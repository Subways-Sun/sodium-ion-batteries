        "title": "Synergy of cations in high entropy oxide lithium ion battery anode",
        "abstract": "Though high entropy oxides have been explored as possible conversion-type negative electrodes for Li-ion batteries, the roles of the different elements remain unclear. Here the authors determine the behavior of each element during electrochemical cycling and connect it to the nanoscale structure. High entropy oxides (HEOs) with chemically disordered multi-cation structure attract intensive interest as negative electrode materials for battery applications. The outstanding electrochemical performance has been attributed to the high-entropy stabilization and the so-called ‘cocktail effect’. However, the configurational entropy of the HEO, which is thermodynamically only metastable at room-temperature, is insufficient to drive the structural reversibility during conversion-type battery reaction, and the ‘cocktail effect’ has not been explained thus far. This work unveils the multi-cations synergy of the HEO Mg_0.2Co_0.2Ni_0.2Cu_0.2Zn_0.2O at atomic and nanoscale during electrochemical reaction and explains the ‘cocktail effect’. The more electronegative elements form an electrochemically inert 3-dimensional metallic nano-network enabling electron transport. The electrochemical inactive cation stabilizes an oxide nanophase, which is semi-coherent with the metallic phase and accommodates Li^+ ions. This self-assembled nanostructure enables stable cycling of micron-sized particles, which bypasses the need for nanoscale pre-modification required for conventional metal oxides in battery applications. This demonstrates elemental diversity is the key for optimizing multi-cation electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "The stacked and brittle 2D layered structure of molybdenum disulphide limits its practical application in lithium ion batteries. Here, authors report a dewetting-induced manufacture strategy to create the interpenetrating network and induce the pseudocapacity to improve the electrochemical performance. Architected materials that actively respond to external stimuli hold tantalizing prospects for applications in energy storage, wearable electronics, and bioengineering. Molybdenum disulfide, an excellent two-dimensional building block, is a promising candidate for lithium-ion battery anode. However, the stacked and brittle two-dimensional layered structure limits its rate capability and electrochemical stability. Here we report the dewetting-induced manufacturing of two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide nanosheets into a three-dimensional foam with a structural hierarchy across seven orders of magnitude. Our molybdenum disulfide foam provides an interpenetrating network for efficient charge transport, rapid ion diffusion, and mechanically resilient and chemically stable support for electrochemical reactions. These features induce a pseudocapacitive energy storage mechanism involving molybdenum redox reactions, confirmed by in-situ X-ray absorption near edge structure. The extraordinary electrochemical performance of molybdenum disulfide foam outperforms most reported molybdenum disulfide-based Lithium-ion battery anodes and state-of-the-art materials. This work opens promising inroads for various applications where special properties arise from hierarchical architecture.",

        "abstract": "Silicon monoxide (SiO) is an attractive anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries for its ultra-high theoretical capacity of 2680 mAh g^−1. The studies to date have been limited to electrodes with a relatively low mass loading (< 3.5 mg cm^−2), which has seriously restricted the areal capacity and its potential in practical devices. Maximizing areal capacity with such high-capacity materials is critical for capitalizing their potential in practical technologies. Herein, we report a monolithic three-dimensional (3D) large-sheet holey graphene framework/SiO (LHGF/SiO) composite for high-mass-loading electrode. By specifically using large-sheet holey graphene building blocks, we construct LHGF with super-elasticity and exceptional mechanical robustness, which is essential for accommodating the large volume change of SiO and ensuring the structure integrity even at ultrahigh mass loading. Additionally, the 3D porous graphene network structure in LHGF ensures excellent electron and ion transport. By systematically tailoring microstructure design, we show the LHGF/SiO anode with a mass loading of 44 mg cm^−2 delivers a high areal capacity of 35.4 mAh cm^−2 at a current of 8.8 mA cm^−2 and retains a capacity of 10.6 mAh cm^−2 at 17.6 mA cm^−2, greatly exceeding those of the state-of-the-art commercial or research devices. Furthermore, we show an LHGF/SiO anode with an ultra-high mass loading of 94 mg cm^−2 delivers an unprecedented areal capacity up to 140.8 mAh cm^−2. The achievement of such high areal capacities marks a critical step toward realizing the full potential of high-capacity alloy-type electrode materials in practical lithium-ion batteries. The large-sheet holey graphene framework/SiO (LHGF/SiO) composite displays notably high recoverable strain, suggesting considerably improved mechanical flexibility and robustness The LHGF/SiO anode with a mass loading of 44 mg cm^−2 delivers a high areal capacity of 35.4 mAh cm^−2 at current density of 8.8 mA cm^−2 and retains a capacity of 10.6 mAh cm^−2 at 17.6 mA cm^−2 The LHGF/SiO anode with an ultra-high mass loading of 94 mg cm^−2 delivers an extraordinary areal capacity up to 140.8 mAh cm^−2, about 1–2 order of magnitude higher than those in typical commercial devices",

        "abstract": "Due to its high specific capacity, silicon anode has gained interest on a global scale as the anode of next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, it is challenging for silicon anodes to replace graphite anodes for widespread use due to the inevitable volume expansion and SEI film development generated by silicon during the lithiation/delithiation process. Among these, the advancement of nanotechnology has sped up the development of silicon anodes. This paper reviews nanotechnology applied in the Si anode to improve the battery performance. The volume expansion of Si is effectively decreased by reducing the volume of the silicon anode in order to increase its specific surface area. Additionally, the smaller negative electrode reduces the distance traveled by lithium ions, greatly increasing the silicon negative electrode's efficiency. At present, the main silicon nano-anode materials include nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets, nanotubes, nanoporous materials and so on. It is hoped that this review will provide a deep prospect introduction to the nano-silicon anode. Pure silicon nanoparticles and silicon nanowires, and new nanomaterials composed of them with graphite, graphene, metals, etc.",

        "title": "Carbon-encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles as a high-rate lithium ion battery anode material.",
        "abstract": "A facile and scalable in situ synthesis strategy is developed to fabricate carbon-encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles homogeneously embedded in two-dimensional (2D) porous graphitic carbon nanosheets (Fe3O4@C@PGC nanosheets) as a durable high-rate lithium ion battery anode material. With assistance of the surface of NaCl particles, 2D Fe@C@PGC nanosheets can be in situ synthesized by using the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and C6H12O6 as the metal and carbon precursor, respectively. After annealing under air, the Fe@C@PGC nanosheets can be converted to Fe3O4@C@PGC nanosheets, in which Fe3O4 nanoparticles (∼18.2 nm) coated with conformal and thin onion-like carbon shells are homogeneously embedded in 2D high-conducting carbon nanosheets with a thickness of less than 30 nm. In the constructed architecture, the thin carbon shells can avoid the direct exposure of encapsulated Fe3O4 to the electrolyte and preserve the structural and interfacial stabilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the flexible and conductive PGC nanosheets can accommodate the mechanical stress induced by the volume change of embedded Fe3O4@C nanoparticles as well as inhibit the aggregation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thus maintain the structural and electrical integrity of the Fe3O4@C@PGC electrode during the lithiation/delithiation processes. As a result, this Fe3O4@C@PGC electrode exhibits superhigh rate capability (858, 587, and 311 mAh/g at 5, 10, and 20 C, respectively, 1 C = 1 A/g) and extremely excellent cycling performance at high rates (only 3.47% capacity loss after 350 cycles at a high rate of 10 C), which is the best one ever reported for an Fe3O4-based electrode including various nanostructured Fe3O4 anode materials, composite electrodes, etc.",

        "abstract": "The lithium storage performance of silicon (Si) can be enhanced by being alloyed with germanium (Ge) because of its good electronic and ionic conductivity. Here, we synthesized a three-dimensional nanoporous (3D-NP) SiGe alloy as a high-performance lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode using a dealloying method with a ternary AlSiGe ribbon serving as the precursor. The morphology and porosity of the as-synthesized SiGe alloy can be controlled effectively by adjusting the sacrificial Al content of the precursor. With an Al content of 80%, the 3D-NP SiGe presents uniformly coral-like structure with continuous ligaments and hierarchical micropores and mesopores, which leads to a high reversible capacity of 1158 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g-1 with excellent rate capacity. The strategy might provide guidelines for nanostructure optimization and mass production of energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Constructing unique mesoporous 2D Si nanostructures to shorten the lithium-ion diffusion pathway, facilitate interfacial charge transfer, and enlarge the electrode-electrolyte interface offers exciting opportunities in future high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, simultaneous realization of 2D and mesoporous structures for Si material is quite difficult due to its non-van der Waals structure. Here, the coexistence of both mesoporous and 2D ultrathin nanosheets in the Si anodes and considerably high surface area (381.6 m2 g-1 ) are successfully achieved by a scalable and cost-efficient method. After being encapsulated with the homogeneous carbon layer, the Si/C nanocomposite anodes achieve outstanding reversible capacity, high cycle stability, and excellent rate capability. In particular, the reversible capacity reaches 1072.2 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 even after 500 cycles. The obvious enhancements can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the unique 2D mesoporous nanostructure and carbon capsulation. Furthermore, full-cell evaluations indicate that the unique Si/C nanostructures have a great potential in the next-generation lithium-ion battery. These findings not only greatly improve the electrochemical performances of Si anode, but also shine some light on designing the unique nanomaterials for various energy devices.",

        "abstract": "The high theoretical capacity of red phosphorus (RP) makes it a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries. However, the large volume change of RP during charging/discharging imposes an adverse effect on the cyclability and the rate performance suffers from its low conductivity. Herein, a facile solution-based strategy is exploited to incorporate phosphorus into the pores of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) derived carbon hosts under a mild temperature. With this method, the blocky RP is etched into the form of polyphosphides anions (PP, mainly P5 - ) so that it can easily diffuse into the pores of porous carbon hosts. Especially, the indelible crystalline surface phosphorus can be effectively avoided, which usually generates in the conventional vapor-condensation encapsulation method. Moreover, highly-conductive ZIF-8 derived carbon hosts with any pore smaller than 3 nm are efficient for loading PP and these pores can alleviate the volume change well. Finally, the composite of phosphorus encapsulated into ZIF-8 derived porous carbon exhibits a significantly improved electrochemical performance as lithium-ion battery anode with a high capacity of 786 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 , a good stability within 700 cycles at 1 A g-1 , and an excellent rate performance.",

During the synthesis, 3D self-assembly of cubic NaCl particles is adopted to not only serve as a template to direct the growth of 3D porous carbon nanosheet networks, but also create a 2D-confined space to achieve the construction of few-layer MoS2 nanosheets robustly lain on the surface of carbon nanosheet walls. In the resulting 3D architecture, the intimate contact between the surfaces of MoS2 and carbon nanosheets can effectively avoid the aggregation and restacking of MoS2 as well as remarkably enhance the structural integrity of the electrode, while the conductive matrix of 3D porous carbon nanosheet networks can ensure fast transport of both electrons and ions in the whole electrode. As a result, this unique 3D architecture manifests an outstanding long-life cycling capability at high rates, namely, a specific capacity as large as 709 mAh g(-1) is delivered at 2 A g(-1) and maintains ∼95.2% even after 520 deep charge/discharge cycles.

In the constructed architecture, the CVD-synthesized graphene shells with excellent elasticity can effectively not only avoid the direct exposure of encapsulated Sn to the electrolyte and preserve the structural and interfacial stabilization of Sn nanoparticles but also suppress the aggregation of Sn nanoparticles and buffer the volume expansion, while the interconnected 3D porous graphene networks with high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and high mechanical flexibility tightly pin the core-shell structure of Sn@G and thus lead to remarkably enhanced electrical conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode. As a consequence, this 3D hybrid anode exhibits very high rate performance (1022 mAh/g at 0.2 C, 865 mAh/g at 0.5 C, 780 mAh/g at 1 C, 652 mAh/g at 2 C, 459 mAh/g at 5 C, and 270 mAh/g at 10 C, 1 C = 1 A/g) and extremely long cycling stability even at high rates (a high capacity of 682 mAh/g is achieved at 2 A/g and is maintained approximately 96.3% after 1000 cycles).

        "abstract": "Controlling the morphology of nanostructured silicon is critical to improving the structural stability and electrochemical performance in lithium-ion batteries. The use of removable or sacrificial templates is an effective and easy route to synthesize hollow materials. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of mesoporous silicon hollow nanocubes (m-Si HCs) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOF) as an anode material with outstanding electrochemical properties. The m-Si HC architecture with the mesoporous external shell (∼15 nm) and internal void (∼60 nm) can effectively accommodate volume variations and relieve diffusion-induced stress/strain during repeated cycling. In addition, this cube architecture provides a high electrolyte contact area because of the exposed active site, which can promote the transportation of Li ions. The well-designed m-Si HC with carbon coating delivers a high reversible capacity of 1728 mAhg-1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 80.1% after the first cycle and an excellent rate capability of >1050 mAhg-1 even at a 15 C-rate. In particular, the m-Si HC anode effectively suppresses electrode swelling to ∼47% after 100 cycles and exhibits outstanding cycle stability of 850 mAhg-1 after 800 cycles at a 1 C-rate. Moreover, a full cell (2.9 mAhcm-2) comprising a m-Si HC-graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode exhibits remarkable cycle retention of 72% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C-rate.",

        "abstract": "Volume expansion is a major challenge associated with tin oxide (SnO x), which causes poor cyclability in lithium-ion battery anode. Bare tin dioxide (SnO2), tin dioxide with graphene sheets (SnO2@GS), and bouquet-like nanocomposite structure (Mn2SnO4@GS) are prepared via hydrothermal method followed by annealing. The obtained composite material presents a bouquet structure containing manganese and tin oxide nanoparticle network with graphene sheets. Benefiting from this porous nanostructure, in which graphene sheets provide high electronic pathways to enhance the electronic conductivity, uniformly distributed particles offer accelerated kinetic reaction with lithium ion and reduced volume deviation in the tin dioxide (SnO2) particle during charge-discharge testing. As a consequence, ternary composite Mn2SnO4@GS showed a high rate performance and outstanding cyclability of anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The electrode achieved a specific capacity of about 1070 mA h g-1 at a current density of 400 mA g-1 after 200 cycles; meanwhile, the electrode still delivered a specific capacity of about 455 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 2500 mA g-1.

In the case of BP we also investigated the possible volume expansion on Li insertion. We find a 11% expansion, which is very similar to the one found in graphite. Our findings show that both membranes are suitable materials for lithium ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "Metal vanadates suffer from fast capacity fading in lithium-ion batteries especially at a high rate. Pseudocapacitance, which is associated with surface or near-surface redox reactions, can provide fast charge/discharge capacity free from diffusion-controlled intercalation processes and is able to address the above issue. In this work, we report the synthesis of macroporous CoV2O6 nanosheets through a facile one-pot method via acetylene black induced heterogeneous growth. When applied as lithium-ion battery anode, the macroporous CoV2O6 nanosheets show typical features of pseudocapacitive behavior: (1) currents that are mostly linearly dependent on sweep rate and (2) redox peaks whose potentials do not shift significantly with sweep rate. The macroporous CoV2O6 nanosheets display a high reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of 89% (against the second cycle) after 500 cycles at 500 mA g(-1), and high rate capability of 453 mAh g(-1) at 5000 mA g(-1). We believe that the introduction of pseudocapacitive properties in lithium battery is a promising direction for developing electrode materials with high-rate capability.",

When using alginate as a binder, porous silicon nanowires exhibited superior electrochemical performance and long cycle life as anode material in a lithium ion battery. Even after 250 cycles, the capacity remains stable above 2000, 1600, and 1100 mAh/g at current rates of 2, 4, and 18 A/g, respectively, demonstrating high structure stability due to the high porosity and electron conductivity of the porous silicon nanowires. A mathematic model coupling the lithium ion diffusion and the strain induced by lithium intercalation was employed to study the effect of porosity and pore size on the structure stability. Simulation shows silicon with high porosity and large pore size help to stabilize the structure during charge/discharge cycles.",

        "abstract": "The combination of high-capacity and long-term cyclability has always been regarded as the first priority for next generation anode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To meet these requirements, the Ag nanoparticle decorated mesoporous SnO2/NiO nanotube (m-SNT) anodes were synthesized via an electrospinning process, followed by fast ramping rate calcination and subsequent chemical reduction in this work. The one-dimensional porous hollow structure effectively alleviates a large volume expansion during cycling as well as provides a short lithium-ion duffusion length. Furthermore, metallic nickel (Ni) nanoparticles converted from the NiO nanograins during the lithiation process reversibly decompose Li2O during delithiation process, which significantly improves the reversible capacity of the m-SNT anodes. In addition, Ag nanoparticles uniformly decorated on the m-SNT via a simple chemical reduction process significantly improve rate capability and also contribute to long-term cyclability. The m-SNT@Ag anodes exhibited excellent cycling stability without obvious capacity fading after 500 cycles with a high capacity of 826 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. Furthermore, even at a very high current density of 5000 mA g-1, the charge-specific capacity remained as high as 721 mAh g-1, corresponding to 60% of its initial capacity at a current density of 100 mA g-1.",

        "title": "Scalable Production of Si Nanoparticles Directly from Low Grade Sources for Lithium-Ion Battery Anode.",
        "abstract": "Silicon, one of the most promising candidates as lithium-ion battery anode, has attracted much attention due to its high theoretical capacity, abundant existence, and mature infrastructure. Recently, Si nanostructures-based lithium-ion battery anode, with sophisticated structure designs and process development, has made significant progress. However, low cost and scalable processes to produce these Si nanostructures remained as a challenge, which limits the widespread applications. Herein, we demonstrate that Si nanoparticles with controlled size can be massively produced directly from low grade Si sources through a scalable high energy mechanical milling process. In addition, we systematically studied Si nanoparticles produced from two major low grade Si sources, metallurgical silicon (∼99 wt % Si, $1/kg) and ferrosilicon (∼83 wt % Si, $0.6/kg). It is found that nanoparticles produced from ferrosilicon sources contain FeSi2, which can serve as a buffer layer to alleviate the mechanical fractures of volume expansion, whereas nanoparticles from metallurgical Si sources have higher capacity and better kinetic properties because of higher purity and better electronic transport properties. Ferrosilicon nanoparticles and metallurgical Si nanoparticles demonstrate over 100 stable deep cycling after carbon coating with the reversible capacities of 1360 mAh g(-1) and 1205 mAh g(-1), respectively. Therefore, our approach provides a new strategy for cost-effective, energy-efficient, large scale synthesis of functional Si electrode materials.",

The electrochemical performance of the composite as lithium-ion battery anode was studied for the first time. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the hierarchical hollow structure and conductive RGO matrix, the composite exhibits excellent long-life performance and rate capability. A capacity of 890 mAh/g is achieved after 200 cycles at 200 mA/g and a capacity of 429 mAh/g is retained after 800 cycles at 1000 mA/g.

As the anode of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), porous NiMn2O4/C nanostructures exhibit a superior specific capacity and an excellent long-term cycling performance even at a high current density. The discharge capacity can stabilize at 2130 mA h g(-1) within 350 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1). After a long-term cycling of 1500 cycles, the capacity is still as high as 1773 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 4000 mA g(-1), which is almost five times higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. The porous NiMn2O4/C hierarchical nanostructure provides sufficient contact with the electrolyte and fast three-dimensional Li(+) diffusion channels, and dramatically improves the capacity of NiMn2O4/C via interfacial storage.",

        "title": "Atomic layer deposited tungsten nitride thin films as a new lithium-ion battery anode.",
        "abstract": "This article demonstrates the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of tungsten nitride using tungsten hexacarbonyl [W(CO)6] and ammonia [NH3] and its use as a lithium-ion battery anode. In situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), ellipsometry and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements are carried out to confirm the self-limiting behaviour of the deposition. A saturated growth rate of ca. 0.35 Å per ALD cycle is found within a narrow temperature window of 180-195 °C. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) vibrational spectroscopy is used to determine the reaction pathways of the surface bound species after each ALD half cycle. The elemental presence and chemical composition is determined by XPS. The as-deposited material is found to be amorphous and crystallized to h-W2N upon annealing at an elevated temperature under an ammonia atmosphere. The as-deposited materials are found to be n-type, conducting with an average carrier concentration of ca. 10(20) at room temperature. Electrochemical studies of the as-deposited films open up the possibility of this material to be used as an anode material in Li-ion batteries. The incorporation of MWCNTs as a scaffold layer further enhances the electrochemical storage capacity of the ALD grown tungsten nitride (WNx). Ex situ XRD analysis confirms the conversion based reaction mechanism of the as-grown material with Li under operation.",

The core-shell composite exhibits high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and improved cycle performance as an anode material for Li-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "As an anode for lithium-ion batteries, metallic bismuth (Bi) can provide a superb volumetric capacity of 3800 mA h cm-3, showing perspective value for application. It is a pity that the severe volume swelling during the lithiation process leads to the dramatic deterioration of the cycling performances. To overcome this issue, Bi nanorods encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (yolk-shell Bi@C-N) are elaborately designed through in situ thermal reduction of Bi2S3@polypyrrole nanorods. In comparison with the commercial Bi, the lithium storage capacities of Bi@C-N are significantly enhanced, and it presents a stable volumetric capacity of 1700 mA h cm-3 over 500 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A g-1, nearly 2.2 times that of graphite. The N-doped carbon nanotube and the cavity between the carbon wall and Bi jointly contribute to this superior performance. Especially, the failure mechanism of Bi nanorods and the protective effect of the carbon shell are revealed by ex situ TEM, which illuminates the decreasing tendency in the initial 10-20 cycles and the subsequent stable trend of cyclic performance.",

        "title": "\"Fast-Charging\" Anode Materials for Lithium-Ion Batteries from Perspective of Ion Diffusion in Crystal Structure.",
        "abstract": "\"Fast-charging\" lithium-ion batteries have gained a multitude of attention in recent years since they could be applied to energy storage areas like electric vehicles, grids, and subsea operations. Unfortunately, the excellent energy density could fail to sustain optimally while lithium-ion batteries are exposed to fast-charging conditions. In actuality, the crystal structure of electrode materials represents the critical factor for influencing the electrode performance. Accordingly, employing anode materials with low diffusion barrier could improve the \"fast-charging\" performance of the lithium-ion battery. In this Review, first, the \"fast-charging\" principle of lithium-ion battery and ion diffusion path in the crystal are briefly outlined. Next, the application prospects of \"fast-charging\" anode materials with various crystal structures are evaluated to search \"fast-charging\" anode materials with stable, safe, and long lifespan, solving the remaining challenges associated with high power and high safety. Finally, summarizing recent research advances for typical \"fast-charging\" anode materials, including preparation methods for advanced morphologies and the latest techniques for ameliorating performance. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the ongoing breakthroughs for \"fast-charging\" anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Intercalated materials (niobium-based, carbon-based, titanium-based, vanadium-based) with favorable cycling stability are predominantly limited by undesired electronic conductivity and theoretical specific capacity. Accordingly, addressing the electrical conductivity of these materials constitutes an effective trend for realizing fast-charging. The conversion-type transition metal oxide and phosphorus-based materials with high theoretical specific capacity typically undergoes significant volume variation during charging and discharging. Consequently, alleviating the volume expansion could significantly fulfill the application of these materials in fast-charging batteries.",

        "abstract": "Integrating nanoscale porous metal oxides into three-dimensional graphene (3DG) with encapsulated structure is a promising route but remains challenging to develop high-performance electrodes for lithium-ion battery. Herein, we design 3DG/metal organic framework composite by an excessive metal-ion-induced combination and spatially confined Ostwald ripening strategy, which can be transformed into 3DG/Fe2O3 aerogel with porous Fe2O3 nanoframeworks well encapsulated within graphene. The hierarchical structure offers highly interpenetrated porous conductive network and intimate contact between graphene and porous Fe2O3 as well as abundant stress buffer nanospace for effective charge transport and robust structural stability during electrochemical processes. The obtained free-standing 3DG/Fe2O3 aerogel was directly used as highly flexible anode upon mechanical pressing for lithium-ion battery and showed an ultrahigh capacity of 1129 mAh/g at 0.2 A/g after 130 cycles and outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 98% after 1200 cycles at 5 A/g, which is the best results that have been reported so far. This study offers a promising route to greatly enhance the electrochemical properties of metal oxides and provides suggestive insights for developing high-performance electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Performance of lithium-ion batteries at sub-ambient temperatures are extremely restricted by the resistive interphases originated from electrolyte decomposition, especially on the anode surface. This work reports a novel strategy that anode interphase of low impedance is constructed by applying an electrolyte additive dimethyl sulfite (DMS). Electrochemical measurements indicate that the as-constructed interphase provides graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cells with excellent lower temperature performance, outperforming the interphase constructed by 1,3,2-Dioxathiolane 2,2-dioxide (DTD), a common commercially used electrolyte additive. Spectral characterizations in combination with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the improved performance is attributed to the unique molecular structure of DMS, which presents appropriate reduction activity and constructs the more stable and ionically conductive anode interphase, due to the weaker combination of its reduction product with lithium ions than DTD. This rational design of interphases via additive structure has been proven to be a low cost but rather effective approach to tailor the performances of lithium-ion batteries.",

Here, Professor Arumugam Manthiram looks back at the evolution of cathode chemistry, discussing the three major categories of oxide cathode materials with an emphasis on the fundamental solid-state chemistry that has enabled these advances. Lithium-ion batteries have aided the portable electronics revolution for nearly three decades. They are now enabling vehicle electrification and beginning to enter the utility industry. The emergence and dominance of lithium-ion batteries are due to their higher energy density compared to other rechargeable battery systems, enabled by the design and development of high-energy density electrode materials. Basic science research, involving solid-state chemistry and physics, has been at the center of this endeavor, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. With the award of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to the development of lithium-ion batteries, it is enlightening to look back at the evolution of the cathode chemistry that made the modern lithium-ion technology feasible. This review article provides a reflection on how fundamental studies have facilitated the discovery, optimization, and rational design of three major categories of oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries, and a personal perspective on the future of this important area.",

        "abstract": "The global energy crisis, consumption of fossil fuels, and the associated environmental issues have stimulated extensive interest in searching for sustainable energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in mobile devices, hybrid, and electric vehicles. Electrode-electrolyte interface has a strong impact on battery capacity decrease and long-term cycling stability. In order to improve fundamental understanding of the involved phenomena to accelerate the rational design of cathode materials and stable interface, Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O2 (NCM) is a cathode material for rechargeable LIB and also a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Their battery performance and catalytic activity are highly correlated to their structures. Multiple processes occurring at the cathode/electrolyte interface led to overall performance degradation. One failure mechanism is the dissolution of transition metals from the cathode. Our efforts employ thin film as a model cathode to monitor the Mn dissolution. Using LiMn2O4 and NCM as cathode materials, we will focus on electrochemical characterization, cation mixing, oxygen evolution, and thin film deposition with controlled crystal structures and composition. We will further introduce our work employing the scanning electrochemical microscope to study LIBs degradation and cathode-electrolyte interface in situ and in real-time.",

        "abstract": "During solid‐state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid‐state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state‐of‐the‐art Ni‐rich layered oxides (LiNi1‐x‐yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium‐ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron‐based X‐ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature‐dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid‐state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high‐energy/power density lithium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Modern studies of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathode materials employ a large range of experimental and theoretical techniques to understand the changes in bulk and local chemical and electronic structures during electrochemical cycling (charge and discharge). Despite its being rich in useful chemical information, few studies to date have used 17O NMR spectroscopy. Many LIB cathode materials contain paramagnetic ions, and their NMR spectra are dominated by hyperfine and quadrupolar interactions, giving rise to broad resonances with extensive spinning sideband manifolds. In principle, careful analysis of these spectra can reveal information about local structural distortions, magnetic exchange interactions, structural inhomogeneities (Li+ concentration gradients), and even the presence of redox-active O anions. In this Perspective, we examine the primary interactions governing 17O NMR spectroscopy of LIB cathodes and outline how 17O NMR may be used to elucidate the structure of pristine cathodes and their structural evolution on cycling, providing insight into the challenges in obtaining and interpreting the spectra. We also discuss the use of 17O NMR in the context of anionic redox and the role this technique may play in understanding the charge compensation mechanisms in high-capacity cathodes, and we provide suggestions for employing 17O NMR in future avenues of research.",

        "abstract": "Conventional nickel‐rich cathode materials suffer from reaction heterogeneity during electrochemical cycling particularly at high temperature, because of their polycrystalline properties and secondary particle morphology. Despite intensive research on the morphological evolution of polycrystalline nickel‐rich materials, its practical investigation at the electrode and cell levels is still rarely discussed. Herein, an intrinsic limitation of polycrystalline nickel‐rich cathode materials in high‐energy full‐cells is discovered under industrial electrode‐fabrication conditions. Owing to their highly unstable chemo‐mechanical properties, even after the first cycle, nickel‐rich materials are degraded in the longitudinal direction of the high‐energy electrode. This inhomogeneous degradation behavior of nickel‐rich materials at the electrode level originates from the overutilization of active materials on the surface side, causing a severe non‐uniform potential distribution during long‐term cycling. In addition, this phenomenon continuously lowers the reversibility of lithium ions. Consequently, considering the degradation of polycrystalline nickel‐rich materials, this study suggests the adoption of a robust single‐crystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a feasible alternative, to effectively suppress the localized overutilization of active materials. Such an adoption can stabilize the electrochemical performance of high‐energy lithium‐ion cells, in which superior capacity retention above ≈80% after 1000 cycles at 45 °C is demonstrated.",

Metal oxides are commonly used in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathodes and there is still a lack of understanding of the role of OVs in LIB research field. Here, we report on the behavior of OVs in a single-crystal LIB cathode during the non-equilibrium states of charge and discharge. We found that microcrack evolution in a single crystal occurs due to OV condensation in specific crystallographic orientations generated by the continuous migration of OVs and TM ions. Moreover, understanding the effects of the presence and diffusion of OVs in metal oxides enables the elucidation of most of the conventional mechanisms of capacity fading in LIBs and provides new insights for new electrochemical applications.",

        "abstract": "Lithium transition-metal oxides (LiMn2O4 and LiMO2 where M = Ni, Mn, Co, etc.) are widely applied as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries due to their considerable capacity and energy density. However, multiple processes occurring at the cathode/electrolyte interface lead to overall performance degradation. One key failure mechanism is the dissolution of transition metals from the cathode. This work presents results combining scanning electrochemical microscopy with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to examine cathode degradation products. Our effort employs a LiMn2O4 (LMO) thin film as a model cathode to monitor the Mn dissolution process without the potential complications of conductive additive and polymer binders. We characterize the electrochemical behavior of LMO degradation products in various electrolytes, paired with ICP and EPR, to better understand the properties of Mn complexes formed following metal dissolution. We find that the identity of the lithium salt anions in our electrolyte systems [ClO4–, PF6–, and (CF3SO2)2N–] appears to affect the Mn dissolution process significantly as well as the electrochemical behavior of the generated Mn complexes. This implies that the mechanism for Mn dissolution is at least partially dependent on the lithium salt anion.",

        "abstract": "As the production and consumption of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) increase, the recycling of spent LIBs appears inevitable from an environmental, economic and health viewpoint. The leaching behavior of Ni, Mn, Co, Al and Cu from treated cathode active materials, which are separated from a commercial LIB pack in hybrid electric vehicles, is investigated with ammoniacal leaching agents based on ammonia, ammonium carbonate and ammonium sulfite. Ammonium sulfite as a reductant is necessary to enhance leaching kinetics particularly in the ammoniacal leaching of Ni and Co. Ammonium carbonate can act as a pH buffer so that the pH of leaching solution changes little during leaching. Co and Cu can be fully leached out whereas Mn and Al are hardly leached and Ni shows a moderate leaching efficiency. It is confirmed that the cathode active materials are a composite of LiMn2O4, LiCoxMnyNizO2, Al2O3 and C while the leach residue is composed of LiNixMnyCozO2, LiMn2O4, Al2O3, MnCO3 and Mn oxides. Co recovery via the ammoniacal leaching is believed to gain a competitive edge on convenitonal acid leaching both by reducing the sodium hydroxide expense for increasing the pH of leaching solution and by removing the separation steps of Mn and Al.",

        "abstract": "Although lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have 5-10 times higher theoretical capacity (1675 mAh g-1) than present commercial lithium-ion batteries, Li-S batteries show a rapid and continuous capacity fading due to the polysulfide dissolution in common electrolytes. Here, we propose the use of a sulfur-based cathode material, amorphous MoS3 and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) composite, which can be substituted for the pure sulfur-based cathodes. In order to enhance kinetics and stability of the electrodes, we intentionally pulverize the microsized MoS3 sheet into nanosheets and form an ultrathin nano-SEI on the surface using in situ electrochemical methods. Then, the pulverized nanosheets are securely anchored by the oxygen functional group of r-GO. As a result, the electrochemically treated MoS3/r-GO electrode shows superior performance that surpasses pure sulfur-based electrodes; it exhibits a capacity of about 900 mAh g-1 at a rate of 5C for 2500 cycles without capacity fading. Moreover, a full-cell battery employing the MoS3/r-GO cathode with a silicon-carbon composite anode displays a 3-5 times higher energy density (1725 Wh kg-1/7100 Wh L-1) than present LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layered lithium-rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interests owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320 - 350 mA h g -1 ). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, it is expected to revive the development of layered lithium-rich cathode materials to resolve our increasing dependence on high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we reviewed recent research progresses and in-depth understandings of structure characterizations and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium-rich manganese-based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarized the proposed reaction mechanisms on both the cationic redox reaction of transition-metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discussed opportunities and challenges facing the future development of LLRM cathode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Comprehensive Enhancement of Nanostructured Lithium-Ion Battery Cathode Materials via Conformal Graphene Dispersion.",
        "abstract": "Efficient energy storage systems based on lithium-ion batteries represent a critical technology across many sectors including consumer electronics, electrified transportation, and a smart grid accommodating intermittent renewable energy sources. Nanostructured electrode materials present compelling opportunities for high-performance lithium-ion batteries, but inherent problems related to the high surface area to volume ratios at the nanometer-scale have impeded their adoption for commercial applications. Here, we demonstrate a materials and processing platform that realizes high-performance nanostructured lithium manganese oxide (nano-LMO) spinel cathodes with conformal graphene coatings as a conductive additive. The resulting nanostructured composite cathodes concurrently resolve multiple problems that have plagued nanoparticle-based lithium-ion battery electrodes including low packing density, high additive content, and poor cycling stability. Moreover, this strategy enhances the intrinsic advantages of nano-LMO, resulting in extraordinary rate capability and low temperature performance. With 75% capacity retention at a 20C cycling rate at room temperature and nearly full capacity retention at -20 °C, this work advances lithium-ion battery technology into unprecedented regimes of operation.",

The reversible specific areal capacity of the V2O5/rGO composite paper electrode is 885 μAh/cm2 at 0.09 mA/cm2, much higher than that of the pure V2O5 nanowire paper electrode (570 μAh/cm2). It also shows excellent cycling performance at high rates with 30.9% loss of its initial capacities after 1000 cycles at a current rate of 0.9 mA/cm2. The excellent performance was attributed to the improved electronic conductivity and Li+ ion transport from the rGO addition.",

Though much attention has been paid to this issue, the behavior of Mn dissolution has not been clearly revealed. In this work, by using a refined in-situ UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) technique, we monitored the concentration changes of dissolved Mn ions in liquid electrolyte from LMO at different state of charge (SOC), confirming the maximum dissolution concentration and rate at 4.3 V charged state and Mn2+ as the main specie in the electrolyte. Through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we revealed that Mn dissolution process is highly related to surface structure evolution, solvent decomposition and lithium salt. These results will contribute to understanding TM dissolution mechanisms in working conditions as well as the design of stable cathode.",

        "abstract": "A binder plays a critical role in dispersion of coating liquids and the quality of coating. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is widely used as a binder in cathode slurries; however, its role as a binder is still under debate. In this paper, we study the role of PVDF on the rheology of cathode battery slurries consisting of Li(Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3)O2 (NCM), carbon black (CB) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Rheology and microstructure of cathode slurries are systemically investigated with three model suspensions: CB/PVDF/NMP, NCM/PVDF/NMP and NCM/CB/PVDF/NMP. To highlight the role of PVDF in cathode slurries, we prepare the same model suspensions by replacing PVDF with PVP, and we compare the role of PVDF to PVP in the suspension rheology. We find that PVDF adsorbs neither onto NCM nor CB surface, which can be attributed to its poor affinity to NCM and CB. Rheological measurements suggest that PVDF mainly increases matrix viscosity in the suspension without affecting the microstructure formed by CB and NCM particles. In contrast to PVDF, PVP stabilizes the structure of CB and NCM in the model suspensions, as it is adsorbed on the CB surface. This study will provide a useful insight to fundamentally understand the rheology of cathode slurries.",

        "abstract": "Mg-doped Li[Li0.2-2xMgxCo0.13Ni0.13Mn0.54]O2 is synthesized by introducing Mg ions into the transition-metal (TM) layer of this layered compound for substituting Li ions through a simple polymer-pyrolysis method. The structural and morphological characterization reveals that the doped Mg ions are uniformly distributed in the bulk lattice, showing an insignificant impact on the layered structure. Electrochemical experiments reveal that, at a Mg doping of 4%, the Li[Li0.16Mg0.04Co0.13Ni0.13Mn0.54]O2 electrode can deliver a larger initial reversible capacity of 272 mAh g(-1), an improved rate capability with 114 mAh g(-1) at 8 C, and an excellent cycling stability with 93.3% capacity retention after 300 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances of the Mg-doped material are possibly due to the enhancement of the structural stability by substitution of Li by Mg in the TM layer, which effectively suppresses the cation mixing arrangement, leading to the alleviation of the phase change during lithium-ion insertion and extraction.",

        "abstract": "All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential for providing high power and energy densities with enhanced battery safety. While new solid electrolytes (SEs) have been developed with high enough ionic conductivities, SSBs with long operational life are still rarely reported. Therefore, on the way to high-performance and long-life ASSBs, a better understanding of the complex degradation mechanisms, occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces is pivotal. While the lithium metal/solid electrolyte interface is receiving considerable attention due to the quest for high energy density, the interface between the active material and solid electrolyte particles within the composite cathode is arguably the most difficult to solve and study. In this work, multiple characterization methods are combined to better understand the processes that occur at the LiCoO2 cathode and the Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte interface. Indium and Li4Ti5O12 are used as anode materials to avoid the instability problems associated with Li-metal anodes. Capacity fading and increased impedances are observed during long-term cycling. Postmortem analysis with scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that electrochemically driven mechanical failure and degradation at the cathode/solid electrolyte interface contribute to the increase in internal resistance and the resulting capacity fading. These results suggest that the development of electrochemically more stable SEs and the engineering of cathode/SE interfaces are crucial for achieving reliable SSB performance.",

        "abstract": "A closed-loop process to recover lithium carbonate from cathode scrap of lithium-ion battery (LIB) is developed. Lithium could be selectively leached into solution using formic acid while aluminum remained as the metallic form, and most of the other metals from the cathode scrap could be precipitated out. This phenomenon clearly demonstrates that formic acid can be used for lithium recovery from cathode scrap, as both leaching and separation reagent. By investigating the effects of different parameters including temperature, formic acid concentration, H2O2 amount, and solid to liquid ratio, the leaching rate of Li can reach 99.93% with minor Al loss into the solution. Subsequently, the leaching kinetics was evaluated and the controlling step as well as the apparent activation energy could be determined. After further separation of the remaining Ni, Co, and Mn from the leachate, Li2CO3 with the purity of 99.90% could be obtained. The final solution after lithium carbonate extraction can be further processed for sodium formate preparation, and Ni, Co, and Mn precipitates are ready for precursor preparation for cathode materials. As a result, the global recovery rates of Al, Li, Ni, Co, and Mn in this process were found to be 95.46%, 98.22%, 99.96%, 99.96%, and 99.95% respectively, achieving effective resources recycling from cathode scrap of spent LIB.",

        "abstract": "Iron pyrite (FeS2) is a promising lithium ion battery cathode material because of its low cost and ultra-high energy density (1671 Wh kg-1). However, its reaction mechanisms are still controversial. In this work, we find that different from the conventional beliefs that a formation of an intermediate phase Li2FeS2 and then Fe/Li2S composites at the initial discharge, it undergoes a one-step reaction (FeS2 → Fe + Li2S) or a two-step reaction (FeS2 → FeS + Li2S→ Fe + Li2S), which depends on current rate and temperature. In the charge process, it undergoes a two-step reaction: a phase transition Fe + Li2S → FeS at about 1.74 V; a generation of elemental sulfur (Li2S → S, 2.30 V). FeS is a mackinawite phase which is formed on the interface of Li2S via a hetero-epitaxial growth. In the subsequent cycles, it is a combination reaction behavior of FeS and S. The reaction mechanism suggests that FeS2 suffers from the challenges of conversion reaction materials both FeS and S, such as big volume change, voltage hysteresis, and polysulfide dissolution. These findings would help understand the intrinsic capacity fading of FeS2 and provide guidelines to improve its electrochemical performances.",

The movement of lithium ions into and out of electrodes is central to the operation of lithium-ion batteries. Although this process has been extensively studied at the device level, it remains insufficiently characterized at the nanoscale level of grain clusters, single grains and defects. Here, we probe the spatial variation of lithium-ion diffusion times in the battery-cathode material LiCoO_2 at a resolution of ∼100 nm by using an atomic force microscope to both redistribute lithium ions and measure the resulting cathode deformation. The relationship between diffusion and single grains and grain boundaries is observed, revealing that the diffusion coefficient increases for certain grain orientations and single-grain boundaries. This knowledge provides feedback to improve understanding of the nanoscale mechanisms underpinning lithium-ion battery operation.",

        "title": "Anomalous metal segregation in lithium-rich material provides design rules for stable cathode in lithium-ion battery",
        "abstract": "The authors show that after cycling the model cathode material Li_2Ru_0.5Mn_0.5O_3 undergoes ruthenium segregation and even exsolution at the reconstructed oxide surface, which triggers a progressive degradation process. The insights enable new dimensions in choosing dopants for stabilized cathode surface. Despite the importance of studying the instability of delithiated cathode materials, it remains difficult to underpin the degradation mechanism of lithium-rich cathode materials due to the complication of combined chemical and structural evolutions. Herein, we use state-of-the-art electron microscopy tools, in conjunction with synchrotron X-ray techniques and first-principle calculations to study a 4 d -element-containing compound, Li_2Ru_0.5Mn_0.5O_3. We find surprisingly, after cycling, ruthenium segregates out as metallic nanoclusters on the reconstructed surface. Our calculations show that the unexpected ruthenium metal segregation is due to its thermodynamic insolubility in the oxygen deprived surface. This insolubility can disrupt the reconstructed surface, which explains the formation of a porous structure in this material. This work reveals the importance of studying the thermodynamic stability of the reconstructed film on the cathode materials and offers a theoretical guidance for choosing manganese substituting elements in lithium-rich as well as stoichiometric layer-layer compounds for stabilizing the cathode surface.",

In this study, a hydrometallurgical route for the recovery of lithium fluoride was proposed. Lithium and cobalt could be first selectively leached into solution using formic acid and hydrogen peroxide. By investigating the effects of leaching temperature, time, stoichiometric ratio, H2O2 concentration and solid-to-liquid ratio, the leaching efficiency of Li and Co could reach 99.90% and 99.96%, respectively. Meanwhile, the evaluation of leaching kinetics and calculation of apparent activation energies revealed that the leaching process fitted chemical control satisfactorily. After further fractional precipitation, a high purity of 99.0% lithium fluoride could be finally obtained, thus achieving the effective recovery of spent material from the lithium-ion battery.",

Oxygen vacancies (OVs) can promote Li-ion diffusion, reduce the charge transfer resistance, and improve the capacity and rate performance of LiBs. However, OVs can also lead to accelerated degradation of the cathode material structure, and from there, of the battery performance. Understanding the role of OVs for the performance of layered lithium transition metal oxides holds great promise and potential for the development of next generation cathode materials. This review summarises some of the most recent and exciting progress made on the understanding and control of OVs in cathode materials for Li-ion battery, focusing primarily on Li-rich layered oxides. Recent successes and residual unsolved challenges are presented and discussed to stimulate further interest and research in harnessing OVs towards next generation oxide-based cathode materials.",

        "title": "Spent lithium-ion battery recycling - Reductive ammonia leaching of metals from cathode scrap by sodium sulphite.",
        "abstract": "Recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries has attracted wide attention because of their high content of valuable and hazardous metals. One of the difficulties for effective metal recovery is the separation of different metals from the solution after leaching. In this research, a full hydrometallurgical process is developed to selectively recover valuable metals (Ni, Co and Li) from cathode scrap of spent lithium ion batteries. By introducing ammonia-ammonium sulphate as the leaching solution and sodium sulphite as the reductant, the total selectivity of Ni, Co and Li in the first-step leaching solution is more than 98.6% while it for Mn is only 1.36%. In detail understanding of the selective leaching process is carried out by investigating the effects of parameters such as leaching reagent composition, leaching time (0–480min), agitation speed (200–700rpm), pulp density (10–50g/L) and temperature (323–353K). It was found that Mn is primarily reduced from Mn4+ into Mn2+ into the solution as \n                        \n                           Mn\n                           \n                              \n                                 (\n                                 \n                                    \n                                       NH\n                                    \n                                    \n                                       3\n                                    \n                                 \n                                 )\n                              \n                              \n                                 x\n                              \n                              \n                                 2\n                                 +\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                      while it subsequently precipitates out into the residue in the form of (NH4)2Mn(SO3)2·H2O. Ni, Co and Li are leached and remain in the solution either as metallic ion or amine complexes. The optimised leaching conditions can be further obtained and the leaching kinetics is found to be chemical reaction control under current leaching conditions. As a result, this research is potentially beneficial for further optimisation of the spent lithium ion battery recycling process after incorporating with metal extraction from the leaching solution.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable recycle of spent Li ion batteries is an effective strategy to alleviate environmental concerns and support resource conservation. Here, authors report the direct regeneration of LiFePO_4 cathode using multifunctional organic lithium salts, leading to high environmental and economic benefits. The recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries is an effective approach to alleviating environmental concerns and promoting resource conservation. LiFePO_4 batteries have been widely used in electric vehicles and energy storage stations. Currently, lithium loss, resulting in formation of Fe(III) phase, is mainly responsible for the capacity fade of LiFePO_4 cathode. Another factor is poor electrical conductivity that limits its rate capability. Here, we report the use of a multifunctional organic lithium salt (3,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile dilithium) to restore spent LiFePO_4 cathode by direct regeneration. The degraded LiFePO_4 particles are well coupled with the functional groups of the organic lithium salt, so that lithium fills vacancies and cyano groups create a reductive atmosphere to inhibit Fe(III) phase. At the same time, pyrolysis of the salt produces an amorphous conductive carbon layer that coats the LiFePO_4 particles, which improves Li-ion and electron transfer kinetics. The restored LiFePO_4 cathode shows good cycling stability and rate performance (a high capacity retention of 88% after 400 cycles at 5 C). This lithium salt can also be used to recover degraded transition metal oxide-based cathodes. A techno-economic analysis suggests that this strategy has higher environmental and economic benefits, compared with the traditional recycling methods.",

Then, Li is recovered from the raffinate as Li2CO3 with the purity of 99.2% by precipitation method. Finally, organic load phase is stripped with 0.5M H2SO4, and the cathode material LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 is directly regenerated from stripping liquor without separating metal individually by co-precipitation method. The regenerative cathode material LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 is miro spherical morphology without any impurities, which can meet with LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 production standard of China and exhibits good electrochemical performance. Moreover, a waste battery management model is introduced to guarantee the material supply for spent battery recycling.",

However, the degradation of cyclic performance is very serious when LNMO cathode operates over 4.2 V.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nWe report a rational design of a sulfur heterocyclic quinone (dibenzo[b,i]thianthrene-5,7,12,14-tetraone=DTT) used as a cathode (uptake of four lithium ions to form Li4 DTT) and a conductive polymer [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)=\n\n\nPEDOT\nPSS) used as a binder for a high-performance rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Because of the reduced energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) caused by the introduced S atoms, the initial Li-ion intercalation potential of DTT is 2.89 V, which is 0.3 V higher than that of its carbon analog. Meanwhile, there is a noncovalent interaction between DTT and\n\n\nPEDOT\nPSS, which remarkably suppressed the dissolution and enhanced the conductivity of DTT, thus leading to the great improvement of the electrochemical performance. The DTT cathode with the\n\n\nPEDOT\nPSS binder displays a long-term cycling stability (292 mAh g(-1) for the first cycle, 266 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C) and a high rate capability (220 mAh g(-1) at 1 C). This design strategy based on a noncovalent interaction is very effective for the application of small organic molecules as the cathode of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "High Rate and Stable Li-Ion Insertion in Oxygen-Deficient LiV3O8 Nanosheets as a Cathode Material for Lithium-Ion Battery.",
        "abstract": "Low performance of cathode materials has become one of the major obstacles to the application of lithium-ion battery (LIB) in advanced portable electronic devices, hybrid electric vehicles, and electric vehicles. The present work reports a versatile oxygen-deficient LiV3O8 (D-LVO) nanosheet that was synthesized successfully via a facile oxygen-deficient hydrothermal reaction followed by thermal annealing in Ar. When used as a cathode material for LIB, the prepared D-LVO nanosheets display remarkable capacity properties at various current densities (a capacity of 335, 317, 278, 246, 209, 167, and 133 mA h g-1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 mA g-1, respectively) and excellent lithium-ion storage stability, maintaining more than 88% of the initial reversible capacity after 200 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The outstanding electrochemical properties are believed to arise largely from the introduction of tetravalent V (∼15% V4+) and the attendant oxygen vacancies into LiV3O8 nanosheets, leading to intrinsic electrical conductivity more than 1 order of magnitude higher and lithium-ion diffusion coefficient nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of LiV3O8 without detectable V4+ (N-LVO) and thus contributing to the easy lithium-ion diffusion, rapid phase transition, and the excellent electrochemical reversibility. Furthermore, the more uniform nanostructure, as well as the larger specific surface area of D-LVO than N-LVO nanosheets may also improve the electrolyte penetration and provide more reaction sites for fast lithium-ion diffusion during the discharge/charge processes.",

        "abstract": "The current lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrode fabrication process relies heavily on the wet coating process, which uses the environmentally harmful and toxic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. In addition to being unsustainable, the use of this expensive organic solvent substantially increases the cost of battery production, as it needs to be dried and recycled throughout the manufacturing process. Herein, we report an industrially viable and sustainable dry press-coating process that uses the combination of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a dry powder composite and etched Al foil as a current collector. Notably, the mechanical strength and performance of the fabricated LiNi_0.7Co_0.1Mn_0.2O_2 (NCM712) dry press-coated electrodes (DPCEs) far exceed those of conventional slurry-coated electrodes (SCEs) and give rise to high loading (100 mg cm^−2, 17.6 mAh cm^−2) with impressive specific energy and volumetric energy density of 360 Wh kg^−1 and 701 Wh L^−1, respectively. Scalable dry electrode process is essential for the sustainable manufacturing of the lithium based batteries.

        "abstract": "Recently, hydrogen boride (HB) with a pseudo-two-dimensional sheet structure was successfully synthesized, and it is theoretically predicted to have high potential as a negative electrode material for alkali metal ion batteries, making it a promising new candidate. This study represents the first experimental examination of the negative electrode properties of HB. HB was synthesized via cation exchange from MgB2. The confirmation of HB synthesis was achieved through various spectroscopic experiments, including synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in addition to direct observation using transmission electron microscopy. The HB electrode was prepared by mixing the HB powder sample with conductive additive carbon black and a polymer binder. A test cell was assembled with the HB electrode as the working electrode, and lithium metal as the counter and reference electrodes, and its battery electrode properties were evaluated. Although reversible charge-discharge curves with good reversibility were observed, the reversible capacity was 100 ± 20 mA h g-1 which is significantly smaller than the theoretical predictions. Nitrogen gas adsorption experiments were performed on the HB powder sample to determine the specific surface area indicating that the HB sheets were stacked together. It is plausible to consider that this stacking structure led to a reduced lithium-ion storage capacity compared to the theoretical predictions.",

The advantages and disadvantages of different types of nanomaterials are being discussed, such as nanoparticles, nanocoating, nanotubes, and nanocomposites, and their effects on the electrochemical behavior of the LIBs. On the other hand, some of the key issues and future directions for the development of nanomaterials-based LIBs are also being highlighted.

Unfortunately, the application of LNMO is hindered by its poor cycle stability. Here, we demonstrate an easily-prepared site-selectively doped LNMO electrode with exceptional durability. In this work, Mg is selectively doped onto both tetrahedral (8a) and octahedral (16c) sites in the Fd-3m structure. This site-selective doping not only suppresses unfavorable two-phase reactions and stabilizes the LNMO structure against structural deformation, but also mitigates the dissolution of Mn during cycling. Mg-doped LNMOs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, retaining ~86% and ~87% of initial capacity after 1500 cycles at 1 C and 2200 cycles at 10 C, respectively. Such excellent electrochemical performance is also reflected in prototype full-batteries with novel TiNb2O7 counter electrodes. This work pioneers an atomic-doping engineering strategy for electrode materials that could be extended to other energy materials to create high-performance devices.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are common in everyday life and the demand for their raw materials is increasing. Additionally, spent LIBs should be recycled to achieve a circular economy and supply resources for new LIBs or other products. Especially the recycling of the active material of the electrodes is the focus of current research. Existing approaches for recycling (e.g., pyro-, hydrometallurgy, or flotation) still have their drawbacks, such as the loss of materials, generation of waste, or lack of selectivity. In this study, we test the behavior of commercially available LiFePO4 and two types of graphite microparticles in a dielectrophoretic high-throughput filter. Dielectrophoresis is a volume-dependent electrokinetic force that is commonly used in microfluidics but recently also for applications that focus on enhanced throughput. In our study, graphite particles show significantly higher trapping than LiFePO4 particles. The results indicate that nearly pure fractions of LiFePO4 can be obtained with this technique from a mixture with graphite.",

Although the discovery and optimization of battery active materials has been the subject of extensive study since the 1980s, the most disruptive advancements of commercial LIBs in the past decade stem instead from overall cell design and engineering. In pursuit of higher energy density and fast-charging capability, strategies focused on tuning the properties of composite electrode architectures (e.g., porosity, conductivity, tortuosity, spatial heterogeneity) by restructuring the inactive component matrix of LIB electrode films have recently garnered attention. This perspective explores recent advances in electrode design through an applied lens, emphasizing synthetic platforms and future research directions that are scalable, commercially feasible, and applicable to a wide range of active materials. We introduce and critically assess recently proposed strategies for structuring electrode architectures, including spatial gradients of local composition and microstructure; metal-foil current collector alternatives; and electrode templating techniques, evaluating both achievements in battery performance and commercial applicability. Coupled with improved active materials, new electrode architectures hold promise to unlock next generation LIBs.",

Deep learning computer vision methods were used to evaluate the quality of lithium-ion battery electrode for automated detection of microstructural defects from light microscopy images of the sectioned cells. The results demonstrate that deep learning models are able to learn accurate representations of the microstructure images well enough to distinguish instances with defects from those without defect. Furthermore, the benefits of using pretrained networks for microstructure classification were also demonstrated, achieving the highest classification accuracies. This method provides an approach to analyse thousands of Li-ion battery micrographs for quality assessment in a very short time and it can also be combined with other common battery characterization methods for further technical analysis.",

        "abstract": "Free-standing electrode (FSE) architectures hold the potential to dramatically increase the gravimetric and volumetric energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by eliminating the parasitic dead weight and volume associated with traditional metal foil current collectors. However, current FSE fabrication methods suffer from insufficient mechanical stability, electrochemical performance, or industrial adoptability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable camphene-assisted fabrication method that allows simultaneous casting and templating of FSEs comprising common LIB materials with a performance superior to their foil-cast counterparts. These porous, lightweight, and robust electrodes simultaneously enable enhanced rate performance by improving the mass and ion transport within the percolating conductive carbon pore network and eliminating current collectors for efficient and stable Li+ storage (>1000 cycles in half-cells) at increased gravimetric and areal energy densities. Compared to conventional foil-cast counterparts, the camphene-derived electrodes exhibit ∼1.5× enhanced gravimetric energy density, increased rate capability, and improved capacity retention in coin-cell configurations. A full cell containing both a free-standing anode and cathode was cycled for over 250 cycles with greater than 80% capacity retention at an areal capacity of 0.73 mA h/cm2. This active-material-agnostic electrode fabrication method holds potential to tailor the morphology of flexible, current-collector-free electrodes, thus enabling LIBs to be optimized for high power or high energy density Li+ storage. Furthermore, this platform provides an electrode fabrication method that is applicable to other electrochemical technologies and advanced manufacturing methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has received increasing attention as an alternative manufacturing approach to slurry casting for the production of battery and supercapacitor electrodes. This process is of relevance for industrial scalability as evidently seen in the current electrophoretic paints industry. Nevertheless, the reported work so far have only concentrated on thin films of electrophoretically deposited electrodes for energy storage. Here, the electrochemical performance of thick films (up to tens of μm) as lithium‐ion battery electrodes produced by EPD is reported. A commercially sourced LiN1/3M1/3C1/3O2 (5 to 25 μm particle size) was used in this exemplary investigation. This work shows the production of binder‐free high density active material (>90 %) electrodes. Coin cells were assembled and the battery performance was measured. Tests included: cyclic voltammetry, C‐rate vs capacity, battery cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Other investigations also studied: colloidal electrolyte formulation, electrode manufacture, microstructure characterisation and elemental mapping analysis. In short, EPD electrode manufacture can be applied as a platform technology for any battery and supercapacitor material, and the reported manufacturing processes and methodologies represent direct relevance to produce energy storage electrodes useful to practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Lithium‐ion battery performance is intrinsically linked to electrode microstructure. Quantitative measurement of key structural parameters of lithium‐ion battery electrode microstructures will enable optimization as well as motivate systematic numerical studies for the improvement of battery performance. With the rapid development of 3‐D imaging techniques, quantitative assessment of 3‐D microstructures from 2‐D image sections by stereological methods appears outmoded; however, in spite of the proliferation of tomographic imaging techniques, it remains significantly easier to obtain two‐dimensional (2‐D) data sets. In this study, stereological prediction and three‐dimensional (3‐D) analysis techniques for quantitative assessment of key geometric parameters for characterizing battery electrode microstructures are examined and compared. Lithium‐ion battery electrodes were imaged using synchrotron‐based X‐ray tomographic microscopy. For each electrode sample investigated, stereological analysis was performed on reconstructed 2‐D image sections generated from tomographic imaging, whereas direct 3‐D analysis was performed on reconstructed image volumes. The analysis showed that geometric parameter estimation using 2‐D image sections is bound to be associated with ambiguity and that volume‐based 3‐D characterization of nonconvex, irregular and interconnected particles can be used to more accurately quantify spatially‐dependent parameters, such as tortuosity and pore‐phase connectivity.",

        "abstract": "A facile process is demonstrated for the synthesis of layered SiCN-MoS_2 structure via pyrolysis of polysilazane functionalized MoS_2 flakes. The layered morphology and polymer to ceramic transformation on MoS_2 surfaces was confirmed by use of electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. Tested as thick film electrode in a Li-ion battery half-cell, SiCN-MoS_2 showed the classical three-stage reaction with improved cycling stability and capacity retention than neat MoS_2. Contribution of conversion reaction of Li/MoS_2 system on overall capacity was marginally affected by the presence of SiCN while Li-irreversibility arising from electrolyte decomposition was greatly suppressed. This is understood as one of the reasons for decreased first cycle loss and increased capacity retention. SiCN-MoS_2 in the form of self-supporting paper electrode (at 6 mg·cm^−2) exhibited even better performance, regaining initial charge capacity of approximately 530 mAh·g^−1 when the current density returned to 100 mA·g^−1 after continuous cycling at 2400 mA·g^−1 (192 mAh·g^−1). MoS_2 cycled electrode showed mud-cracks and film delamination whereas SiCN-MoS_2 electrodes were intact and covered with a uniform solid electrolyte interphase coating. Taken together, our results suggest that molecular level interfacing with precursor–derived SiCN is an effective strategy for suppressing the metal-sulfide/electrolyte degradation reaction at low discharge potentials.",

        "abstract": "Currently, exploring high‐volumetric‐capacity electrode materials that allow for reversible (de‐)insertion of large‐size K+ ions remains challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode for storage of K+ ions due to its high volumetric capacity, confirmed in lithium‐/sodium‐ion batteries, and the intrinsic good electronic conductivity. However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now. Here, a novel K–Te battery is constructed, and the K+‐ion storage mechanism of Te is revealed to be a two‐electron conversion‐type reaction of 2K + Te ↔ K2Te, resulting in a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm−3. Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm−3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high‐rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm−3 at 15 C, and superior long‐term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C. This excellent electrochemical performance proves the feasibility of utilizing Te as a high‐volumetric‐capacity active material for storage of K+ ions and will advance the practical application of KIBs.",

        "abstract": "The investigation of chemical and structural dynamics in battery materials is essential to elucidation of structure-property relationships for rational design of advanced battery materials. Spatially resolved techniques, such as scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), are widely applied to address this challenge. However, battery materials are susceptible to electron beam damage, complicating the data interpretation. In this study, we demonstrate that, under electron beam irradiation, the surface and bulk of battery materials undergo chemical and structural evolution equivalent to that observed during charge-discharge cycling. In a lithiated NiO nanosheet, a Li_2CO_3-containing surface reaction layer (SRL) was gradually decomposed during electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) acquisition. For cycled LiNi_0.4Mn_0.4Co_0.18Ti_0.02O_2 particles, repeated electron beam irradiation induced a phase transition from an layered structure to an rock-salt structure, which is attributed to the stoichiometric lithium and oxygen removal from 3a and 6c sites, respectively. Nevertheless, it is still feasible to preserve pristine chemical environments by minimizing electron beam damage, for example, using fast electron imaging and spectroscopy. Finally, the present study provides examples of electron beam damage on lithium-ion battery materials and suggests that special attention is necessary to prevent misinterpretation of experimental results.",

        "abstract": "No design rules have yet been established for producing solid electrolytes with a lithium-ion conductivity high enough to replace liquid electrolytes and expand the performance and battery configuration limits of current lithium ion batteries. Taking advantage of the properties of high-entropy materials, we have designed a highly ion-conductive solid electrolyte by increasing the compositional complexity of a known lithium superionic conductor to eliminate ion migration barriers while maintaining the structural framework for superionic conduction. The synthesized phase with a compositional complexity showed an improved ion conductivity. We showed that the highly conductive solid electrolyte enables charge and discharge of a thick lithium-ion battery cathode at room temperature and thus has potential to change conventional battery configurations. Description Editor’s summary Solid electrolytes have been developed to allow solid-state batteries to compete with liquid electrolyte batteries, but there is still a challenge in ensuring good contact with the electrodes, which thus limits the thickness of electrodes that can be used in practice. Li et al. applied the principles of high-entropy materials to improve upon the properties of existing electrolytes through the sensible partial substitution of addition elements. The authors demonstrate the incorporation of their materials into a cathode structure, which provides the high ionic conductivity required for solid-state battery applications. —MSL Adding composition complexity to a known crystal framework enables millimeter-thick battery electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Increased demand for hybrid and electric vehicles has motivated research to improve onboard state of charge (SOC) and state of health estimation (SOH). In particular, batteries with composite electrodes have become popular for automotive applications due to their ability to balance energy density, power density, and cost by adjusting the amount of each material within the electrode. SOH algorithms that do not use electrochemical-based models may have more difficulty maintaining an accurate battery model as the cell ages under varying degradation modes, such as lithium consumption at the solid-electrolyte interface or active material dissolution. Furthermore, efforts to validate electrochemical model-based state estimation algorithms with experimental aging data are limited, particularly for composite electrode cells. In this paper, we first present a reduced-order electrochemical model for a composite LiMn2O4-LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrode battery that predicts the surface and bulk lithium concentration of each material in the composite electrode, as well as the current split between each material. The model is then used in dual-nonlinear observers to estimate the cell SOC and loss of cyclable lithium over time. Three different observer types are compared: 1) the extended Kalman filter; 2) fixed interval Kalman smoother; and 3) particle filter. Finally, an experimental aging campaign is used to compare the estimated capacities for five different cells with the measured capacities over time.",

Here, a new electrophoretic deposition Co3O4/graphene (EPD Co3O4/G) hybrid electrode is developed to improve the electrochemical performance. Through EPD, Co3O4 nanocubes can be homogeneously embedded between graphene sheets to form a sandwich-like structure. Owing to the excellent flexibility of graphene and a large number of voids in this sandwich-like structure, the structural integrity and unobstructed conductive network can be maintained during cycling. Moreover, the electrode kinetics has proved to be a fast surface-controlled lithium storage process. As a result, the Co3O4/G hybrid electrode exhibits high specific capacity and excellent electrochemical cycling performance. The Co3O4/G hybrid electrode was also further studied by in situ electrochemical XRD to understand the relationship of its structure and performance: (1) The observed LixCo3O4 indicates an intermediate of possible small volume change in the first discharging. (2) The theoretical capacity achievement of the Co3O4 in hybrid electrode was evidenced. (3) The correlation between the electrochemical performance and the structural evolution of the Co3O4/G hybrid electrode was discussed detailedly.",

        "abstract": "Prelithiation can boost the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). A cost-effective prelithiation strategy with high quality and high industrial compatibility is urgently required. Herein we developed a roll-to-roll electrodeposition and transfer-printing system for continuous prelithiation of LIB anodes. By roll-to-roll calendering, pre-manufactured anodes could be fully transfer-printed onto electrodeposited lithium metal. The interface separation and adhesion during transfer printing were related to interfacial shear and compressive stress, respectively. With the facile transfer-printing prelithiation, high initial Coulombic efficiencies of 99.99% and 99.05% were achieved in graphite and silicon/carbon composite electrode half cells, respectively. The initial Coulombic efficiencies and energy densities in full cells were observed to be significantly improved with the prelithiated electrodes. The roll-to-roll transfer printing provides a high-performance, controllable, scalable and industry-adaptable prelithiation in LIBs. Prelithiation can be used to address the issue of active lithium loss during lithium-ion battery operation, but its cost effectiveness needs to be improved. Here the researchers develop a roll-to-roll electrodeposition and transfer-printing system for the production of prelithiated battery anodes with high electrochemical performances.",

The Ge nanorod networks were observed to self-replicate their tetrahedron structures and form a diamond cubic lattice-like inner network. After etching and subsequent carbon coating, the treated Ge nanostructures provide good electrical conductivity and are resistant to gradual deterioration, resulting in superior electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs, with a charge capacity retention of 96% after 100 cycles and a high specific capacity of 1360 mA h g^−1 at 1 C and a high-rate capability with reversible capacities of 1080 and 850 mA h g^−1 at the rates of 5 and 10 C, respectively. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the fast electron transport and good strain accommodation of the carbon-filled Ge microflower-on-nanostem hybrid electrode.",

The nanowires, made by the supercritical-fluid-liquid-solid process, are crystalline, range in diameter from 10 to 50 nm with an average length of >100 μm, and are coated with a thin chemisorbed polyphenylsilane shell. About 90% of the nanowire fabric volume is void space. Thermal annealing of the nanowire fabric in a reducing environment converts the polyphenylsilane coating to a carbonaceous layer that significantly increases the electrical conductivity of the material. This makes the nanowire fabric useful as a self-supporting, mechanically flexible, high-energy-storage anode material in a lithium ion battery. Anode capacities of more than 800 mA h g(-1) were achieved without the addition of conductive carbon or binder.",

The IL-based electrolyte is characterized in terms of conductivity and viscosity at various temperatures, revealing a Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) trend. Lithium half-cells employing the Sn-C anode and NMC cathode in the Pyr14 TFSI-LiTFSI electrolyte are investigated by galvanostatic cycling at various temperatures, demonstrating the full compatibility of the electrolyte with the selected electrode materials. The NMC and Sn-C electrodes are combined into a cathode-limited full cell, which is subjected to prolonged cycling at 40 °C, revealing a very stable capacity of about 140 mAh g(-1) and retention above 99 % over 400 cycles. The electrode/electrolyte interface is further characterized through a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations upon cell cycling. The remarkable performances reported here definitively indicate that IL-based lithium ion cells are suitable batteries for application in electric vehicles.",

From the early Li‐metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li‐based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next‐generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium‐ion battery chemistries.",

        "abstract": "High-tap-density silicon nanomaterials are highly desirable as anodes for lithium ion batteries, due to their small surface area and minimum first-cycle loss. However, this material poses formidable challenges to polymeric binder design. Binders adhere on to the small surface area to sustain the drastic volume changes during cycling; also the low porosities and small pore size resulting from this material are detrimental to lithium ion transport. This study introduces a new binder, poly(1-pyrenemethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PPyMAA), for a high-tap-density nanosilicon electrode cycled in a stable manner with a first cycle efficiency of 82%-a value that is further improved to 87% when combined with graphite material. Incorporating the MAA acid functionalities does not change the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) features or lower the adhesion performance of the PPy homopolymer. Our single-molecule force microscopy measurement of PPyMAA reveals similar adhesion strength between polymer binder and anode surface when compared with conventional polymer such as homopolyacrylic acid (PAA), while being electronically conductive. The combined conductivity and adhesion afforded by the MAA and pyrene copolymer results in good cycling performance for the high-tap-density Si electrode.",

Here, we present a previously unreported particle size and electrode porosity dual-gradient structure design in the graphite anode for achieving extremely fast-charging lithium ion battery under strict electrode conditions. We develop a polymer binder–free slurry route to construct this previously unreported type particle size-porosity dual-gradient structure in the practical graphite anode showing the extremely fast-charging capability with 60% of recharge in 10 min. On the basis of dual-gradient graphite anode, we demonstrate extremely fast-charging lithium ion battery realizing 60% recharge in 6 min and high volumetric energy density of 701 Wh liter−1 at the high charging rate of 6 C.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in the development of new battery materials is understanding their fundamental mechanisms of operation and degradation. Their microscopically inhomogeneous nature calls for characterization tools that provide operando and localized information from individual grains and particles. Here, we describe an approach that enables imaging the nanoscale distribution of ions during electrochemical charging of a battery in a transmission electron microscope liquid flow cell. We use valence energy-loss spectroscopy to track both solvated and intercalated ions, with electronic structure fingerprints of the solvated ions identified using an ab initio nonlinear response theory. Equipped with the new electrochemical cell holder, nanoscale spectroscopy and theory, we have been able to determine the lithiation state of a LiFePO4 electrode and surrounding aqueous electrolyte in real time with nanoscale resolution during electrochemical charge and discharge. We follow lithium transfer between electrode and electrolyte and image charging dynamics in the cathode. We observe competing delithiation mechanisms such as core-shell and anisotropic growth occurring in parallel for different particles under the same conditions. This technique represents a general approach for the operando nanoscale imaging of electrochemically active ions in the electrode and electrolyte in a wide range of electrical energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion battery manufacturing is a highly complicated process with strongly coupled feature interdependencies; a feasible solution that can analyze feature variables within manufacturing chain and achieve reliable classification is, thus, urgently needed. This article proposes a random forest (RF)-based classification framework, through using the out of bag predictions, Gini changes, as well as predictive measure of association (PMOA), for effectively quantifying the importance and correlations of battery manufacturing features and their effects on the classification of electrode properties. Battery manufacturing data containing three intermediate product features from the mixing stage and one product parameter from the coating stage are analyzed by the designed RF framework to investigate their effects on both the battery electrode active material mass load and porosity. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed RF framework not only achieves the reliable classification of electrode properties, but also leads to the effective quantification of both manufacturing feature importance (FI) and correlations. This is the first time to design a systematic RF framework for simultaneously quantifying battery production FI and correlations by three various quantitative indicators, including the unbiased FI, gain improvement FI, and PMOA, paving a promising solution to reduce model dimension and conduct efficient sensitivity analysis of battery manufacturing.",
