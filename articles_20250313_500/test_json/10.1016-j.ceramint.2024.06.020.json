                "Addressing the slow electrochemical kinetics and electrode pulverization of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is needed to continuously develop advanced anode materials. Molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) is considered promising for SIBs anodes due to its wider interlayer distance, faster electronic conductivity, and weaker interlayer force. However, the nanoparticle aggregation and layered structure collapse caused by bond breakage weaken its inherent advantages for excellent sodium storage performance. Herein, hierarchically nanostructured regulation and surface coating of MoTe2 based SIB anodes are simultaneously achieved by employing Mo-PDA as precursors through a concise and effective method containing chelation, preoxidation and tellurization. The microstructure and morphology of MoTe2/C composites can be facilely regulated by controlling the chelation time and tellurization temperature. The as-synthesized MoTe2/C-6h-600 electrode exhibits encouraging Na+ storage performance, which delivers discharge capacitances of 290.7 mAh g−1 (0.1 A g−1) and 161.1 mAh g−1 (1.0 A g−1) after hundreds and thousands cycles, respevtively. Furthermore, the assembled full cell of MoTe2/C-6h-600//NVP delivers a stable reversible capacitance of 103 mAh g−1, which is promising for future practical applications."

                "Developing rechargeable batteries for energy storage is crucial for tackling environmental pollution, meeting social development needs, and discovering fresh energy sources [, , ]. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gained significant attentiveness because of the low cost of sodium resources and their ability to provide long-lasting and high-capacity energy storage [, , ]. However, the sluggish electrochemical kinetics caused by the larger Na+ radius and the problem of pulverization and volume expansion pose significant challenges to improve the SIB performances containing rate capability, long-term stability, and safety [ , , ]. To tackle these challenges, considerable effort has been dedicated to develop advanced SIB anodes [ , , ]. Unfortunately, the majority of reported anode materials suffer from weaknesses such as poor electronic conductivity, inferior structure stability, and unstable cycling performance [, , ]. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), with their unique Na+ storage mechanism and layered structures, offer promising characteristics containing high theoretical capacitance, fast charge transfer, and weak chemical bonds [ , , ].",
                "Recently, there has been increasing attention on molybdenum-based SIB anodes benefitting from their structural diversity and good performance [ , , ]. Molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) with unique 2D layered architecture is a typical TMD, which has a relatively wider interlayer spacing (MoTe2 (∼0.70 nm) > MoSe2 (∼0.65 nm) > MoS2 (∼0.62 nm) > graphite (∼0.34 nm)) and weaker interlayer forces (Te–Mo–Te), allowing for excessive Na+ storage without serious volume change [ , , ]. For instance, Panda et al. [ ] used high-temperature solid-state reaction to prepare high-purity MoTe2, which exhibited an initial discharge capacity of ∼320 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1. Liang et al. [ ] reported the synthesis of MoTe2 nanosheets based on the space-confined effect of NaCl template, which delivered high reversible discharge specific capacity (412 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1) as well as good rate and cycling capabilities. However, bond breakage easily occurs between layers of MoTe2 due to the volume change when numerous sodium ions are inserted, leading to nanoparticle aggregation and layered structure collapse, which weakens its inherent advantages for excellent Na+ storage performance []. To overcome this issue, carbonaceous materials were often chosen to be combined with MoTe2 to maintain the structure strength [, , ]. Dopamine (DA) is a cost-effective carbon source, which can not only be converted into nitrogen-doped carbon, but also adsorb and chelate molybdate ions through numerous catechol groups [, , ].",
                "Herein, nanosheet self-assembled MoTe2/C composites with hierarchical architecture are synthesized by employing chelation, preoxidation, and tellurization techniques. In the processes, DA proceeds self-polymerization and chelation with molybdate ions simultaneously to form Mo-PDA. After preoxidation, and tellurization, PDA is converted into nitrogen doped carbon and Mo–O bond breaks accompanied by the formation of Te–Mo–Te. Furthermore, the microstructure of MoTe2/C could be regulated through chelation time and tellurization temperature. The resulting 3D hierarchical structure with nanosheet self-assembly provides numerous active sites for Na+ storage. The assembled half-cell and full-cell both exhibit excellent rate capability and prolonged cycles."

The precursor underwent multiple rinses with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol to eliminate residues and impurities. Moreover, Mo-PDA was dried at 60 °C to remove moisture. The influence of stirring time on material properties is investigated by controlling stirring time for 3h, 6 h and 9 h, respectively.

Firstly, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and DA were mixed with the Tris buffer solution and stirred evenly. In the meantime, chelation and self-polymerization of DA are going on simultaneously. On the one hand, DA possesses numerous catechol groups that can chelate and adsorb a large number of molybdate ions from the decomposition of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (Mo7O246−+4H2O→7MoO42−+8H+) [ ]. On the other hand, PDA is formed because of the self-polymerization of DA under weakly alkaline conditions. More importantly, under the bidirectional action of chelation and self-polymerization, the precursor Mo-PDA composite was generated with the color change of the reaction solution from transparent to dark brown (Fig. S1) [ , , ]. Secondly, Mo-PDA composites were pre-oxidized at 450 °C for 3h to form the intermediate product MoOx/C. During calcination, PDA is converted to amorphous nitrogen doped carbon materials at the high calcination temperature while (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O is decomposed into MoOx. Finally, MoTe2/C composite is synthesized after the tellurization of MoOx/C at 600 °C for 5 h.",

At 500 °C, there is no characteristic XRD peak due to the low tellurization temperature. When the tellurization temperatures reach 600 °C and 700 °C, the peaks observed at 12.79°, 25.75°, 29.42°, 31.73°, 32.53°, 50.73°, 52.73° in XRD patterns correspond to the (002), (004), (201), (−112), (112), (310), (020) crystal planes of MoTe2 (JCPDS: 71–2157) []. Due to the large amount of amorphous carbon in the MoTe2/C composites, the weakly wide diffraction peaks in the 17°–28° range are attributed to the carbon material in the sample [ ]. Furthermore, Fig. S2 displays the sample surface information using Raman spectra, two typical carbon peaks at 1341 cm−1 (peak D) and 1604 cm−1 (peak G) were observed, which deliver the ID/IG values of the MoTe2-6h-600 and MoTe2-6h-700 are 1.23 and 1.14, respectively, indicating that MoTe2-6h-600 exhibits more surface defects. Furthermore, MoTe2/C composites were determined by TGA (Fig. S3). In the range of 220 °C–340 °C, the amount of MoTe2/C material increases due to the oxidation of MoTe2 [ , ]. The weight drop above 350 °C is due to the continuous oxidation of carbon. The carbon content in the composites is estimated to be about 34 %.",

In Fig. 3a–c, the three products are similar in morphology and size. The microspheres are about 2 μm in size and consist of a large number of layered nanosheets that are connected in a 3D interconnected network. However, the overlap degree of nanosheets of MoTe2/C-6h-500 is higher than that of MoTe2/C-6h-600. Meanwhile, the nanosheets of MoTe2/C-6h-700 collapsed due to the excessive temperature. The unique hierarchical structure of MoTe2/C can provide increased amount of active sites for sodium storage, improve the electron and ion transport rates, as well as relieve structural damage caused by volume effects. Fig. 3d–f shows the microstructure of MoTe2/C-6h-600 captured by TEM and HR-TEM. It can be seen that the microsphere is composed of numerous ultrathin and interconnected nanosheets, which corresponds well to the above SEM images.

Fig. 4 also shows the SEM images of the intermediate products Mo-PDA and MoOx/C at different synthesis times. It can be seen that the morphology of Mo-PDA-3h looks more like spheres, the lamellar structure is not fully developed. Meanwhile, the morphologies of Mo-PDA-6h and Mo-PDA-9h are nanosheets assembled in flower-like structures. By contrast, the nanosheet stacking of Mo-PDA-9h is denser than that of Mo-PDA-6h, which is speculated to be caused by too long reaction time (Fig. 4a–c). Because of the different morphologies of the precursor, the samples after preoxidation and tellurization also exhibit significantly different morphological characteristics (Fig. 4d–f for MoOx/C, Fig. 4g–i for MoTe2/C). Generally speaking, insufficient reaction time leads to incomplete development of the hierarchical structure of the product, resulting in the aggregation of nanoparticles. On the other hand, excessive reaction time can easily cause thickening and secondary aggregation of nanosheets, which is also unfavorable for rapid electrolyte immersion and ion/electron transport."

The ratio gradually increases to about 93 % when the scanning rate went up from to 1.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 6d). The high capacitance contribution may be due to the hierarchical nanostructure with nanosheets self-assembly, which raises more surface active sites to hold more Na+.",

In GITT measurements, the variation of voltage response to time can be achieved by alternating pulses and relaxation. Fig. S5a shows GITT curves of MoTe2/C-6h-600 and MoTe2/C-6h-700 electrodes.

From the charge-discharge process, the value of LogDNa + for MoTe2/C-6h-600 is higher than that of MoTe2/C-6h-700, indicating that MoTe2/C-6h-600 has better diffusion kinetics.",
                        "To investigate the interfacial resistance of the MoTe2/C electrodes, EIS tests of MoTe2/C-3h-600, MoTe2/C-6h-500, MoTe2/C-6h-600, MoTe2/C-6h-700, and MoTe2/C-9h-600 were evaluated after cycles. As depicted in Fig. S6, the Nyquist diagram of the MoTe2/C electrode consists of a semicircle and a diagonal line. The semicircle in the mid-high frequency is induced by the charge transfer between the active material and the electrolyte. The observable diagonal line corresponding to Warburg impedance (Zw, in the low frequency region) represents Na+ diffusion in the electrode [ ]. EIS data are fitted using the equivalent circuit diagram in Fig. S6, R1 is related to solution resistance (Rs) and R2 is related to Rct. CPE1 is related to the constant phase element of the Rct, Wo is related to the Warburg impedance. After fitting, the Rct values of MoTe2/C-3h-600, MoTe2/C-6h-500, MoTe2/C-6h-600, MoTe2/C-6h-700, and MoTe2/C-9h-600 electrodes are184.7Ω, 302.3 Ω, 140.1 Ω, 192.4 Ω, and 245 Ω, respectively.

                        "The SEM images before and after cycling of MoTe2/C-6h-600 and MoTe2/C-6h-700 are illustrated in Fig. 7 to identify the structure stability of electrodes. Before cycling, the two electrodes both have similar smooth surfaces. However, MoTe2/C-6h-700 displays many small and narrow cracks in the electrode plate after cycling. By contrast, MoTe2/C-6h-600 has almost no cracks in the electrodes after cycling, and the flower-like structure has good mechanical strength, so that it can maintain its original appearance. Furthermore, TEM and HRTEM characterizations of MoTe2/C-6h-600 after cycling are shown in Fig. S7. Although it did not clearly display the flower like morphology probably due to the relatively complex components of electrode plates, the ultrathin nanosheets of MoTe2/C-6h-600 were observed, suggesting the stable microstructures. The (112) and (004) crystal faces of MoTe2 were observed with the lattice spacing of 0.27 nm and 0.34 nm, which is also corresponding to the mentioned mechanism analysis of reversible conversion reaction (equations (1), (2))). Additionally, XPS characterizations of MoTe2/C-6h-600 electrode plates before and after cycling show that the main characteristic peaks of each element are relatively close to the initial prepared product powder (Fig. S8), except for the shift of C–O bonds, which may be related to the addition of conductive carbon black in the electrode plates.",

Fig. S9 displays the electrochemical performance and morphology of NVP cathode. Fig. 8a shows the structural diagram of full cell (MoTe2/C-6h-600//NVP). The full cell delivers an excellent 1st discharge capacitance of 186 mAh g−1 and a good reversible capacitance of 103 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 8b). Fig. 8c shows the similar GCD curves to MoTe2/C-6h-600 half cell and the initial Coulombic efficiency reaches 97 %. Furthermore, Fig. 8d exhibits a digital photo that the assembled MoTe2/C-6h-600//NVP full cell powered an electronic gyroscope and Video S1 displays the related rotation scene.",

                "In summary, hierarchical flower-like MoTe2/C composites with unique nanosheet self-assembly are synthesized by employing Mo-PDA as precursors through a concise and effective synthesis route combined chelation, preoxidation and tellurization. The as-synthesized MoTe2/C composites exhibit rich structure designability and morphology regulatability, which are beneficial for enhanced Na+ storage. Specifically, MoTe2/C-6h-600 electrode maintains a discharge capacitance of 290.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles and 161.1 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled MoTe2/C-6h-600//NVP full cell has an excellent reversible capacitance of 103 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating the promising practical applications. Although we have discussed many advantages of as-prepared MoTe2/C nanocomposites, there are still some limitations. For example, how to reduce the preparation temperature of materials will be beneficial for energy consumption management. In addition, it is necessary to further improve the capacitance of full cell to drive large electronic instruments instead of current small electronic devices."
