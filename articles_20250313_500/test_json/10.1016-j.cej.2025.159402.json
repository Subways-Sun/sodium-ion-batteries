                "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) anode holds the merits of high capacity (∼660 mA h/g) and good conductivity (2.5 × 106 S m−1). Nevertheless, it still suffers from uncontrolled volumetric expansion (VE: 390 %) during cycling. Herein, a 3D honeycombed carbon structure is designed to regulate the huge VE to obtain Sb@C composite. It can deliver an unparalleled reversible capacity with fantastic long-term cycling stability (500 mA g−1@1050 mA h/g@5000 cycles@99.9 % retention) during 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V voltage window. In-situ XRD patterns profoundly clarify the mechanism for excess Na-storage as double reaction processes: alloying/de-alloying (Sb + 3Na ⇋ Na3Sb) during 2.5 ∼ 0.01 V and Na-plating/stripping into/from C skeleton (C + 9Na ⇋ Na9C) during 0.01 ∼ -0.05 V. Furthermore, electrochemical performance in different electrolytes (ether and ester) are much better cycling capacity and stability. In-situ EIS tests verify the far lower polarization throughout an entire charge–discharge in ether electrolyte during 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V. In addition, during Na-plating process, it is confirmed that Sb@C possesses lower binding energy (−2.19 eV) and diffusion energy barrier (0.2943 eV) by theoretical calculation. Hence, this work is inspiring in electrode materials design for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",

                "Nowadays, a revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) based on energy storage technology has extensively emerged worldwide. Intelligent driving cars (IDCs), a latest application of AI, are facilitating people's life and further promoting the innovation of secondary battery technologies (SBTs). Meanwhile, for high crustal abundance of sodium element (2.64 %) and relatively high energy density, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as a suitable substitute for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in IDCs and large-scale energy storage power stations (LSESPS) [1]. For SIBs, the anode materials can be divided into insertion/extraction (e.g. graphite, nanocarbon materials, hard carbon(HC)) [2], conversion (e.g. S, Se, P, transition metal oxides) [3], [4] and alloying (e.g. Sb, Bi, Sn, Si) [5], [6] types according to their electrochemical reaction mechanism. Herein, HC is appreciated for its superior cycling capability and high safety that are derived from the internal disordered porous structure, surface defect sites and mild VE during cycling [7]. However, extremely high synthesis temperature (2800 ℃), low working capacity (∼300 mA h/g) and inferior rate performance make it unfit for command. Besides, conversion-based materials generally can give working capacity about 400 mA h/g, greater than HC [8]. Meanwhile, they also suffer from poor reaction kinetics and unstable cycling issues [9] originated from huge VE (> 80 %) and low electronic conductivity [10], [11]. In contrast, alloying-type antimony (Sb) anode is capable of displaying a higher capacity (∼660 mA h/g) [12], better electronic conductivity (2.5 × 106 S m−1) [13], eligible voltage plateau (0.6 V v.s. Na+/Na) [14] as well as volumetric capacity (1750 mA h/g) [15], indicating greater potential for application in anode materials for next-generation SIBs. However, Sb anode still takes along severe VE (390 %) during cycling [16]. Such uncontrolled would make the working capacity lower and lower during long-term cycling [17].",
                "To effectively alleviate the huge VE of Sb anode, 3D structural regulations (e.g. core–shell [18], porous sphere [19]) and morphological designs (e.g. rod-like [20], podiform [21], nanobox-shaped [22]) are extensively adopted. For instance, Yang et al. [23] prepared an Sb@C composite with egg-yolk-shell structure (carbon content: 20 wt%), effectively regulating the VE and promoting ion transport. As a result, it obtained an enhanced working capacity as well as stability (1000 mA g−1@325 mA h/g@8000 cycle@74 %). He’s group [24] designed a N/S-doped Sb@C material with 3D porous core–shell microspheres (carbon content: 50.4 wt%), which can exhibit a high capacity (540 mA h/g@100 mA g−1) as well as ultra-long cycling life (331 mA h/g@10000 cycles@20 A g−1@99.7 %). Besides, Huang et al. [13] synthesized an Sb@C composite composed of Sb particles and porous carbon octahedron via an in-situ substitution method (carbon content: 30 wt%), displaying high reversible capacity (474.5 mA h/g@500 cycles@200 mA g−1@97.5 %). Recently, Zhang et al. [21] planted Sb into carbon nanotubes to form pea-shaped Sb@C (carbon content: 13 wt%). It is able to give outstanding electrochemical performances in both cycling (559 mA h/g@200 cycles@100 mA g−1@92 %; 305 mA h/g @3000 cycles@1 A g−1@70 %) and rate (206 mA h/g@10 A g−1) capabilities. Hence, giving Sb a 3D porous big house can efficiently deal with the VE issue and improve comprehensive electrochemical performance. However, all the above Sb@C composites carry relatively high proportion (>13 wt%) of skeletal carbon, which means an extremely decreased ratio of active Sb in the electrode material. It inevitably leads to a significant diminution in the working capacity. Thus, it is significant to convert the large amount of carbon materials from electrochemically inactive to active on the premise of solving weakness of huge VE. Such invariable challenge has never been overcome until now.",
                "In this work, we design a N-doped Sb@C materials with 3D honeycomb shaped porous spherical morphology. Such 3D honeycombed structure can greatly relieve VE during Sb-Na alloying/de-alloying process. Moreover, such Sb@C composite electrode is capable of delivering unparalleled 1050 mA h/g working capacity during 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V voltage window with superb cycling stability (500 mA g−1@1050 mA h/g@5000 cycles@99.9 %) and energy density (2228 W h kg−1) in ether electrolyte. Furthermore, the excess Na-storage mechanism is profoundly clarified to be alloying/de-alloying (Sb + 3Na ⇋ Na3Sb) during 2.5 ∼ 0.01 V and Na-plating/stripping into/from C skeleton (C + 9Na ⇋ Na9C) during 0.01 ∼ -0.05 V by various in-situ and ex-situ characterizations. Hence, this work is inspiring in electrode materials design for higher-performance SIBs."

                "The structures of as-prepared Sb@C and C anodes are characterized by XRD as shown in Fig. S1a. The Sb@C material displays typical diffraction peaks of (012), (104), (110), which can be assigned to the pure hexagonal Sb crystal (JCPDS: 35–0732; space group: R-3 m (166)) without any impure phase [25]. Besides, no obvious diffraction peaks belonging to C anode can be observed in the XRD patterns of both Sb@C and C samples, indicating the C skeleton is amorphous [26]. To further clarify crystal structures of Sb@C, Rietveld refinement patterns and result are performed (Fig. S1b and Table 1). The Sb@C (a = b = 4.3029 Å, c = 11.266 Å, v = 180.6437 Å3) can provide considerable cell parameters. The amorphous carbon is also analyzed by Raman spectra (Fig. S1c). The two broad peaks located at 1339 and 1585 cm−1 are ascribed to the disorder-induced (D peak) and crystalline graphite (G peak) vibrations for both samples. the values of ID/IG of Sb@C and C anode are 1,0.943, respectly, which suggesting that they contain a large amount of defective carbon. Moreover, the morphology of these samples is performed by SEM and TEM images as illustrated in Fig. 1a-c. The Sb@C composite displays dissimilar honeycombed spherical particles with uniform particle diameter (500 nm, Fig. 1a). In contrast, the as-synthesized C material shows hollow porous spherical secondary particles (1 ∼ 5 μm) made up of cake-like primary particles (1–1.5 μm, Fig. S1d, e). To more clearly observe the internal structure of the polygonal nano-holes (100 nm) of such honeycomb, the TEM and EDS-mapping images are given (Fig. 1b, c and Fig. S1f, g-i). Densely packed particles range from a few to tens of nanometers root on the internal surface of these holes (Fig. 1c), which can be reasonably identified as the Sb component in such composite. Furthermore, HR-TEM image shows distinct lattice spacing of 0.31 nm (Fig. 1d, e), which can be indexed to the (012) lattice plane of highly crystalline Sb. The SAED pattern also confirms this point (Fig. 1e). Meanwhile, HR-TEM only shows lattice of Sb not C, further proving the existence of amorphous C skeleton. Ulteriorly, the distribution of Sb and C elements is demonstrated in Fig. 1f-i. It can be clearly observed that the honeycombed skeleton is constructed by the amorphous C and the Sb nano particles uniformly grow on the holes. In general, such designed honeycombed frame structure of Sb@C is capable of providing more active surface sites, promoting electrolyte diffusion, reducing the distance of Na+ transport and strengthening the structurally mechanical tolerance, thereby relieving volume expansion in long cycles and enhancing the electrochemical performances [27]. It is worth noting that by exerting the pinning effect of NaCl during the synthesis process and building a unique, highly dispersed three-dimensional porous framework, which effectively preventing the aggregation of Sb nanoparticles, buffering the mechanical stress caused by the volume change of antimony during repeated alloy/de-alloy processes, and limiting their structural damage [28], [29]."

                "To elucidate the structural evolution during the excess Na+ plating/stripping process, the SEM images are performed (Fig. 2a). In the discharge process (Fig. 2a I→Ⅴ), the honeycombed sphere gradually transforms from empty regular polygonal holes (Fig. 2a I) to more and more engorged honeycomb (Fig. 2a Ⅲ). It is corresponding to the alloying process (Sb → Na3Sb; Fig. 2b I →Ⅲ) from 2.5 V to 0.01 V, which is the general discharge procedure like all other published studies on Sb anode [30], [31]. Furthermore, to activate more sites for Na-storage of Sb@C electrode, the discharge process is promoted to a more negative voltage (−0.05 V) as displayed in Fig. 2b Ⅲ→Ⅴ. The consequential structural transition presents an eventually stuffed honeycomb (Fig. 2a Ⅴ). Such pioneering operation can effectively achieve extra capacity as high as 1050 mA h/g compared to the normal Sb/C composite anode (< 600 mA h/g) [32]. Furthermore, in the charge process from −0.05 V to 2.5 V (Fig. 2b Ⅴ→VIII), it involves two process of both Na-strip (−0.05 V ∼ 0.01 V) and de-alloying from Na3Sb to Sb (0.01 V ∼ 2.5 V). The corresponding reversible structural evolution are shown in Fig. 2a Ⅴ→ VIII, in which an overall hollow honeycomb is rehabilitative substantially (Fig. 2a VIII), exhibiting excellent structural reversibility during Na alloying/de-alloying and plating/stripping process. Besides, the insignificant morphological change of the honeycombed holes is due to the formation of SEI film on the inner wall [33]. More importantly, from the SEM images in Fig. 2a I → VIII, we can preliminarily perceive that the extra Na capacity is originated from the plating/stripping behavior between Na and carbon skeleton, rather than extra reaction between Na and Sb. Besides, the corresponding CV curves (2.5 ∼ -0.05 V) of Sb@C composite and C anode can display clear oxidation–reduction peaks below 0 V voltage.",
                "It must be mentioned that this Na-plating behavior below 0 V and close to 0 V in Sb@C anode also present in hard carbon anode [2], [34], [35]. They share the same characteristics of discharge–charge curves and internal mechanism. Besides, (Fig. S2a, b), exhibiting significant differences compared to the CV curves during 2.5 ∼ 0.01 V (Fig. S2c). To clarify the change of DNa+ values after such Sb@C of dual mechanism design in ether, GITT curves are performed (Fig. S2d). The values range from 10-10 to 0.9 × 10-6 cm2 s−1. In addition, to further understand the excellent electrochemical behaviors of the Sb@C electrode, CV curves at different scan rates were collected to evaluate the kinetic characteristics for sodium storage. The CV curves show off an almost completely similar shape from 0.2 to 1 mV/s in Fig. S2e. As the scanning rate increases, the shape of the CV curve becomes closer to a rectangle, which is the feature of surface diffusion control. Fig. S2f reveals the values of b obtained according to the following formula [36]:(1)",
                "i = a v b",
                "In the formula, the i indicates current density and v is scan speed, both a and b are constants. Ordinarily, b value close to 0.5 represents battery-type (diffusion control behavior), and near 1 displays capacitor-type (surface diffusion process). For Sb@C, the calculated b values are 0.97 and 0.8 for the anodic peak1, 2 and 0.77 and 0.85 for the cathodic peak 3, 4 at 0.2 ∼ 1 mV/s, indicating a high capacitive contribution behavior. The large b values prove the honeycomb-like Sb@C microspheres are more conducive to Na+ storage occurring on or near the surface.",
                "A quantitative understanding of the ratio of capacitance and diffusion control contributions along with voltage variations requires further grasps of the correlation between current responses and scan speeds. The quantitative relationship can be determined by the following formula [37]:(2)",
                "i ( V ) = k 1 v+ k 2 v 1 / 2Here, the i is current response and V is potential, k1v indicates capacitive effects and k2",
                "v 1 / 2 represents diffusion-controlled process, wherein v is the scan speed, k1 and k2 are parameters, respectively. Through the above formula, the total contribution of diffusion-controlled and surface capacitance behavior to Na+ storage can be intuitively understood under the given voltage. Fig. S2g visually shows the proportional relationship between the diffusion and capacitance control contributions at 1 mV/s sweep speed. It is easy to find that the capacitance behavior is difficult to concentrate near the redox peak, which may be related to the smoothing of the Na+ diffusion process by the redox reaction. As demonstrated in Fig. S2h, the contribution ratio of capacitive behavior in Na+ storage enhances as the scan rate raises, even reaching 89.2 % when the sweep speed reaches 1 mV/s. This amazing pseudocapacitive contribution is extremely helpful for enhancing the high-rate capacity and long-period cycling performance of the electrode.",
                "In order to further elucidate the reaction mechanism, the electrode sheets at different states of discharging-charging (SOD and SOC) have been disassembled and immersed into an ethanol solution containing 1 % phenolphthalein (C20H14O4) as shown in Fig. S6. It can be observed that the solution remains clear and transparent from 2.5 V to 0.01 V, revealing the non-existence of Na metal during Na/Sb alloying process. From 0.01 V to −0.05 V, the purple color of the solution gradually deepens, signifying the more and more sodium metal deposition within the carbon skeleton. The reason is that the reaction between sodium metal and alcohol to form sodium alkoxide to increase the pH value [38]. This experiment fully confirms the reaction mechanism of Na-plating/stripping process just like in Sodium metal batteries (SMBs)."

                "Based on the clarified Na-alloying/de-alloying and plating/stripping mechanism, the Sb@C anodes are tested in both ether and ester electrolytes (Fig. 3). It can exhibit specific capacities of 296.9, 270.4, 258.7,249.5, 233.3, and 259.3 mA h/g at current densities of 50, 200, 500, 1000, 3000, and 500 mA g−1, respectively, in the ether (0.01–2.5 V). In contrast, the performances in ester are inferior (Fig. 3a left). The capacity is stemmed from the alloying reaction (Sb + 3Na ⇋ Na3Sb). Ulteriorly, to stimulate greater Na-storage potential, Sb@C anodes are performed in lower discharge voltage till −0.05 V (Fig. 3a right). It is observed that as high as 20 % (52 mA h/g) to 300 % (787 mA h/g) excess reversible capacities are achieved at 500 mA g−1, which are derived from the Na-plating/strip into/from C skeleton with a minus voltage plateau (−0.005 V, Fig. 3a-c). Similarly, the ether electrolyte is able to assist much better capacity as well as smaller over-potential (13 v.s. 81 mV) than the ester (Fig. 3c). From the Tafel polarization curves (Fig. 3d), the ether is capable of giving larger corrosion current density than the other (7.226 v.s. 0.335 mA cm−2), which is consistent with the results of smaller polarization and even better electrochemical performances. Furthermore, the long-term cycling stability of Sb@C anode is investigated as illustrated in Fig. 3e. It can display ultra-high capacities of 772 mA h/g (200 % excess Na; CEs: 99.8 %) and 1050 mA h/g (300 % excess Na; CEs: 99.9 %) with 99.7 % and 99.9 % retentions during 5000 cycles in ether electrolyte, respectively, much superior than that in the ester electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, such capacity (1050 mA h/g) and corresponding energy density (2228 W h kg−1) for Sb@C anode are unprecedented compared with the latest reported studies (Fig. 3f) [21], [24], [25], [39], [40], [41]. Hence, the as-designed Sb@C electrode material has great potential for application. Besides, to elucidate the contribution of C skeleton, the C anode is tested exclusively during 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V as illustrated in Fig. S3a, b. The C anode can give a working capacity of 735 mA h/g, including negligible capacity of 30 mA h/g above 0.01 V and bulk capacity of 705 mA h/g during 0.01 ∼ -0.05 V (C + Na ⇋ Na9C) (Fig. S3a). Hence, such a result further confirms the unprecedented capacity (1050 mA h/g) comes from the contribution of C skeleton. Besides, the Sb particles grow within C skeleton (Fig. 1a-c) and alloying reaction products (Na3Sb) effectively support the inner surface. As a result, a more suitable C skeleton for Na+ plating is constructed, thereby stimulating more Na+ storage sites with ultra-high excess capacity.",
                "In order to verify the truth behind the different collaborative relationship between ether or ester and Sb@C anode, the ex-situ XPS spectrums of cycled-electrodes are performed (Fig. 4a-h). The peak located at 1071.3 eV can be assigned to the Na 1 s (Na-F and Na-O), while the binding energies of 687.4 eV (P-F) and 683.9 eV (Na-F) are regarded as the F 1 s in both ether (Fig. 4a, c) and ester (Fig. 4b, d, respectively. Obviously, the peak intensities of Na 1 s and F 1 s in ether are far weaker than that in ester, revealing much lower interface side reactions between electrode and electrolyte [42]. It fundamentally explains the higher capacity, pretty well 100 % CEs and fantastic cycling capability in ether. Besides, the binding energies seated at 535.7 and 530.82 eV in two electrolytes belong to Na KLL and Sb 3d [43], respectively (Fig. 4e, f). For the ether (Fig. 4e), the binding energies for O 1 s located at 533.1, 531.9 and 531.3 eV are corresponding to the C-O (RCH2ONa, CMC-Na), C = O (CMC-Na) and C = O (Na2CO3), respectively. They are situated in 533 eV (C-O, ROCO2Na, CMC-Na), 531.9 eV (C = O, ROCO2Na, CMC-Na) and 531.2 eV (C = O, Na2CO3), respectively, for the ester (Fig. 4f). Besides, the C1s comprises three binding energies (289 eV of O-C = O, 286.4 eV of C-O and 284.8 eV of C-C), respectively (Fig. 4g, h). The distinctive peak intensities of organic or inorganic C-O, C = O, O-C = O, C-C are derived from the decomposition of diverse nature ether and ester to form a variety of Na-products [44]. Furthermore, the interfacial barriers (E) for these two electrolytes are evaluated by poikilothermic EIS tests from 10 to 30 ℃. The Ea can be calculated based on the Arrhenius equation [45]:(3)",
                "ln ( T / R EIS ) = - E a / ( R T ) + lnA",
                "where T, REIS, R, and A represent absolute temperature, resistance, standard gas constant, and preexponential constant, respectively. It can be observed that the impedance values vary more mildly in ether than ester (Fig. 4i), suggesting much better temperature adaptability. Moreover, the estimated Ea, SEI (13.47 KJ mol−1) and Ea, ct (17.83 KJ mol−1) in the ether are less than that (40.32 and 65.04 KJ mol−1) in the ester (Fig. 4j, k), respectively. The smaller E values suggest thinner SEI film are conducive for the reaction [46], [47]. Such interface reaction process can be vividly portrayed as Fig. 4l.",
                "To further clarify the structure–activity relationship for outstanding long-term cycling stability of Sb@C anode in ether electrolyte, in-situ XRD patterns are carried out during −0.05 ∼ 2.5 V (Fig. 5a). In the discharge process (2.5 ∼ 0.01 V), the diffraction peaks of (012) and (104) located at 28.7° and 40.07° gradually weakening and finally disappearing, which is due to the alloying reaction (Sb + Na → Na3Sb). Meanwhile, a new diffraction peak situated in 21.6° appears and grows up progressively, which is attributed to the Na3Sb alloy. Furthermore, to stimulate the.",
                "Na-plating into the C skeleton, the discharge process is deepened (0.01 ∼ -0.05 V). It can be observed that the intensity of diffraction peak of Na3Sb keeps almost unchanged in this process. More importantly, a new diffraction peak located at about 33° appear and gradually become stronger that is assigned to the (002) crystal plane of orthorhombic Na metal (PDF#97–0189460) [38], which profoundly confirms the Na-plating mechanism. Besides, in the charge process (2.5 ∼ -0.05 V), the XRD patterns of such Sb@C composite display superb axial symmetry, including the Na-stripping from C skeleton and de-alloying (Na3Sb → Sb + Na) process, indicating excellent electrochemical reversibility. Also, the corresponding counter map vividly displays the above conclusion (Fig. 5a right). Comprehensive analysis based on the morphological evolution in SEM images (Fig. 2a), structural evolution of XRD patterns (Fig. 5a), phenolphthalein colorimetric experiment (Fig. S6), and the electrochemical curve characteristics (Fig. 3b), the reaction mechanism can be clarified to be double-mechanism: alloy/de-alloy and Na- plating/Na-stripping.",
                "To elucidate the evolution of electronic conductivity in both ether and ester electrolytes, in-situ EIS tests are carried out for the 1st and 5000th charge–discharge cycles (2.5 ∼ -0.05 V; Fig. 5b-e). For the 1st cycle (Fig. 5b), in ether electrolyte, the Rct values vary gradually from 6.5 to 2 Ω in the discharge process from 2.5 to 0.01 V (Sb + Na → Na3Sb). Furthermore, the Rct values keep stable about 7.1 Ω from 0.01 to −0.05 V, which illustrate that the more Na-plating into C skeleton. Meanwhile, during Na-plating/Na-stripping process, the sodium metal electrode will inevitably undergo expansion and contraction, which make the interface unstable, the surface easy to break, consume electrolyte and active sodium, and thus increasing the interface impedance (e. g. Rct) of the battery. However, the uneven distribution of the local electric field and concentration of metal ions around the bumpy anode surface, tend to trigger the formation of Na dendrites, which cannot be eliminated [48]. Fortunately, we have successfully filtered electrolyte types and found that ether-based electrolyte has better stability, tolerance, and durability with much smaller Rct value (10 Ω), which is derived from the merits of sodium ions and ether solvent molecules can undergo highly reversible intercalation reactions in the Sb@C anode, effectively constructing a stable electrode/electrolyte interface on its surface. The photos of the 5000 cycled electrodes in half-cells at 500 mA g−1 in ether-based (Fig. S5a) and ester-based (Fig. S5b) electrolytes, as well as their time–voltage curves (Fig. S5c) are provided. It can be observed the glass fiber separator in ether-based electrolyte shows insignificant changes with neat surface in Fig. S5a, revealing the excellent regulatory effect for inhibiting the growth of Na dendrites and the occurrence of interfacial side reactions. In contrast, the 5000 cycled separator in ester-based electrolyte has turned black and electrode sheet starting to fall off (Fig. S5b), which is caused by the structural collapse of Sb@C during repeated Na plating-stripping cycles in ester electrolyte. In addition, during the Na-plating/stripping process, the time–voltage curves (Fig. S5c) also indicate the effects of a robust anode framework and kinetics in ether electrolyte. In the charge process (−0.05 ∼ 0.01 V), the Rct values basically show the same as Na-plating. Thus, the Na-plating and stripping processes are highly stable and reversible with similar reaction kinetics. Subsequently, the Rct values slowly increase from 2.1 Ω to 6.3 Ω from 0.01 to 2.5 V that is corresponding to the de-alloying reaction (Na3Sb → Sb + Na). Obviously, such Rct evolution is highly consistent with the structural evolution process by in-situ XRD analysis (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the Rct maintains the same change rule in the 5000th cycle only with enlarged values (Fig. 5c) in ether electrolyte. Besides, it also shows accordant patterns of change for the ester electrolyte (Fig. 5d, e). Also, the Rct values are always larger than that in ether electrolyte throughout the charge–discharge process. It strongly elucidates the higher ionic conductivity (> 10-3 S cm−1) in ether electrolyte [49], [50]. A robust and stable SEI film can be generated and inhibits further decomposition reaction [51], [52], thereby promoting chemical stability and transport kinetics [53]. Hence, the superior capacity and cycling stability for Sb@C in ether electrolyte is natural and reasonable [45].",
                "In addition, it is provided a more intuitive view of morphological changes of Sb@C by TEM images (Fig. S4a) after 5000 cycles. It can be observed that it neither powdering nor collapse and still maintains a complete spherical shape, which shows excellent structural mechanical resistance. Furthermore, HR-TEM image shows distinct lattice spacing of 0.34 nm (Fig. S4b, c), which still can be indexed to the (012) lattice plane of highly crystalline Sb, and the larger interplanar spacing of (012) than the original (0.31 nm) is attributed to the insertion/extraction of Na+ during 5000 cycles. The SAED patterns also confirm this point (Fig. S4d). Ulteriorly, Fig. S4e-i show the distribution of elements in the Sb@C electrode after 5000 cycles. It can be clearly observed every element is still uniformly and discretely distributed in the Sb@C electrode, which maintains the uniformity of the active substances involved in the reaction, thereby improving reaction efficiency.",
                "Moreover, in order to study interface interactions between Sb, C, and Na, a model of single-layer graphene substrate (Fig. 6a) is constructed for theoretical calculations, and based on this substrate, Na, Sb, and Na were loaded separately to obtain parameters like binding energy (Fig. 6b, c) and charge distribution (Fig. 6d-f) at the interface. As displayed in Fig. 6b, c, the simulated binding energy of Na, NaSb atoms on graphene substrate is − 1.02 and − 2.19 eV, respectively. More negative binding energy means a lower nucleation barrier, indicating that the Sb@C framework possesses a stronger affinity to facilitate the preferential nucleation of Na+ [54]. The charge differential density results (Fig. 6d-f) illustrate the Na@Sb@C (Fig. 6f) framework has larger charge transfer number than Sb@C and Na@C, which explains that the local current density on Sb@C surface can be greatly reduced by controlling the electric field distribution. Besides, this indicates that Sb@C during Na-plating can further decrease the local current density, thus endowing the Sb@C framework with excellent high current density performance. To more in-depth clarify the electronic structure of sodium, antimony and carbon composite, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are carried out (Fig. 6g-j). Firstly, the density of states (DOS) signal between the peaks on both sides of the Fermi level is always visible. However, there is a significant band gap at the Fermi level of individual carbon materials (Fig. 6g), then after bring in Sb (Fig. 6h), Na (Fig. 6i), Sb@Na (Fig. 6j), the band gap at the Fermi level disappears, and the DOS intensity of Na@Sb@C is significantly higher than that of Na@C, which indicates that drawing into Sb can enhance carbon composite atomic bonding ability and metallicity, thereby promoting the faster ion diffusion and the conductivity of Sb@C is significantly improved. Diffusion dynamics calculation based on the model is shown in Fig. 6k, the results (Fig. 6l) indicate that Na@Sb@C (0.2943 eV) possesses a lower diffusion energy barrier than Na@C (0.3212 eV), which shows Na@Sb@C holds faster ion diffusion rate. Consequently, Sb atoms growing on the carbon skeleton is conducive to the enhancement of working capacity, cycling, and rate capabilities.",
                "To examine the practicality of the as-designed Sb@C anode, Na3V2(PO4)3/C//Sb@C (NVP//Sb@C) full-cells are assembled as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a gives the working diagram of such full-cell. The mass ratio of negative to positive (N/P ratio) was controlled as 1:10 in the Na3V2(PO4)3/C//Sb@C (NVP//Sb@C) full-cell. Generally, the upper voltage of Na3V2(PO4)3//Sb full-cell is controlled below 3.5 V in other studies [41], [55]. We intentionally increased the upper cut-off voltage of the NVP//Sb@C full-cell to 3.6 V to activate the capacity of Na-plating/Na-stripping. Fortunately, the capacity of NVP//Sb@C full-cell based on only cathode (NVP) is 110 mA h/g as given in Fig. 7c, while the capacity of NVP//Sb@C full-cell is 918 mA h/g based on only anode (Sb@C) as illustrated in Fig. 7e. Both the cathode (NVP) and anode (Sb@C) have contributed a specific capacity close to their theoretical specific capacities (117 and 1050 mA h/g). Hence, Sb@C anode can display the same electrochemical behavior and specific capacity in both half-cell and full-cell. In detail, NVP//Sb@C full-cells can deliver reversible capacities of 117, 113, 108, 98, and 86 mA h/g at current densities of 50, 200, 500, 1000, and 3000 mA g−1 (Fig. 7b, c), respectively. It is also capable of providing a superior cycling stability (500 mA g−1@110 mA h/g@500 cycles@98.6 % retention@99.6 % average CE) based on cathode calculation. Besides, if calculating reversible capacity based on anode at a current density of 50, 200, 500, 1000, and 3000 mA g−1, their capacity can reach 995, 940, 918, 835, 741 mA h/g (Fig. 7d, e). Such capacity (995 mA h/g) and corresponding energy density (1086 W h kg−1) for Sb@C anode are unprecedented compared with the latest reported studies (Fig. 7f) [20], [23], [24], [33], which displays great practical application prospects in high energy density SIBs. Besides, we also evaluated the relationship between the capacity of anode electrode and the capacity of full-cell as shown in Fig. S7. Obviously, the capacity of full-cell gradually increases along with the increase of the capacity of anode according to the change in slope of the curve. Especially within this capacity range (300–1500 mA h/g), the slope displays great changes, indicating a significant impact. Hence, the well-designed high-capacity Sb@C anode (1050 mA h/g) with extremely stable cycling performance and high coulombic efficiency is very practical and meaningful in terms of improving the capacity and energy density of full-cells."

                "In conclusion, Sb@C composite anode is prepared with a morphology of honeycombed spherical particle. Benefited from the two-stage reaction mechanism (Sb + 3Na ⇋ Na3Sb during 2.5 ∼ 0.01 V and C + 9Na ⇋ Na9C during 0.01 ∼ -0.05 V), it is able to exhibit an unparalleled charge–discharge capacity (1050 mA h/g) and reliable long-term cycling life (99.9 % capacity retention; 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V). Moreover, in-situ XRD and EIS tests are performed to profoundly clarify the excess Na-storage mechanism and evolution of electron transfer dynamics in both ether and ester electrolytes during 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V, respectively. Furthermore, we deeply study the interfacial interactions between antimony and carbon materials, explained 3D honeycombed carbon structure improves reaction kinetics and cycling stability and helped understand the reasons behind the improved conductivity and electrochemical performance of the material by theoretical calculation such as interface theory, diffusion kinetics and electronic structure calculations. The well-assembled NVP//Sb@C full-cell also hold superior electrochemical performances, such as cycling stability (98.6 %) and energy density (2228 W h kg−1). Thus, such ingenious idea can provide a unique perspective for designing electrode materials for high-performance SIBs."
