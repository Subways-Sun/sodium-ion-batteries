                "O3-type layered transition metal oxide NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) has the advantages of high theoretical specific capacity, simple synthesis method and low cost, which is an ideal cathode material for sodium ion batteries. However, because of its unstable lamellar structure and poor Na+ diffusion channels, the cycle performance and rate performance of NFM electrode materials are poor. In this work, Ca0.05Na0.9Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (Ca-NFM) electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance were prepared by the modification strategy of Ca2+ doping to replace part of Na+. Calculations show that Ca2+ successfully occupies part of the Na sites, which leads to an increase in the Na layer thickness and thus enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics. Tests on Ca-NFM electrodes in the charged state show that the doped non-electrochemically active Ca2+ is firmly stabilized in the Na layer and supports the laminar body structure, which in turn enhances the cycling performance of the material. The capacity retention of Ca-NFM electrode with 200 cycles at 1 C was 87.65%, while the capacity retention of NFM electrode under the same conditions was only 66.73%. The Ca-NFM electrode also performs significantly better than the NFM electrode in terms of rate performance. It has been shown that Ca doping also increases the upper limit of the voltage window of the electrode, which provides a significant capacity advantage while maintaining excellent cycling performance.",

                "For the long-term development of human society, the use of recyclable green energy has become urgent. Wind, water, geothermal and solar energy are widely available and recyclable green energy sources, but these energy sources are unevenly distributed geographically and are affected by environmental factors, so they usually do not maintain a stable power generation status, thus affecting their large-scale use , , , , , . In order to realize the full utilization of green energy, there is an urgent need to find a high-efficiency, high-conversion, low-cost energy storage device. As one of the electrochemical energy storage devices, sodium ion batteries have received a lot of attention from all walks of life for their advantages of high energy density, low cost and safety and stability , , , . The electrochemical performance of the cathode material greatly affects the performance level of the whole battery, so it is especially important to synthesize a cathode material with excellent performance. Layered transition metal oxides NaxTMO2 (TM = Ni, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, etc.) are widely reported as one of the cathode materials for sodium ion batteries with high specific capacity and voltage plateau and simple synthesis method , , , . In general, the layered transition metal oxides can be classified into P-type and O-type according to the different morphology of the arrangement and stacking of the transition metal layers and Na layers in the C-axis direction. Prepresents the spatial environment occupied by Na+ as tri-prism, while O represents the spatial environment occupied by Na+ as octahedral , , , , . The layer spacing of P-type materials is generally larger, and the diffusion of Na+ is more convenient, and their rate performance and cycling performance are better, but because they are in a sodium-poor state, the actual available Na content in P-type materials is less, especially when the use environment is a full cell, its counter electrode is hard carbon, and a part of Na+ will be consumed when forming SEI film, resulting in the actual available Na+ is even less , , . On the contrary, O-type materials are in high sodium stoichiometry ratio, the actual available Na+ is much higher than that of P-type materials, and the synthesis is more convenient. However, because of its higher Na content, there will be more Na+ release and embedding during the actual charging and discharging process, resulting in a more affected layer structure and more complicated phase transition, so the cycle life is relatively short , , , .",
                "The current modification strategies for layered transition metal oxide cathode materials usually include surface modification and metal ion doping , . Mingzhe Leng et al. . coated a layer of MgO film on the surface of NaNi0.45Mn0.3Ti0.2Zr0.05O2 electrode by RF magnetron sputtering, thus improving the rate performance and cycling performance of the electrode material. In order to improve the electrochemical stability of P2-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 electrode material, Hyeongwoo Kim et al. . coated the surface of the material with MgNiO metal oxide coating, which suppressed the undesirable side reactions and still had a capacity of 37.41 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles at 5 C. Na Li et al. . in situ coated a layer of Na2SiO3 compound on the surface of NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 material, which can effectively reduce the polarization and suppress the voltage drop, thus enhancing the electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity of their coated modified material is 28.02% higher than that of the original material after 50 cycles. Ma et al. . prepared Na1−xCax/2NFM samples by solid-phase synthesis to enhance the cyclic stability of the original material. Lee et al. . prepared NaMg0.05[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]0.95O2 samples by co-precipitation and solid-state synthesis, which doped Mg2+ into the transition metal layer, enhanced the structural stability of the material, and improved the electrochemical properties. Zhou et al. . prepared NaNi0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 electrode material by ball milling solid-phase synthesis method, which showed good performance with 77% capacity retention after 100 cycles.",
                "To solve the problems of poor cycling performance and poor rate performance of O3-type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 materials, this work prepared Ca0.05Na0.9Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance by the modification strategy of Ca2+ doping to replace part of Na+. Firstly, the XRD refinement results show that the replacement of some Na+ by Ca2+ with larger particle size can widen the diffusion channel of Na+, which makes Na+ diffusion easier and thus enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics. Secondly, the XPS spectra of Na1s and Ca2p show that Na+ is continuously delocalized with the charging process, while Ca2+ does not migrate, proving that Ca2+ is non-electrochemically active, which can be firmly stabilized among the Na layers and plays a crucial role in supporting the layered structure and maintaining the stability of the crystal structure."

                "In order to verify the effect of different amounts of Ca dopant on the performance of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 original materials, we conducted electrochemical performance tests on four electrode materials. As shown in Fig. S1, this is the cycling performance graph of several samples at 1 C. It can be seen that the capacity retention of the unmodified pristine material NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is only 66.73% after 200 cycling cycles. The modified materials with the introduction of Ca dopant show better cycling performance, among which Ca0.05Na0.9N1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 shows the best performance with a capacity retention rate of 87.65%. In the following we will discuss two electrode materials, NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) and Ca0.05Na0.9N1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (Ca-NFM).",
                "As shown in Fig. 1a, the X-ray diffraction analysis tests of the two synthesized materials were compared, and it was found that the diffraction peaks of the two materials corresponded highly, and according to the standard card (PDF# 88–0720), both samples were attributed to the R-3 m space group of the α-NaFeO2 structure, and the diffraction peaks corresponded to the O3 single-phase structure , indicating that the doping of trace Ca2+ had no destructive effect on the crystal structure of NFM. The sharp main peaks of both materials represent the high crystallinity of the materials, in addition, no other obvious heterogeneous phase peaks were observed in the figure. As shown in Fig. 1b, we performed XRD refinement calculations on the material to derive the cell parameters before and after doping by Ca, and the detailed cell parameters are shown in Table S1. Inside the crystal of the layered material, the transition metal oxide layer and the Na layer are usually arranged alternately along the C-axis cycle , while we can learn from the results that the C-axis of the cell of the Ca-NFM material is longer, which is obviously due to the successful doping of Ca2+ at the Na site, which makes the Na layer thickness increase. At the same time, the O-Na-O length increases to 3.2508 Å. This result facilitates Na+ delocalization and embedding, which makes Na+ diffusion easy and thus enhances the electrochemical properties of the material. Table S2 shows the ratios of the elements analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry testing (ICP-OES), and the results tested are in accordance with the expected and theoretical molecular formulae. Table S2 shows the ratios of the elements analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry testing (ICP-OES), and the results tested are in accordance with the expected and theoretical chemical formulae. Fig. 1c shows the process of Ca-doping modification of the material. On the left side is the O3-type layered crystal structure of NFM, after a small amount of Ca2+ doping, some of the Na sites are occupied by Ca2+, forming a Na-Ca mixed layer, in which Ca2+ with a larger ionic radius plays a supporting role, thus stabilizing the layered structure of the material and making the crystal structure of the material less prone to collapse during a long cycle, thus improving the cycling performance of NFM.",
                "As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b, the SEM images of NFM and Ca-NFM, respectively, can be seen that the two materials are very close in appearance and morphology, both of which are amorphous small lamellar particle structures with particle sizes roughly distributed from 150 to 400 nm and belong to single crystal particles. The TEM images and HRTEM images of Ca-NFM are shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, and it is obvious to see the consistent and ordered lattice stripes, which represent its good crystallinity. And the stripe spacing is 0.541 nm, which corresponds to the (003) crystal plane of the crystal. Fig. 2e shows the EDS images of Ca-NFM material, and it can be seen that Na, Ca and other elements are uniformly distributed inside the material particles, and the composition of each chemical element in the material is uniformly distributed, indicating that Ca2+ is successfully doped into the NFM material.",
                "In order to determine the chemical valence state of each element in the material, we used XPS to test and characterize it. Fig. 3 shows the XPS test results of the Ca-NFM material. Fig. 3a shows the energy spectrum of Ca 2p, with the electron binding energies of the two main peaks located at 346.3 eV and 349.8 eV, corresponding to Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2, respectively, proving that the chemical valence of the Ca element successfully doped in the material is positive divalent . Fig. 3b corresponds to the electron energy spectrum of Ni 2p, where the electron binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 is 854.6 eV and that of Ni 2p1/2 is 872.1 eV, where the two peaks located at 860.4 eV and 877.8 eV are satellite peaks, which proves that the valence state of Ni element in Ca-NFM material is positive divalent . The electronic energy spectrum of Fe 2p is shown in Fig. 3c. The two main peaks located at 710.6 eV and 724.3 eV electron binding energy correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, while the other two peaks are satellite peaks . Fig. 3d shows the electronic energy spectrum of Mn 2p . From the test results, it is clear that the material contains both Mn3+ and Mn4+. The main peak of Mn 2p3/2 can be decomposed into two peaks, located at 640.4 eV and 641.8 eV, respectively. The main Mn 2p1/2 peak can also be split into two sub-peaks located at 652.1 eV and 653.5 eV, respectively. The proportions of Mn3+ and Mn4+ were analyzed according to the Gaussian integral fitting method, where the proportion of Mn3+ was 36.89% and the proportion of Mn4+ was 63.11%.",
                "In order to investigate the effect of Ca-doped Na sites on the electrochemical performance of NFM electrode materials, a series of electrochemical tests were conducted to compare the two materials, NFM and Ca-NFM, as shown in Fig. 4, and the voltage windows for all tests in this figure are 2.0–4.0 V. As shown in Fig. 4a, the first lap charge/discharge curves of NFM and Ca-NFM at 0.1 C (13 mA g−1) show similar trends for both curves. the capacity of NFM is slightly higher than Ca-NFM with a discharge capacity of 125.35mAh g−1, while the discharge capacity of Ca-NFM is 117.10mAh g−1. This occurs because Ca2+ in Ca-NFM occupies part of the Na-site, resulting in fewer available Na vacancies, leaving less effective Na+ actually involved in the reaction and thus a slight reduction in capacity, which is exactly what we expected. Fig. 4b shows the CV curves for NFM and Ca-NFM. It can be seen that both materials correspond to two pairs of redox peaks, where the redox peaks located in the low voltage region correspond to the plateau region in the charge/discharge curve, which corresponds to the electrode material in the sodium-rich state, and the other pair of redox peaks located in the high voltage region correspond to the slope region in the charge/discharge curve, which corresponds to the electrode in the sodium-poor state. Fig. 4c shows the rate performance of the two materials. The initial lap capacities of NFM at 0.1 C,0.2 C,0.5 C,1 C,2 C, 5 C are 125.35 mAh g−1, 117.86 mAh g−1, 107.51 mAh g−1, 98.59 mAh g−1, 87.42 mAh g−1, 66.39 mAh g−1. The initial lap capacities of Ca-NFM at 0.1 C,0.2 C,0.5 C,1 C. 2 C, and 5 C are 117.04 mAh g−1, 113.86 mAh g−1, 108.89 mAh g−1, 102.21 mAh g−1,92.44 mAh g−1, and 74.27 mAh g−1, respectively. Although the capacity of the NFM is slightly higher than that of the Ca-NFM at 0.1 C, the capacity advantage of the Ca-NFM gradually becomes apparent as the current continues to increase. This is because Ca2+ widens the Na layer spacing, making it easier to delocalize and embed Na+ , thus enhancing the diffusion of Na+, which is consistent with previous findings. In order to explore the cycling performance of both materials, a constant current charge/discharge cycle of 200 laps at 1 C (1 C = 130 mA g−1) was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4d, the initial capacity of the NFM was 106.24 mAh g−1, slightly higher than that of the Ca-NFM at 104.40 mAh g−1, but as the cycle progressed, it could be seen that the capacity decay trend of the Ca-NFM was significantly weaker than that of the NFM. The capacity retention of the NFM electrode after 200 cycles was 66.73%, while the Ca-NFM electrode had a capacity retention of 87.65% under the same conditions. The Ca doping strategy improved the capacity retention of the NFM material by more than 20.03%. Also, the capacity of Ca-NFM after cycling is 1.29 times higher than that of NFM. Compared to NFM, Ca-NFM exhibits extremely good cycling stability performance. As shown in Fig. S2, the capacity retention of Ca-NFM is still 30% higher than that of the NFM even after 500 long cycles. Fig. 4e and Fig. 4f show the charging and discharging curves of NFM and Ca-NFM at 1 C with different cycle laps, respectively. It can be seen that the stability of Ca-NFM electrode is significantly better than that of NFM, and the polarization of Ca-NFM is also significantly lower than that of NFM. From the results, the effect of Ca2+ doping on the cycling performance enhancement is obvious, mainly because Ca2+ with a large ionic radius plays the role of supporting the layered structure, thus stabilizing the main framework and thus improving the cycling stability performance of the electrode material. In addition, Ca doping increases the upper limit of the test voltage window of the NFM electrode. As shown in Fig. S3, we widen the test voltage window of Ca-NFM electrode to 2.0–4.2 V, and we can see that the specific capacity of Ca-NFM electrode is still 87.39mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 C, and its capacity retention rate is 76.59%, and the cycling performance of Ca-NFM is still substantially better than that of NFM electrode. Moreover, the capacity of Ca-NFM was higher than that of NFM during the whole cycle test, and the Ca-doped Ca-NFM electrode showed a significant capacity advantage while maintaining excellent cycle performance.",
                "To understand the effect of Ca doping on the Na+ diffusion kinetics of NFM, we performed EIS impedance test analysis and Na+ diffusion coefficient calculation for NFM and Ca-NFM materials, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, the Nyquist curves of both NFM and Ca-NFM samples have semicircular curves in the high frequency band and ray regions in the low frequency band. The semicircular curve in the high frequency band, which represents the interfacial charge transfer impedance (Rct) between the electrode material and the electrolyte, and the ray in the low frequency region, which represents the Warburg impedance (Zw) , , are associated with the Na+ diffusion in the NFM and Ca-NFM active materials . Fig. 5b shows the linear relationship between",
                "Z ′ and ω−1/2, and the equations in the figure represent their linear relationship. The specific calculation results are shown in Table S3, and it can be seen that the Rct of NFM and Ca-NFM are 951.22 Ω and 384.64 Ω, respectively, which represents that Ca-NFM possesses a smaller degree of polarization and confirms that it has a better electrochemical performance. In addition, the DNa+ diffusion coefficient of Ca-NFM was calculated to be 1.94 × 10–11 cm2·s−1, while that of NFM was 1.05 × 10–11 cm2·s−1, confirming that Ca-NFM possesses better Na+ diffusion ability , . This is because the doping of Ca2+ increases the thickness of the Na layer, and thus the Na+ detachment/embedding becomes easier, so Ca-NFM has better Na+ diffusion performance and better rate performance.",
                "In order to investigate whether the doped Ca2+ undergoes delocalization/embedding behavior, we performed XPS tests on the Ca-NFM electrode (4.0 V) and compared it with the brand new Ca-NFM electrode, and the results are shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, corresponding to the XPS spectra of Na1s and Ca2p. The Na1s peak intensity of the uncharged Ca-NFM electrode was significantly higher than that of the charged Ca-NFM electrode (4.0 V), which was due to the fact that during the charging process, Na+ was taken off from the Ca-NFM electrode and the Na+ content in it was significantly reduced, so the Na1s peak intensity was substantially lower. For the XPS spectra of Ca2p, the intensity did not change significantly either at the uncharged electrode or at the electrode in the charged state (4.0 V), so its Ca2+ content was basically unchanged, and this result can confirm that Ca2+ is unable to undergo deaccession and embedding during the charging process, i.e., the doped Ca2+ is non-electrochemically active , . Therefore, we can judge that the doped Ca2+ is firmly stabilized in the Na layer and plays the role of supporting the layered structure to maintain the stability of the Ca-NFM crystal structure, which in turn improves the electrochemical properties of the material.",
                "In order to investigate the structural changes and reversibility of the electrode during charging and discharging, a series of ex-situ XRD tests were performed, as shown in Fig. S4, which is the XRD pattern of the Ca-NFM electrode at different voltage states during the first cycle, where the individual diffraction peaks change with charge at different voltage states. It can be seen that the electrode in the initial state corresponds to the R-3 m space group of the hexagonal layered structure of phase O3. Subsequent to charging to 3.5 V, it can be seen that the (003) peak is shifted to a lower angle, while the peaks (101) and (012) are shifted to a higher angle, and the electrode in this state corresponds to the P3 phase. As charging proceeds, the voltage state rises to 4.0 V, and the peaks (003), (101) and (012) are shifted accordingly, at which point the P3 phase corresponding to the hexagon , . It means that the corresponding phase change state during charging is O3-P3 change. The discharge state is the exact opposite of the charging state, where each diffraction peak gradually returns to the O3 phase from the P3 phase as the voltage decreases. The phase transition process of the Ca-NFM electrode possesses a very high reversibility as shown in the ex-situ XRD patterns. In order to verify whether the electrode could maintain the structure of its phase after cycling, we removed the Ca-NFM electrode after 200 cycles under 1 C and subsequently tested the XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. S5. It can be seen that the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ca-NFM after cycling are obvious and no heterogeneous phase is generated, indicating that the Ca-NFM electrode possesses good stability.",
                "In addition, compared with other currently reported layered transition metal oxide cathode materials (Table S4), the Ca-NFM electrode material prepared in this work has excellent cycling performance and good rate performance, which is an extremely valuable sodium ion cathode material for application."

It was also calculated that Ca-NFM possessed a higher Na+ diffusion coefficient. XPS tests of Ca-NFM electrodes in the charged state show that the doped Ca2+ is non-electrochemically active and Ca2+ supports the layered body structure, so enhancing the cycling stability of the material.

The capacity of Ca-NFM is slightly lower than that of NFM at low rate, but above 0.5 C, its capacity is significantly higher than that of NFM, demonstrating the superior rate performance advantage of Ca-NFM. Tests have shown that Ca doping can also increase the upper limit of the test voltage window for NFM electrodes, which can show significant capacity advantages while maintaining excellent cycling performance. In conclusion, the Ca-NFM electrode materials prepared by Ca doping possess a more stable layered structure and better Na+ diffusion kinetics, which in turn exhibit better electrochemical performance.
