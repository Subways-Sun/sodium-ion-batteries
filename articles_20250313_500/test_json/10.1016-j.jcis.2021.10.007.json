                "Sodium vanadium phosphate [Na3V2(PO4)3] with high voltage platform, low cost and environment friendliness has been considered as one of the most promising candidates as cathodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. However, the sodium storage property of Na3V2(PO4)3 is limited because of its low electronic conductivity and poor kinetic performance. Herein, MoO42−-doped Na(3+2x)V2(PO4)(3-x)MoO4(x) [NVP-MoO4 (x), x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15] have been developed and prepared by a feasible solid-state reaction. The optimal NVP-MoO4 (0.10) delivers a high initial capacity of 108.9 mA h g−1 and presents an excellent capacity retention of 91.5% at 1 C after 150 cycles. In addition, the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) shows a good rate capability, delivering a relatively high capacity of 84.2 mA h g−1 at 50 C. The results of sodium storage measurement and density of states calculation indicate that MoO42− doping can significantly enhance the structural stability, promote the kinetics behavior and boost the electronic conductivity of the materials. In-situ XRD test reveals that the electrochemical reaction of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) exhibits a highly reversible phase transition process. This work provides a new insight for the design of advanced cathodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries by the strategy of unique anion doping."

                "With the successful commercialization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), green transportation and portable electronic devices are gradually increasing in daily life [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. However, lithium resources are faced with the bottlenecks of high cost, less reserves and uneven distribution, which hinder their larger-scale application in the future [7]. Sodium and lithium belong to the same main group, which have similar chemical and physical properties. Therefore, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the best alternatives to LIBs due to abundant and inexpensive sodium resources [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Nevertheless, the ionic radius of Na+ is larger than that of Li+, leading to a sluggish reaction kinetics behavior in electrochemical reaction process [13]. Besides, the large radius of Na+ makes cathode materials more prone to volume expansion and structural collapse in sodium storage process, which greatly restricts the rate capability and cycling stability of SIBs [14].",
                "In recent years, the development of advanced cathode materials with high electronic conductivity and excellent structural stability for high-performance SIBs has gained considerable attention, such as layered transition metal oxides [NaxMO2 (M = Co, Ni, Mn, etc.) [15], [16], [17], Prussian blue analogues NaxM’y[M”(CN)6]z·nH2O [M’(M”) = Fe, Cu, Mn, etc.] [18], [19], and polyanionic compounds [Na3Mx(XO4)3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, V, etc.) (X = B, P, Si, Mo, etc.)] [3], [8], [20], [21], [22]. Among the above candidates, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is particularly prospective and has been extensively investigated due to its typical NASCION structure, low cost and fast charge/discharge capability. In addition, NVP exhibits a high voltage platform (∼3.4 V) with a theoretical specific capacity of 117.6 mA h g−1 [23], [24], [25]. Nevertheless, the rate capability and cycling stability of NVP are greatly hampered by the intrinsic low electronic conductivity of the materials and large radius of Na+ [26]. The modification strategies of carbon coating and ion doping (metal ions or anions) have been generally used to improve the electrochemical performance of NVP. Carbon coating can effectively enhance the surface electrical conductivity of the materials [27], [28]. For ion doping, the partial substitution at sodium and/or vanadium sites can improve the electronic conductivity of NVP and thus promote the electrochemical performance of the materials. Most of investigations on NVP materials with metal ion doping focus on the substitution of Na and/or vanadium sites, such as Na3V(2-x)Mgx(PO4)3 [29], Na3V(2-x)Crx(PO4)3 [30], Na(3-x)KxV(2-y)Mgy(PO4)3 [31], and so on.",
                "So far, to our knowledge, there are few reports for nonmetal substitution of NVP at the inactive anion (PO43−) sites, except for some cases on Na3V2P3–xBxO12 [32], and Na3+xV2(PO4)3−x(SiO4)x [33], [34]. However, these few investigations have proved that the partial replacements at the inactive anion (PO43−) sites can modulate and boost the electrochemical characteristics of the materials without the reduction, even promote theoretical capacity of the materials [34]. At present, the anionic groups of BO33− [32], SO42− [35], and SiO44− [33], [34] have been utilized to replace PO43− in NVP materials. It is noted that the ionic structure of BO33− is triangle, while the other two are tetrahedron, meaning that the replacement of isostructural SO42− or SiO44− for PO43− may be more superior than BO33− owing to the structural similarity. In fact, SiO44− or SO42− modified NVP materials do exhibit better electrochemical properties than BO33−-doped NVP [32], [33], [34], [35]. On the other hand, MoO42− is tetrahedral, which is similar to PO43−. Therefore, it can be reasonably anticipated that MoO42− may partially replace PO43− at PO43− site to adjust the crystal structure of NVP and improve its sodium storage performance. To our knowledge, there are no reports on MoO42−-doped NVP.",
                "Herein, MoO42−-doped NVP materials have been developed by the partial substitution of MoO42− for PO43− and utilized as advanced cathodes for SIBs. A series of Na(3+2x)V2(PO4)(3-x)MoO4(x) [NVP-MoO4 (x), x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15] samples have been prepared by a simple high-temperature solid-state reaction. The MoO42−-doped NVP with enhanced electronic conductivity can facilitate Na+ diffusion and raise the sodium storage performance. As a result, the as-prepared NVP-MoO4 (0.10) exhibits superior electrochemical performance, delivering the awesome initial specific capacity of 108.9 mA h g−1 (1 C) and relatively high capacity of 84.2 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 50 C, and exhibiting excellent cycling stability even at 30 C for 2000 cycles."

                "A simple high-temperature solid-state reaction was employed to synthesize Na(3+2x)V2(PO4)(3-x)MoO4(x) [NVP-MoO4 (x), x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15]. To investigate the effect of MoO42− doping on the electrochemical performance of the NVP, the NVP-MoO4 (x) with various doping amounts were prepared in this work (more details of synthetic procedure can be found in Supporting Information). Fig. 1a presents the crystal structure of the NVP with the R-3c space group and depicts the graphical representation of MoO42− doping in the lattices of the NVP. The open three-dimensional structure and components of the NVP are well matched. [VO6] octahedron and [PO4] tetrahedron form a basic unit of V2(PO4)3 via sharing oxygen atoms, as exhibited in Fig. 1a. And each unit can generate a large number of internal gaps, which facilitates the storage of sodium ions [36]. Because of the difference in the oxygen environments, there are two different kinds of Na+ (Na1, Na2) in the lattice, and the electrochemical activity of Na2 is higher than that of Na1 owing to the much weaker bonding of Na2 than Na1 [25].",
                "Fig. 1b displays the XRD patterns of the NVP-MoO4 (x) (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15). All NVP-MoO4 (x) present sharp and similar diffraction peaks, which can be indexed to a typical NASICON (JCPDS No.53–0018) structure with R-3c space group. Obviously, the crystal structure of the NVP maintains well after MoO42− doping. Fig. S1 exhibits the Rietveld refinements of the NVP-MoO4 (x) based on the XRD data in Fig. 1b, while the corresponding crystal cell parameters and refinement factors are listed in Table S1. According to the refinements results, the refinement factors of χ2, Rwp and Rp are not more than 3.045, 7.52% and 5.81%, respectively, indicating that the observed results are in good agreement with the calculated patterns. Tables S2 and S3 display the crystallographic data of the NVP and the proportion of P in the NVP-MoO4 (0.10), respectively. With the increase of the doping amount of MoO42−, the lattice parameters a and c of the NVP-MoO4 (x) change slightly, which means that MoO42− has successfully entered into the lattices of the NVP.",
                "The Raman spectra of the as-prepared NVP-MoO4 (x) is exhibited in Fig. 1c. There are two characteristic peaks in the range of 1100–2000 cm−1. The signal peak sited at 1357 cm−1 is ascribed to D band, while the another signal situated at 1598 cm−1 is assigned to G band of carbon [27]. The intensity ratios of D-band and G-band (ID/IG) can indicate the crystallinity of carbon materials. The ratios of ID/IG are 1.01, 1.02, 1.01 and 1.06 for the NVP-MoO4 (0), the NVP-MoO4 (0.05), the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.15), respectively. All the ratios of ID/IG are all greater than 1, demonstrating the presence of disorder carbon in the NVP-MoO4 (x), which is beneficial to enhance the electronic conductivity [29], [13], [37]. Moreover, the resistivity of the NVP-MoO4 (x) is collected by four-probe test, and the results are displayed in Fig. S2. It can be observed that the NVP-MoO4(0.10) (14.09 Ω/cm) presents the optimal electronic conductivity, which is superior to the NVP-MoO4 (0) (19.45 Ω/cm), the NVP-MoO4 (0.05) (16.44 Ω/cm) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.15) (31.74 Ω/cm).",
                "Fig. 2a-2d exhibit the SEM images of the NVP-MoO4 (x). From Fig. 2a, the NVP-MoO4 (0) presents irregular morphology with an average size of 100–200 nm. From Fig. 2b-2d, the particle sizes of the NVP-MoO4 (x) slightly increase after the doping of MoO42−. The TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) are shown in Fig. 2e-2f. The distinct lattice finger (0.283 nm) is observed, corresponding to the (2 1 1) crystal plane of the material. Moreover, the surface of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) is covered with an amorphous carbon layer (∼0.846 nm). This carbon layer may boost the electron conductivity of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) and thus improve electrochemical performance. The results of HRTEM and SEAD indicate that the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) material presents good crystal characteristics. The element mapping images exhibit that the elements of sodium (Na), phosphorus (P), vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), carbon (C), and oxygen (O) are homogeneously distributed in the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) (Figs. 2g and S3).",
                "XPS measurement is employed to confirm surface chemical constituents and bonds of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10). The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S4) indicates the existence of Na, P, V, Mo, C and O, which is in accord with the element mapping of the material (Fig. 2g). In the C 1s spectra, the signal peak situated at 284.8 eV is attributed to CC bond, while the other peaks located at 285.8 and 289.0 eV are assigned to CO and CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 3a) [38]. The O 1s spectra is observed and can be fitted into four peaks, of which two peaks situated at 531.43 and 532.37 eV are attributed to OP and OC and another two characteristic peaks at 533.03 and 534.43 eV are ascribed to oxygen vacancies and adsorbed H2O, respectively [39]. The V 2p spectra exhibits two signal peaks at 516.35 and 523.26 eV, which can be assigned to the signals of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 3c). It is shown that the V of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) mainly exists in the form of trivalence [40]. The XPS spectrum of Mo 3d in Fig. 3d displays two peaks (228.69 and 231.85 eV), corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d1/2, respectively, illustrating the presence of Mo4+ in the NVP-MoO4 (0.10). In addition, the other characteristic peaks at 229.32, 232.99 and 236.00 eV are assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d1/2, respectively, illustrating the presence of Mo5+ and Mo6+ [41], [42], [43]. Clearly, Mo element exists in the form of mixed valence states.",
                "Fig. 4 displays the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared NVP-MoO4 (x). The first charging and discharging profiles of the NVP-MoO4 (x) at a low current density of 1 C (1 C = 117 mA g−1) under the voltage window of 2.4–4.3 V (vs Na+/Na) are exhibited in Fig. 4a. Among them, the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) presents the highest reversible capacity of 108.9 mA h g−1 (1 C). As a contrast, the discharge specific capacities of the NVP-MoO4 (0), the NVP-MoO4 (0.05) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.15) in the first cycle are 94.3, 90.0 and 81.9 mA h g−1, respectively. According to the charging and discharging profiles, the voltage platform is obvious at ∼ 3.4 V, which can be assigned to the redox reaction of V3+/V4+ [44]. Obviously, the specific discharge capacity of the material can be effectively enhanced by the introduction of MoO42−. Fig. 4b exhibits the cycling stability of the NVP-MoO4 (x). The material of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) delivers the high specific capacity of 99.6 mA h g−1 at 1 C after 150 cycles and shows the good capacity retention. Nevertheless, the reversible capacities of the NVP-MoO4 (0), the NVP-MoO4 (0.05) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.15) are 61.1, 81.6, and 81.9 mA h g−1 at 1C after 150 cycles, respectively. The charge/discharge curves of the first five cycles for the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) at 1 C are displayed in Fig. 4c. They almost completely overlap, indicating excellent cycling stability.",
                "Figs. 4d and S5 exhibit the rate capability of the NVP-MoO4 (x). Clearly, the rate capability of the NVP-MoO4 (x) have been greatly enhanced after MoO42− doping. The NVP-MoO4 (0.10) exhibits the optimal rate capability. Along with the increase of current density from 0.5 to 20 C for the NVP-MoO4 (0.10), the discharge capacity remains almost constant, while the specific discharge capacity is mildly decreases to 92 (20 C) and 90.2 mA h g−1 (30 C). Amazingly, the discharge capacity of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) is up to 84.2 mA h g−1 even at a superhigh current density of 50 C, while the NVP-MoO4 (0.05) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.15) present much lower capacities of 74 and 53.7 mA h g−1 at 50 C, respectively. Moreover, when the current density is adjusted back to 0.5 C, the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) can even return to the initial state, indicating the excellent rate capability. However, the capacity of the NVP-MoO4 (0) decays to 46 mA h g−1 (10 C) (Fig. 4d). Figs. 4e, 4f and S5 exhibit the charge/discharge profiles of the NVP-MoO4 (x) at different current densities. Compared with the NVP-MoO4 (0), the charging and discharging curves of the NVP-MoO4 (x) (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) present coupled steady plateaus. The voltage platform in the charging and discharging profiles do not vanish even though at 50 C, illustrating that the sodiation/desodiation processes are still in progress in MoO42−-doped electrodes at high current densities. Fig. S6 exhibits the relationship between energy density and doping amount in the materials. It can be seen that the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) displays the outstanding energy density of ∼358.2 Wh/kg (1 C), which is significantly higher than that of the NVP-MoO4 (0) (284.8 Wh/kg), the NVP-MoO4 (0.05) (297.7 Wh/kg) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.15) (269.4 Wh/kg).",
                "Figs. 5 and S7 exhibit long cycling stability for the as-prepared NVP-MoO4 (x) materials. The NVP-MoO4 (0.10) presents an outstanding initial capacity of 103 mA h g−1 at 20 C and exhibits the retention rate of 81.6% after 500 cycles (Fig. 5a). Even after 1000 cycles, the average coulombic efficiency is almost close to 100%. However, the NVP-MoO4 (0.05) (Fig. S7b) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.15) (Fig. S7c) present the inferior capacities of 75.9 and 78.7 mA h g−1 under the same condition. Furthermore, the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) cathode can still deliver the initial capacity of 90.6 mA h g−1 at 30 C and remain at 50.7 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles, indicating splendid long cycling performance. Nevertheless, the NVP-MoO4 (0) (Fig. S7a) electrode gives the initial specific capacity of 85 mA h g−1 at 5 C, and only holds the capacity of 66.5 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. In addition, the microstructures of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) and the NVP-MoO4 (0) after 500 cycles at 1 C are observed by SEM (Fig. S8). Compared with the NVP-MoO4 (0), the morphology of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) changes little even after 500 cycles. The comparison of half-cell performance between this work and the recently reported investigations for sodium-ion batteries is shown in Table S4. Obviously, the overall electrochemical performance of the NVP-MoO4(0.10), especially rate capability, is excellent among various NVP-based materials. Consequently, the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) may be the promising cathode material for SIBs because of its outstanding rate performance and long cyclic stability.",
                "Fig. S9 displays the CV profiles of the NVP and the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) at 0.1 mV s−1 between 2.4 and 4.3 V. From Fig. S9, the redox reactions of the NVP and the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) occur at the voltage of ∼3.4 V, which is consistent with the extraction/insertion of Na+ in the crystal structure of the NVP. The oxidation process is ascribed to the two-phase transition process of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 [26]. The NVP-MoO4 (0.10) displays a stronger oxidation peak than the NVP. As for the process of reduction, the peaks are divided into two parts due to the structural rearrangement when Na+ transfers from the Na1 site to the Na2 site [45]. The small reduction peak corresponds to the short discharge platform in Fig. 4a. Moreover, the polarization voltage of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) electrode between cathode and anode peaks is 211 mV, which is visibly less than that of the NVP (301 mV). Clearly, compared with the pristine NVP, MoO42−-doped NVP possesses excellent electrochemical reversibility and improved reaction kinetics.",
                "In order to further study the kinetic properties of the materials, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) tests are carried out. Nyquist diagram and the fitting result of EIS circuit model are displayed in Fig. 6a. The EIS spectra is composed of a semicircle and a slash in the high/low frequency regions. The semicircle is assigned to the charge transfer process, while the diagonal line is associated with the diffusion of sodium ions (Warburg impedance) [46]. Based on the calculation and fitting of equivalent circuit, the Rct of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) (252.2 Ω) is much smaller than that of the NVP (408.3 Ω), illustrating a faster charge transfer dynamic for the NVP-MoO4 (0.10). Fig. 6b demonstrates the linear relationship of the NVP-MoO4 (0) and the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) materials in the Ź vs ω−1/2. As calculated, the slope of the NVP-MoO4 (0) is higher than that of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10), indicating a lower value of diffusion coefficient of Na+ (DNa). Obviously, the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) electrode presents low charge transfer resistance and fast Na+ diffusion kinetics, indicating that MoO42− doping can enhance rate capability.",
                "Fig. S10 exhibits the dynamic properties of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10). The shapes of the CV profiles (Fig. S10a) at different rates (0.2–1.2 mV s−1) are similar, and the peak current (i) increases with the increase of scanning rates (v), manifesting that there is a distinct capacitive behavior in the electrochemical process [47]. According to Eqs. (3) and (4) in the Supporting Information, the b values of oxidation and reduction peaks in CV profiles are 0.62 and 0.85, respectively, demonstrating that the dynamic behavior of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) is controlled via both diffusion and capacitive behavior. The contribution rates of two controlled processes are obtained via formula (5) in the Supporting Information. The capacitive contribution is 94.14% at 0.6 mV s−1 (Fig. S10b). The proportions of capacitive/diffusion contribution at various scanning rates are displayed in Fig. S10c. When the scanning rates are 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 mV s−1, the contributions of capacitive behavior are 88.62, 93.37, 94.57, 94.91 and 95.37%, respectively, meaning that the outstanding rate capability of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) is mainly contributed via high capacitive behaviour [48]. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) are used to further probe the dynamic properties of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S10d-10f. It can be seen that the Na+ diffusion coefficient is mainly at the range of 10−11 to 10−9 cm2 s−1. There is no doubt that MoO42− doping facilitates the diffusion of Na+, and the diffusion coefficient of MoO42− modified NVP is higher than that of previously reported NASICON-type NVP materials [49], [50], [51].",
                "The electrical effects of MoO42− doped NVP are ascertained via the calculation of density of states (DOS) and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The crystal structures of the NVP and MoO42−-doped NVP is simulated, as displayed in Fig. 7a. From Fig. 7b, the band gap of the NVP-MoO4 (0) is 4.97 eV. For the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) (band gap = 3.67 eV), some new energy states appear around the bottom of conduction band, significantly narrowing the width of foregoing band gap in the pristine NVP and enhancing the electronic conductivity. Further analyzing the partial DOS (Fig. S11) shows that these nascent states in the band gap above the Ef mainly come from the contribution of Mo atom. Hence, one can conclude that MoO42− doping could induce the change of local structure and modify the electronic structure. Thus, the appearance of new energy states may improve the electrochemical properties of the NVP [34].",
                "For illustrating the structural evolution of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) electrode during desodiation/sodiation process, in-situ XRD of the material is collected. Figs. 8 and S12 exhibit the diffraction patterns of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) at different charge states. To be specific, the (1 0 4), (0 2 4), (1 1 6) and (3 0 0) four profiles shift to right. At discharging, the four peaks completely return to the initial state. Moreover, the (1 1 3) and (2 1 1) peaks split into new peaks and gradually disappear. During discharging, the peaks gradually appear again. The results present that all the diffraction peaks significant change and gradually return to the pristine state during charging and discharging, indicating that the electrochemical reaction of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) is highly reversible."

                "To summarize, we have synthetized Na(3+2x)V2(PO4)(3-x)MoO4(x) cathode materials as advanced cathodes for SIBs. The doping of MoO42− significantly reduces the internal resistance and accelerates the migration rate of sodium ions in the NVP-based materials, resulting in an obvious enhancement of electrochemical performance. The optimum content of MoO42− is 0.10. The NVP-MoO4 (0.10) presents excellent rate capability and cycling stability, which exhibits the outstanding rate capability of 84.2 mA h g−1 at a superhigh current density of 50 C. Moreover, the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) shows a relatively specific capacity of 73.2 mA h g−1 with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.2% even at 20 C after 1000 cycles. The EIS measurement and DOS computation demonstrate that the faster sodium ion kinetics and lower band gap after the doping of MoO42− account for the excellent rate capability of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10). In-situ XRD manifests that the structure of the NVP-MoO4 (0.10) undergoes a highly reversible phase transition process. We believe that the anionic doping strategy not only sheds a new insight for the modification of NVP, but also provides a reference for the practical application of polyanionic SIBs."
