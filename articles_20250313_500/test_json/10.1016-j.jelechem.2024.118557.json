                "O3-type NaTMO2 (TM = transition metal) is highly anticipated as a cathode for sodium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, the irreversible phase transition during sodiation/desodiation and the Jahn-Teller effect induced by Mn3+ have hindered its steps towards industrialization. Herein, we propose a doping strategy to enhance the structural stability of O3-type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 through Zr doping. On the one hand, the Na+ transport channels are broadened due to the enlarged layer spacing, which accelerates the kinetic processes. On the other hand, Zr doping maintains structural integrity, inhibiting the decay of the layered structure. As a result, the uniquely designed material NNFMZO-6000 exhibited a discharge specific capacity of 113.8 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a capacity retention of 67.54 % after 200 cycles. This work presents an effective modification method to optimize the properties of O3-type NaTMO2 materials.",

                "Since the completion of the first industrial revolution, the demand for primary energy has been increasing rapidly, making the development of new energy sources and efficient energy utilization a contemporary hot topic [1]. Recently, lithium-ion batteries have been successfully commercialized and have come to dominate the energy storage, the energy storage, electric vehicles, and portable devices sectors. However, lithium resources are relatively scarce and unevenly distributed, revealing inherent shortcomings for large-scale energy storage systems (LSEESs). Sodium-ion batteries, analogous to lithium-ion batteries, are particularly suitable for LSEESs due to their extensive geographical distribution and abundant resource reserves [2], [3]. Furthermore, the manufacturing process of sodium-ion batteries is highly compatible with that of lithium-ion batteries, significantly reducing production costs and offering high potential for industrialization [4], [5].",
                "The cathode material is a critical component of ion-based batteries. Prominent candidates for cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries include transition metal oxides [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], polyanionic compounds [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], and Prussian blue analogs [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Among these, expectations for the commercialization of transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, where TM = transition metal) are extremely ambitious owing to their high theoretical capacity, excellent electrical conductivity, fast diffusion kinetics, and compatibility with established battery manufacturing infrastructure [21], [22], [23]. The O3-type and P2-type structures are the two common structures found in NaxTMO2. When x = 1 in NaxTMO2, the material exhibits an O3-type structure, which can accommodate more Na+ compared to the P2-type structure (x < 0.7), indicating a higher theoretical specific capacity [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. However, O3-type NaxTMO2 still faces critical challenges hindering its commercialization: Firstly, poor air stability significantly increases production and transportation costs and poses a risk of electrochemical performance degradation [31], [32], [33], [34]. Secondly, the complex structural evolution during sodiation/desodiation processes leads to poor structural stability, deteriorating sodium storage performance [33], [35], [36], [37], [38]. For the former, microstructure modulation [39], [40], surface modification [41], [42], [43], [44], and elemental doping [45], [46], [47], [48] are effective strategies to improve air stability. For the latter, elemental doping is widely recognized as a robust method for maintaining structural stability [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. For instance, Sun et al. [55] proposed substituting Na+ in NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NNFMO) with Ca2+. ICP and XRD refinement results indicated that Ca2+ successfully replaced Na+, generating Na vacancies and resulting in a larger interlayer spacing in the alkali layers, which accelerates Na+ diffusion. In situ XRD analysis demonstrated that NNFMO experienced a reversible “O3-P3-O3″ phase transition during charge and discharge. In addition, Ca2+ doping effectively widened the stable voltage range of the P3 phase, leading to superior material recoverability, which strongly supports long-term operational stability. As a result, the prepared Na0.9Ca0.05Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 116.1 mAh/g at a current density of 1C and a capacity retention of 91.8 % after 200 cycles, while the capacity retention of the pristine sample was only 67 % after 200 cycles. Additionally, the Na0.9Ca0.05Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode demonstrated excellent rate performance (86.2 mAh/g at 10C), attributed to the effective improvement in structural reversibility and the expanded d-spacing of the alkali metal layers due to Ca2+ doping. Besides, Wang et al. [56] proposed a high-valence ion doping strategy by introducing Ta5+ into O3-type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2, which forms stronger TM-O bonds with oxygen compared to transition metal elements (Ni, Fe, Mn, etc.). XRD results showed that Ta doping raised the phase transition voltage from O3 to P3 to 3.2 V, improving phase transition reversibility. Compared to the pristine sample, theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of Ta5+ widened the spacing of the alkali metal layers, effectively reduced the activation energy barrier of Na+ and decreased the band gap. As a result, the NFM-Ta0.01 electrode achieved a capacity retention of 80.15 % after 200 cycles at 1C, significantly higher than that of the original sample (35.44 %).",
                "Inspired by the selection of doping elements mentioned above, we proposed introducing high-valence metal elements into the structure to form strong TM-O bonds, leading to shorter TM-O bond lengths as well as enhanced TM-O bond energies, thereby improving the structural stability of O3-type materials and enhancing phase transition reversibility. Herein, we introduced trace amounts of Zr4+ into O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 to prepare a series of materials, NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3ZrxO2 (x = 0, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008). First, XRD results showed that the introduction of Zr suppressed the formation of the NiO phase. Second, Zr doping enhanced the structure stability, with a discharge capacity of 113.8 mAh/g at 1 C and an increase in capacity retention from 53.66 % in the original sample to 67.54 % in the modified sample. Finally, XRD, SEM, and TEM measurements demonstrated that Zr doping effectively improved structural stability during the cycling process."

                "To analyze the crystal structure of the samples, X-ray powder diffraction was conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. 1(a). The XRD patterns of all samples can be indexed to the α-NaFeO2 structure with an R-3m space group. The shapes of the characteristic peaks of the doped samples with different Zr contents are consistent with NNFMO-bare, and the differences in the intensities of the characteristic peaks are not significant, suggesting that the influence of Zr doping is negligible for crystal structure. In addition, compared to the undoped samples, the XRD diffraction peaks of the doped samples are not significantly shifted due to the low concentration of Zr doping. Additionally, the XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples appear at ∼37.25° and ∼43.25° as the characteristic peaks of NiO (PDF#89-7131), which belong to (0 0 1) and (2 0 0) crystal planes, respectively. Furthermore, the XRD spectra are locally enlarged within the angular region of 42.6–43.8°, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In comparison with the NNFMO-bare, the XRD patterns of the Zr-doped samples show a reduced intensity of the characteristic peaks of the (2 0 0) crystal plane corresponding to NiO. This suggests that the introduction of Zr to NNFMO-bare contributes to the suppression of NiO phase generation.",
                "Further, XRD measurements were employed to analyze the tendency of NiO in the samples synthesized at different sintering temperatures (doped with Zr at a concentration of 6000 ppm). As shown in Fig. S1, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of the (0 0 2) crystal plane attributed to NiO increases gradually with the increase in sintering temperature, indicating that higher sintering temperatures favor the generation of NiO.",
                "The morphologies of NNFMO-bare, NNFMZO-2000, NNFMZO-4000, NNFMZO-6000, and NNFMZO-8000 are shown in Fig. 2(a–e). NNFMO-bare consists of irregular flake particles with diameters of 500 nm to 2 μm stacked into columnar particles with a length of 200 nm. Interestingly, as the doping concentration of Zr increases, the primary particles transform from irregular flake particles to square flake particles without any significant change in size. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the addition of Zr changes the material’s surface energy, which in turn changes the morphology of the primary particles [57]. Fig. 2(f-f5) shows the EDS maps of the NNFMZO-6000 sample, which suggest that Na, Ni, Fe, Mn, and Zr are uniformly distributed, indicating the successful introduction of Zr into the material. The elemental composition of the synthesized samples was determined by ICP testing. As shown in Table S1, the compositions are Na0.999Ni0.335Fe0.332Mn0.334O2, Na1.002Ni0.333Fe0.334Mn0.334Zr0.002O2, Na1.001Ni0.334Fe0.333Mn0.333Zr0.004O2, Na0.999Ni0.333Fe0.334Mn0.334Zr0.006O2, and Na1.001Ni0.333Fe0.333Mn0.334Zr0.008O2, corresponding to NNFMO-bare, NNFMZO-2000, NNFMZO-4000, NNFMZO-6000, and NNFMZO-8000, respectively. The Na:Ni:Fe:Mn:Zr mole ratios are consistent with predesigned ratios",
                "Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were conducted to test the electrochemical properties of the materials, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows the rate capabilities of NNFMO-bare, NNFMZO-2000, NNFMZO-4000, NNFMZO-6000, and NNFMZO-8000. Specifically, the NNFMZO-6000 electrode exhibits superior rate performance with discharge capacities of 160.5, 120, 113.8, 106.6, 93.5 and 84.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, and 10 C, respectively. In comparison, the NNFMO-bare electrode exhibits the poorest rate performance with discharge capacities of 115.1, 110.3, 105.2, 99.2, 88.7 and 77.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, and 10 C, respectively. Notably, the NNFMZO-6000 electrode exhibits a discharge specific capacity of 160.5 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 C, which may be attributed to the Zr4+ doping that effectively regulated the Na-O-TM structure in the material. This regulation of the Na-O-TM structure successfully activates the redox reactions of lattice oxygen, providing the capacity during the charging and discharging processes [58]. Fig. 3(b, c) show the charge/discharge curves of NNFMO-bare and NNFMZO-6000 at different current densities, respectively. Compared to NNFMO-bare, NNFMZO-6000 shows a more distinct and prolonged discharge plateau.",
                "To assess the prolonged operational capability of the synthesized samples, all electrodes were characterized by cycling at 1 C. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the NNFMZO-6000 electrode displays the highest capacity retention of 67.54 % after 200 cycles, while NNFMZO-2000, NNFMZO-4000, and NNFMZO-8000 exhibited capacity retention of 59.06 %, 61.84 %, and 64.19 %, respectively. As the doping concentration of Zr increases, the capacity retention showes a tendency to increase and then decrease, indicating that the optimal doping concentration is 6000 ppm. Without modification, the capacity retention of the NNFMO-bare electrode was only 53.66 % after 200 cycles, which is attributed to the irreversible structural phase transition that occurs in the material during the charging/discharging process [33]. This suggests that regardless of the amount of Zr addition, the structural stability of the material can be improved, thereby increasing the capacity retention after long-term cycling. This conclusion will be demonstrated later by the characterization of XRD, SEM, and TEM. Fig. 3(e,f) show the charge/discharge curves of NNFMO-bare and NNFMZO-6000 electrodes at different numbers of cycles, respectively. Compared to NNFMO-bare, NNFMZO-6000 shows less polarization during charging and discharging, indicating that the introduction of Zr effectively suppresses the polarization of the material during desodiation/sodiation. Interestingly, the NNFMZO-6000 shows a new platform around 2.6 V, which is attributed to the phase transformation from P3 to O3′ [59]. As the cycles progress, the platform becomes less obvious after 20 cycles. Finally, the platform disappears completely after 40 cycles. In conclusion, the enhanced capacity and cycling stability are mainly attributed to the activation of the oxygen redox reaction as well as the improvement of structural stability due to Zr doping.",
                "The different Na storage behaviors between NNFMO-bare and NNFMZO-6000 were explored using the corresponding dQ/dV profiles in Fig. 4. For NNFMO-bare, distinct redox peaks (3.0/2.7 V) can be observed, which may be contributed to the Ni4+/Ni2+ via Ni3+ redox process [7]. With increasing current density, the oxidation and reduction peak potentials shift towards the polarization direction. In contrast, one oxidation peak and two reduction peaks appear in the dQ/dV curves of NNFMZO-6000 charged/discharged at 0.1 C. The O/P mixed phase appearing at 2.6 V triggers an additional reduction peak [55]. Specifically, the oxidizing voltage platform difference of NNFMO-bare between the current density of 0.1C and 10C is 638 mV, which is higher than that of NNFMZO-6000 (544 mV), demonstrating that Zr doping suppresses the polarization of materials at high current density. Fig. 4(c, d) show the dQ/dV curves at different cycles. Compared to NNFMO-bare, significant redox peaks can be detected in the curves of NNFMZO-6000 even after 200 cycles. Conversely, no obvious peaks can be found in the curves of NNFMO-bare after 200 cycles, suggesting that Zr doping effectively maintains the structural integrity of the material over long-term operation. Additionally, both materials exhibit a degree of polarization during cycling.",
                "XRD analysis was conducted to explore the structural changes in the cycled materials. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the XRD patterns of the two electrodes after cycling. The intensities of the diffraction peaks in both samples weaken after cycling. The characteristic peaks of (0 0 3) and (1 0 4), which represent the layered structure, remain clearly observable. Moreover, the characteristic peak located at ∼43°, belonging to NiO, still appears. This indicates that the repeated deintercalation/intercalation of Na+ collapses the layered structure. Meanwhile, side reactions between the material and electrolyte continue to occur on the electrode surface during cycling process. All of these lead to degradation of the layered structure of the material. As shown in Fig. 5(b), compared to NNFMO-bare, the characteristic peak of the (1 0 4) crystal plane belonging to NNFMZO-6000 appears at ∼41.75°, which is significantly higher, demonstrating that the layered structure is maintained more integrally with Zr doping. Additionally, the characteristic peak appearing near 65° belongs to the aluminum foil.",
                "To visually observe the erosion of the cycled material's surface morphology by the electrolyte, SEM measurements were conducted and the images are shown in Fig. 6. The surface of NNFMO-bare in Fig. 6 (a, b) becomes rough after cycling, and the division between particles becomes blurred. The particle surface of the material has been damaged due to the Na+ deintercalation-intercalation process as well as corrosion by the electrolyte. In contrast, in the SEM images of NNFMZO-6000, the demarcation between particles is still obvious, and the particle surface is smooth, suggesting that Zr doping can protect the material from the erosion of the electrolyte, ultimately benefiting the cycling stability of the material.",
                "TEM measurements were employed to directly characterize the crystal structure of both pristine and cycled materials. Fig. 7(a) shows the HRTEM images of pristine NNFMO-bare. The distinct (1 0 1) lattice fringes with an interlayer spacing of 0.2617 nm can be well detected, corresponding to the XRD result. However, Fig. 7(b) exhibits the distorted lattice fringes, demonstrating that the crystal structure of NNFMO-bare was damaged during the cycling. In contrast, clear lattice fringes are observed in the TEM images of both pristine and cycled NNFMZO-6000, indicating that Zr doping effectively maintains the layer structure. Additionally, the d-spacing indexed to the (1 0 1) plane reduces from 0.2629 nm to 0.2605 nm after cycling, demonstrating compression of the layer structure during the long-term cycling. Furthermore, compared to pristine NNFMO-bare, the d-spacing of (1 0 1) lattice fringes increases from 0.2617 nm to 0.2629 nm with Zr doping, indicating an increased d-spacing of the material and broadened Na+ transport paths. In conclusion, Zr doping effectively preventes the decay of the material's layer structure, thereby explaining the optimal long-cycle stability of NNFMZO-6000."
