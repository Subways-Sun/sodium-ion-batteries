                "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been proved as one of the most alternative to Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by the virtue of the abundant resources of Na. Among the cathodes, layered oxides stand out owing to their high energy density. The Jahn–Teller distortion, structural phase transition and oxygen release are main drawbacks of Mn/Ni based layered oxides. Hence, Li-Ni-Cu co-substituted Na0.67Li0.1(Mn0.7Ni0.2Cu0.1)0.9O2 (NLMNC) sample was prepared. The NLMNC sample exhibits the honeycomb-ordered superstructure at about 22° which is ascribed to cation ordering. By virtue of the Li-Ni-Cu co-substitute, the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn is suppressed. Attributed to Li+ migrating from the metal oxide layer to the interlayer and the Li+ can play the part of pillar in the interlayer, NLMNC cathode displays the capacity retention rate of 82.5 % at 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. The anionic redox reaction of NLMNC is related to the addition of Li ions and O 2p non-bonding which is different from the anionic redox reaction of electrons removing from O 2p in the eg* (Ni–O) states of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. During charge process, peroxo O− emerges with the oxidation of lattice oxygen. During discharge process, the intensity of peroxo O− gradually decreases. DFT calculations were also carried out to reveal the reaction mechanism of NLMNC. The DFT results showed that the anionic redox reaction occurs near Mn ions, while the Ni ions are stable which is corresponding with our results. It is proven that such Li-Ni-Cu co-substituted NLMNC presents a promising cathode material for SIBs.",

                "Electrochemical energy storage is relied by the modern society owing to the rapid development and utilization of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in portable electronic products and electric vehicles , , , , , . With the increasing awareness of environmental protection and the rising price of oil, people are increasingly enthusiastic in electric vehicles which results in the price of lithium resources increasing sharply. Hence, the recent dependence on batteries is greater than ever and the price of lithium resources has been pushed up. It is also noted that most of the world's high-quality lithium resources are concentrated in South America and Australia with geopolitical concerns , , . Under these circumstances, the calling for alternative batteries becomes even more urgent , , , . Many monovalent and multivalent cation batteries have been studied and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) stand out among these batteries by virtue of the abundant resources corresponding with the low cost, similar charge/discharge mechanism comparing with LIBs and high standard electrode potential , , , , .",
                "Cathode, which is considered as the most important parts of the battery, determines the work voltage, rate performance and energy density , , , , . Among these cathodes, such as layered oxides, polyanionic compounds, Prussian blue and organic compounds, layer oxides attract great attention on account of simple synthesis process and high energy density , , , . Layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, TM referring to transition metals) can be classified into two main group, P2 type (P: prismatic) and O3 type (O: octahedral), depending on the coordination environment of Na+ . And the numbers \"2″ and \"3″ are related to the minimum repeated layers. Particularly, manganese-based layered oxides NaxMnO2 achieve great attention by virtue of the low cost and the environmental friendliness , , , , . However, the phase transition and the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ lead to the serious structural collapse and the rapid capacity fading. In addition, Manthiram's group reported the mechanism about transition-metal ions with Jahn-Teller distortions dissolving into the electrolytes that high valence state Mn4+ cations are strong oxidizers which can reduce back directly to the stable state (Mn2+) along with oxidizing electrolyte solvent molecules into CO2 and other substances. In this case, many works found that doping with other elements, such as Li, Mg, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni and so on, can address these problems partially , , . It is reported that there are two Na sites called Nae site and Naf site in the structure of NaxMnO2 due to the ordering of Na+ and vacancy. The sodiation/desodiation process of Na in “e” site is faster than that in “f” site. The Na+/vacancy ordering leads to poor rate performance. Xiao et al. found that Li and Ti co-doping can suppress such Na+/vacancy ordering and the cathode sodiation/desodiation reaction becomes a completely solid solution reaction. Generally, specific elements doping can endow cathodes improved kinetic process. They demonstrated that the solid-solution reaction region in electrochemical process can be expanded by virtue of the Li and Ti co-doping . Till now, utilizing both cationic and anionic redox reactions is one of the acceptable methods to enhance the energy density of SIBs with layered oxide cathodes. It is reported that monovalent elements, transition metals located on the right side of the periodic table and 4d/5d elements doping can display oxygen redox activities. Many works were carried out because the anxiety of structure stability is growing due to the high expectations of SIBs replacing LIBs in some fields. Introducing Li+ into the transition metal layers which is the similar strategy previously applied to Li-rich layered oxides can activate anionic redox reaction. By virtue of introducing Li+ into the transition metal layers, the coordination environments of some of O2− anions change from coordinated with three TM ions to coordinated with one Li ion and two TM ions. The interaction between Li and O is weaker than the interaction between TM and O resulting in more easily losing electrons from O2− anions coordinated with both Li and TM. The introduction of Li ions is also related to O holes of oxygen and O 2p non-bonding (O 2p lone pair) . It is reported that the O 2p non-bonding can maintain the structure stability, while the utilization of TM–O band with anionic activities, such as LiCoO2, may lead to the structural failure and oxygen release [ , ]. The charge and discharge processes can empty and fill the O 2p non-bonding [ ,]. There are some works reporting about superstructure corresponding with outstanding performances. Bruce's group first reported the honeycomb-ordered superstructure and Ribbon-ordered superstructure which are corresponding with the reversibility of anion redox. A dual-honeycomb superstructure (LiMn6−MgMn6) in a layered oxide was designed and synthesized by Wang et al. The LiMn6 superlattice activates the anion redox and the MgMn6 superlattice stabilizes the crystal structure. Currently, the structure change is also the focus of research. Kang's group studied the migration of TM to the tetrahedral site or octahedral site in the Li layer and in-plane TM migration. They further proved the reason of voltage loss which is related to the migration of TM to other sites. Expect these, large-scale electrical energy storage system is a significant goal. The preparation and transportation of Na-based layered transition metal oxides are limited by the air stability. Hence, it is important to improve the air stability of layered oxides. It is reported that layered oxides with high redox potential couples of Ni2+/4+ and Cu2+/3+ show much better air-stability than layered oxides with other redox couples . Many other works about air stability are also reported and the storage and transportation capability are simultaneously enhanced , , , .",
                "In this work, Na0.67Mn0.7Ni0.2Cu0.1O2 cathode (NMNC) and Li-doping Na0.67Li0.1(Mn0.7Ni0.2Cu0.1)0.9O2 (NLMNC) cathode were prepared. With the addition of Ni, Cu and Li, the Mn3+ concentration can be diluted and the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ can be suppressed. It is expected that the Li substitution enables the complete solid-solution reaction in a wide voltage range due to the suppression of Na+/vacancy ordering and the formation of honeycomb-ordered superstructure with Li+. In addition, the anionic activities with O 2p non-bonding can be triggered which is corresponding with the good structure stability rather than the remove of electrons from O 2p in the eg* (Ni–O) states of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 . The cathodes exhibit better air-stability by virtue of the substitution of Mn by Ni and Cu with higher redox potential. Expect these, octahedral-site stabilization energy (OSSE) (OSSE=octahedral CFSE - tetrahedral CFSE, crystal field stabilization energies (CFSE)) is also considered. It is hoped that this work can offer a solution toward the design of layered oxides with anionic activity, excellent air-stability and good structure stability."

The spherical precursor was mixed with stoichiometric amounts of lithium/sodium salt and the mixture was heated in air. Owing to the different diffusion rate, kirkendall effect occurs during the heat-treating process resulting in the homogeneous polyhedra hollow structure.",
                        "The results of ICP tests are shown in Table S1 for revealing the chemical compositions. As shown in Fig. 1a, the crystal structures of NMNC and NLMNC samples were determined by XRD. All the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the P2-type layered structure with the hexagonal lattice corresponding with the space group of P63/mmc. It can be revealed that the crystallinity and the purity of NMNC and NLMNC are good by virtue of the sharp peaks and no impurity peaks. As shown in Fig. 1b, the NLMNC sample exhibits the honeycomb-ordered superstructure at about 22° which is ascribed to cation ordering with Li in the transition metal layer. Such superstructure is corresponding with one Li-ion surrounded by six transition-metal ions owing to the mismatch of ionic valence and radius. The Rietveld refinement result of NLMNC sample with rational Rwp is shown in Fig. 1b and Table S2 for getting further information about the crystal structure. The Li and Cu ions are successfully introduced into transition metal layers. Na ions occupy two distinct Wyckoff sites, Nae site and Naf site. By virtue of the Li substitution, Na ions tend to occupy Nae site and the Na+/vacancy ordering is suppressed. The schematic illustration of honeycomb-ordered superstructure is shown in Fig. 1c,d. It is reported that Li+ will migrate irreversibly from transitional metal layers to interlayers and the honeycomb-ordered superstructure is corresponding with oxygen redox activities . It is expected that the Li+ ions migrate to alkali metal layers can support the structure leading to the great cycling performance.",
                        "The SEM images of NMNC and NLMNC are exhibited in Fig. 2a,b, respectively. It is vividly shown that there is no significant difference between NMNC sample and NLMNC sample. Both samples display a homogeneous polyhedra hollow structure. Such homogeneous polyhedra hollow structure is related to low volume change and good structural stability during electrochemical reaction processes. Nano-Brook 90plus PALS was used to reveal pore size distribution, the result is shown in Fig. S1 that the average pore size of NLMNC sample is about 2.1 μm. With the aim of studying the surface area of NLMNC sample, BET (Brunaurer-emmett-teller ASAP 2020) was carried out. As exhibited in Fig. S2, the NLMNC sample exhibits large BET surface area of 30.29 m2·g−1. For a more convincing description, TEM images of NLMNC sample are displayed in Fig. 2c. The hollow structure is also proved as shown in the inset of Fig. 2c. As revealed in Fig. 2c, the interference fringe spacing (d-spacings of the (002) plane) of NLMNC sample is 0.55 nm. For further examining the distribution of elements, EDS mapping of NLMNC sample is shown in Fig. 2d. It is vividly exhibited that sodium, manganese, nickel and cuprum elements are extremely uniform in the NLMNC sample.",
                        "XPS was performed to further reveal the surface elemental composition of NLMNC and NMNC, as exhibited in Fig. 2e–g. With the addition of Li, the XPS Mn 2p spectrum of NLMNC is different from that of NMNC. The intensity of peaks for Mn4+ of NLMNC at 642.5/654.0 eV are stronger than that of NMNC at 642.8/654.3 eV which reveals the addition of Li+ resulting in the increase in the average valence state of Mn. The relative content of Mn4+ and Mn3+ of two samples is exhibited in Table S3 which clearly reveals the higher content of Mn4+ in NLMNC. It is widely acknowledged that the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ will lead to the serious structural collapse and the increase in the average valence state of Mn is meaningful for suppressing the Jahn–Teller distortion. Reducing the Mn3+ content and increasing Mn4+ content in NLMNC can improve the cycling performance. By the XPS analysis of Ni 2p, two peaks of NMNC located at 854.5 eV and 872.0 eV can be ascribed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2. Such result displays the oxidation state of Ni in NMNC is divalent. However, there are four peaks located at 854.1/871.6 eV and 856.3/874.9 eV after the addition of Li in NLMNC, which are corresponding with the oxidation state of divalent and trivalent. Both samples show complex satellite peaks which are belong to Ni compounds. The XPS fitted peak results for Cu 2p of NLMNC and NMNC are also similar. The peaks at 933.2 eV and 932.7 eV are corresponding with Cu 2p3/2 and the peaks at 952.5 eV and 952.5 eV can be ascribed to Cu 2p1/2 and one satellite exhibiting in both samples. It reveals the Cu in the chemical environment of Cu2+."

                        "The electrochemical energy storage behaviors of NLMNC and NMNC are tested Fig. 3a,b exhibits the initial charge-discharge curves of NLMNC and NMNC at current densities of 20 mA g−1, respectively. Several voltage plateaus exist in the initial charge-discharge curves of NMNC. While, almost none of the platforms appear in the initial charge-discharge curves of NLMNC from 2.1 V to 4.0 V. Especially, the high voltage plateaus of NMNC at about 4.2 V may be related to the electrochemical oxidation of Cu2+ to Cu3+ and Ni3+ to Ni4+, phase transition and oxygen redox. Such high voltage plateaus are not obvious in the curves of NLMNC revealing the riveting Li+ can bring O 2p non-bonding, disrupt the Na+/vacancy ordering and expand the range of solid-solution. Comparing with the NMNC cathodes, the NLMNC cathode exhibits smooth and sloping profiles which is related to the structural stability. The initial charge/discharge capacity of NLMNC is 163.0/116.1 mAh·g−1 with the coulombic efficiency of 71.2 % indicating that the Li+ migrate from transitional metal layers to interlayers resulting in the low coulombic efficiency Fig. 3c exhibits the cycling performance of NLMNC and NMNC at current densities of 20 mA·g−1. It is clearly shown that the discharge capacity of NLMNC is higher than that of NMNC. During the previous cycling processes, there is a small increase in the discharge capacity of NLMNC which is relative to the activated process and the migration of Li+. The rate capabilities are performed under the current densities of 20, 50, 100, 200 and 20 mA·g−1, as shown in Fig. 3d. The average capacities of NLMNC are higher than those of NMNC and the gap is getting wider with the increase of current densities. Furthermore, NLMNC and NMNC cathodes are tested at 200 mA g−1 for 100 circles (Fig. 3e). The initial discharge capacity of NLMNC is 102.1 mA h g−1 and the highest discharge capacity is 111.3 mA h g−1 after the activated process. After 100 cycles, the capacity retention rate of NLMNC is 82.5 % (based on the discharge capacity of initial cycle) which is obviously better than that of NMNC. In addition, the charge/discharge curves of the 2nd, 25th, 50th, 70th and 100th cycles are shown in Fig. 3f for further revealing the electrochemical behaviors of NLMNC. It's clearly shown that there is a small voltage drop (0.2467 V) from 2nd to 100th. The cutoff potential drop may be related to the migration of Li+ corresponding with the dissolution of a small quantity of manganese. However, the discharge capacity of NMNC dropped from 93.8 to 26.8 mA h g−1 which is much worse than that of NLMNC. Such phenomenon is related to the serious Jahn–Teller distortion and low octahedral-site stabilization energy (OSSE) . Fig. 3g,h shows the Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of NMNC cathode and NLMNC cathode as a way to better figure out the electrochemical processes. It is vividly shown that the CV curves of NMNC cathode is corresponding with the initial charge-discharge curves (Fig. 3 g). There is a pair of oxidation and reduction peaks at about 4.2 V and 4.05 V which can be related to the electrochemical oxidation of Cu2+ to Cu3+and Ni3+ to Ni4+, phase transition and oxygen redox [ , ]. However, the reduction peak at about 4.05 V which exhibits poor reversibility in long cycling disappears in the CV curves of NLMNC cathode (Fig. 3h). It is attributed to the addition of Li that suppresses the oxygen release. For conventional Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, the electron can be removed from O 2p in the eg* (Ni–O) states . It is reported that the Ni-O bond is the weakest in the M-O bonds which may lead to the structural failure . While the electron removed from O 2p non-bonding corresponding with the addition of Li ions can maintain the structural stability by generating peroxo-like O–O species. Furthermore, when Li+ was introduced into NMNC, the original peaks became broadened which is related to the voltage plateaus became sloping (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, GITT test (the second cycle) was done to evaluate the Na+ diffusion in NMNC cathode and NLMNC cathode, as shown in Fig. 3i j. The chemical diffusion coefficient of Na+ is corresponding with the following Eq. (1):(1)",
                        "D N a + = 4 π τ ( n m V m S ) 2 ( Δ E s Δ E t ) 2",
                        "Where, ∆Es and ∆Et, getting from the GITT results, refer to the change of voltage for resting and cycling, respectively. The τ, nm, Vm and S in this equation are related to the time duration, molar concentration, molar volume and the active surface of the electrode. After calculating, the obtained DNa+ for NLMNC electrode during the charge process is about 10−11 cm2s−1 (Fig. 3l). However, there are large fluctuations in the obtained DNa+ for NMNC electrode during the charge process from 10−11–10−13 cm2s−1 (Fig. 3k) which may be associated with the phase transition and oxygen redox activities. Furthermore, the average obtained DNa+ for NLMNC electrode during the discharge process is smaller than that of NMNC. Such result exhibits NLMNC electrode owning facile Na+ transport contributing to the electrochemical performances.",
                        "For exploring the change of impedance corresponding with cationic and anionic redox reactions, potential-based in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PBIS-EIS) measurements of NLMNC electrode during the second charge process were performed. The amplitude of PBIS-EIS was 10 mV and the frequency range was 1 Hz to 100 kHz. The 3D Bode-Phase plot (Fig. 4a) is corresponding with the frequency, voltage and phase angle. As the cationic redox reaction occurs at the beginning of charging, the phase angles in the frequency range of 1–100 Hz become bigger. With the reaction stabilizing and the reduction of charge, the charge transfer resistance become smaller. After charging to 3.5 V, the phase angles in the frequency range of 1–100 Hz become bigger again till 4.0 V which is corresponding with the occurrence of Ni3+/Ni4+ and anionic redox reaction. These phenomena are also revealed by vertical views of differential Nyquist plots as shown in Fig. 4b. The bar-colorimetric card from blue to red is corresponding with the value of d(-Z’’)/d(Z’). The higher the slope of the impedance semicircle is, the bluer the color is. The Nyquist plots of NLMNC cathode at different selected voltages are also exhibited in Fig. 4c. The trend mentioned above can also be well observed. The anionic redox reaction at high voltage is the main reason for the increase of impedance."

After charging to 4.3 V, there is a slight shift of Li 1 s peak to 55 eV as exhibited in Fig. 6b. There is no peak of honeycomb-ordered superstructure (Fig. 6e). This phenomenon may be related to Li ions migrating from the transition metal site to the alkali site in the interlayer during the charging process. The Li 1 s peak stables at about 55 eV after discharging to 2.1 eV (Fig. 6c). The peak of honeycomb-ordered superstructure cannot be recovered. The loss of superstructure peak may be originated from the loss of honeycomb ordering corresponding with the migration of Mn ions. By virtue of the migration of Li+ from the metal oxide layer to the interlayer during cycling, the Li+ act as a pillar for ensuring the interlayer spacing which can reduce the interaction of OO and enhance the cycling stability. The schematic diagram of NLMNC cathode during cycling is shown in Fig. 6 g. After initial cycling, the Li+ migrate from the transition metal oxide layer to the interlayer corresponding with the Li+ can play the part of pillar in the interlayer during later cycling. In addition, the electrons remove from O 2p non-bonding also resulting from the vacancies from the migration of Li ions.",
                        "The charge transfer mechanism of NLMNC cathode with outstanding electrochemical performance was further revealed by ex-situ XPS. Ex-situ XPS of Mn 2p of NLMNC is shown in Fig. S3. During the charge process, the intensity of Mn4+ increases. Till 4.3 V, the Mn 2p peaks are almost full of Mn4+. Then the intensity of Mn4+ decreases with the discharge process. Furthermore, ex-situ XPS of Ni 2p and Cu 2p of NLMNC cathode at different charge/discharge states were performed for understanding the change of surface elemental composition of NLMNC as exhibited in Fig. 7a–b. During the first cycle, Mn keeps the state of +4. It is revealed that Ni2+ is gradually oxidized to Ni3+ and Ni4+ during the charge process and the intensity of Ni2+ and Ni3+ increases during the discharge process. There is a shift of the XPS results of Cu 2p corresponding with the oxidation of Cu2+ to Cu3+. Such change is related to the riveting of Li+, which can promote the oxidation of Cu. In addition, the valence state change can suppress the Jahn–Teller distortion of Cu2+. With the aim of exploring the state of oxygen, ex-situ XPS of O is at different charge/discharge states are tested and the results are shown in Fig. 7c. The orange line in O 1 s ex-situ XPS peak is corresponding with lattice O2− and the blue line is related to the surface species such as the carbonate and CO/C = O species. During the charge process (beginning at 4.0 V), the new peaks observed at around 532.5 eV are assigned to the formation of peroxo O− with the oxidation of lattice oxygen. During the discharge process, the intensity of peroxo O− gradually decreases, which exhibits the anionic redox reaction is highly reversible. Such phenomenon is different form the anionic redox reaction corresponding with the electrons removing from O 2p in the eg* (Ni–O) states of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 .",
                        "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to reveal the reaction mechanism of NLMNC. The results are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S4. By virtue of the addition of Cu, the valence state of Mn is enhanced which stabilize the Mn ions in the structure. This phenomenon is related to the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+. It can be observed that the valence states of Mn during cycling change a lot. In addition to Mn becoming stable, Ni ions also become stable. The anionic redox reaction corresponding with the electrons removing from O 2p in the eg* (Ni–O) states is hard to occur. It reveals that the anionic redox reaction will occur near the Mn ions. These results tally with the electrochemical processes. The Li+ ions migrate from the metal oxide layer to the interlayer during the first cycling process and this process leave vacancy in the metal oxide layer which is correlated with the formation of O 2p non-bonding. This process can control the fast electron loss of Ni ions. All in all, the DFT results show that the anionic redox reaction occurs close to Mn ions corresponding with the O 2p non-bonding rather than the electrons removing from eg* (Ni–O) states.",
                        "It is acknowledged that the electronic configuration of Cu2+ is (t2g)6(eg)3 which is high-spin and unstable. While the electronic configuration of Cu3+ is (t2g)6(eg)2 which is more stable than Cu2+. It is also can be compared by octahedral-site stabilization energy (OSSE) (OSSE=octahedral CFSE - tetrahedral CFSE, crystal field stabilization energies (CFSE)). Here, octahedral-site stabilization energy (OSSE) (OSSE=octahedral CFSE - tetrahedral CFSE, crystal field stabilization energies (CFSE)) is mentioned to compare the stability of different valence states. The crystal field stabilization energies (CFSE) of 3d transitional metals can be determined through Eq. (2):(2)",
                        "C F S E = x E ( d ε ) + y E ( d γ ) + ( n 2 − n 1 ) Pwhere x, y, n2 and n1 refer to the number of electrons in dε, the number of electrons in dγ, the number of electron pairs in d orbital of complex and the number of electron pairs in d orbital of 3d transitional metals, respectively. P stands for the pairing energies which is ignored in calculation for simplicity. The Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn can also be explained by OSSE. For Mn3+ and Mn4+, the calculated OSSE are −0.422Δo and −0.844Δo (Δo Refers to octahedral-site splitting) leading to better stability of Mn4+. Put in simple terms, Mn3+ ions tend to be more stable in tetrahedral site while Mn ions stand in octahedral site in the structure of P2 phase. Hence, the valence state of Mn increasing is beneficial for stabling the structure by virtue of the low valence state of Cu and Li. It is acknowledged that the electronic configuration of Cu2+ is (t2g)6(eg)3 which is high-spin and unstable. While the electronic configuration of Cu3+ is (t2g)6(eg)2 which is stabler than Cu2+. After calculating, the OSSE of Cu2+ and Cu3+ are −0.422Δo and −0.844Δo. The higher the absolute value of OSSE, the more stable the structure is. Hence, the cycling stability of NLMNC is also enhanced by virtue of the addition of Li which can promote the reduction of Cu. Here, there is one more point which is also important needing to be mentioned that the same transition metal ion with different valence states and OSSE own different performances."

                        "Air stability is another critical factor for these layered oxide cathodes. The structure and electrochemical performance of NLMNC sample after stored in air for 7 days were characterized and tested. There is no new peak shown in the result of XRD revealing the good air stability (Fig. 9a). The honeycomb-ordered superstructure peak is also shown at about 22 ° In addition, the morphology is also reserved well confirmed by the SEM in Fig. 9b. The rate and cycling performances for both samples is shown in Fig. 9c. The rate performance of NLMNC sample after stored in air for 7 days is almost the same as pristine NLMNC sample. The rate performance of NLMNC sample after stored in air for 7 days at 200 mA g−1 is a little worse than pristine NLMNC sample. It may be related to the small amounts of H2O and CO2 reacting with NLMNC sample corresponding with H+ ions block the interlayer of NLMNC sample. The cycling performance NLMNC sample after stored in air for 7 days almost overlays with that of the pristine one at 20 mA g−1. These results indicate the NLMNC cathode owns good air stability which is suitable for preparation, storage and transportation in the industry."

                "In summary, NMNC sample and NLMNC sample were prepared via hydrothermal method and calcination. The NLMNC sample exhibits the honeycomb-ordered superstructure that one Li-ion surrounded by six transition-metal atoms. Both samples display a homogeneous polyhedra hollow structure which is related to low volume change and good structural stability. By virtue of the introduction of Li+, the Jahn–Teller distortion of NLMNC is suppressed due to the increased average valence state of Mn, which optimizes its cycling performance. The outstanding electrochemical performances are related to Li+ migrating from the metal oxide layer to the interlayer corresponding with the promotion of the Cu redox and the Li+ can play the part of pillar in the interlayer. Owing to the electrons removing from O 2p non-bonding by the addition of Li ions and honeycomb-ordered superstructure, the oxygen release and structural failure by electrons removing from eg* (Ni–O) states are suppressed. DFT results also reveal these mechanisms that the anionic redox reaction occurs close to Mn ions corresponding with the O 2p non-bonding rather than the electrons removing from eg* (Ni–O) states. In addition, the co-substituted strategy can enhance the air stability. It is hoped that this co-substituted strategy will provide guidance for future work. Some other inactive elements, such as Ti, Zn, Sn, etc., can also be attempted to be added for stabilizing the oxide and playing the part of pillar. We believe that such outstanding NLMNC cathode will lead the way for practical application of layered oxides in SIBs."
