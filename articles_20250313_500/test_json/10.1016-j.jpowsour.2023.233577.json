                "Graphite, the most prominent anode material for Li-ion battery, exhibited very poor performance in sodium ion battery. The electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions in graphite is impeded due to smaller interlayer spacing. Here, we have reported ASR derived hard carbon as a suitable anode electroactive material for Na-ion battery. Prepared via single step selective thermal transformation, the hard carbons contain defects, heteroatoms, nanopore, and ordered carbon zones with expanded interlayer spacing.

Although Li-ion battery is currently dominating the energy market, yet it falls short to meet the growing large scale energy storage system (EES) demand.

                "Rechargeable Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are considered one of the propitious energy storage systems which can help and give a solution to eradicate the environmental alterations caused by excessive fossil fuels consumption. It is the time demand that we should divert our choice of energy consumption from fossil fuels to renewable energy, produced from sources like wind, tidal wave, solar etc. Most of the renewable energy producing systems use interim energy storage systems to store the energy and then integrate with the main electrical power system [,]. NIB could be a better candidate for using as interim energy storage device in the large-scale energy storage system due to their excellent features like cost-effectiveness, safety, energy density, and portability [,]. To the greatest extent, now a days the major portion of NIBs research is focused on positive electrode materials of NIBs. In this article, importance has been given to a new possible anode material for NIBs which has been fabricated using the hard carbons synthesised from automotive shredder residue (ASR). The primary perspective of this study is to introduce the ASR as a potential source of carbon materials for energy storage systems and elucidate the electrochemical performance of the hard carbons synthesised from ASR as an anode material in Na-ion battery.",
                "From the beginning of Li-ion battery (LIB) commercialisation, graphite has been used as anode material in LIBs. The performance of graphite as anode material in LIBs is quite satisfactory. But graphite garnered a poor reputation when used as anode material in NIB. The interlayer spacing of graphite (0.335 nm) is not suitable for Na+ ion insertion during the electrochemical sodiation process [ ]. The reversible capacity of graphite as anode material in NIB is",
                "< 35mAhg−1 [ ,]. Limitation of graphite as anode material in NIB has paved the way for other carbonaceous materials to be used as anode material in NIBs. For instance, various kind of non-graphitic carbonaceous materials like hard carbons [, , ], soft carbons, and amorphous carbons have been tested as anode material in NIBs [, , , , ]. Among all these carbonaceous materials, hard carbons have grasped the special attention due to their high thermal stability, low cost, and availability [ , ]. Hard carbons are consisted of randomly oriented microdomains and loosely stacked layer of graphene with larger interlayer spacing than the graphite [ ]. In hard carbons, the Na+ ion can easily store in expanded graphite layer, defects at the graphene plane, and nanovoids in between randomly stacked graphite layer. The large interlayer spacing of hard carbons acts as buffer during Na+ ion insertion, because it helps to avoid the volume changes caused by Na+ ion insertion. On the contrary soft carbons have smaller amount of nanovoids and lesser interlayer spacing in comparison with hard carbons. Though the soft carbons contain some amount of turbostratic carbon, the Na+ ion storage in soft carbon is lower than the hard carbon. The situation is much worse for graphite. The orderly stacked graphene layer and the absence of nanovoids allow graphite to store very few amount of Na+ ions at the graphene edges [ ]. The unique microstructure of hard carbons facilitates the sodiation/desodiation process in NIB during electrochemical operation. Recent studies on hard carbons say that most of the hard carbons provide specific capacities between 200mAh/g to 300mAh/g as anode material in NIB [ , , ].",
                "In this work an attempt has been made to synthesis hard carbons from ASR and use them as anode active material in NIB. Around 50 million ton of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) are generated per year which is responsible for producing approximately 50 million ton of waste per year [ ,]. Usually, ELVs contain 70–75% ferrous metal, 5% non-ferrous metal, and 20–25% automotive shredder residue (ASR) []. It is projected that by the end of 2030 the amount ASR will reach 9 million ton [ ]. Abandoning landfilled ASR is a serious threat to the environment due to the presence of various organic compounds in ASR. ASR usually contains plastic (35–55%), rubber (10–20%), wood (15–40%), and textile and other materials (5–15%). Recovery of potential value-added materials like plastic, rubber, and biomass have been turned into the topic of research now a days [ , , , , , ]. The recovered value materials are used for manufacturing of composite filler, thermosetting filler, fuel synthesis, etc. Synthesis of carbonaceous materials from ASR is a unique, sustainable, and innovative timely concept to use as anode material feedstock for sodium ion battery. In this study, three carbon materials were synthesised from ASR at 700 °C, 900 °C, and 1100 °C. The hard carbon derived from ASR at 1100 °C (ASR-11) showed better electrochemical performance compared to other anodes. This hard carbon exhibited high initial reversible capacity of 434mAh/g at 10 mA/g and hold a capacity retention of 53% after 100 cycles. The material's performance parameters reported here as anode active material in NIB are on par with the currently used carbon materials synthesised from different sources. Table 1 summarised the performances of some carbon materials from existing literature and the performance of ASR derived hard carbon as anode material in Na-ion battery."

With temperature the specific surface area decreases drastically and becomes 9.80 m2/g at 1100",
                "°C. The specific surface area decreases mainly due to elimination of micropores from the hard carbons. Along with pore elimination, the internal ordering of the carbon atoms at higher temperature is also responsible for the decrease in specific surface area. The evolution of micropores and mesopores can be defined in the following ways. The presence of micropores at 700",
                "°C might be due to the poor structural ordering of carbon (C–C) aromatic structures.",
                "With increasing temperature, graphene layers grow, and some carbon atoms leave the lattice via COx formation. These high temperature chemicals and structural consequences were responsible for mesopore formation. Besides, the rotation of ordered carbon layers might also be responsible for mesopore evolution [ ]. The elimination of micropores and evolution of mesopores help in achieving high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of anode during electrochemical operation. The reason is, elimination of micropores decreases the surface area leading to lower volume of electrochemically active areas, thus helped in formation of thin, stable, and uniform SEI layer [ ]. Fig. 2f demonstrates that with temperature the surface area of hard carbons decreased which helped in attaining high ICE of ASR-11A (ICE = 52.9%) compared with ASR-7A (ICE = 20.9%). Fig. 2(c, d, and e) depicts the Na NMR results of the hard carbons after charging and discharging. The Na NMR results have been illustrated here to reveal the electrochemical interaction of sodium in hard carbons. The NMR spectra reveal that the magnitude of the charge spectra is lower than that of the discharge spectra. This observation corroborates with measured capacity (Fig. 3a, b, and c) of the anodes where it is demonstrated that the charge capacity is lower than the discharge capacity. The diminished charge spectra and subsequent capacity loss can be assigned with the SEI layer formation at the hard carbon surface and trapping of Na in hard carbons []. The NMR spectra exhibits 4–6 Na active sites which can be described as: (i) The peak at -2 ppm can be assigned to Na2CO3. The use of carbonate in electrolyte preparation or the presence of carbonate in SEI layer could be responsible for the evolution of this peak; (ii) The broad NMR peak at −10 ppm can be attributed to NaPF6 or the fluoride salt present in the SEI layer; (iii) −12 ppm peak position can be assigned with the Na adsorption at the carbon surface; (iv) The NMR peak at −14 ppm can be attributed to nanopore filling of hard carbons with Na+ ions; (v) Anodes made from ASR-9 and ASR-11 show a shoulder peak at 10 ppm. This indicates that ASR-9 and ASR-11 have more active sites for Na+ ion storage than ASR-7. Careful observation of NMR spectra reveals that the discharge spectra only have the 10 ppm signal which means the active site at 10 ppm is completely cyclable. Therefore, it can be stated that Na can be completely extracted during charging from this active site. This phenomenon of reversibility of Na+ ion insertion and extraction can be assigned with Na+ ion intercalation at extended graphitic layers of hard carbons; (vi) The anode made from ASR-11 shows an additional peak at −18 ppm. This Na active site can be attributed to nanopore filling by Na+ ion. This indicates that ASR-11 has a different pore structure than the other hard carbons. BET results can be corroborated with the above explanation as it is indicated from BET results (Fig. 2g) that ASR-11 has maximum volume of mesopore. The NMR results indicate that ASR-11 has more Na active sites than the other hard carbons which helps ASR-11 to store more Na+ ions, culminating in higher capacity than the ASR-9 and ASR-7.",
                "The Raman spectra in Fig. 2b shows the Raman features of hard carbons. The Raman peaks at",
                "∼ 1340 cm−1 and",
                "∼ 1590 cm−1 of every sample can be associated with D-band and G-band respectively. The D-band shows up in the Raman spectra due to the presence of defects and/or pore in sp2 carbons. The G-band is the consequence of graphitic carbon. The concentration of defects and the purity of the crystals of hard carbons can be approximated via Raman band intensity ratio. The band ratio of every spectrum has been stated in Fig. 2b. The band ratio of the hard carbons gradually increases with increasing the temperature. The increasing trend of Raman band ratio (ID/IG) indicates the presence of defects along the graphene plane [ ]. The band ratio reveals that ASR-11 has maximum concentration of defects. However, there is no distinct definition which can be assigned to the defect sites present in the hard carbons. Usually, the defect sites are reactive dangling bond at the surface, vacancies/holes at the interior of carbon plane, Stone-Wales defects, curved graphene sheet, sp3 linked carbon, heteroatoms (metal and nonmetal) bonded to the carbons [ ,]. These defect-sites play an important role in sodiation potential particularly potential at the sloping region of potentiogram. The heterogenous environment (i.e., presence of heteroatoms, defects) of hard carbons enhances the electrochemical performances. The heteroatoms act as in situ dopants and create defect sites in host materials resulting in better adsorbility of sodium ions in defect sites []. The powerful bonding energy of interaction between Na+ ions and defects overcomes the van der Walls force between graphene layers which tremendously helps in Na+ ion intercalation in defect sites [ ].",
                "At this stage of discussion one legitimate question arises about the electrochemical performance of these hard carbons as anode materials in NIB. In the quest of finding the answer of the above interrogation, the hard carbons were punched into coin cells to use as electrode for evaluating the sodium storage performance as anode. Fig. 3a, b, and c display the potential profile (voltage Vs capacity profile) of all the hard carbons. The carbonisation temperature deeply influenced the shape of the profile. The profile is divided into two parts: (i) the sloping voltage profile (above 0.1V) related to heteroatom, defect sites, edges, and vacancies of the hard carbons, and (ii) the plateau voltage profile (",
                "∼ 0.1V) related to the ordered carbon and nanopore filling. All the hard carbons show different sloping voltage and plateau voltage capacity profile, which symbolises that the carbonisation temperature and the presence of active sites have their own individual effect on the shape of the potentiogram. Na+ ion binding energy with carbon is highest at defect and vacancy sites, which can be corelated to the potential at the sloping region [ , ]. Energetically it is in favor of Na+ ion to anchor at the defect sites as the defect sites contain low energy empty shells which can easily store extra electrons [ ]. Besides the Na+ ion diffusion in defect sites are much faster than the graphene sheets [ ]. Thus, it is accepted that sodiation at the initial stage of electrochemical operation is happened at the defect sites leading to rise of sloping potential before plateau potential. The sodiation at the plateau region occurs at low potential value. At such low voltage the sodium ion storage sites are characterised by low binding energy [ ]. Which indicates that the low voltage sodium ion storage occurs at the nanopores and between graphene layers because the graphene surface is considered energetically least favorable for Na+ ion intercalation [ , ]. In consequence it is rational to state that low potential Na+ ion storage occurs between graphene layers and at nanopore. The plateau capacity at",
                "∼ 0.1V is associated with the short range ordered carbon zone and nanopore filling of hard carbons. Higher carbonisation temperature increases the plateau capacity of the hard carbons which can be attributed to the presence of ordered carbons around the defects in hard carbons. The presence of homogenous contact plate inside the ordered carbon zone are beneficial for Na+ ion storage, creating the plateau capacity [ ]. Fig. 3d displays the initial capacity (sloping and plateau capacity) of all the anodes. With carbonisation temperature both the sloping capacity and plateau capacity are increased, which corroborates with the structural properties of hard carbons where it has been tried to demonstrate that with carbonisation temperature the amount of Na+ ion storage sites are increased. Nonetheless, it is clear from Fig. 3d that ASR-11 has the highest number of active sites for Na+ ion storage. However, it should be noted that increasing the carbonisation temperature may not always bring benefits for Na-ion battery. Higher carbonisation temperature causes horizontal growth (width (La)) of the graphene layers and increases the average number of graphene layers. If the graphene layers become overly large, Na+ ions need to diffuse through a longer diffusion path. Larger number of graphene layers and longer diffusion path limits the Na+ ion diffusion rate during electrochemical operation []. Besides, at higher temperature, the order of carbon atom rearrangement within the internal hard carbon structure is increased owing to the higher thermal energy. Consequently, the carbon atoms arrange themselves in a more orderly manner, causing a decrease in d-spacing [, ]. The decrease in intergraphene layer spacing hinders the Na+ ion transportation through the electrode material [ , ]. Appropriate La value of graphene layers not only boosts the electrochemical performance of anode materials, but also minimises the irreversible capacity loss of the battery. Considering the electrochemical performances and changes in structural properties of hard carbon with temperature, the maximum operational temperature during hard carbon synthesis in this study was kept at 1100",
                "°C.",
                "The TEM images in Fig. 4 reveal the structural and morphological evolution of ASR derived hard carbons. The morphological transformation of the hard carbon went through different carbonisation temperatures (700",
                "°C −1100",
                "°C) is displayed in Fig. 4a–c. The TEM images show that the carbon materials are neither ordered nor disordered, rather consist of several short range ordered carbon zone in the matrix of non-graphitic carbon, as anticipated for usual hard carbons. The ordered carbon zones consist of multi-layer short range stacked graphene, ranging from 2 to 10 layers. ASR-7 (Fig. 4a) is amorphous carbon, it composed of more disordered carbon than graphitised carbon. With increasing the carbonisation temperature, amount of graphitised carbon (Fig. 4b and c) increased which results in the formation of short range ordered carbon zone. Thus, the surface morphology indicates that the hard carbon synthesised from ASR is a mixture of ordered and disordered carbon. With increasing the carbonisation temperature, the number of ordered carbon zone increased. These short range ordered carbon zone helped in attaining better electrochemical performance. In Fig. 4a, the ASR-7 hard carbon exhibits a substantial lack of orderliness. The amount of short range ordered carbon is very low in ASR-7. Instead of having significant amount of short range ordered carbon, ASR-7 got bigger volume of disordered carbon (non-graphitic carbon). ASR-9 (Fig. 4b) has some short range ordered carbon zone, but the amount is lesser than the ASR-11. Lack of significant amount ordered carbon in ASR-7 and ASR-9 is most likely owing to the absence of enough energy for driving the growth of ordered carbon structure. Fig. 4c depicts that ASR-11 has more rumpled nanodomain of ordered carbon with expanded d-spacing than ASR-7 and ASR-9. Expanded interlayer spacing of hard carbons is favorable for Na+ ion intercalation and deintercalation during electrochemical operation [ ]. The better electrochemical performances of ASR-11A corroborate with improved structural and morphological features of ASR-11. Electrochemical information provided in Fig. 3d shows that ASR-11A has the highest plateau capacity among all the anodes. Which means, the rumpled nanodomain with large interlayer spacing enabled ASR-11A to attain high plateau capacity. From the literature till now it is demonstrated that the large d-spacing of hard carbon is thermodynamically preferable for Na+ ion storage. And the presence of rumpled and short-range ordered carbon zones (TEM images in Fig. 4) contribute to the plateau capacity of potentiogram. Besides, the randomly distributed amorphous regions (disordered/non-graphitic carbon) contain huge amount of nanovoids which help in Na+ ion storage during the electrochemical operation of the anode.",
                "The potential profile of the anodes is displayed in Fig. 3a, b, and c. The very first discharge capacity of ASR-7A, ASR-9A, and ASR-11A are 311.9mAh/g, 359.1mAh/g, and 434.2mAh/g respectively. The large capacity value of ASR-11A indicates the presence of more active sites for Na+ ion storage in ASR-11A than ASR-7A, and ASR-9A. These active sites are defects, edges, pore, and ordered carbon layers [ ]. In the case of first discharge capacity, the capacity at",
                "∼ 0.1V increases with temperature. The plateau capacity of ASR-11A and ASR-9A can be related with Na+ ion insertion into expanded interlayer spacing and nanopore [ ]. The plateau capacity of ASR-7A is very low in comparison with ASR-11A and ASR-9A. The reason for low plateau capacity of ASR-7A could be the presence of lower volume of mesopore and absence of extended interlayer spacing. The first charge capacity of ASR-7A, ASR-9A, and ASR-11A are 65.4mAh/g, 147.3mAh/g, and 230.1mAh/g respectively. The corresponding coulombic efficiency (CE) of first cycle of the anodes are 20.9%, 41.1%, and 52.9% for ASR-7A, ASR-9A, and ASR-11A respectively. Though the ICE is increased with temperature, still the value is low. This indicates the high trapping ratio of Na+ ions in hard carbons during first cycle. In this consequence, the micropores at the surface of hard carbons or between the graphene sheets can be accused for trapping Na+ ions and result in low CE and capacity loss [ ]. Correlation of the ICE value with BET result, reveals that ASR-7 has the highest volume of micropores and low ICE (20.9%). On the contrary, ASR-11 has the lowest volume of micropores and high ICE (52.9%).",
                "From the potential profiles (Fig. 3a, b, and c) of all the anodes, it is clearly seen that a large irreversibility exists between the first charge and discharge cycle. The calculated irreversible capacity loss of anodes after first cycle is 79.2%, 50.1%, and 46.9% for ASR-7A, ASR-9A, and ASR-11A respectively. The irreversible capacity loss of the anodes after first cycle is related to the SEI (solid electrolyte interface) layer formation [ , ]. Along with the SEI layer, the high irreversible capacity loss of ASR-7A (79.2%) can be assigned to the structural disorderliness of carbon in ASR-7 [ ]. The cycling performances of the anodes at 10 mA/g up to 100 cycles were measured and displayed in Fig. 4d. It is acknowledged that ASR-11A provides highest capacity (434.2mAh/g) and capacity retention (",

Though the ICE (52.9%) of ASR-11A is low, but with cycle number the CE increases and goes beyond 95%. ASR-11A exhibits better electrochemical performance than the ASR-7A and ASR-9A, thus the rate performance of only ASR-11A at different current density (10 mA/g to 100 mA/g to 10 mA/g) is displayed in Fig. 4e. With increasing the current density, the capacity of ASR-11A decreases and becomes",
                "∼ 70mAh/g at 100 mA/g. When the current density is reset to 10 mA/g, the capacity increases again and reaches to",
                "∼ 210mAh/g. This capacity recovery phenomenon indicates that ASR-11A possess good rate capability and material tolerance to fast Na+ ion insertion/extraction. The electrochemical kinetics of the anodes after 10 cycles are depicted via electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in Fig. 4f. All the EIS spectra show one semicircle succeeded by a liner slope at lower frequency region. The semicircle of the EIS spectrum is usually considered to be responsible for the combined resistance offered by SEI layer (RSEI; lower frequency range) and charge transfer (Rct; higher frequency range). The liner slope is usually associated to Warburg impedance related with solid state Na+ ion diffusion. In addition, the first intercept of the EIS spectrum with X-axis is considered as ion diffusion resistance (Re) in electrolyte [ ]. The calculated Re value of the ASR-7A, ASR-9A, and ASR-11A are approximately 18",

This lower resistance of ASR-11A can be assigned to the suitable short range ordered carbon zone with expanded interlayer spacing where Na+ ion can get easily stored during cyclic operation. The low electrochemical resistance value of ASR-11A corroborates with its highest discharge capacity, better rate and cyclic performances compared to other anodes. Moreover, the presence of heteroatoms also influences the EIS spectrum. The presence of heteroatoms increases the conductivity of the carbons (effects of the presence of heteroatoms are discussed in section 4) which results in lower electrochemical resistance, better electrochemical performance [ , , ].",
                "In conclusion of electrochemical performance of ASR derived hard carbon it can be stated that ASR-7A showed poor electrochemical performance owing to the lack of active sodium ion storage sites. On the contrary ASR-11A showed admirable electrochemical performance due to the presence of active sodium ion storage sites like defects, short range ordered carbon zone with large inter layer spacing, and nanopore."

                "The hard carbons used in this research work store the Na+ ions during electrochemical operation usually via three mechanisms: insertion/intercalation of Na+ ions, alloying of Na+ ions or conversion of Na+ ions. These mechanisms have been discussed here briefly. Insertion or intercalation of Na+ ions in hard carbon is defined as storage of Na+ ions inside the hard carbon without affecting the crystalline parameters of the hard carbon (the schematic of Na insertion has been displayed in Fig. 5a). When Na+ ions are inserted into the hard carbon, it forces some of the electrons to leave the structure. This indicates that the hard carbons must possess some atoms (heteroatoms) which are easily oxidised and reduced, and the hard carbons must possess moderate electrical conductivity. One important aspect of Na+ ions intercalation must be mentioned, for Na+ ions insertion, the hard carbons must possess expanded interlayer spacing. Because, the diameter of Na+ ions (0.204 nm) is pretty big for accommodating in interlayer spacing of graphite (0.335 nm), thus Na+ ions hardly creates stagged compounds with perfectly ordered carbon (i.e. graphite) [ ]. The TEM images (Fig. 4a–c) display that the hard carbons have large interlayer spacing where they can easily store Na+ ions. Expanded interlayer spacing facilitates Na+ ions intercalation and deintercalation during electrochemical operation [ ]. The Na+ ions insertion into hard carbons can be expressed via the following equation.1",
                "y N a + + y e − + C → N a y C",
                "The elemental characterisation (Table 2, Table 3) reveals that the hard carbon contains a significant number of heteroatoms (i.e., Si, N, Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, etc.). Heteroatoms like Si and N, from group number 14 and 15 can react with the Na+ ions and form intermetallic compounds which are considered as alloying or dealloying of these elements with Na. These alloying or dealloying of heteroatoms with Na+ ions increase the specific capacity because one single atom can anchor multiple Na atoms. The alloying or dealloying reaction of these elements with Na+ ions has been stated below.2",
                "M ( = S i , N , a n dSe t c . ) + y N a + + z e − → N a y M",

                "M y X z + ( n z ) N a + + ( n z ) e − → y M + z N a n X",
                "Here, X in compounds MyXz, and NanM represents halide, phosphide, or metal hydride. With increasing the atomic number of electropositive elements, the M-X bond becomes more ionic and strong, thus irreversible capacity loss increases causing low ICE []. One point must be mentioned here that the presence of large heteroatoms (e.g., Al, Si, Ti, Ca, Mg, etc.) in hard carbons may cause stress and form cracks. The continuous exposure of the cracked surface to the electrolyte during electrochemical operation results in the formation of new SEI layers. As a result, the cyclic stability and reversibility of electrochemical reactions may decrease [].",
                "However, the presence of heteroatoms leads to achieve favorable binding energy (negative binding energy) for sodium ion storage into graphene sheets []. Heteroatoms like Al (electron acceptor), Si (isovalent), and N (electron donor) act as in situ dopants and influence the property of hard carbons. In Si–C and Al–C system, C being more electronegative than the Si and Al, C drags the outer shell electrons of Si and Al towards it. As a result, negative charge localises around the neighboring C atoms of Si and Al in the graphene sheets []. In consequence strong interaction between sodium atom and graphene sheet grows up around the heteroatoms. Along with the negative charge localisation, Al also creates holes (act as p-type dopants) in the host lattice which improves the electrical conductivity of the hard carbons by increasing carrier mobility. However, for N the situation is different than p-type dopants and isovalents (Si). Nitrogen, being more electronegative than the carbon, it draws the electrons from carbon's outer shell towards itself and induces polarisation in adjacent carbon network []. Thus, nitrogen localises negative charge around itself making the neighboring carbon atoms to become positively charged. However, the doping behavior of N depends on its bond configuration with carbon atoms. Nitrogen usually shows three bond configurations [ ]: (i) graphitic/quaternary (n-type), (ii) pyridinic (p-type), and (iii) pyrrolic (p-type). Due to in plane bond formation with carbon atoms, graphitic nitrogen contributes electron to the",
                "π network of surrounding carbon atoms and act as an n-type dopant. On the contrary, pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen being bonded with carbons at defect sites behave as p-type dopant due to their electron withdrawing tendency from the carbon network. However, all these types of nitrogen increase the carrier concentration. Oxygen is a very strong electronegative element; thus, it is quite impossible for oxygen to form substitutional doping in graphene sheet. But, the presence of oxygen containing functional groups (CO, C–O–C, C–OH, COOH/COOR, etc.) in carbon is considered as oxygen doping [ ]. The covalent bonding of oxygen containing functional groups converts sp2 carbon into sp3 carbon, leading to distortion in graphene sheet. In consequence of structural alteration, the conductivity of carbons reduces due to an increase in the amount of sp3 hybridisation carbons. Along with the above nonmetallic elements, the hard carbon contains some metallic elements like Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, etc. All these metallic elements are electropositive than carbon and have electron deficiency at their valance shell. Owing to electron deficiency, these metallic elements act as electron acceptors and create holes in the lattice, thus inducing p-type doping effects in the hard carbon lattice. However, due to bigger atomic size, the presence of these metallic elements creates distortion and defects in the lattice (visual representation of lattice deformation is shown in Fig. 5c). Along with heteroatoms, vacancy also plays an important role in Na+ ions storage. The defective sp-bonded carbons in vacancy, develop negative charges around themselves, create favorable locations for binding sodium atoms. Strong binding energy between Na+ ions and vacancy defects favor the Na+ ions intercalation, as a result, Na+ ions easily get anchored at vacancy defect sites. When sodium intercalates at the defect sites, the carbon pulls the valence electron density of sodium towards the carbon ring. In consequence, electron density difference rises between sodium and carbon ring making the bond ionic in nature [,]. Moreover, the vacancy defects enhance the Na+ ions insertion into hard carbons during electrochemical operation and this phenomenon can be associated with the capacity at sloping region.",
                "Functional groups play heavyweight performances like anchoring the heteroatoms at the surface of hard carbons via electrostatic interaction/Van der Waals force/",
                "π − π stacking/covalent bond formation []. Alongside heteroatoms, the sodium atoms might have been anchored by the oxygen containing functional groups at the carbon surface and lead to achieve high specific capacity. These oxygen containing functional groups anchored the Na+ ions via surface redox reaction during electrochemical operation []: -CO + Na+ + e− = -C-O-Na. Therefore, this surface redox reaction contributes to electrochemical energy storage of NIB. Besides, presence of oxygen containing functional groups leads to expansion in graphene layers with increased interlayer spacing [ ]. The attachment of the functional groups at both the sides of graphene layer gives rise to distortion in interlayer structure and localised small range ordered carbon domain with expanded interlayer spacing by breaking down the long-range graphitic order. Here one point must be mentioned that it’s not only the functional groups, which are responsible for enlarging the interlayer spacing, in addition, the intercalation of heteroatoms at the middle of graphite sheet are also responsible for increasing the interlayer spacing (the schematic related to interlayer expansion and distortion of graphene plane due to the presence of heteroatoms and functional groups have been displayed in Fig. 5d). It is reported that the electrochemical insertion of Na+ ions in ordered graphite is thermodynamically impractical but Na+ ions insertion in large interlayer spacing is thermodynamically viable [ , ]. Large interlayer spacing makes it easy for the Na+ ions to move freely between two graphene layers and offers more space for Na+ ions storage which ultimately contributes to the plateau capacity of the potentiogram. Finally, yet importantly, nanopores are one of the most important structural features of hard carbons. From the BET result it is demonstrated that the hard carbons synthesised in this study contain nanopores. Owing to low binding energy, nanopores have been acted as preferable Na+ ion storage sites in hard carbons. Fig. 5b displays the visual representation of Na+ ion storage in expanded graphene layer and nanopore."

                "In a nutshell, this article illustrates the feasibility of using ASR derived hard carbon as anode material in Na-ion battery. The consequences of carbonisation temperature and the influences of the presence of various heteroatoms and defects on the electrochemical properties of anode materials are utterly discussed here. Among all the anodes, ASR-11A exhibits better electrochemical performances owing to its extended interlayer spacing, presence of heteroatoms, oxygen containing functional groups, numerous defects, edges, and nanopores. The proposition of converting ASR into hard carbon can establish a new paradigm in the field of sodium ion batteries regarding the quest for optimal carbon active material and their sources. Moreover, further tailoring of the carbon properties, such as tuning the surface area and regulating the growth of the short range ordered carbon zone with expanded interlayer spacing, may result in a better electrochemical performance of the battery. Low ICE and capacity loss are considered as two major drawbacks of using hard carbons in NIB. Further research can be conducted to reduce the trapping ratio of Na+ ions and the formation of thin, stable SEI layer ensuring high ICE and low-capacity loss. The ASR creates burden on the environment unless they are treated accordingly. However, ASR could be a valuable source for synthesising carbonaceous materials for using as carbon active material in rechargeable batteries. The utilisation of ASR in rechargeable batteries, such as Na-ion batteries, will help to overcome the harsh impact caused by landfilled ASR and, alongside, ensure material sustainability."
