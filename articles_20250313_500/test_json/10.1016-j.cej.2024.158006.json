                "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) serves as an ideal anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), boasting a high theoretical specific capacity and large interlayer spacing. However, the substantial volume change and low conductivity present significant challenges in maintaining the electrochemical stability of the electrode. Herein, a novel semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) binder (sodium alginate-g-poly (acrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl acrylate)-boric acid, SA-PAHB) is synthesized by free radical copolymerization grafting and the multiple hydrogen bonding crosslinking (bond energies spanning from − 33.89 to − 45.49 kcal/mol by theoretical calculations), which can effectively mitigate stress in Na+ deintercalation in MoS2 anodes under the synergy of the unique structure of the SIPN, maintaining electrode stability. Simultaneously, the variable hydrogen bonding crosslinking and abundant –NH2 groups greatly facilitate Na+ diffusion and enhance kinetic performance. Leveraging the advantages of SA-PAHB, the electrochemical performance is significantly enhanced compared to traditional SA and grafted SA-based binders. Specifically, MoS2 anodes using SA-PAHB binder exhibit an initial discharge specific capacity of 772.1 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and retain 511.2 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 200 cycles, with no capacity loss. Additionally, an outstanding rate performance is achieved, delivering 378.5 mAh/g at 10 A/g. For sodium-ion coin full-cells, a discharge specific capacity of 125.2 mAh/g is maintained at 0.5 A/g after 50 cycles."

                "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), as an emerging energy storage technology, are gradually becoming a strong contender to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their advantages in resource abundance, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness [1], [2], [3]. SIBs demonstrate significant potential in electrochemical performance, safety, and large-scale energy storage applications, particularly in regions with abundant sodium resources [4], [5]. However, the larger ionic radius of sodium (Na+, 1.06 Å) compared to lithium ions hinders the exploration of anode materials and slows down the electrochemical reaction kinetics [6], [7]. Therefore, it is imperative to find an anode material for SIBs that offers high specific capacity, long cycle life, and superior rate capability. Researchers have made numerous efforts in this regard, including the introduction of 2D materials such as graphene [8], [9], transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) [10], [11], and MXenes [12]. In recent years, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), with its unique layered structure and high theoretical specific capacity (providing 670 mAh g−1 upon sodium intercalation), has been extensively studied as an anode material for SIBs [13], [14], [15]. The larger interlayer spacing of MoS2 (6.2 Å compared to 3.4 Å in graphite) facilitates the rapid intercalation and deintercalation of Na+, thereby enhancing the battery’s charge–discharge efficiency [16]. However, the significant volume change during sodium deintercalation and its low electrical conductivity can severely impair the electrochemical performance of SIBs [17].",
                "To mitigate the substantial volume changes of MoS2 and enhance its electron conductivity to improve the electrochemical performance of batteries, numerous modifications to the MoS2 anode material have been implemented, yielding quite favorable results. Such as single-atom cobalt-doped MoS2/carbon composites [18], polyvinylpyrrolidone-derived nitrogen-doped carbon-coated MoS2 composites [19], and Te-doping induced C@MoS2-xTex@C nanocomposites [20]. The commonality among these efforts is their relative complexity, high cost, and energy-intensive operations, which are not well-suited for transitioning from laboratory to industrial-scale production. Therefore, it is urgent to adopt a different approach that combines simplicity of operation, low cost, and environmental friendliness to enhance the electrochemical performance of MoS2 anode in SIBs.",
                "Binders, as an indispensable component of battery construction, have been proven to effectively act as a “bridge” between electrode components during the cyclic expansion and contraction of electrodes, maintaining electrode stability [21]. Water-based binders, in contrast to traditional PVDF binder, eliminate the use of organic solvents (N-methylpyrrolidone, NMP), significantly protecting the environment. Common water-based binders include polymers such as sodium alginate (SA) [22], [23], carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) [24], [25], guar gum (GG) [26], and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) [27]. Although these polymers possess abundant polar groups that can enhance adhesion and promote electrochemical performance, their inherent linear structure and monomolecular state render them “brittle” [26], [28]. Limited deformability and poor crack resistance of these binders can lead to skeletal damage when electrode materials undergo significant volume changes, resulting in a sharp decline in electrochemical performance. Recently, binders modified by grafting onto individual polymer molecules have been reported, such as alginate grafted with polyacrylamide (Alg-g-PAAm) [29], dopamine-modified carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-DOP) [30], and polyisoprene-graft-maleic anhydride (VPI-g-MA) [31]. Then, the introduction of small monomer units forming physical crosslinks demonstrate their robust versatility [32], [33]. These high-strain polymer binders not only accommodate the volume changes of electrodes but also effectively release the stress of electrodes through chain slippage and a variety of hydrogen bond interactions, thereby stabilizing the electrochemical performance of electrode materials.",
                "Inspired by this, a polymer binder (sodium alginate-g-poly (acrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl acrylate)- boric acid, SA-PAHB) has been designed for the MoS2 anode of SIBs. Abundant hydrogen bonds were introduced by grafting SA with an appropriate ratio of hard monomer acrylamide and soft monomer 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (sodium alginate-g-poly (acrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl acrylate), SA-PAH). The subsequent insertion of boric acid further forms a physical cross-link with SA, generating various hydrogen bond energy values (from − 33.89 to − 45.49 kcal mol−1) and a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) structure was ultimately formed. This effectively buffers the stress produced during the electrode expansion and contraction process, reducing the volume change of the electrode, as illustrated by Fig. 1a. This strategy, when applied to the anode materials of SIBs, significantly enhances the cycle life and rate capability of the MoS2 anode. Specifically, a discharge specific capacity of 511.2 mAh g−1 is maintained after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 (a capacity retention rate of over 100 %) and the rate performance is also excellent (378.5 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1), which are significantly superior to the electrochemical performance of traditional SA and the grafted SA-based binder. Concurrently, the SA-PAHB binder is equally applicable to sodium-ion full-cells, maintaining stable electrochemical performance. This study offers insights into the stress behavior of SIBs anodes and sets the stage for developing new binders suitable for anode materials with high specific capacities and significant volume expansion."

                        "The release of substantial internal stress in the electrodes during the charge–discharge process is particularly significant for anode materials with large volume changes. To reduce the stress generated during sodium deintercalation in MoS2 anodes in SIBs, a SIPN binder (SA-PAHB) was designed and synthesized. Under the introduction of the boronic acid, a quadruple hydrogen-bonding effect and borate ester bonds are established, firmly encapsulating the MoS2 anode and effectively mitigating its significant volume changes, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. To achieve this goal, a polymer, SA-PAH, was synthesized through graft copolymerization under typical free radical polymerization conditions. In addition, boronic acid, rich in polar groups (–OH), was introduced to form a SIPN, with the specific chemical reaction formula displayed in Fig. 1b.

                        "The successful synthesis of the SA-PAHB binder is characterized by FTIR and XRD, as shown in Fig. 2a, b. The peaks at 3266.6, 1589.4, 1403.6, 1083.8, and 1023.9 cm−1 correspond to the O − H stretching vibration, O = C − O (carboxylate) asymmetric vibrations, O = C − O symmetric vibrations, C-OH, and C − O − C asymmetric vibrations of SA, respectively [7]. The FTIR of the SA-PAH polymer synthesis process is presented in Fig. S2. Peaks at 3331.4 and 3162.1 cm−1 correspond to N-H stretching in the primary amide, peaks at 1654.2 and 1611.1 cm−1 are attributed to C = O and NH2 stretching, a peak at 1427.8 cm−1 is associated with C-N stretching, and 961.7 cm−1 corresponds to the C = C double bond of AM monomer [36], [29]. The peaks at 3429.8, 1725.2, 1178.9, and 984.2 cm−1 is assigned to the –OH stretching vibration, the O-C = O stretching vibration, the C-O-C stretching vibration, and the C = C double bond of HEA monomer, respectively [37]. After graft copolymerization, the C = C double bond peaks of the AM and HEA monomers disappear in SA-PAH, and the C-H stretching vibration peak shifts from 2930.8 cm−1 of SA to 2937.7 cm−1 of SA-PAH, indicating the formation of the SA-based graft copolymer [38]. Upon the introduction of boronic acid, the − OH stretching vibration peak of SA-PAHB broadened and shifted to a higher wavenumber of 3200.4 cm−1, compared to the − OH stretching vibration peak of SA-PAH at 3191.7 cm−1. This change, often referred to as a blue shift, occurs because the boronic acid interacts with the hydroxyl groups, forming new hydrogen bonds or other interactions that increase the bond energy of the − OH groups. Based on the above analysis, this suggests the formation of a physical cross-link structure. Concurrently, the asymmetric and symmetric vibration peaks of O = C − O, originally at 1610.9 and 1413.2 cm−1, moved to lower wavenumbers of 1602.2 and 1409.9 cm−1, respectively, confirming the occurrence of chemical bonds or hydrogen bonds between SA-PAH and boronic acid.",
                        "The XRD patterns of SA, SA-PAH, and SA-PAHB are shown in Fig. 2b. SA displays two amorphous peaks at 2θ = 13.4° and 21.9°. The XRD pattern of AM, presented in Fig. S3, reveals a crystalline structure. After free radical copolymerization grafting, the SA-PAH polymer also shows two distinct amorphous peaks, with shifts to 2θ = 13.7° and 22.4°, and a reduction in peak intensity. These shifts and intensity changes indicate the formation of chemical or hydrogen bonds between SA and the AM and HEA, as supported by the molecular weight (Mn) data from GPC in Fig. S4. The SA-PAHB polymer, which includes boronic acid, exhibits further weakening and merging of the amorphous peaks, with positions shifting to 2θ = 15.3° and 21.5°. This suggests additional chemical or hydrogen bonding between boronic acid and the SA-PAH polymer. Based on the above, we can confirm the successful synthesis of a SIPN of SA-PAHB binder. In addition, NMR spectroscopy tests were also used to confirm the successful synthesis of the SA-PAH and SA-PAHB polymers, as shown in Fig. S5.",
                        "To understand the physicochemical properties of the SA-PAHB polymer, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) tests were conducted to characterize the SA-PAHB and SA polymers, as shown in Fig. 2c, d, and Fig. S6. The variation curves of viscosity with shear rate are displayed in Fig. 2c and Fig. S6a. The viscosity of the SA-PAHB polymer decreases with the increase in shear rate, specifically from 2.03 to 0.05 Pa·S, indicating that the SA-PAHB polymer is a shear-thinning pseudoplastic non-Newtonian fluid. In contrast, the SA polymer exhibits a similar trend in viscosity with shear rate, but the viscosity value decreases from an initial 0.93 to 0.15 Pa·S. Additionally, the frequency-dependent viscoelastic modulus is presented in Fig. 2d and Fig. S6b, clearly confirming that the SA-PAHB polymer exhibits viscous behavior (loss modulus (G″) > storage modulus (G′)) across almost all frequencies, which is also verified by its tan δ value, indicating that the SA-PAHB polymer is controlled by an energy dissipation mechanism during the sample stretching. The SA polymer also exhibits similar viscous behavior, as shown in Fig. S6b. Based on the above, the SA-PAHB binder indicate its superior mechanical stability characterized by high viscosity and stress relaxation, which are crucial in maintaining the electrode's structural integrity during the sodiation and desodiation processes, as they prevent the detachment of active material from the current collector and accommodate the volume changes of the MoS2 anode, thereby contributing to the significantly improved cycling stability. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the SA, SA-PAH, and SA-PAHB polymers to characterize their thermal stability, as shown in Fig. S7. The results show that SA-PAHB has the highest thermal decomposition temperature, with an initial decomposition temperature of 226.9 ℃, which is higher than 208.7 ℃ for SA and 213.8 ℃ for SA-PAH. This suggests that the multiple hydrogen bond structure brought about by the SA-PAHB semi-interpenetrating network polymer contributes to enhancing the thermal stability of the polymer and also leads to a higher tensile strength of the SA-PAHB polymer (Fig. S8), which is beneficial for maintaining the stability of the electrode.",

A plausible explanation for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode to maintain a high specific capacity at different current densities could be the introduction of abundant –NH2 polar groups and the formation of multiple hydrogen bonding crosslinking, which, under their combined effect, favorably facilitate the rapid migration and diffusion of Na+ [39].",
                        "Cycle stability tests were conducted on MoS2 anodes with three different binders at 0.5 A g−1, as illustrated in Fig. 3c. The active material loading was controlled at approximately 0.7 mg, and initially activated for three cycles at 0.1 A g−1. The MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode contributed a discharge specific capacity of 496.1 mAh g−1 in the fourth cycle, and even a discharge specific capacity of 511.2 mAh g−1 could be maintained at 0.5 A g−1 after 200 cycles, corresponding to almost no decay rate per cycle. However, the MoS2-SA and MoS2-SA-PAH electrodes could only sustain discharge specific capacities of 282.9 and 426.1 mAh g−1, respectively, with capacity retention rates of 56.9 % and 98.9 % relative to the fourth cycle, indicating a decline in capacity. This is further corroborated by the trends observed in the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves in Fig. 3d and Fig. S13. Furthermore, the Coulombic efficiencies (CE) of MoS2-SA-PAHB, MoS2-SA-PAH, and MoS2-SA electrodes were evaluated and are presented in Fig. S14. The initial CE of MoS2-SA-PAHB and MoS2-SA-PAH electrodes are 73.7 % and 70.0 %, respectively, slightly lower than that of the MoS2-SA electrode at 78.5 %, likely due to the introduction of additional monomers causing increased side reactions. Subsequently, the CE of the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode rose to 96.3 % in the second cycle, surpassing that of MoS2-SA-PAH and MoS2-SA electrodes at 95.1 % and 95.3 %, respectively. Ultimately, the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode exhibited a stable average CE of 98.4 %, higher than the 98.1 % of MoS2-SA-PAH and 97.7 % of MoS2-SA electrodes, indicating that the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode has a higher efficiency for sodium-ion insertion and extraction throughout the charge–discharge cycles.",
                        "The reaction kinetics of the MoS2-SA, MoS2-SA-PAH, and MoS2-SA-PAHB electrodes are characterized through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Fig. 3e, the EIS of the three electrodes cycled are presented. In the high-frequency region, the semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). A smaller Rct radius signifies more rapid charge transfer and a lower level of polarization [40]. The slope of the curve in the low-frequency region corresponds to the diffusion coefficient of Na+, with a larger slope indicating a relatively high diffusion coefficient [41], [42]. Compared to the MoS2-SA and MoS2-SA-PAH electrodes, the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode exhibits a smaller Rct value in the high-frequency region and a larger slope in the low-frequency region, indicating a faster process of Na+ intercalation and deintercalation. Furthermore, to meet the practical needs of industrial production, higher loading of MoS2-SA-PAHB electrodes were obtained by applying a thicker coating of electrode slurry to achieve active material loadings of 1.0 and 1.2 mg. The MoS2-SA-PAHB (1.0 mg) and MoS2-SA-PAHB (1.2 mg) electrodes can achieve discharge specific capacities of 336.1 and 357.7 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 200 cycles, respectively, with corresponding capacity retention rates of approximately 72.7 % and 78.4 %, as shown in Fig. 3f and Fig. S15. Compared to the discharge specific capacity of 511.2 mAh g−1 and almost no capacity loss of the MoS2-SA-PAHB (0.7 mg) electrode, this suggests that the SA-PAHB binder can be used to prepare higher loading electrodes, which have promising prospects in practical production and life.",
                        "To further highlight the advantages of the SA-PAHB binder, electrochemical cycling performance tests were conducted on three different electrodes at a higher current density of 1 A g−1, as shown in Fig. S16. The MoS2-SA, MoS2-SA-PAH, and MoS2-SA-PAHB electrodes could maintain discharge specific capacities of 218.7, 364.8, and 427.8 mAh g−1 after 220 cycles, respectively, with corresponding capacity retention rates of 47.2 %, 86.4 %, and 93.2 % relative to the fourth cycle. This suggests that the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode is capable of stable cycling performance at both low and high current densities. In addition, cycle stability tests for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode at an ultra-high current density of 10 A g−1 were conducted, with 0.1 and 1 A g−1 used for activation for five cycles each, as shown in Fig. 3g. The results show that a discharge specific capacity of 267.4 mAh g−1 can be achieved for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode after 305 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention rate of 81.7 % relative to the eleventh cycle. As per the preceding discussion, we can confirm that the SA-PAHB binder has a fairly good effect in maintaining the electrochemical stability of the MoS2 anode of the SIBs, which may be due to the multiple hydrogen bond effects induced by its semi-interpenetrating network polymer structure. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode and its comparison with other relevant literature from five dimensions are displayed in Fig. 3h.",
                        "The electrochemical kinetic performance of MoS2 anodes with SA-PAHB and SA binders was assessed by analyzing cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (0.01–3.00 V versus Na/Na+, at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1), as illustrated in Fig. 4a and Fig. S17a. In the initial cycle of CV curves for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode, only cathodic peaks at approximately 0.01 V and 0.79 V were discernible, which are ascribed to Na+ intercalation, SEI layer formation, and the conversion of NaxMoS2 to Na2S/Mo [43], [44]. The CV curves demonstrated stability in the following two cycles, suggesting a highly reversible and stable sodiation/desodiation process. During the inaugural scan, two anodic peaks were identified at approximately 0.44 V and 1.55 V, which were less pronounced than the 0.94 V and 1.61 V (indicated by an arrow) of the MoS2-SA electrode (Fig. S17a), signifying improved Na+ extraction dynamics [18], [45].",
                        "Additionally, the reaction kinetics of the MoS2-SA-PAHB and MoS2-SA electrodes were examined by employing CV curves at varying scan rates (as shown in Fig. 4b and Fig. S17b). The relationship between the scan rate (v) and peak current (i) is delineated by Equations (1), (2) [46].(1)",
                        "i = a v b(2)",
                        "log i = log a + b log vwhere the parameters a and b represent the fitting constants. Here, i denotes the measured peak current (A), and v signifies the scan rate (mV s−1). The slope of the logi-logv plots corresponds to the b value, indicative of the electrochemical reaction mechanism. A b value around 0.5 indicates that diffusion-controlled behavior is predominant, whereas a b value close to 1 suggests that capacitive behavior is dominant [34]. The b values for the MoS2-SA-PAHB and MoS2-SA electrodes were computed, as depicted in Fig. 4c and Fig. S17c. The results reveal that the b value for each peak is approximately 0.9, suggesting that the sodium storage behavior is primarily governed by capacitive behavior. Equation (3) provides further elucidation on the contribution of capacitive behavior [46].(3)",
                        "i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2in this context, k1v represents the capacitive behavior, while k2v1/2 denotes diffusion-controlled behavior, with k1v and k2v1/2​ being distinct fitting parameters.",
                        "The trends in diffusion and capacitance contributions in the CV curves of the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode at scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7 mV s−1 are depicted as a three-dimensional histogram (Fig. 4d). With an increase in scan rate, there is a gradual rise in capacitive contribution and a corresponding decrease in diffusion contribution. Upon reaching a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, the percentage capacity contribution (highlighted in light blue) for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode is computed to be approximately 92.8 % (Fig. 4e), in comparison to 91.7 % of the MoS2-SA electrode (Fig. S17d). The percentages of capacitive behavior and diffusion-controlled behavior for the MoS2-SA-PAHB and MoS2-SA electrodes at varying scan rates are consolidated in Fig. 4f and Fig. S17e. The findings reveal that as the scan rate escalates from 0.1 to 1 mV s−1, the proportion of capacity contribution for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode amplifies from 81.4 % to 92.8 %, signifying an enhancement in pseudocapacitive behavior [43].",
                        "Moreover, the Nyquist plots of the EIS for the MoS2-SA-PAHB and MoS2-SA electrodes at various temperatures are illustrated in Fig. 4g, h, and Fig. S18. A semicircle, representing the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrodes, is discernible in the high-frequency region of the Nyquist plots. The equivalent circuit, derived from fitting the Nyquist plots, is incorporated in Fig. 4g and Fig. S18a, providing the numerical values of the Rct. The findings indicate that the Rct values of the MoS2-SA electrode at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55 ℃ are 7314.0, 3419.0, 1680.0, 898.8, 566.5, 341.3, and 233.8 Ω, respectively. Conversely, the Rct values of the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode at the identical temperatures are markedly lower, with corresponding values of 979.3, 520.9, 311.6, 195.7, 112.6, 77.5, and 56.0 Ω. This suggests a superior interfacial charge transfer for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode. To further ascertain the activation energy (Ea) for Na+ intercalation into MoS2, the Butler–Volmer equation and Arrhenius equation are employed collectively to compute the activation energy values during the deintercalation process of Na+ from the electrode. The associated calculation formulas are detailed in the supporting information. As depicted in Fig. 4i, the respective calculations and their fitting results suggest that the activation energy (Ea) for the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode is approximately 80.697 kJ mol−1, which is significantly lower than the 95.986 kJ mol−1 of the MoS2-SA electrode. This implies that the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode facilitates a more rapid transfer of Na+ [47], [48]."

                        "SEM analysis was utilized to examine the microstructure of MoS2-based electrodes prepared with SA, SA-PAH, and SA-PAHB binders, both before and after cycling, to investigate changes in surface morphology. The cycled MoS2-SA, MoS2-SA-PAH, and MoS2-SA-PAHB electrodes were disassembled in a glove box and then washed with dimethyl carbonate, with the resulting separator surfaces shown in Fig. S20. It can be clearly seen that some of the MoS2-SA electrode has fallen off and adhered to the separator, indicating that its inherent linear structure has weak adhesion. Conversely, no obvious electrode fallout was found adhering to the separator surface of the MoS2-SA-PAH and MoS2-SA-PAHB electrodes. The SEM images of the original surface morphology of the MoS2-SA, MoS2-SA-PAH, and MoS2-SA-PAHB electrodes are shown in the Fig. 5a, b, c. It can be observed that compared to the MoS2-SA electrode surface with more cracks and agglomeration and the MoS2-SA-PAH electrode surface with some agglomeration, the MoS2 and conductive agent (acetylene black) on the surface of the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode are more evenly distributed on the copper foil, with no obvious cracks. After the charge–discharge cycle, the MoS2-SA, MoS2-SA-PAH, and MoS2-SA-PAHB electrodes were disassembled for further observation. The results show that there is some electrode material falling off the MoS2-SA electrode (Fig. 5d and Fig. S21a), which can also be verified from Fig. S20a, and there are more obvious cracks on the surface of the MoS2-SA-PAH electrode (Fig. 5e and Fig. S21b). In contrast, the surface of the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode can still maintain a relatively uniform and crack-free state after cycled (Fig. 5f and Fig. S21c). This may be due to the multiple hydrogen bond effects of the SA-PAHB semi-interpenetrating network polymer binder that can tightly adhere MoS2, so that the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode will not undergo excessive expansion and contraction during the deintercalation of Na+. The SEM cross-sectional images of the electrodes before and after cycling can also prove that the SA-PAHB binder has a certain effect in maintaining the stability of the electrode. For the MoS2-SA-PAHB electrode, the electrode thickness increases from the original 8.27 um to 20.00 um after cycling (Fig. 5i, l), and the calculated expansion rate is 141.8 %, which is much lower than the 265.1 % of the MoS2-SA electrode (Fig. 5g, j) and 172.2 % of the MoS2-SA-PAH electrode (Fig. 5h, k). Therefore, this further confirms that the multiple hydrogen bond effects induced by the SA-PAHB semi-interpenetrating network polymer binder play a crucial role in suppressing the volume change of the MoS2-based electrode [49], [50]."

                        "To assess possible real-world applications, a sodium-ion coin full-cell was constructed using MoS2-SA-PAHB as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/C-PVDF as the cathode. The diagrammatic representation of the coin full-cell is illustrated in Fig. 6a. The CV curve of the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell at the second cycle is depicted in Fig. 6b, where a sharp peak of ∼ 2.64 V for the anodic sweep and ∼ 1.31, and ∼ 1.82 V for the cathodic sweep can be observed. These observations align with the charge–discharge plateau of the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell, which can be substantiated from the charge–discharge curves depicted in Fig. 6c. Concurrently, the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell achieves a relatively high initial coulombic efficiency of 74.4 %, and with the progression of charge–discharge activation, the coulombic efficiency gradually increases from 74.4 % (first cycle) to 91.3 % (third cycle). The cycle stability of the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell was evaluated, as illustrated in Fig. 6d. A discharge specific capacity of 125.2 mAh g−1 can be sustained at 0.5 A g−1 after 50 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention rate of 54.3 % relative to the fifth cycle, and an LED can be lighted up by the coin full-cell in the charged state. Besides, it can be observed that the trends of the charge and discharge specific capacity basically coincide in the Fig. 6d, indicating its relatively high coulombic efficiency. Based on this, the average coulombic efficiency of 96.9 % for the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell can be calculated. To understand the cycle stability of the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell at different current densities, a rate performance test was conducted, as shown in Fig. 6e. The results show that discharge specific capacities of 149.1, 128.9, 108.7, 90.1, and 70.0 mAh g−1 can be achieved, respectively, at current densities of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1 for the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell. After returning from 2 to 0.1 A g−1, a discharge specific capacity of 120.0 mAh g−1 can be obtained, which essentially restores its original discharge specific capacity, indicating that the MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3/C coin full-cell has good reversibility. Given these results, the SA-PAHB binder demonstrates promising potential for practical application in sodium-ion full-cell."

                "In conclusion, a new SA-PAHB binder is prepared through free radical copolymerization grafting and multiple hydrogen bonding crosslinking. The binder is applied to the MoS2 anode of sodium-ion battery half-cells and full-cells. The SA-PAHB, with its semi-interpenetrating network structure, is capable of forming multiple hydrogen bonds, generating hydrogen bond values ranging from –33.89 to −45.49 kcal mol−1 as calculated by DFT, which is beneficial for maintaining the stability of MoS2-based electrodes and effectively suppressing the volume changes during the sodiation and desodiation processes. Moreover, the rich polar groups –NH2 and the variable hydrogen bonding crosslinking points contained in the SA-PAHB binder can effectively promote the rapid diffusion of Na+ and enhance the kinetic performance of the MoS2-based electrodes. Compared to traditional linear structured SA and the grafted SA-based binder (SA-PAH), the electrochemical performance of MoS2 anode using the SA-PAHB binder, whether in half-cells or full-cells, is significantly improved. In light of the aforementioned, we are confident that the SA-PAHB semi-interpenetrating network polymer is an ideal binder for the MoS2 anode, for both half-cells and full-cells of SIBs."
