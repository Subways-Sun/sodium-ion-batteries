                "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is gifted with fast Na+ conductive NASICON structure. But it still suffers from low electronic conductivity and inadequate energy density. Herein, a high-entropy modification strategy is realized by doping V3+ site with Ga3+/Cr3+/Al3+/Fe3+/In3+ simultaneously (i.e. Na3V2−x(GaCrAlFeIn)x(PO4)3; x  = 0, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08) to stimulate the V5+⇋V2+ reversible multi-electron redox. Such configuration high-entropy can effectively suppress the structural collapse, enhance the redox reversibility in high working voltage (4.0 V), and optimize the electronic induced effect. The in-situ X-ray powder diffraction and in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests efficaciously confirm the robust structural recovery and far lower polarization throughout an entire charge-discharge cycle during 1.6–4.3 V, respectively. Moreover, the density functional theory calculations clarify the stronger metallicity of high-entropy electrode than the bare that is derived from the more mobile free electrons surrounding the vicinity of Fermi level. By grace of high-entropy design and multi-electron transfer reactions, the optimal Na3V1.7(GaCrAlFeIn)0.06(PO4)3 can exhibit perfect cycling/rate performances (90.97%@5000 cycles@30 C; 112 mA h g−1@10 C and 109 mA h g−1@30 C, 2.0–4.3 V). Furthermore, it can supply ultra-high 185 mA h g−1 capacity with fantastic energy density (522 W h kg−1) in half-cells (1.4–4.3 V), and competitive capacity (121 mA h g−1) as well as energy density (402 W h kg−1) in full-cells (1.6–4.1 V), demonstrating enormous application potential for sodium-ion batteries."

                "Nowadays the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) in the industrial (e.g. PanGu NLP Large Model) and cultural (e.g. ChatGPT) fields requires significant consumption of electricity resources worldwide. The electric energy storage and conversion are greatly relying on novel secondary battery devices (SBDs), such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and potassium ion battery (PIBs) [1], [2], [3], [4]. Hereinto, SIBs are going to become the favorite in both industry and academia owing to their merits of low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. The cathode materials, including layered metal oxides (e.g. O3-NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 [5], P2-Na0.70Fe0.10Cu0.20Ni0.05Mn0.65O2 [6], P2-Na0.67Li0.1Fe0.37Mn0.53O2 [7], and P3-Na0.75Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 [8]), polyanionic-typed compounds (e.g. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) [9], NaxMn2(PO4)3 [10], Na6.88V2.81(P2O7)4 [11], and Na2.26Fe1.87(SO4)3 [12]), prussian blue analogues (e.g. Na2−δNi[Fe(CN)6] [13] and Nax(FeMnNiCuCo)[Fe(CN)6] [14]), chromium-based cathodes (e.g. NaCrO2 [15]), and organics (e.g. poly(N-vinylcarbazole) [16]), have been extensively investigated for decades. Wherein, only NVP cathode is endowed with both stable V5+⇋V2+ multi-electron redox (1.6 V of V3+/2+, 3.4 V of V4+/3+, and 4.0 V of V5+/4+, respectively), fast Na+ conductive NASICON structure (three-dimensional (3D) [V2(PO4)3]; R-3c), and small volume change (<4.2%) during Na+ extraction/insertion [17], [18]. A fly in the ointment, the bare NVP is also governed by inferior electronic conductivity (10−9 S cm−1) [19], underserved theoretical specific capacity (117 mA h g−1), and permanent working voltage (3.4 V), which lead to the poor rate/cycling properties as well as relatively low energy density (<370 W h kg−1) [20], [21].",
                "For tackling these, a series of surface coating engineering, including being decorated by carbon species (i.e. soft carbon [17], carbon nanotube [21], graphene [22], hard carbon [23], and N(B)-doped carbon [24], [25]), phosphates (e.g. Na1.3Al0.7Ti1.3(PO4)3 [26] and H3PO4·12MoO3 [27]), and ceramics (e.g. TiO2) [28], is adopted to boost the electronic conductivity, strengthen the interfacial stability, as well as restrain the side reactions. Especially, carbon coating can serve as both superb flexible protective layer and conductive agent, displaying double merits in facilitating the comprehensive performance of electrodes [22]. Furthermore, lattice doping is proved to effectively adjust the bulk crystal and electronic structures. For instance, single-doping (Cr3+, Al3+, etc.) [18], [29], double-doping (Cr3+/Mg2+, Al3+/Cr3+, K+/Ca2+, Al3+/F−, etc.) [30], [31], [32], [33], triple-doping (Mg2+/Cr3+/Fe3+) [34], and quadruple-doping (e.g. Ti4+/Mn2+/Cr3+/Zr4+) [35] into Na, V, and (or) O lattice sites were employed, respectively, to realize the more stable structure and faster electron transfer. Better yet, the multi-doping is recognized as the more effective modification strategy compared to the single-doping on account of the following reasons. Generally, single-doping can finitely adjust the local physicochemical property of individual lattice site. It cannot comprehensively regulate every lattice site in the crystal structure. Moreover, multi-doping with at least two types of element is commonly able to obtain richer transferable free electrons and more diverse external ions with differentiated ionic radius and electronegativity [36]. Hence, multi-doped materials are provided with better structural conductivity and stability. For example, Han’s group [37] developed co-doped Na3.83V1.17Mn0.58Ni0.25(PO4)3 electrode with better cycling (79.3%@100 cycles@0.2 C) and rate capabilities (77 mA h g−1@20 C) compared to the single-doped samples. Recently, high-entropy (ΔSconf ≥ 1.5R) strategy is extensively adopted to polish up the performances for cathode materials [35]. Such finesse can fabricate a bulk mixed-valent environment of cations and supply an entropy-dominated phase stability effect [38]. It is able to effectively suppress the structural collapse, enhance the redox reversibility especially in high working voltage (≥3.4 V), as well as boost the electronic induced effect [39], [40], [41], [42]. For instance, Wu’s group [35] designed a high-entropy Na3(Ti0.2V0.2Mn0.2Cr0.2Zr0.2)2(PO4)3 material with superior electrochemical performances (115 mA h g−1@1 C), which is derived from the enhanced bulk-phase conductivity and structural stability. Zhou et al. [36] synthesized a high-entropy Na3.32V1.6Cr0.08Fe0.08Mn0.08Mg0.08Ca0.08(PO4)3 cathode and realized much-improved cycling and rate capabilities (93.1%@2000 cycles@40 C, 140 mA h g−1@4 C) during 1.2–4.2 V. It must be said that several specific trivalent elements Ga3+, Cr3+, Al3+, Fe3+, and (or) In3+ [15], [18], [43], [44], [45] are able to efficiently excite the V5+/V4+ high-voltage redox (4.0 V) for NVP cathode, thereby providing extra discharge capacity (20 mA h g−1) and energy density (75 W h kg−1) [46]. Currently, the collaborative effect of these five elements and the corresponding structure-activity relationship are not clear, which is essential and urgent to be further studied.",
                "Inspired by the above, we innovatively design a series of high-entropy Na3V2−x(GaCrAlFeIn)x(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08) cathodes in this work. Benefiting from the greatly enhanced electronic and spatial structures, the optimal Na3V1.7(GaCrAlFeIn)0.06(PO4)3 sample is capable of exciting a V5+/V4+ high-voltage redox (4.0 V) with 22 mA h g−1 of capacity, 83 W h kg−1 of energy density, and higher working voltage (3.8 vs. 3.4 V) within 2.0–4.3 V, which can also display a dependable cycle lifetime (90.97%@5000 cycles@30 C) in half-cells. Moreover, the multi-electron reactions (V2+⇋V5+) are thoroughly unlocked during 1.4–4.3 V and an unprecedented Na-storage capacity (185 mA h g−1) is obtained. Besides, such high-entropy electrode in full-cells can exhibit superior cycling stability (95.6%@300 cycles@1 C) and rate capability (90 mA h g−1@20 C)."

                "The structural evolution of the high-entropy design is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The typical crystal structure for HE-N3VM3P3 reveals that the Ga3+, Cr3+, Al3+, Fe3+, and In3+ occupy the same sites as V3+ in [MO6] octahedral. Besides, it provides two different types of occupying sites for Na+ (Na1 and Na2) [47], [48]. Wyckoff position of Na1 is 6b with 6-fold coordination and Na2 is 18e with 8-fold coordination. Na+ at Na2 site preferentially migrates out compared to Na1 site, attributed to the weaker bonding energy of Na2–O [49]. From Fig. 1(b), all the XRD patterns can be indexed to the pure phase of NVP (R-3c space group, PDF: #53-0018) [18]. The (012), (104), (113), (116), and (300) diffraction peaks are sharp and upright, indicating high crystallinity. To further clarify their crystal structures, Rietveld refinement patterns are performed (Fig. 1c and Fig. S2). The bare NVP (a = b = 8.72526 Å, c = 21.80609 Å, V = 1437.689 Å3) can provide larger cell parameters compared to the HE-N3VM3P3 (a = b = 8.72226 Å, c = 21.78656 Å, V = 1435.415 Å3) (Table S1), implying the successful incorporation of different radius of Ga3+(76 pm), Cr3+ (75.5 pm), Al3+ (67.5 pm), Fe3+ (78.5 pm), and In3+ (76 pm) into the V3+ (78 pm) site [15], [17]. The enlarged (113) diffraction peak also confirms this result (Fig. S2a). Raman spectra reveal the two peaks of disordered carbon (D band) and graphitized carbon (G band) at 1360 and 1590 cm−1 (Fig. 1d and e), respectively, which are assigned to the sp2-type carbon. The ID/IG values of NVP and HE-N3VM3P3 are 0.98 and 0.95, respectively, suggesting that the coating layer mainly incorporates amorphous carbon. HE-N3VM3P3 has a lower ID/IG value than NVP, indicating a better electronic conductivity [49]. For the XPS tests (Fig. 1f–k), the binding energies situated at 1118.2 ± 0.1 eV and 1145.1 ± 0.1 eV are attributed to Ga 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively [17] (Fig. 1f). From Fig. 1(g), the two peaks of 712.0 ± 0.1 eV and 725.7 ± 0.1 eV are supposed to Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 [44]. Similarly, the two peaks of 578.4 ± 0.3 eV and 583.4 ± 0.1 eV belong to the Cr 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 (Fig. 1h) [36]. The binding energies at 516.6 ± 0.1 eV and 523.7 ± 0.1 eV correspond to V 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 (Fig. 1i) [50]. The peaks located at 444.9 ± 0.1 eV and 452.6 ± 0.1 eV can be regarded as In 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 (Fig. 1j) [45]. Moreover, the two peaks at 74.7 ± 0.1 eV and 75.6 ± 0.1 eV are assigned to Al 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 (Fig. 1k) [43]. It fully proves that all the Ga, Cr, Al, Fe, In, and V elements are trivalent in these three high-entropy materials. It must be mentioned that the Fe3+ is not reduced perhaps due to the conservation of positive and negative valence states in HE-N3VM3P3 structure, which is also confirmed in this study [22]. Furthermore, all the binding energies of Ga, Cr, Al, Fe, and In elements of HE-N3VM3P3 are slightly higher than those of the other samples (e.g. 75.7 vs. 75.6 vs. 75.6 eV in Fig. 1k), indicating a more superior structural stability [50].",
                "The Na3V2−x(GaCrAlFeIn)x(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08) samples reveal similar irregular particles morphology from the SEM images (Fig. S3a–d). The samples show insignificant change in the morphology after high-entropy design. In Fig. 2(a), it can be observed that HE-N3VM3P3 particles are uniformly decorated by flexible amorphous carbon film as thin as cicada wings, which is favorable to the electronic conductivity [50]. The carbon contents are 5.95, 5.87, 5.89, and 5.95 wt% for Na3V2−x(GaCrAlFeIn)x(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08), respectively. Moreover, HRTEM images display a d-spacing of 0.206 nm that corresponds to the (306) plane in NVP structure (Fig. 2b). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns further confirm that HE-N3VM3P3 cathode holds a high crystallinity (Fig. 2c), which is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 1c). For purpose of observing the elemental distributions in HE-N3VM3P3, the EDX-mapping images for both SEM (Fig. S3e) and TEM (Fig. 2d) are performed. It is transparent that the C, Ga, Cr, Al, Fe, In, V, O, and P elements are uniformly distributed on the surface of bulk particles. The carbon is distributed on both the surface and the surroundings, thereby supplying better conductive network.",
                "The electrochemical performances of bare and high-entropy materials are shown in Fig. 3. Compared to bare NVP (110 mA h g−1), HE-N3VM2P3 (113 mA h g−1), and HE-N3VM4P3 (110 mA h g−1) materials, HE-N3VM3P3 can exhibit the highest specific capacity of 117 mA h g−1 at 1 C (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the charge-discharge curves display 3.4 V plateau, assigned to the V4+/V3+ redox. In particular, all the high-entropy cathodes are able to show an extra high-voltage plateau (4.0 V), which is due to the V5+/V4+ redox [17]. The differences of redox peaks in CV curves also confirm this circumstance (Fig. 3b and c). Also, the polarization for oxidation/reduction peak pairs is much smaller for HE-N3VM3P3 sample than bare NVP (e.g. 0.21 vs. 0.29 V; 0.28 vs. 0.68 V) after both the 1st and the 1000th cycle. What is more, HE-N3VM3P3 has the fantastic capacity retention of 97.6% after 1000 cycles, far better than the others (79.9%, 95.8%, and 93.3%) (Fig. 3d). From Fig. 3(e and f), HE-N3VM3P3 can also deliver more superior rate capabilities (107 mA h g−1@30 C, 97 mA h g−1@50 C, and 76 mA h g−1@90 C) compared to the bare NVP, HE-N3VM2P3, and HE-N3VM4P3 materials, which still shows unprecedented progressiveness compared with previous studies [18], [22], [31], [32], [47], [49], [51], [52] (Fig. 3g). To test their high-current charging-discharging capability, the long-periodic cycling at 30 C is obtained (Fig. 3h). The coulombic efficiency of HE-N3VM3P3 (99.95%) is higher than that of NVP (99.76%). Besides, HE-N3VM3P3 is capable of giving 101 mA h g−1 of capacity with 90.97% retention after 5000 cycles, while the bare NVP only shows mediocre performance (70 mA h g−1@48.63%@5000 cycles@30 C). The energy and power densities are important indicators for evaluating performance of SIBs. The optimum HE-N3VM3P3 can display distinct advantages on both energy and power densities compared to recently reported NVP materials [17], [53] (Fig. 3i). Moreover, to demonstrate the superiority of such high-entropy design, a series of selected single-, double-, triple-, and quadruple-doped samples is obtained as shown in Fig. S4. It is clear that the HE-N3VM3P3 cathode carries off the first prize in any aspects (i.e. discharge capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability). Moreover, the regular evolution (single- < double- < triple- < quadruple- < quintuple-doped) of electrochemical performances also confirms the implementation of high-entropy design. Thus, the highly reversible multi-redox (V5+/4+/3+) derived from the high-entropy design is the significant contribution to the performance improvements.",
                "To unseal the entire multi-redox (V5+⇋V2+), the bare and high-entropy materials are tested within an enlarged voltage window (1.4–4.3 V) (Fig. 4). The initial discharge curves display three voltage plateaus (4.0, 3.4, and 1.6 V) for high-entropy electrodes, which correspond V5+/4+, V4+/3+, V3+/2+ redox, respectively. Compared to bare NVP, HE-N3VM2P3, and HE-N3VM4P3 (172, 184, and 175 mA h g−1), HE-N3VM3P3 can exhibit the highest specific capacity of 185 mA h g−1 with 522 W h kg−1 of energy density at 1 C (Fig. 4a). Besides, HE-N3VM3P3 can also provide the best cycling stability (93.8%@140 cycles@1 C) (Fig. 4b). As expected, the different oxidation/reduction peaks in CV curves also confirm this circumstance (Fig. 4c). The polarization of V3+/2+ (0.31 V) is larger than that of V4+/3+ (0.18 V) and V5+/4+ (0.03 V) redox, which reveals the inferior reversibility of V3+/2+ redox. Besides, such high-entropy design is beneficial for improving the reversibility of V2+/V3+ reaction, just like the effect in this study [47] Furthermore, HE-N3VM3P3 exhibits much better rate (69 mA h g−1@90 C) and long-term cycling (88.7%@5000 cycles@30 C) capabilities (Fig. 4d and e). Besides, the reason for the lack of capacity of HE-N3VM4P3 cathode is the fully-polarized state at 90 C, while the HE-N3VM2P3 and HE-N3VM3P3 electrodes are still far from this state [19]. It is due to their better spatial and electronic structures, which can withstand larger current density in the charge-discharge process. CV curves at different scanning rates are tested in Fig. 4(f and g). The relationship between peak current (i) and scan rate (v) is as follows.(1)",
                "i=a v b(2)",
                "l o g ( i )=l o g ( a )+ bl o g ( v )",
                "It can be observed that b-values of 1–4 peaks are from 0.36 to 0.61 for bare NVP and the b-values of 1–6 peaks are from 0.21 to 0.79 for HE-N3VM3P3, implying that the charge storage is a combination of diffusion control dynamics and capacitance control behavior [18]. For clarifying the structural and morphological evolutions after 1000 cycles, the ex-situ XRD and SEM measurements are carried out (Fig. S5). The diffraction peaks remain basically unchanged for HE-N3VM3P3 after 1000 cycles, while they almost disappear for bare NVP (Fig. S5a and b), which indicates a severe structural decay after long-term cycling. Moreover, the morphology has negligible change after 1000 cycles for HE-N3VM3P3 (Fig. S5c). In contrast, bare NVP displays serious agglomeration (Fig. S5d), suggesting larger interface impedance. Hence, the more superior cycling and rate performances of HE-N3VM3P3 electrode are due to the better structural and interfacial stability.",
                "To clarify the change of DNa+ values after such high-entropy design, the GITT curves are performed (Fig. 5a and b and Fig. S6a and b). The DNa+ values range from 10−11 to 0.8 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 for HE-N3VM3P3 sample, which are higher than bare NVP (10−11–10−9 cm2 s−1), HE-N3VM2P3 (10−11–0.5 × 10−8 cm2 s−1), and HE-N3VM4P3 (10−11–0.4 × 10−8 cm2 s−1). Therefore, the better cycling and rate capabilities are reasonable for HE-N3VM3P3. Furthermore, to verify the structural evolution during Na+ extraction/insertion process (2.0–4.3 V), the in-situ XRD patterns are carried out (Fig. 5c and d). The diffraction peaks undergo a series of reversible shifts along with the appearance/disappearance or splits of the indexed peaks. Moreover, if the charging voltage reaches to 3.4 V, the (024), (116), and (300) diffraction peaks of HE-N3VM3P3 transfer to the higher 2θ region, indicating lattice contraction and Na+ extraction, which is consistent with the reaction (typical bi-phase reaction) from Na3V3+1.7M3P3 to Na1.4V4+1.7M3P3 phases (V3+/V4+). Keeping charging to 4.0 V, the diffraction peaks continuously shift to a higher angle, assigned to V4+/V5+ redox. The diffraction peaks gradually return to their original positions during discharge process, suggesting a superb reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. The slightly shifting 2θ degree (∼0.51°) reveals insignificant volume change during charge-discharge, confirming a good cyclic stability [18], [54]. Also, the changes law of diffraction peaks shows high consistence with the ex-situ XRD (Fig. S6c). In order to explore the valence evolution of V element during the charge process, ex-situ XPS tests at various charging states (3.4, 4.0, and 4.3 V) of bare NVP and HE-N3VM3P3 sample are carried out (Fig. 5e and f). For bare NVP (Fig. 5e), after charging to 3.4, 4.0, and 4.3 V, the peaks of V 2p3/2 gradually shift towards higher binding energies (515.9 → 516.1 → 517.5 eV), and the peaks of V 2p1/2 display the same trend (523.1 → 523.5 → 524.8 eV), suggesting an increasing proportion of V4+ [54]. For the HE-N3VM3P3 sample (Fig. 5f), after charging to 3.4 V, the peaks located at 517.6 and 524.8 eV also corresponds to the V3+ and V4+ just like that for bare NVP. However, further charging to 4.0 and 4.3 V, the peaks increase from two to four with different binding energies (517.1 → 517.4 eV of V4+ 2p3/2; 518.4 → 519.1 eV of V5+ 2p3/2; 524.3 → 524.1 eV of V4+ 2p1/2; 525.3 → 526.1 eV of V5+ 2p1/2), respectively. Moreover, the proportion of V4+ activated to V5+ is estimated to be 19% based on the peak area ratio, which is basically consistent with the charge capacity (22 to 117 mA h g−1) in Fig. 3(a). To further elucidate the effects on the electronic conductivity, the in-situ EIS is tested in Fig. 5(g and h). In the charge process from 1.6 to 4.3 V, the Rct values gradually decrease from 790.5 Ω to a minimum value (255.9 Ω) for NVP, which is connected with the exacerbated lattice contraction along with the more and more extraction of Na+. Subsequently, the Rct values progressively increase from 255.9 to 983.1 Ω accompanied by the discharge to 1.4 V. It is ascribed to the gradually deepening lattice recovery resulting from the Na+ insertion process. Besides, the Rct values (496.1 Ω) of HE-N3VM3P3 return to its original state after discharged to 1.6 V, while the Rct values of bare NVP increased by 192.6 Ω. From Fig. 5(i), Rct values of bare NVP are bigger than those of HE-N3VM3P3 during Na+ extraction/insertion process. Moreover, the EIS after the 1st and 1000th cycles is also performed (Fig. S5d and e). We can find that the Rct values vary from 123.0 to 143.5 Ω for HE-N3VM3P3, while they increase from 488.8 to 579.2 Ω for bare NVP. Hence, the high-entropy cathodes lead to both the high electronic and ionic conductivities.",
                "To further estimate the performances, the hard carbon is selected as the reference anode (Fig. S7). It can display a reversible capacity of 187 mA h g−1 with 85.6% of capacity retention at 1 C after 260 cycles. For the HE-N3VM3P3//HC and NVP//HC full-cells (Fig. 6a), the former can deliver much better performances than the latter in discharge capacity (121 vs. 112 mA h g−1), rate capability (103 vs. 59 mA h g−1@10 C), and cycling stability (115 mA h g−1@95.6%@1 C@300 cycles), respectively (Fig. 6b–d). Furthermore, the HE-N3VM3P3//HC full-cell is tested within an enlarged voltage window (1.5–4.1 V) as shown in Fig. S8. The reversible V2+/V3+ redox corresponding to approximately 1.5 V of voltage plateau is successfully activated with an overall enhanced capacity of 170 mA h g−1 in the initial cycle and 160 mA h g−1 remained after 50 cycles. The mediocre cyclic stability is perhaps due to the structural instability caused by over-deep charging-discharging [55].",
                "To more in-depth clarify the structure-activity relationship behind the high-entropy design, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are carried out (Fig. 6f and g). The density of states (DOS) of bare NVP shows partial crossing the Fermi level, indicating the presence of semimetal features in the structure. Meanwhile, discrete islands mainly composed of V 3d orbitals and O 2p orbitals are detected near the Fermi level, implying that bare NVP has high covalence with a three-dimensional skeleton. By comparison, the additional islands formed by the Ga/Cr/Fe/Al/In 3d–O 2p bonds consist of extra islands located between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). It reveals that the band gap gradually decreases, which can tremendously facilitate the diffusion rate of Na+. Clearly, the DOS signals between the peaks on both sides of the Fermi level mean rich mobile free electrons surrounding the vicinity of Fermi level, indicating that HE-N3VM3P3 sample has stronger atomic bonding ability and metallic properties. Based on energy band theory and quantum mechanics [54], introducing Al3+, Cr3+, In3+, Ga3+, and Fe3+ elements into the structure can provide far more valence bands and conduction bands with different quantized energies than only V3+. Hence, the transition of free electrons becomes much easier, thereby promoting faster charge transfer in the lattice [43]."

                "High-entropy strategies are successfully applied in Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode for SIBs. The in-situ XRD and in-situ EIS characterizations profoundly clarify the far strengthened structural reversibility and faster electron transfer. The DFT calculations fundamentally verify the structure-activity relationships before and after high-entropy design from electronic/spatial structure perspectives. Derived from the optimized crystal structure, electronic induced effect, and V5+⇋V2+ multi-redox reversibility, the preferred HE-N3VM3P3 material can deliver unprecedented electrochemical performances, including dependable cycling performance (88.7%@5000 cycles@30 C; 2.0–4.3 V), extremely high specific capacity (184.78 mA h g−1; 1.4–4.3 V) in half-cells, and competitive energy density (401.37 W h kg−1@0.2 C; 1.6–4.1 V) in full-cells.
