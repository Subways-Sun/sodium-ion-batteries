                "With abundant resources and multiple electron transfer, V2O3 is a potential anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, dramatic volume changes and slow reaction kinetics during the charge/discharge process still limit its application. Herein, porous yolk-shell V2O3/nitrogen-doped carbon (V2O3/NC) spheres are produced by a simple solvothermal method combined with subsequent carbonization. In this hierarchical structure, ultra-fine nanoparticles as primary building unit facilitate ion/electron transport; unique yolk-shell structure relieves the volume strain improving the structure integrity; nitrogen-doped carbon enhances electrochemical conductivity; moreover, rational mesoporous structure accelerates electrolyte penetration and high specific surface area supplies abundant reaction sites. Based on the above merits, yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres exhibit satisfactory sodium ion storage performance (129.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 after 12,000 ultra-long cycles). What's more, an assembled V2O3/NC//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell displays outstanding cycle performance (46 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.2 A g−1), demonstrating its potential value for practical applications."

                "With increasing awareness of environmental protection, energy conservation and emission reduction, the development of novel green renewable energy is becoming more and more booming [1], [2]. Despite lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) currently occupy the dominant status in renewable energy and conversion systems worldwide [3], [4]. But it is also need to face perplexing problems such as lithium resources unevenly distributed in the earth, their content decreased and their price increased year by year [5], [6], [7], [8]. Compared with lithium, sodium can be seen everywhere and abundant on the earth. The physical and chemical properties and the standard electrode potential of sodium ion are similar to lithium ion. Therefore, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential candidates in the novel green renewable energy [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. It is well known that electrode materials have a crucial effect on battery performance. Graphite is the most stable anode material for lithium ion storage. However, its storage capacity and structural stability as the anode of SIBs are not ideal [2], [14]. This is because the radius and mass of sodium ion are larger than lithium ion, making it difficult for sodium ion to rapidly inserted/extracted in the graphite electrode [15], [16]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an electrode material which can quickly store and release sodium ion. V2O3 is regarded as a promising candidate anode of SIBs due to a series of advantages (e.g. abundant products, low prices, multiple valence states and safe operation) [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Despite a lot of progresses made in recent years, several troubling problems of V2O3 need to be improved for high-performance SIBs such as structure collapse and slow reaction kinetics during charging/discharging process.",
                "Engineering electrode materials with hierarchical structure could endow the electrode with excellent property [28], [29], [30], [31]. By reducing the scale of structural units of hierarchical structure to the nanoscale, the short transmission path expedites the transport process of electrons/ions, thereby enhancing rate ability of the electrode [32], [33]. The large specific surface area and abundant pores of constructed micro-nanostructure can generate abundant active sites in the structures to store more Na+, which is conducive to enhance the pseudocapacitance behavior and electrode capacity [34], [35]. For example, Wang et al. reports that hierarchically yolk-shell structured ZnS/NC dodecahedra as an anode material shows excellent specific capacity of 757 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 [36]. Compared with the hollow and core-shell structures, yolk-shell structures have the advantages of robust structural stability and uniform component dispersion [37], [38], [39]. As we all know, composite design strategies in electrode materials may enhance the electrochemical conductivity and stability of electrode [40], [41], [42], [43]. Compositing flexible carbon with electrode materials can improve the overall electrochemical conductivity of the electrode from inside to outside, and restrain the stress change of the electrode structure during the cycle process, which has a double optimization effect [32], [34]. Therefore, it is great significance to design and prepare micro-nanostructure V2O3/high conductivity carbon composite with outstanding property for SIBs anode.",
                "Herein, we used a simple solvothermal method combined with subsequent carbonization to prepare yolk-shell V2O3/nitrogen-doped carbon (V2O3/NC) spheres as an anode for SIBs. This unique electrode design improves the storage performance of sodium ion with several advantages: the yolk-shell structure composed by zero-dimensional nanoparticles has a large number of pores, which can accelerate the penetration of electrolyte and make the electrolyte fully contact with the electrode; the cavity in yolk-shell structure can tolerate volume change of electrode material to maintain the structural integrity in charging/discharging process; nitrogen-doping carbon can enhance the electrode electrical conductivity to speed up electrons/ions transfer and generate abundant active sites to store ample sodium ion, which is conducive to strengthen the pseudo-capacitance behavior. Consequently, the yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres exhibit outstanding long cyclic stability in SIBs. Meanwhile, yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres assembled into the V2O3/NC//Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cell displays excellent stable storage ability."

                "Fig. 1a illustrates the schematic formation of V2O3/NC yolk-shell spheres. Briefly, a spherical precursor with yolk-shell structure is prepared through VO(acac)2 and dopamine hydrochloride added to in a mixed solvent system at 180 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the precursor is carbonized at 700 °C in N2 atmosphere, wherein polydopamine is converted into in situ nitrogen-doped carbon and V2O3 becomes highly crystallized simultaneously. Notably, the obtained V2O3/NC perfectly inherits the original yolk-shell structure. Specially, without adding dopamine, the pure V2O3 has a nanorod-like morphology with a diameter of about 80 nm and a length of about 571 nm (Fig. S1a). With adding different amounts of dopamine, the morphologies of the corresponding products retain spherical structure without significant change (Fig. S1b–d). Therefore, dopamine plays an important role in the formation of spherical morphology. The precursor presents a spherical structure with an internal cavity that can be seen from the small damaged notch (Fig. 1b), according to SEM analysis result. The larger damage position of SEM image in the Fig. 1c further evidences that V2O3/NC composites have yolk-shell structure with diameter of 1.1–1.4 μm after calcination, which is benefitting from its excellent structural thermal stability. Furthermore, TEM images further clearly reveals the internal structure of V2O3/NC hybrids, which is consistent with the results of SEM (Fig. 1d). Importantly, the activity space between the outer shell and inner core can buffer the huge volume changes caused by the sodiation/desodiation behavior, which is conducive to the structural integrity of electrode. What's more, the formation process of the yolk-shell structure was analyzed according to the structures of the precursors obtained at different reaction times. As shown in Fig. S2, the structure of the precursor is solid sphere when the react time is 3 h. With the progress of the reaction, the precursor gradually generates an inner cavity (6 h) and finally forms a yolk-shell structure (12 h). It is attributed to the asymmetric Oswald ripening reaction. In addition, it can also be observed in the TEM image that the constituent unit of V2O3/NC is ultrafine nanoparticles, which is conducive to the generation of large specific surface area, thus providing high pseudocapacitance behavior (Fig. 1e). The HRTEM micrograph in Fig. 1f illustrates that V2O3 and N-doped carbon achieve uniform recombination. The lattice spacing with 0.36 nm d-spacing correspond to (012) crystal plane of V2O3. Meanwhile, a lamellar N-doped carbon can be observed in the green range. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) demonstrates the successful formation of V2O3 with excellent crystallization (Fig. 1g). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer elemental mapping identifies the four elements V, O, C and N are uniformly distributed into the yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres (Fig. 1h).",
                "The crystal structure of as-built V2O3/NC was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). And all diffraction peaks in Fig. 2a are corresponding to hexagonal V2O3 phase (JCPDS Card No. 34-0187), demonstrating the as-built V2O3/NC has fine crystallinity. Additionally, all Raman diffraction peaks of the V2O3/NC in Fig. 2b can be matched with characteristic peaks of V2O3, which is consistent with the results reported in the references and once again proves the successful preparation of V2O3 [22], [23]. What's more, the positions of Raman peaks of V2O3/NC and pure V2O3 (Fig. S3) are basically the same, indicating that bonding of V2O3 is not affected by N-doped carbon. The carbon content of yolk-shell V2O3/NC composites is determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air atmosphere. The carbon content of yolk-shell V2O3/NC composites calculated by the law of conservation of mass is about 13 % in Fig. 2c (detailed calculation is seen in Supplementary Materials). Since the yolk-shell V2O3/NC hybrid self-assembled by ultra-small sized nanoparticles as primary construction unit, a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of 140.5 m2 g−1 is revealed (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the V2O3/NC spheres with aggregation-resistant structure exhibit a mesoporous size distribution (Fig. 2d). In short, the as-prepared yolk-shell V2O3/NC microspheres own the dual advantages on structure and composition. Suitable mesoporous structure, large electrochemical contact area and perfect carbon recombination not only accelerate the electron/ion transfer and electrolyte penetration to improve the electron conductivity, but also improve structural stability in the electrochemical testing process.",
                "X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis was employed to study the surface chemical components and chemical state characteristics of the yolk-shell V2O3/NC microspheres. The peaks at 523.9 and 516.6 eV are V3+ 2p1/2 and V3+ 2p3/2, respectively in the V 2p spectrum (Fig. 3a) [44]. In the Fig. 3b, 532.5, 531.6 and 530.3 eV peaks of O 1s spectrum are indexed to CO, CO and VO bonds [45], [46]. Three peaks 401.9, 400.9 and 398.9 eV belong to graphite nitrogen, pyrrole nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen in the N 1s spectrum. (Fig. 3c) [45], [47]. The 288.3, 286.9, 285.9 and 284.6 eV peaks are ascribed to OCO, CO, CN and CC, respectively in the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 3d) [20], [23], [44]. The presence of nitrogen-doped carbon can generate affluent active sites for sodium ion storage, reinforcing pseudocapacitive behavior.",
                "The unique yolk-shell structure and in-situ nitrogen-doped carbon of porous V2O3/NC composites are beneficial to facilitate sodium ion storage and transport. Fig. 4a manifests the primal three cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres among 0.01-3 V. In the first cathodic scan, the irreversible reduction peak appears at 0.37 V, which is caused by the irreversible decomposition of electrolyte to form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film [20], [22]. Subsequently, the rest two CV curves basically coincide, reflecting V2O3/NC electrode has satisfactory reversibility. Fig. 4b presents the initial galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) specific capacity is 208.3/483.2mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The drop in capacity is caused by the formation of SEI films in the first cycle. Moreover, it is not difficult to find that the shapes of charge/discharge curves under different rates are similar in Fig. S4a, indicating the superior reversibility of the electrode. The yolk-shell V2O3/NC electrode displays discharge capacities of 246.3, 223.4, 202.6, 181.6, 174.8 and 151.1 mAh g−1 under different current densities (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 2 A g−1) in Fig. S4b. when the rate returns to 0.1 A g−1, the discharge capacity of V2O3/NC can return to 243.7 mAh g−1, demonstrating its high reversibility and robust stability. Fig. 4c shows the 10th, 3000th, 6000th, 9000th and 12,000th differential capacitance (dQm/dV) curves of yolk-shell V2O3 electrode at 5 A g−1. The obtained dQm/dV curves have a similar shape to the CV curves in Fig. 4a. Moreover, with the increase of the number of cycles, the dQm/dV curves of yolk-shell V2O3 electrode fluctuate less and show a high degree of coincidence, which proves that it has outstanding periodic stability. In addition, the corresponding GCD curves in Fig. 4d also have a high overlap degree and the steady specific capacity after ultra-long cycles, indicating that the electrode has an excellent reversibility. The cycling ability of yolk-shell V2O3/NC electrode is tested at 1 and 5 A g−1 and corresponding consequence is shown in Fig. 4e. Yolk-shell V2O3/NC electrode owns a capacity of 230.6 mAh g−1 after 4500 cycles at 1 A g−1 and retains 129.5 mAh g−1 under 12,000 ultra-long cycles even at a high rate of 5 A g−1. Compared with the previous reported related V2O3-based anodes in references, the as-synthesized V2O3/NC electrode exhibits absolute advantages in terms of long life stability and capacity (Table S1). This is mainly attributed to two aspects: the porous yolk-shell structure can not only greatly improve the structural stability of the electrode, but also increase contact area to accelerate to the penetration of the electrolyte; furthermore, the in-situ nitrogen-doped carbon can improve the conductivity of the electrode, thus speeding up the ion/electron transport.",
                "To highlight superiority of yolk-shell V2O3/NC electrode, the electrochemical performances of pure V2O3, V2O3/NC-0.05 and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes obtained under different dopamine addition of 0 g, 0.05 g and 0.15 g were tested as comparison. Under the same test conditions, the CV curves of pure V2O3 (Fig. S5a), V2O3/NC-0.05 (Fig. S6a) and V2O3/NC-0.15 (Fig. S7a) electrodes are similar to the V2O3/NC electrode because of their similar components. The initial GCD specific capacities of pure V2O3 (Fig. S5b), V2O3/NC-0.05 (Fig. S6b) and V2O3/NC-0.15 (Fig. S7b) are 67.7/171 mAh g−1, 179.6/330.1 mAh g−1 and 119.2/366.7 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, respectively. In addition, the cycling ability of pure V2O3, V2O3/NC-0.05, V2O3/NC and V2O3/NC-0.15 are tested at 0.5 A g−1 and corresponding consequence is shown in Fig. S8. Pure V2O3 nanorods cannot provide robust structural stability and a large number of active sites due to nanorod-like structure and the absence of carbon, showing the lowest capacity of 71.9 mAh g−1 after 220 cycles. With adding dopamine, the cycling performances of V2O3/NC-0.05 (236.2 mAh g−1 after 860 cycles) and V2O3/NC-0.15 (170 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles) electrodes are significantly higher than that of pure V2O3. This is because carbon improves the electrochemical conductivity and overall structural stability of the electrode. However, the cycling performances of V2O3/NC-0.05 and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes are lower than that of V2O3/NC (320.3 mAh g−1 after 1700 cycles), which is due to the decrease of electrode capacity caused by the introduction of too much carbon. Therefore, when the dose of dopamine is 0.1 g, the electrochemical performance of the electrode is the best.",
                "To further explore the reason for the different Na+ storage properties of V2O3/NC-0.05, V2O3/NC and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes, the kinetics analysis of three electrodes were carried out under different sweep rates (0.2 to 2.0 mV s−1). The CV curves of three electrodes present similar shapes and the current intensity increases gradually with the increase of scanning speed (Figs. 5a, S9a and S10a). The peak current (i) and scan rate (v) normally abide by the coming formula: i = avb [46], [48], [49]. The b value was figured out by fitting the slope of between log (i) and log (v). The different magnitude of b value between 0.5 and 1 indicates disparate mechanisms. Specifically, b = 0.5 and b = 1 reflect diffusion-controlled behavior and pseudocapacitance behavior, respectively. As revealed in Fig. S9b, Fig. 5b and Fig. S10b, the b values of the V2O3/NC-0.05, V2O3/NC and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes are 0.85 (peak I)/0.94 (peak II), 0.84 (peak I)/0.94 (peak II) and 0.93 (peak I)/0.95 (peak II), respectively, showing the process of Na-ion storage is mainly the mixing behavior of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitance. In addition, the mechanism of sodium storage was explored by using XPS analysis. The valence state of vanadium of V2O3/NC electrode discharged to 0.01 V is displayed in Fig. S11. There are two peaks located at 523.5 eV and 515.1 eV in V 2p spectrum, which are attributed to the V3+ 2p1/2 and V3+ 2p3/2, respectively, indicating the sodium storage of the electrode is intercalation. Therefore, the sodium storage mechanism of V2O3/NC electrode is intercalation reaction with a high surface pseudocapacitance behavior. Fig. S9 (c, d), Fig. 5 (c, d) and Fig. S10 (c, d) show the capacitance fraction of the pseudocapacitance contribution of V2O3/NC-0.05, V2O3/NC and V2O3/NC-0.1 electrodes, respectively. It can be observed that the proportion of the pseudocapacitance behavior of the three electrodes increases gradually with the scanning rate from 0.2 to 2 mV s−1. At the same scanning rate, the pseudocapacitance contribution of V2O3/NC-0.05, V2O3/NC and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes increase successively, indicating that the increase of carbon content is conducive to the generation of pseudocapacitance behavior.",
                "To reveal motivation for the excellent Na-ion storage ability of V2O3/NC, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test of V2O3/NC-0.05, V2O3/NC and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes were performed from 0.01 to 3.0 V at 0.05 A g−1. Fig. 6a clearly shows that V2O3/NC electrode has smaller voltage variation than V2O3/NC-0.05 and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes during relaxation process, indicating V2O3/NC electrode has extremely stability and faster reaction rate. According to the equation",
                "D Na + = 4 π τ m B V m M B S 2 Δ E S Δ E t 2 [50], the corresponding DNa+ values of the three electrodes are displayed in Fig. 6b. Specially, the discharge and charge DNa+ values of V2O3/NC electrode are 48.3 × 10−13–6 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 and 22.7 × 10−13–8.6 × 10−13 cm2 s−1, respectively, which is significantly higher than V2O3/NC-0.05 (19.9 × 10−13–3.6 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 and 11.7 × 10−13–1.8 × 10−13 cm2 s−1) and V2O3/NC-0.15 (25.8 × 10−13–6.8 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 and 14.4 × 10−13–2.2 × 10−13 cm2 s−1) electrodes, demonstrating the faster transfer speed of sodium ion in V2O3/NC electrode. During the discharge process, sodium ions continuously occupy active site of the electrode and accumulate, resulting in the gradual decrease of sodium ion diffusion coefficient. In the charging process, the diffusion coefficient of sodium ion decreases step by step, which is due to Na+ continuous extraction from the electrode material leading to the decrease of Na+ concentration. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses of three electrodes were measured in the range of 105 to 10−2 Hz frequency. In the light of the equivalent electrical circuit, the resistance of charge transfer (Rct) of the V2O3/NC-0.05 (16.52 Ω), V2O3/NC (13.85 Ω) and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrode (13.72 Ω) are slightly lower than pure V2O3/NC electrode (30.78 Ω) in the high frequency region, indicating the introduction of N-doped can improve electrochemical conductivity of the electrode (Figs. 6c and S5c). Furthermore, in the low frequency region, the Warburg impedance (σω) of V2O3/NC-0.05, V2O3/NC and V2O3/NC-0.15 electrodes are 555.3, 147.2 and 484.9, respectively (Fig. 6d). According to the equation",
                "D Na + = R 2 T 2 2 A 2 F 4 n 4 C 2 σ ω 2 [48], [49], the smaller the value of σω is, the greater the value of DNa+. Therefore, it is concluded that Na+ diffusion ability is preferable in the V2O3/NC electrode, which means that V2O3/NC electrode has prominent electrochemical conductivity to promote Na+ transfer. More obviously, the Rct of the V2O3/NC electrode decreases significantly to 6.38 Ω after 1700 cycles of 0.5 A g−1 and it also demonstrates fine Na+ diffusion ability in the low frequency region in Fig. S12. This means that the V2O3/NC electrode has stable electrochemical conductivity and favorable Na+ kinetics. What's more, the morphology of V2O3/NC electrode after 200 cycles at 0.5A g−1 was performed in Fig. S13. After cycling, the V2O3/NC electrode can basically maintain the original spherical structure without serious pulverization and aggregation (Figs. S13a and S14a). Even the yolk-shell structure can be observed at the damaged site, indicating that the electrode has excellent structural stability (Fig. S13b). The outstanding structural integrity of V2O3/NC is attributed to the perfect combination of V2O3 and N-doped carbon, which is conducive to the electrode to carry out stable cycling and obtain an extremely long cycle life spans. Fig. S14b displays the V 2p spectrum of the V2O3/NC electrode after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. There are two peaks located at 523.5 eV and 515.1 eV in V 2p spectrum, which are attributed to the V3+ 2p1/2 and V3+ 2p3/2, respectively, indicating the good structural stability and reversibility of V2O3/NC electrode.",
                "To truly evaluate the practical prospect of the yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres, the V2O3/NC//Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cell are assembled matching with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode after five cycles of activation, as the illustration shown in Fig. 7a. First, the Na3V2(PO4)3 was assembled into a half-cell with Na tablets for electrochemical performance evaluation. It presents overlapped CV curves in initial three cycles (Fig. S15a), the corresponding charge/discharge profiles displays high redox reaction voltage of 3.2/3.44 V (Fig. S15b). The Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode produces steady cycling stability at 0.2 A g−1 and keeps 97.5 mAh g−1 after 90 cycles in Fig. S15c. The electrochemical performances of V2O3/NC//Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cell were evaluated between 0.4 and 3.8 V. Fig. 7b reveals the charge/discharge curves with similar platform for the initial three cycles at 0.05 A g−1, indicating the full cell owns stable cyclic stability. As shown in Fig. 7c, the full−cell presents satisfactory rate capability, which are 41.8 mAh g−1 (0.1 A g−1), 35.2 mAh g−1 (0.2 A g−1), 30.1 mAh g−1 (0.4 A g−1), 25.5 mAh g−1 (0.6 A g−1) and 24.5 mAh g−1 (0.8 A g−1). The cycling stability of V2O3/NC//Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cell is further investigated at 0.2 A g−1 and maintained satisfactory discharge capacity: 46 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles (Fig. 7d). The excellent properties indicate that porous yolk-shell V2O3/NC composites are a prospect anode for SIBs."

                "In summary, we used a facile solvothermal-carbonization method to prepare porous yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres for efficient and steady sodium ion storage. The porous yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres have diverse merits: nanoparticles as primary building block can provide a convenient way for ion/electron transport, thus speeding up ion/electron transport; unique yolk-shell spheres can conduce to tolerate volume changes during discharge/charge reaction to obtain robust structural stability; nitrogen-doped carbon improves overall electrochemical conductivity of the electrode; abundant mesoporous as well as great BET specific surface can boost electrolyte penetration and provide plentiful active sites, thus enhancing reaction kinetics. Therefore, the porous yolk-shell V2O3/NC spheres exhibit outstanding cycling stability (129.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 over 12,000 ultra−long cycles). What's more, V2O3/NC//Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cell also shows unprecedented cycle life (300 cycles) and satisfactory capacity (46 mAh g−1) at 0.2 A g−1, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work provides a rational strategy (structural engineering and composition recombination) to modify electrode materials to acquire long-life cycle property for sodium ion storage."
