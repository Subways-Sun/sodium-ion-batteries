                "Co3O4 has been diffusely researched for high theoretical capacities and superior security. However, its poor intrinsic conductivity and serious volume effects during Na-ion insertion/extraction restrict its actual applications. Herein, graphene oxide coated Co3O4 nanoparticle are integrated through a straightforward hydrothermal method and freeze-drying treatment followed by annealing process. The characterization results indicate that the Co3O4 nanoparticles (∼20 nm) were loaded onto N-GO (∼75 nm), and nitrogen element was successfully introduced through urea. The unique Co3O4/N-GO structure suffices competent stress relaxation and fast Na+ and electron transfer during discharge/charge cycles. Consequently, the Co3O4/N-GO electrode displays a high discharge capacity of 323 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode), the NVP//Co3O4/N-GO battery exhibits significant energy density (249.9 Wh kg−1) and power density (163.3 W kg−1)."

                "Since the debut in the nineties of the 20th century, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been extensively applied to various power storage devices from intelligent device to electric automobiles [1], [2], [3]. Nevertheless, the low resource and the heterogeneous distribution of lithium element have become a major obstacle for future multitudinous application of LIBs [4], [5], [6]. Over the years, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have made considerable attention, for which NIBs are approved to be the promising substitution to LIBs in large-scale energy storage applications because of the abundant resource of Na element and the approximate electrochemical properties between Li and Na [7], [8], [9]. Since Na+ radius (1.02 Å) is almost twice as Li+ radius (0.59 Å), however, Na+ is more difficult to intercalate into/extract from the hard carbon anode, resulting in the poor capacity and the structural instability [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Hence, it is essential to seek an innovative anode material with excellent electrochemical performances for the development and design of advanced SIBs.",
                "In the past five years, transition metal oxides (TMOs), including Co3O4, MnO2, Fe3O4, SnO2, Sb2O3, are thought to the potential anode materials for NIBs owing to their rich redox site and tall theoretical capacity relative to the hard caron electrode [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Among them, Co3O4 has been intensively investigated as promising anode materials due to its high theoretical capacity, excellent chemical properties and environmental friendliness [22], [23]. However, the inherent weaknesses of Co3O4 anode materials, such as large volume expansion, low initial coulombic efficiency and inferior conductivity, restrict the practical application for SIBs [24]. Li et al [25] synthesized nano-sized Co3O4 electrode for SIBs, which exhibited ab initial special capacity of 168 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C. As a result of the apparent volume expansion of Co3O4 electrode, however, the special capacity drops to 76 mAh/g after only the 41th cycle.",
                "To surmount the aforesaid problems, one effective strategy is to composite nanostructured Co3O4 with various electronically conductive carbon makings, for instance graphite carbon, carbon nanofibers and Graphene [26], [27]. On the one hand, the carbon materials can control the growth of TMOs nanoparticles and decrease Na+ diffusion path [28]. On the other hand, the carbon materials can serve as a buffer matrix to alleviate volume fluctuate of TMOs electrodes during the charge/discharge cycle [14], [29], [30], [31]. For example, Hu et al. [32] synthesized flower-like Co3O4/graphite carbon (Co3O4/C) composites by annealing Co-MOFs precursors, and the special capacity of the composites maintained at 213.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 after 100 cycles.",
                "Moreover, introducing nitrogen heteroatom into carbon materials can trigger extrinsic defects, and then enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon electrode materials [33], [34], [35]. Liang et al. [36] have demonstrated that the discharge capacity of hollow carbon nanosphere anode material for SIBs increased from 159 mA h g−1 to 198 mA h g−1 at a 0.2 A g−1 after doping N. Therefore, a ration hybrid material compositing Co3O4 with N doped carbon substrate would be expected to become the suitable anode electrode for SIBs.",
                "In the present work, N-doped graphene oxide coated Co3O4 nanoparticles (Co3O4/N-GO) hybrid were synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method followed by an annealing process. When serve as anode materials for SIBs, the as-prepared Co3O4/N-GO electrode represented a relatively high initial discharge/charge ability of 630/616 mA h g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–3.0 V, and delivered a reversible capacity of 323 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Besides, Co3O4/N-GO electrode also proved the excellent rate performance with the discharge capacity of 296 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and the discharge capacity of 199 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. As a result, the Co3O4/N-GO hybrid exhibited remarkable sodium storage capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability, indicating its potential applications in SIBs."

                "The construction process of Co3O4/N-GO nano architecture is illustrated in Scheme 1. N-doped graphene oxide confined Co3O4 nanoparticles (Co3O4/N-GO) hybrid were synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method and freeze-drying treatment followed by an annealing process.",
                "Fig. 1a-b exhibits the FESEM images of Co3O4/N-GO, in which the surface of N-GO is wrinkle and unsmooth because the Co3O4 is stuck to the surface. It can be found that the flake structure of GO changes to the irregular shape after doping N (Fig. S1-2). The pure Co3O4 presents a polyhedral structure with even surface, and the granule size is in the scope of 5–15 μm (Fig. S3). The average thickness of the Co3O4/N-GO was measured to be about 30–40 nm by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as interpreted in Fig. 1c. Further TEM investigations show that the uniform Co3O4 with less than 30 nm are embedded into the N-doped graphene oxide (Fig. 1d-e). According to the HRTEM image, the calculated lattice spacing of 0.467 nm is in line with (1 1 1) plane of the Co3O4 (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping images reveal that Co and O were uniformly represented in Co3O4/N-GO. However, C and N elements mainly concentrate upon the rim of Co3O4, manifesting the formation of coated layer of N-GO (Fig. 1g-i).",
                "Fig. 2a appears the XRD patterns of Co3O4/N-GO, Co3O4, N-GO and GO. As seen in it, there is only a big hump at around 25° for GO and N-GO, indicating that doping N does not alter the phase structure of GO. In the case of Co3O4/N-GO and Co3O4, all diffraction peaks can be indexed to the spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS Card No. 78–1970). Moreover, no characteristic peaks for carbon are detected due to its low diffraction intensity. In addition, the characteristic peaks of Co3O4/N-GO is weaker than those of Co3O4, revealing that the adoption of N-GO can inhibit the growth of Co3O4, which is line with SEM results. The TGA measurement at air atmosphere is performed to analyze the Co3O4 content of Co3O4/N-GO, as exhibited in Fig. 2b. It is important to noted that the slight weight loss from 30 to 200 °C results from the elimination of the absorbed H2O on surface. It is obvious that the fast weight loss from 200 to 700 °C is ascribed to the carbon combustion, and the final mass keeps stable at about 700 °C, when GO is exhausted completely and Co3O4 is left intact [26]. Based on the TGA result, therefore, it can be concluded that the content of Co3O4 in Co3O4/N-GO is 48.5 wt%.",
                "The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed to illustrate the external chemical composition of Co3O4/N-GO and Co3O4, as revealed in Fig. 2c-f. From the survey spectrum (Fig. 2c), it can be seen that the peak of C 1s is visibly heighten after compositing Co3O4 with graphene oxide. Additionally, N element also is detected in the survey spectrum of Co3O4/N-GO, indicating N is successfully doped into graphene oxide. In the case of the high-resolution Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2d), the peaks at 779.3 eV and 795.9 eV are assigned to Co2+, and the peaks at 779.3 eV and 795.9 eV correspond to Co3+. Furthermore, the minor spikes at 779.3 eV and 795.9 eV are due to the signature spikes of Co 2p. Located at 802.9 eV can be expressed as a result of high spin Co2+ ion vibrations [12], [37]. As demonstrated in Fig. 2f, the high-resolution spectrum of N 1s can be deconvoluted into pyridine N (398.8 eV), Co-N, (399.4 eV) and pyrrole N (400.2 eV), further suggesting successful nitrogen doping [38].",
                "Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to describe the bonding configurations in the materials, as exhibited in Fig. 3a. The FTIR spectra of GO is similar to that of N-GO, while the FTIR spectra of Co3O4/N-GO is close to that of Co3O4, which are in line with the XRD results. As for Co3O4 sample, the peaks centered at 662 and 664 cm−1 can be assigned to the Co-O vibration of spinel Co3O4 [39]. It is worth noted that the introduction of N-GO exerts a certain effect on the Co-O vibration, and the two peaks shift to 662 and 664 cm−1, respectively [40].",
                "Fig. 3b exhibits the Raman of the four samples. The Raman of D and G and 2D bands for GO are found at around 1350, 1560 and 2700 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, the three characteristic peaks be further intensified after doping N because the annealing treatment increases the crystallity of GO [41]. As for Co3O4, the Raman signals have four characteristic bands at 472, 511, 603 and 671 cm−1, which correspond to the Eg, F2g, F2g, A1g symmetric stretching for Co-O vibration mode [37]. After compositing with N-GO, moreover, the above four Raman peaks slightly change, and shift to 470, 517, 605 and 6669 cm−1. The FTIR and Raman results reveal that some Co-C and Co-N bonding maybe exist in Co3O4/N-GO, and influence the Raman signals of Co-O.",
                "Fig. 4a descriptions the cyclic voltammogram (CV) splines of Co3O4/N-GO at 0.1 A g−1 with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. In 1st cathodic scan, the apparent shoulder peak at 1.12 V should be attributed to electrolyte decomposition and Co3+/Co2+ reduction to create a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film [38]. However, the shoulder peak at 1.12 V disappears at 2nd and 3rd scan, substantiating the presence of an indubitable irreversible interaction. The one peak at about 0.62 V should blamed to the alloying process of Co3O4 with Na+ to form monomeric metal Co and Na2O [39]. The oxidation peaks (0.86 V and 1.22 V) can be considered Co oxidation. In the 3rd cycle, the CV curves overlap better, suggesting that the Co3O4/N-GO electrode has excellent reversibility and cycling stability. The CV curves of pure Co3O4 describe a similar sodiation/desodiation reaction process with Co3O4/N-GO (Fig. S4c). Nevertheless, the cathodic peaks of pure Co3O4 shift to higher potential and anodic peaks shift to lower potential compared with Co3O4/N-GO, indicating the more serious polarization effect. Clearly, the N-GO possesses a higher first discharge capacity than GO because N doping increases the defects of graphene and provides more active sites for sodium storage [43]. However, it is noted that the capacities of N-GO and GO are close after 2nd an 3rd cycle, which should be ascribed to the discrepancy in their morphologies (Fig. S4a-b).",
                "Fig. 4b proves the steady current charge/discharge profile of the Co3O4/N-GO at 0.1 A g−1. The initial discharge capacity and charge capacity of Co3O4/N-GO were 630 mA h g−1 and 616 mA h g−1, respectively. The corresponding first coulomb efficiency is up to 97 %. The capacity drops to 323 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, and the coulomb efficiency is near to 100 %. In a way, the preliminary extended discharge plateau is derived from the decrease of Co3O4 to Co monomers and the establishment of SEI films, which is in accordance with the CV consequences [15], [44]. As a comparison, Co3O4, GO, and N-GO exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 606, 305, and 416 mA h g−1, and decay to 478, 137, and 140 mA h g−1 in the second circle, respectively (Fig. S4a-c).",
                "Fig. 4c appears the rate performance of Co3O4/N-GO, Co3O4, GO, and N-GO electrodes at the current density of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 A g−1 in the voltage windows of 0.005–3.0 V. It is clear that the Co3O4/N-GO electrode manifestations the most excellent rate performance. The specific capacity of Co3O4/N-GO at the current density of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 A g−1 are 480, 347, 296, 237, and 183 mA h g−1, successively. When the current density is renovated to 0.05 A/g, the specific capacity of Co3O4/N-GO returns to 373 mA h g−1, hinting a smooth diffusion reaction of Na+ at the Co3O4/N-GO during de-embedding. At 1 A g−1, the specific capacity of Co3O4/N-GO (183 mAh g−1) is high than those of N-GO (61 mAh/g) and Co3O4 (3.9 mAh g−1), revealing that the Co3O4/N-GO electrode can be charged and discharged at a high rate. Moreover, it is obvious that pure Co3O4 exhibits the lowest stable capacity due to the huge volume expansion [45]. In addition, N-GO electrode shows a slightly increased rate performance than GO electrode due to doping N.",
                "Fig. 4d compares the cycling performance of Co3O4/N-GO, pure Co3O4, GO, and N-GO at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. The Co3O4/N-GO displays high primary discharge capacity of 630/616 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 97 %. After 100 cycles, the Co3O4/N-GO still has a capacity of 323 mA h g−1, outperforming N-GO (165 mA h g−1), GO (104 mA h g−1) and Co3O4 (16.4 mA h g−1). Fig. S6 reveals the cycling stability of Co3O4/N-GO electrode at a high current density of 1.0 A/g. Notably, Co3O4/N-GO anode presents excellent cycling capability, delivering the discharge capacity of 157.2 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 72.07 % in respect to the 2nd cycle discharge capacity of 218.1 mA h g−1. The cycling performance of the Co3O4/N-GO synthetic is relative to those of formerly reported Co3O4-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, as listed in Table S1.",
                "To prove the application of the anode material in real Na+-ion batteries, the full cell system was assembled, coupling Co3O4/N-GO as the anode material and commercial NVP as the cathode material, as illustrated in Fig. 4f. The discharge/charge profiles of the full cell at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 with a voltage range from 0.5 to 3.3 V are presented in Fig. 4e. The assembled full cell exhibits an initial 154.1 mA h g−1 reversible capacity with the Coulombic efficiency of 92.3 %. As shown in Fig. 4g, the full cell also displays the long-term cycling stability at 500 mA g−1. At the first cycle, the reversible capacity is 154.1 mA h g−1, and subsequently grow during the first 5th cycle and ultimately reach their maximum values (162.6 mA h g−1). Subsequently, the reversible capacity steadily decreases to 94.8 mAh g−1 at 30th cycle. Afterwards, the reversible capacity keeps a relative stable status. After 50th cycles, the reversible capacity still maintain to 91.3 mA h g−1, corresponding to capacity retention of 59.2 %. In Fig. 4g, the capacity of the full battery decreases in a short period of time. The irreversible capacity of alloying reaction exists in the charge–discharge cycle of battery [42].When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode), the NVP//Co3O4/N-GO battery exhibits significant energy density (249.9 Wh kg−1) and power density (163.3 W kg−1). The full battery can power a light-emitting diode, as appeared in Fig. 4h. All these results prove that the Co3O4/N-GO is a promising anode for Na-ion batteries and appears potential in a practical application.",
                "EIS tests were adopted to get further penetration on the Na storage capacities of Co3O4/N-GO and Co3O4, as appeared in Fig. 5a. The Nyquist plots exhibit a semicircle in the high-frequency zone corresponds to the course of the charge transfer, and the straight line in the low-frequency zone should be ascribed to the mass transfer of Na ions [52]. Obviously, Co3O4/N-GO shows a low Rct value compared to Co3O4 electrode (24.8). To gain insight into the diffusion state of sodium ions, the linear behavior between Z′ and ω−1/2 is demonstrated in Fig. 5b. The fit slope of Co3O4/N-GO is 1556.02, far lower than that of Co3O4 (9015.38). The EIS results indicate that the introduction of N-doped graphene oxide can distinctly boost the electrons transfer, thus improving sodium storage performance [53].",
                "The Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was measured to grasp the diffusion coefficient of Na ion (DNa+) at different voltage states. The GITT curve of Co3O4/N-GO are presented in Fig. 5c. The DNa+ can be obtained from the following equation [54]:(2)",
                "D Na + = 4 π Δ t m B V M M B S 2 Δ E s Δ E τ 2Where Δt, mB, MB, VM and S represents the pulse time (s), mass of active substance (g), molar mass (g mol−1), molar volume (cm3 mol−1) and active surface area of the electrode (cm2), respectively [43]. The ΔES and ΔEτ are calculated according to the GITT curves [55]. The DNa+ of the Co3O4/N-GO in the discharge and charge process are plotted in Fig. 5e. The DNa+ values vary from 1.95 × 10−12 to 1.51 × 10−14 cm2 s−1 in discharge process, and fluctuate between 1.95 × 10−14 and 1.95 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 in charge process.",
                "As presented in Fig. 5f, CV curves at scan rates of 0.1–5.0 mV s−1 were plotted to further ascertain the detailed transport kinetic properties of Co3O4/N-GO. As well known, the storage mechanism of electrode materials can be split into non-faradaic (the capacitor behavior) and faradaic processes (the diffusion-controlled behavior) [44]. The power-law relationship for calculating the capacitive effect follows the Eq. (3) [45]:(3)",

For Co3O4/N-GO electrode, the b values of the anodic and cathodic peaks are 0.72 and 0.62 (Fig. 5g), evidencing that the Na+ storage kinetics of Co3O4/N-GO is controlled by a combination of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive mechanisms [16]. Furthermore, the relative contribution of pseudocapacitive can be quantitatively determined from the following Eq. (4) [47]:(4)",
                "i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2Here k1 and k2 are constants, while the k1v and k2v1/2 represents the contribution of pseudo-capacity and intercalation reactions, separately [48]. As interpreted in Fig. 5h, the section for pseudocapacity contribution of Co3O4/N-GO can even go to 84.4 % at 5.0 mV s−1. Simultaneously, it is found the contribution of pseudocapacitive section with the rising of scan rate augment. At the scan rate of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mV s−1, the pseudocapacitive contribution are 43.3 %, 63.1 %, 70.1 %, 77.3 % and 84.4 %, separately (Fig. 5i and Fig. S8), reflecting the domination of capacitive behavior in the storage process [34], [49], [50].",
                "Fig. S9a-b presents the XRD patterns of Co3O4/N-GO electrode at discharge–charge process. It is discovered that the diffraction peak of (3 1 1) gradually move from 36.4730 to 36.8110 during the discharge course, indicating the alloying reaction occurred with the insertion of Na+. Inversely, the charging process within the limits of 0.01–3.0 V, the interplanar spacing of Co3O4/N-GO decreases with the increase of voltage, implying the deintercalation of Na+ [51], [56]. Fig. S10 shows SEM images and EDS mapping of Co3O4/N-GO electrode after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. After test, the Co3O4 nanoparticles is similar to the its initial shape, revealing the good durability (Fig. S10a-c). The corresponding EDX mapping view illustrates that C, Co, O, Na and N atoms were uniformly represented in Co3O4/N-GO after charge–discharge cycle (Fig. S10d). The Co3O4/N-GO composite has good stability and cyclability between the surface and electrolyte."
