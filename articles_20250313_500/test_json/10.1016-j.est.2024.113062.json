                "The direct reduction of solid Bi2O3 to Bi used for a high-performance anode is studied for the first time. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the conversion of solid Bi2O3 is a one-step process. Electrolysis measurements using a solid Bi2O3 cathode were carried out at various experimental conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the electrolytic samples reveal that the solid Bi2O3 can be completed reduced to Bi. The electrolytic Bi obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h achieves a long and steady cycle, a higher specific capacity than 403.2 mAh g−1, and a higher capacity retention than 95.5 % cycling for even 4000 cycles, as well as an excellent rate capability. The electrochemical deoxidation approach can provide a green and straightforward pathway for producing high-performance sodium-ion batteries anodes.",

                "In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been widely investigated because of their low cost, abundant resources, and comparable electrochemical properties with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which are considered to be the most promising alternative for LIBs [1]. Although the storage mechanisms of sodium identical to lithium, and the reduction potential of sodium is very close to lithium, it is more difficult to find suitable anodes for SIBs because of their larger radius [2]. Over the past decade or so, various anodes have been used for SIBs, such as carbon-based materials (hard carbon [3,4], carbon nanotube [5,6], graphene [7]), titanium-based materials [8,9], alloy-type materials (Sn [[10], [11], [12], [13]], Sb [14,15], Bi [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]), and conversion-type materials (transition metal compounds [21,22]). Among them, Bi-based alloy-type anodes have been received much attention owing to the high theoretical capacity (385 mAh g−1 from Bi to Na3Bi) and suitable voltage platform (about 0.6 V vs Na+/Na), which are considered to be a promising candidate as anode for SIBs [19,23].",
                "So far, great progress has been made in the study of the Bi-based anodes for SIBs. Notably, bulk bismuth could gradually transform into structurally stable three-dimensional porous bismuth nanoparticles after cycling in electrolytes mixed with NaPF6 and ether-based solvents, and this unique evolutionary mechanism contributed to the realization of superior electrochemical performances (higher specific capacity, rate and capacity retention, etc.) for the bismuth anode. Kim et al. [24] found that the bulk bismuth anode in DME solvent still had a storage capacity of 378 mAh g−1 after 6000 cycles at 3.85 A g−1, and even after 3500 cycles at a higher current rate of 7.7 A g−1, the NaBi half-cell still provided a capacity of 360 mAh g−1 (an average capacity loss of only 0.0014 % per cycle). Similarly, Wang et al. [25] reported that the bulk bismuth anode could be well wetted in NaPF6-G2 electrolyte and a uniform and stable solid electrolyte interface would be formed on the surface, and the capacity was still 398 mAh g−1 after 2000 cycles at 0.4 A g−1, with a capacity retention rate of 94.4 %. Hence, the use of ether-based electrolytes can improve the electrochemical performance of the Bi-based anodes. In addition to the use of bulk bismuth as anode, the electrochemical performance of Bi-based anodes can be improved by other strategies, such as designing nanostructures [26], compounding with carbon materials [27,28], and synthesizing bismuth alloys [29,30]. Zhang et al. [29] successfully prepared BiSb alloy nanoparticles using pulsed laser treatment of bismuth metal-organic frameworks (MOF-836) with added Sb salts, and the ratio of the two elements in the alloy could be precisely controlled. In particularly, the Bi0.70Sb0.30 alloy still had a specific capacity of 259.8 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, with an average capacity loss of <0.055 % per cycle, and the capacity remained at 180.9 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Ma et al. [31] fabricated a high surface area of Bi microspheres coated with nitrogen-doped carbon via thermally reduced polydopamine-coated Bi2S3. The results showed that the obtained Bi@NC composite anode achieved a long-cycle performance of 4000 accompany with a high capacity (363 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1). Likewise, Wei et al. [32] developed a similar Bi-based nanocomposite anode by a solvothermal treatment. The Bi@NC anode exhibited an excellent rate capability, as well as a long-cycle performance of 5000 accompany with a high capacity (324.2 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1). Guo et al. [33] obtained an ultra-long cycle life of P-Bi/C anode material via a one-step magnesium thermal reduction. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of bicontinuous nanopores with graphene-like carbon cages, the capacity of the obtained anode could retain 178 mAh g−1 at 50 A g −1 for the long-cycle of 20,000. Moreover, they found that P-Bi/C anode could be well applied even at low temperatures of −253 K. To date, the direct electrochemical reduction of solid Bi2O3 to Bi as an anode for SIBs in a choline chloride-ethylene glycol deep eutectic solvent has not been found. The electrochemical deoxidation approach displays several advantages because of (i) it provides a green and straightforward pathway using green electrons as the reductant, (ii) the preparation process is low-carbon and environmentally friendly with evolution of O2 at anode, (iii) the low-cost Bi2O3 feedstocks, and (iiii) the obtained electrolytic product is metallic powder with small particles which is very suitably used for anode material.",
                "In this paper, the direct electrochemical reduction of solid Bi2O3 to Bi used for a high-performance anode was reported for the first time. The reduction behavior of Bi2O3 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant voltage electrolysis measurements were conducted on various experimental conditions, and the cycling and rate performances of the obtained electrolytic samples were measured."

A choline chloride-ethylene glycol deep eutectic solvent was prepared by mixing and stirring a mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol with the molar ratio of 1:2 at 353 K.",
                "CV was conducted on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. A home-made graphite cavity electrode that was fabricated by drilling a hole of 1.0 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in depth on a high purity graphite rod (3 mm in diameter) (Fig. 1), a platinum wire (Alfa Aesar, ≥99.99 %), and a silver wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.9 %) were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the quasi-reference electrode, respectively.",
                "Constant voltage electrolysis was carried out on the same electrochemical workstation using a two-electrode system under constant voltages of 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 V for 2, 4, and 6 h. A cathode of porous Bi2O3 pellet that was wrapped with a nickel mesh and silver current collector and an anode of a graphite rod were used for constant voltage electrolysis. The Bi2O3 cathode was fabricated by mixing and milling a mixture of Bi2O3 powder and NH4HCO3 (as a pore-forming agent, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., AR) with the weight ratio of 7:3 for >1 h, then the mixture was pressed into cylindrical pellet (mass: 0.4 g, diameter: 10 mm) at 8 MPa, and finally the obtained cylindrical pellet was sintered at 393 K for 2 h to remove NH4HCO3 led to the formation of large numbers of pores in the pressed-pellet. After constant voltage electrolysis experiments, the obtained electrolytic products were taken out from the deep eutectic solvent, and examined using XRD (PANalytical B.V.) and SEM (Hitachi, Ltd.).",
                "To prepare the active electrode, 70 wt% of electrolytic Bi, 10 wt% of Super P (conductive agent, Shenzhen Kejing, China), 10 wt% of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (binder, Shenzhen Kejing, China, USP grade), and 10 wt% of polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (elasticity additive, Suzhou Duoduo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China) were dispersed in appropriate amount of deionized water to prepare a honey-like slurry, then the obtained slurry was pasted uniformly onto a copper foil (the mass load of the active material is about 1.0 mg cm−2) and dried at 353 K overnight. The sodium storage performance of the electrolytic bismuth was measured with a half-cell which was assembled in a glove box, where both the moisture and oxygen contents were lower than 0.1 ppm. The as-prepared bismuth circular slice, a sodium foil (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., 99.5 %, diameter: 14 mm), a glass fiber (Whatman, GF/F, diameter: 17 mm), and a solution of 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in diglyme (Suzhou Duoduo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China) were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, the separator, and the electrolyte, respectively.

                        "Linear scan voltammetry was firstly performed to study the electrochemical window of the applied electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 2a. It demonstrates that the cathodic decomposition of the applied electrolyte is observed at about −1.2, and the anodic decomposition of the applied electrolyte is observed at 1.4 V, indicating that the electrolyte exhibits an electrochemical window of 2.6 V, which is consistent with the result obtained by Wang et al. [34]. Then, CV was performed on a working electrode with Bi2O3 to study the reduction behavior of Bi2O3 in the electrolyte (Fig. 2b). It proves that only one significant cathodic current corresponding to the reduction of Bi2O3 is found at a potential that is much more positive than the decomposition potential of the electrolyte, indicating that the conversion of solid Bi2O3 is a one-step process.",
                        "Fig. 3a demonstrates that both Bi2O3 and metallic Bi are found under 2.2 V, suggesting that only a portion of Bi2O3 was reduced to Bi. However, as the constant voltage increased to 2.4 V, the diffraction peaks of metallic Bi increase significantly while the diffraction peaks of Bi2O3 decrease to a negligible amount, suggesting that most amount of Bi2O3 was reduced to Bi. A further increase of the constant voltage to 2.6 V, the diffraction peaks of Bi2O3 disappear and all the diffraction peaks can be identified as metallic Bi, suggesting that Bi2O3 was completely reduced and the conversion rate of Bi2O3 will increase significantly with the increasing of the applied voltage. Fig. 3b shows that the diffraction peaks of Bi2O3 and Bi are both observed for 2 h, and all the diffraction peaks are ascribed to Bi when the duration of electrolysis increased. Therefore, it can be concluded that the reduction rate of Bi2O3 will increase significantly with the increasing of the duration of electrolysis.",
                        "Fig. 4 presents the microscopic morphology of the electrolytic Bi prepared under different constant voltages. It clearly shows that the microscopic morphology of the electrolytic Bi is obviously unidentical to the original Bi2O3. Before electrolysis, the original Bi2O3 displays an elongated structure. Under 2.2 V, dendritic and cauliflower structure of grains with different sizes are formed. As the constant voltage of the electrolysis increased, the grains of the electrolytic Bi will decrease to form spherical structure of grains. A further increase of the constant voltage of electrolysis, the grains of the obtained products will further decrease to form smaller particles with an average size of 2 μm. This is because the conversion kinetics increases with the increasing of cell voltage, which will increase of the active site of reduction reaction, and hence decreases the particles size of the electrolytic products."

                "Fig. 5a shows the cyclic voltammograms of the electrolytic Bi anode obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h. A broad cathodic peak can be observed during the cathodic scan for the first cycle, while two anodic peaks are found at 0.62 and 0.76 V, respectively, after the direction of the scan turned to positive. As reported, the broad cathodic current is ascribed to the activation of the electrode and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface, while the two anodic peaks are attributed to the desodiation reactions of Na3Bi to NaBi and Bi. In the following cycles, two cathodic peaks due to the sodiation of Bi to NaBi and Na3Bi are found at 0.68 and 0.47 V, respectively, during the cathodic scan. Moreover, the redox peaks nearly overlap, indicating the high reversibility of the electrolytic electrode.",
                "The galvanostatic charge-discharge curves display two distinct discharge and charge voltage platforms, as shown in Fig. 5b. The values of the voltage platforms are almost identical to the CV curves. In the initial cycle, the discharge and charge capacities of the electrolytic Bi anode are high up to 441.4 and 396.3 mAh g−1, respectively. Therefore, the initial coulombic efficiency of the electrolytic Bi anode is calculated to be 89.7 %. This high discharge capacity is contributed by the capacity of Bi and Super P (Fig. 5f). In the following cycles, the curves have no significantly change and overlap well, indicating the excellent reversibility of the electrolytic Bi anode.",
                "Fig. 5c presents the rate capability of the electrolytic electrode obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h. The electrolytic electrode delivers high specific capacities of 408.7, 406.3, 403.9, 402.4, 400.0, 391.1, 378.0, and 369.5 mAh g−1, respectively. Moreover, the capacity can return to 398.9 mAh g−1 that is very near to the initial value once the current density recovers from 10.0 to 0.1 A g−1 cycling for 140 cycles, indicating the stable structure and excellent rate performance of the electrolytic Bi anode. Fig. 5d shows the galvanostatic charge-discharge curves of the electrolytic Bi anode obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h. It exhibits nearly similar shape, indicating a small polarization of the electrolytic electrode even at higher current density, and hence a fast kinetic of the electrolytic Bi anode. Compared with previous references about bismuth-based anodes, such as Bi@NC [31], Arrayed Bi [35], Bi/C nanofiber [36], Bi/GO [37], Bi@3DGFs [38], Bi/MXene [39], Bi/CNTs [40], Bi@LIG [41], Bi-C/CF [42], and so on, the electrolytic Bi anode obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h delivers high specific capacities and an excellent rate capability (Fig. 5e).",

It can be seen that the capacity of the electrolytic Bi is high up to 420.1 mAh g−1 and the corresponding capacity retention is high up to 99.2 % cycling for 1000 cycles, while the commercial Bi exhibits a little low capacity of 399 mAh g−1. More amazingly, the electrolytic Bi anode obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h achieves a long and steady cycle, a higher specific capacity than 403.2 mAh g−1, a higher capacity retention than 95.5 %, and the coulombic efficiency of almost 100 % cycling for even 4000 cycles (Fig. 5g), indicating that the electrolytic Bi is a promising electrode for SIBs.",

It can be observed that the surface of the pristine Bi electrode is tight, dense, and uniform (Fig. 6a). After 4000 cycles, the morphology of the Bi electrode evolves into a porous, stable, and integrate network structure without any cracks, which can be able to alleviate the volume change during the repeated charge and discharge processes, and thus guaranteeing a stable cycling performance.",
                "CV measurements were performed at different scan rates to study the kinetic process of the electrolytic Bi anode obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h, as shown in Fig. 7a. It can be seen that the cyclic voltammograms display two pairs of redox peaks and the peak potential almost keep the same with the increasing of the scan rate. As reported in references [32, 40], the peak current is a function of the scan rate and can be analyzed by using Eq. (1)(1)",
                "i = a v bwhere a and b are constants, i is the peak current, and v is the scan rate, which can be obtained by fitting a logi-logv plot. The reaction is a diffusion-controlled process when the value of b closes to 0.5, while the reaction is a surface capacitance process when the value of b nears to 1. As shown in Fig. 7b, the values of b are calculated to be 0.85, 0.53, 0.61, and 0.69, respectively, suggesting that the sodium storage of the electrolytic Bi obtained at 2.6 V for 6 h is ascribed to both the diffusion process and surface capacitance process."
