                "Layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, 0 < x ≤ 1) are considered one of the most promising cathodes for Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and operability. However, NaxTMO2 still faces significant challenges, including poor kinetic performance and low energy efficiency. Herein, in order to enhance the kinetics of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NaNFMO), topography control and component design were proposed: First, Cu doping (Cu-NaNFMO) was used to expand lattice channels and improve “flat sheet” of layered oxide, which synergistically enhanced transport kinetics of Na+. Second, Co coating (NaNFMO@Co) reacted with surface residue to form a fast-ionic conductor NaxCoO2 (0 < x ≤ 1), which inhibited interfacial side reactions and enhanced transport kinetics of Na+. Furthermore, the presence of strong Cu-O bonds in Cu-NaNFMO and fast-ionic conductor NaxCoO2 in NaNFMO@Co led to better electrochemical redox performance, the initial charge specific capacity of NaNFMO was increased from 141.5 mAh g⁻1 to 145.8 mAh g⁻1 and 144 mAh g⁻1, with capacity retention improving by nearly 10 % after 100 cycles. Furthermore, NaNFMO@Co improves ICE from 90.56 % to 93.57 %. With the improved kinetics, the DCR of pouch cells decreased, and the energy efficiency increased from 93.3 % to 94 % and 95.7 %.",

                "In recent years, the continuous development of energy storage and electric vehicles has led to widespread use of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity, long cycling performance, and high energy density [ ]. However, the high cost of LIBs is a significant drawback, primarily due to the scarcity and uneven distribution of lithium resources in nature. Additionally, the recycling of lithium sources from spent batteries is challenging and inefficient [ , , , ], further escalating the costs. To address these issues, researchers have increasingly turned their attention to Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which share similar charge-discharge mechanisms with LIBs. Both sodium (Na) and lithium (Li) belong to the alkali metal group in the periodic table, resulting in comparable physical and chemical properties. Moreover, sodium source is abundant, widely distributed, and easier to obtain, leading to lower costs for SIBs [ , ]. However, the larger ionic radius of Na+ (1.02 Å compared to 0.76 Å for Li+) and its higher relative atomic mass (23 g mol g−1 for Na vs. 6.9 g mol g−1 for Li) result in poorer kinetic performance and lower energy density for SIBs, hindering their widespread use in large-scale energy storage applications.",
                "Currently, a variety of cathode materials for SIBs are under extensive investigation, including layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, 0 ＜ x ≤ 1, where TM denotes transition metal), polyanion compounds [ , ], prussian blue analogs (PBAs) [ ], and organic compounds [ ]. Among these, layered oxides (NaxTMO2) has garnered significant attention due to the similarity in synthesis and structure of ion storage with Li-based ternary oxide cathodes. Compared to PBAs and polyanion compounds, layered oxides offer advantages such as facile synthesis, adjustable voltage range, high theoretical specific capacity, structural stability, and good sodium storage capacity ect [ , ].",
                "However, NaxTMO2 cathodes face some challenges, including structural collapse, lower specific capacity, lower energy density, and reduced efficiency due to irreversible phase transitions [ ] and transition metal (TM) dissolution during electrochemical cycling [ , , ]. Other issues include air instability [ ], surface residual alkali [ ], and slow kinetics caused by complex phase transitions ect. Recent research efforts have focused on modifying layered oxides to address these issues [ ], such as (1) doping with specific elements to alter the charge density around Na+ and strengthen TM-O bonds to stabilize the layered structure and inhibit phase transitions; (2) constructing intercrystalline symbiotic structures to leverage the benefits of different crystalline phases and enhance structural stability [ , , , ]; and (3) applying various coating materials, including oxide coating, phosphate coating [ , ], and other coatings [ , ], to create an inert separator layer or fast-ionic conductor that mitigates anisotropic volume changes and side reactions between the cathode and electrolyte. For example, Qi et al. [ ] employed a ternary cathode gradient distribution strategy, coating MnOx on the surface of O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 using a liquid-phase method to reduce residual alkali and improve electrochemical properties such as capacity retention and rate capacity. Similarly, Liu et al. [ ] doped Ti and Mg as substitute elements for Co to obtain P2-Na0.67Mn0.53Ni0.30Mg0.085Ti0.085O2, thereby increasing the median discharge voltage from 3.21 V to 3.59 V and the energy density from 325 Wh kg−1 to 410 Wh g−1, which can not only promote the O compensation reaction but also inhibit the O2 loss at a high voltage of 4.25 V. Li et al. [ ] proposed constructing a NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoshell to inhibit side reactions and Mn3+ dissolution during cycling, thereby improving cycling stability and providing excellent Na+ diffusion paths and higher electronic conductivity. Also, Professor Zhao's team [ ] proposed the role of NaTi2(PO4)3 as a coating layer of O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2, the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer can not only play a critical role in preventing the highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid (HF) attacks from decomposition of electrolyte and subsequent dissolution of the redox-active metal from the cathode particles but also expand the crystal spacing due to the partial doping of Ti4+, so as to stabilize the structure and promote the migration kinetics of Na+.",
                "Based on the arrangement of the TM layer and the coordination environment of Na+, layered oxide cathodes are usually classified into two categories: O3-type and P2-type. In P2 phase, Na+ diffuses through adjacent prismatic sites with lower energy barriers, while in O3 phase, Na+ must pass through a tetrahedral site with higher energy to move from one octahedral site to the next, resulting in poorer Na+ diffusion kinetics and thus lower rate performance, which also impacts the cycling stability of the material. This phenomenon reflected in the design of pouch cell embodies high direct current resistance (DCR) and low energy efficiency, hindering large-scale application in energy storage systems. Previous studies have seldom focused specifically on the kinetic performance of materials, particularly in the field of layered oxides for SIBs. Rui et al. [ ] proposed a superior LT SIB composed of 3D porous Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C-F) and NaTi2(PO4)3/C foams (NTP/C-F) to develop high-performance SIBs at low temperature. The designed 3D interconnected porous foam structures demonstrate excellent electrolyte absorption ability and Na+ transport performance at low temperatures. Pang et al. [ ] found that appropriate Al doping improved the electrochemical stability of layered Mn-based oxides, demonstrating better electrode kinetics (with better Na+ diffusion coefficient). Kim et al. [ ] proposed that the kinetic hindrance of cobalt-free cathode materials is significantly influenced by current rate and electrode loading level, leading to a reduction in reversible specific capacity and cycling performance. Additionally, particle size and residual lithium content also affect Li+ diffusion kinetics. Thus, controlling particle size and employing strategies such as doping, coating, and washing to reduce residual lithium content are essential for enhancing the kinetic performance of materials.",
                "Based on prior research, we found that poor kinetic performance of materials not only affects capacity and cycling stability but also leads to increased DCR and reduced energy efficiency in pouch cells, thereby hindering the further development and application of SIBs in the energy-storage system. Therefore, we propose to enhance the kinetic performance of O3-type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 layered oxides through topography control and component design (Fig. 1). On one hand, layered oxide cathodes typically exhibit a \"flat sheet\" morphology with crystals adhering to each other, this phenomenon adversely affects the kinetic performance of the material. To address the issue of improving the \"flat sheet\" morphology of layered oxides, we used Cu doping to reduce the exposure of inactive crystal plane (0 0 x) and promote de-flattening growth of crystals, thereby improving Na+ transport pathways and enhancing the kinetic performance of the material. Additionally, the Cu2+/Cu3+ redox electron pairs provide capacity compensation, slow down the phase transitions [ ] during electrochemical processes, and enhance structural stability. On the other hand, considering that cathode inevitably undergoes side reactions at the interface with the electrolyte, leading to the formation of an inert CEI layer, and the presence of surface residue, which hinders Na+ transport, we aim to suppress these interface side reactions by constructing an interface Na+ fast-ion conductor layer to improve Na+ transport kinetics. Therefore, we choose CoOOH coating strategy, where NaxCoO2 (0 < x ≤ 1) forms with residual sodium on the material surface exhibits good ion diffusion rates and high redox potential, not only suppressing interface side reactions but also promoting Na+ diffusion kinetics. The results show that although the two modification strategies we designed approach the problem from different angles, they ultimately both successfully improve the kinetic performance of O3-type NaNFMO. Verification results in pouch cells show that compared to NaNFMO, Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co exhibit higher energy efficiency and better capacity retention under high current density conditions. This indicates that our modification strategies successfully improved the kinetic performance of O3-NaNFMO and provided new design ideas for the widespread and practical application of SIBs in the energy storage field."

                "The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal the valence states of elements in the samples. Fig. S2a displays the XPS spectra for Ni 2p. The binding energy at 854.2 and 871.6 eV correspond to Ni2+, [ ] while those at 855.7 and 873.3 eV correspond to Ni3+. Among the three samples, Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co have lower Ni3+ content and higher Ni2+ content compared to NaNFMO. Based on charge balance, it is inferred that Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co have higher Mn4+ content than NaNFMO, which increases the bond energy of Mn-O and stabilizes the structure. Additionally, fewer Jahn-Teller active Ni3+ reduce the likelihood of irreversible structural phase transitions [ , , ]. Fig. S2b shows the XPS spectra for Fe 2p. The peak at 710.1 eV corresponds to Fe2+, while those at 712.2 eV and 724.3 eV correspond to Fe3+, with a satellite peak at 718.3 eV. The results indicate the coexistence of Fe2+ and Fe3+, with Fe3+ being the predominant oxidation state [ , ]. The content of Fe3+ in Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co is higher than that in NaNFMO and the presence of Fe3+ exhibits an electron-withdrawing state, which increases the oxidation state of surrounding Mn ions, thereby suppressing the Jahn-Teller effect induced by Mn3+ [ ] and maintaining structural stability. Mn 2p spectra (Fig. S2c) shows the peaks at 641.6 and 653.3 eV correspond to Mn3+, while those at 643.0 and 655.5 eV correspond to Mn4+, and Mn4+ is predominant [ ]. Jahn-Teller distortion is primarily caused by Mn3+. Notably, compared to the original NaNFMO (48.35 %), the Mn4+ content in Cu-NaNFMO (56.19 %) and NaNFMO@Co (57.69 %) is increased while Mn3+ content is decreased, which helps to suppress Jahn-Teller distortion, maintain the reversible storage performance of Na+, and enhance structural stability. Fig. S3a presents the XPS survey spectra for the three samples. The XPS spectra for Cu 2p in Cu-NaNFMO are shown in Fig. S3b. The Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks are located at 933.2 and 953.0 eV, respectively, with a satellite peak at 945.0 eV, indicating that Cu shows +2 state [ ]. The XPS spectra for Co 2p in NaNFMO@Co are shown in Fig. S3c. Contrary to the general trend, the Co3+ peaks are observed at lower binding energies of 779.6 and 794.4 eV, while the Co2+ peaks are at higher binding energies of 781.6 and 795.9 eV, with a peak at 786.1 eV corresponding to the satellite peak. This indicates successful coating of Co [ , , ]. Additionally, the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2d) reveals the peak at 528.8 eV attributed to lattice oxygen, which corresponds to TM-O; the peak at 530.8 eV assigned to oxygen species deposited on the material surface, such as Na2CO3 and the peak at 535.5 eV linked to oxygen in adsorbed water [ , , , ]. Analysis of the spectra indicates that the peaks related to adsorbed water in Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co are smaller compared to those in NaNFMO, suggesting their better air stability. The C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c) exhibits peaks representing various carbon species: the peak at 284.3 eV is attributed to C-C/C=O, and the peak at 289.1 eV is associated with -C-C=O [ , , , , ].

The semicircle at high-frequency represented the membrane impedance (Rf), and the semicircle at low-frequency represented the charge transfer impedance (Rct), both were increased with the cycles, but the impedance of Cu-NaNFMO was much smaller than that of NaNFMO. Fig. S6a shows a schematic illustration of the single-step GITT process. In this context, Ohmic polarization refers to the voltage difference between the initial charging voltage and the previous relaxation voltage during the relaxation process. Voltage polarization is defined as the difference between the charging termination voltage and the equilibrium voltage at the end of the next relaxation process. The magnitudes of Voltage polarization and Ohmic polarization directly reflect the rate of Na+ deintercalation. Comparing the GITT results, as shown in Figs. S6b and S6c, the Na+ diffusion coefficients (",

The initial cycle charge-discharge curves for NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co (Fig. 6a) demonstrated that NaNFMO@Co exhibited a higher specific capacity and a smoother electrochemical curve. This improvement could be attributed to high-temperature calcination under O2, which compensates for structural damage and oxygen loss, partially recovering capacity. Additionally, NaNFMO@Co showed reduced polarization, indicating decreased residual alkali. Fig. 6b shows that NaNFMO@Co had a capacity retention rate of 66.19 % after 100 cycles, significantly higher than 58.13 % of the NaNFMO. At the same time, the first cycle coulombic efficiency (CE) of NaNFMO@Co also improved from 90.69 % to 93.57 %, enhancing the energy efficiency of the material.",

                        "Residual alkali is a significant issue for SIBs cathodes. Surface residual sodium reacts with H2O and CO2 in the air, forming NaOH and Na2CO3 [ ], while lattice sodium can be exchanged by protons H, leading to lattice destruction and structural collapse. Surface residual sodium further reacts with the electrolyte, evolving gas during electrochemical cycles and increasing battery safety risks. These residues also form surface resistance compounds, hindering Na+ deintercalation and degrading electrochemical performance. Additionally, the strong alkalinity of residual sodium can cause defluoridation of the PVDF binder in the slurry, leading to gelation and flocculation during slurry coating [ ]. Residual alkali content results (Fig. S7a) showed that Cu doping improved air stability of the sample and reduced structural Na + substitution by H2O, thus lowering residual alkali. NaNFMO@Co exhibited a significant reduction in residual alkali, likely due to the reaction between Co and residual Na2CO3 forming NaxCoO2, which consumes residual alkali. NaxCoO2 also serves as an excellent Na + transport medium, improving the kinetics of Na+. XRD analysis (Fig. S7b) confirmed the formation of Na0.6CoO2 from calcining an equal molar mixture of Na2CO3 and CoOOH at 550 °C for 4 h in O2, proving that CoOOH reacts with surface residual alkali after Co coating, reducing polarization and enhancing kinetics of the material."

During 500 cycles, Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co demonstrated greater stability, with capacity retention rates of 97.98 % and 99.22 %, respectively, higher than that of NaNFMO (94.71 %). The initial charge-discharge curves (Fig. 7b) revealed that Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co had initial capacities of 1290 mAh and 1289 mAh, respectively, higher than that of NaNFMO (1286 mAh), and the first two had a higher voltage plateau. Fig. 7c shows that NaNFMO@Co exhibited the best rate performance, followed by Cu-NaNFMO, and NaNFMO last. Furthermore, Fig. 7d indicates that the energy efficiency of Cu-NaNFMO and NNFMO@Co is 94 % and 95.7 % at 0.5 C respectively, which is greater than that of NaNFMO (93.3 %). This phenomenon suggests that, under equivalent discharge conditions, Cu-NaNFMO and NaNFMO@Co utilize energy more effectively, contributing to reduced electricity costs and enhanced energy efficiency. Additionally, NaNFMO@Co had a DCR of 51.3 mΩ, significantly lower than that of NaNFMO (63.3 mΩ), validating the effectiveness of Co coating in enhancing material kinetics. The DCR of Cu-NaNFMO was 66.61 mΩ, higher than NaNFMO's 63.3 mΩ, which is attributed to the larger single crystal size due to Cu doping, slightly raising the DCR but overall improving energy efficiency. In summary, Cu doping and Co coating strategies significantly enhanced the performance metrics of the pouch cells, demonstrating the feasibility of our modification strategy."
