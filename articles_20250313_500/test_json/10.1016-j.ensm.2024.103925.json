                "Low-cost and long-life cathode materials, such as the polyanionic iron-based Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, are crucial for future large-scale energy storage applications. This material is typically synthesized from the hydrated precursor Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O. However, the vapor released during the heating of crystal water can lead to reduced crystallinity, increased fraction of Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities, and potential structural damage to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. For the first time, we synthesized a stable Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 material using a well-designed sol-gel method. This approach effectively mitigates the aforementioned risks by facilitating a unique transition from anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode. The enhanced crystallinity, controllable impurity fraction, and reduced migration barriers of the pristine Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode significantly improve electrochemical performance. Moreover, we constructed Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C composite cathodes to optimize their high-rate capacity and cycling retention. At 25 °C, these composites exhibit remarkable high-rate capacity and maintain an impressive 92.2 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 C. In tests under extreme conditions at −25 °C, 0 °C, and 60 °C, they sustained over 90 % capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C or exceeded 95 % after 200 cycles at 2 C. Furthermore, the assembled Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C//HC full cells demonstrate superior rate capacity and long-term cycling stability, indicating their promising potential for commercial applications."

                "The escalating environmental degradation attributed to conventional fossil fuels has underscored the imperative for investigating and cultivating sustainable, renewable, and clean energy alternatives [ ]. Given the sporadic and disparate distribution of these renewable resources, the establishment of large-scale energy storage systems capable of judiciously harnessing and distributing energy emerges as a direct and efficacious solution [ ]. Lithium-ion batteries, with their outstanding cycling life and moderate energy density, are widely adopted in industrial fields as large-scale energy storage containers [ ]. However, their subpar safety under high temperatures and poorer electrochemical performance at low temperatures are concerning [ , ], especially in extreme application scenarios such as photovoltaic installations in deserts and wind power installations at high altitudes. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), with a similar energy storage mechanism to lithium-ion batteries, are viewed as potent contenders in the future large-scale energy storage market due to their earth-abundant elements, superior thermal safety and low-temperature electrochemical performance [ , ]. Consequently, the development of cost-effective, long-lasting cathodes for sodium-ion batteries that are suitable for large-scale energy storage applications in all-climate conditions, has captured researchers' attention. In this context, polyanionic iron-based cathode materials are recognized as one of the most promising candidates, attributed to their low cost, wide temperature stability and robust cycling performance [ , , ].",
                "Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 is recognized as an excellent cathode material due to its high operating voltage and moderate capacity [ , , ]. However, its polyanionic framework leads to poor electronic conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics [ , , ]. To mitigate the significant decomposition of SO42− groups above 450 °C, researchers have employed both solid-state [ , ] and aqueous-solution synthetic routes [ , ], incorporating ex-situ conductive materials with the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathodes to improve electrochemical performance. In aqueous-solution routes, the hydrated precursor Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O is typically used to produce Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 [ , ]. However, the vapor released from the heated crystal water may compromise the crystal integrity of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, potentially reverting it back to Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O through hydration reactions [ ]. Additionally, the anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor cannot be directly obtained by sintering hydrated Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O material, leading to a product containing Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities [ , ]. Some efforts have been made to synthesize the anhydrous precursor Na2Fe(SO4)2 by replicating the synthetic conditions used for Na2Co(SO4)2 and Na2Ni(SO4)2 [ , ]. Unfortunately, researchers have only succeeded in obtaining the stable Vanthoffite-type Na6Fe(SO4)4 [ , , ]. Consequently, the physicochemical properties of a stable Na2Fe(SO4)2 and the crystallographic transition mechanism from anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode have not yet been systematically reported.",
                "In this study, a stable Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 materials were synthesized for the first time. The potential risks of low crystallinity, structural damage, and irreversible formation of more Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities due to crystal water vapor were mitigated through the unique transition from anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor to Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode. Compared to electrochemically inactive Na2Fe(SO4)2, the pristine Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 exhibits enhanced low-rate capacity but demonstrates suboptimal performance in high-rate capacity and cycle retention. To address these limitations, we constructed the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C composite cathodes with improved conductivity, which exhibited a higher average working potential, superior high-rate capacity, and an excellent capacity retention. In tests under various climatic conditions at −25 °C, 0 °C, and 60 °C, the composite cathodes maintained over 90 % capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C or over 95 % after 200 cycles at 2 C. Furthermore, the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C//HC full cells, which were assembled with hard carbon (HC) as the anode and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C as the cathode, exhibited exceptional rate capacity and enhanced cycling stability."

                "Fig. 1a illustrates our carefully designed sol-gel synthesis pathway, specifically aimed at mitigating the deleterious effects of moisture on the Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, thus marking a significant departure from the traditional direct sintering methods. For comparison, we prepared the conventional hydrated Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O precursor and tried to obtain the related product Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H through a one-step calcination process (Figure S1). Notably, we observed that water droplets, which condensed from the water vapor, continued to form on the inner surface of the tube wall even as the temperature rose to approximately 270 °C during calcination (Figure S2). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis delineates the distinct crystal structures of the Stanfieldite-type Na2​Fe(SO4​)2​ and the Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. Comprehensive powder XRD Rietveld refinement data confirm that the crystal structure of the Na2Fe(SO4)2 phase is analogous to that of Na2Co(SO4)2 (PDF#97–019–4629) and Na2Ni(SO4)2 (PDF#97–019–4630) [ , ], while diverging from the derived phases Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H, and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C (Figs. 1b-1c, Figures S3-S4)[ , ]. A juxtaposition of the principal crystallographic data for Na2Fe(SO4)2, Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O, Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H, and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C is delineated in Table 1 and Tables S1-S5. The Na2Fe(SO4)2 exhibits larger lattice parameters with a = 23.37554 Å, c = 17.46092 Å, and V = 4155.171 Å3 compared to pristine Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. However, it has smaller lattice parameters of b = 10.31535 Å Notably, all principal crystallographic parameters of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H are smaller than those of pristine Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and modified Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C, indicating potential structural damage (Table 1).",
                "Both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results indicate that Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 readily converts to Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O in humid environments. This conversion subsequently leads to the formation of more Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities after a second calcination [ , ]. This subtle transformation is observed by a decrease in the diffraction intensity of the main peaks (240) and (200), with the intensity ratio of I(240): I(200) gradually dropping below 1.0 [ ]. As the hydration reaction progresses, the formation of additional Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities alters the δ value of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. The change in the Na/Fe ratio may increase the disorder within Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and reduce its crystallinity [ , ]. A comparable phenomenon, known as cation intermixing, is commonly observed in layered metal-oxide cathodes [ , ]. In our study, the intensity ratios of I(240): I(200) for Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H were determined to be 1.08 and 0.84, respectively, indicating a lower crystallinity of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H. Furthermore, Rietveld refinement analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) results estimate the mass fractions of Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities in the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H systems to be 15.3 wt.% and 17.7 wt.%, indicating a higher degree of structural disorder in Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3H. Both Plewa et al. and Yang et al. demonstrate that the mixed precursors transform into Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 within the temperature range of 250–300 °C, as evidenced by in-situ high-temperature XRD tests [ , ]. Thus, the presence of water vapor on the inner wall of the tube at 270 °C or higher significantly increases the risk of structural damage to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. In summary, employing an anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor is beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity of the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 product, reducing the formation of Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities, and mitigating the risk of structural damage. To elucidate the transition mechanism from the anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor to the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 product, we propose the following reaction pathways:(1)",
                "1.7766m o lN a 2 S O 4 + 1.7766m o lF e S O 4 · 7 H 2 O → 1.7766 m o lN a 2 F e ( S O 4 ) 2 + 12.4362m o lH 2 O(2)",

                "The projected crystal structures of Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 along various directions are illustrated in Fig. 1c-1e. To our knowledge, the authentic crystal structure of Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 have not been previously reported in the literature. This structure incorporates a novel FeSO8 dimer, establishing a framework similar to Mg3Ca3(PO4)4 [ , , ]. All Fe2+ ions have been allocated to Fe(1), Fe(2), and Fe(3) crystallographic sites, which are fully occupied (Fig. 1f). One FeO6 octahedron share an edge with an adjacent SO4 tetrahedral, thereby constituting a novel FeSO8 dimer. The Na+ions are situated at seven distinct crystallographic sites, all fully occupied (Fig. 1g). For the Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, a markedly different projected crystal structure is presented in Fig. 1i-1k. All Fe2+ ions were assigned to a singular Fe(1) crystallographic site [ ]. The partially occupied Fe2+ ions reside in octahedra sites that share edges with adjacent FeO6 octahedra, forming a renewed Fe2O10 dimer (Fig. 1l) [ ]. The Na+ ions occupy Na1, Na2, and Na3 crystallographic sites, with only Na1 sites being fully occupied (Fig. 1m) [ ].",
                "Utilizing Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High-Angle Annular Dark-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM), we have elucidated the microstructure of the materials. The secondary particles of Na2​Fe(SO4​)2​ display an ant-nest-like morphology due to water loss during the vacuum drying process, with nanopores forming interconnected channels (Fig. 2a). The primary nanoparticles are separated into sizes ranging approximately from 100 to 200 nm. A distinctive amorphous carbon coating <5 nm thick surrounds these nanoparticles, attributed to the antioxidant properties of ascorbic acid (Fig. 2b). The HAADF-STEM images and inverse Fourier-transform patterns reveal lattice fringe spacings of 4.10 Å and 5.73 Å, corresponding to the (402) and (112) planes of Na2Fe(SO4)2, respectively (Fig. 2b, Figure S5). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirm the polycrystalline nature of the Na2Fe(SO4)2 materials (Fig. 2c), aligning with diverse stripe shadow zones observed in HAADF-STEM images. Following calcination at 350 °C for 6 h, the ant-nest-like structure remains intact (Fig. 2e). A lattice fringe spacing of 2.40 Å is identified, pointing to the (112) plane of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 (Fig. 2f, Figure S6). However, the SAED pattern indicates a single-crystal diffraction pattern (Fig. 2g). To our knowledge, single-crystal Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 nanoparticles may hold promise for battery applications, similar to single-crystal NCM811 cathodes [ , , ]. As for the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C, the porous structure is retained, with exposed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the surface of secondary particles as depicted in Fig. 2i-j. The HAADF-STEM images confirm a lattice fringe spacing of 3.56 Å, corresponding to the (−131) plane of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 (Fig. 2k, Figure S7). These images further differentiate between Na2Fe(SO4)2 phase and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 phase, consistent with the distinct crystalline features revealed by XRD pattern. The STEM-EDS mapping results show uniform distribution of Na, Fe, S, and O elements across the three samples (Fig. 2d, h, l). The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) analysis has determined that the molar ratio of Na/Fe is consistently close to 2:1 for both fresh Na2Fe(SO4)2 and calcined product (Table S6). This consistent Na/Fe molar ratio from the ICP experiments may have contributed to the previous misidentification of Na2​Fe(SO4​)2​ precursor as identical to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode​ in earlier studies [ , , ].",
                "To enhance clarity and reliability of the results, the study focuses on elucidating the crystallization transition mechanism between Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)3 and Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 in the following sections. Initial thermogravimetric analysis (TG) reveals the crystallographic transition between these phases. Mass loss below 100 °C is attributed to the evaporation of interstitial water molecules, while significant mass loss above 450 °C is due to the decomposition of sulfate groups within the crystal lattice (Fig. 3a)[ , ]. The absence of gaseous by-products complicates the detection of slight mass changes in the 100–450 °C range using TG. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) overcomes this by highlighting the crystallographic transition, as shown by the blue-red double shadow region (Fig. 3a). The transition from the nascent Na2Fe(SO4)2 phase to the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 phase occurred between 250 and 300 °C, followed by the decomposition of the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 phase above 400 °C. Ex-situ XRD patterns confirm the stability of Stanfieldite-type Na2​Fe(SO4​)2 below 250 °C, with the emergence of Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3​ peaks at 300 °C (Fig. 3b). This study systematically verifies the new mechanism for transformation of Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 to Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 post-sintering above 250 °C, different from previous assumptions [ , , ]. Further physicochemical contrasts between Na2Fe(SO4)2 and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 are made through Raman and FT-IR spectra, and XPS analysis. The Raman spectrum of Na2Fe(SO4)2 shows only the G band due to the absence of post-sintering, with an ID/IG value of 0.98 for post-sintered Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 (Fig. 3c). Organic elemental analysis identifies amorphous carbon content at 0.21 % for Na2Fe(SO4)2 and 0.11 % for Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, respectively. FT-IR spectra reveal typical bending and stretching vibrations of SO4 tetrahedral and Fe-O bonds, with a significant bathochromic shift in Na2Fe(SO4)2 (Fig. 3d) [ ]. High-resolution XPS spectra show a larger occupied area for Na1 s in Na2Fe(SO4)2, attributed to multiple connections between seven distinct Na sites and adjacent ions (Fig. 3e). The Fe2p and S2p exhibited similar shape for Na2Fe(SO4)2 and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, with minor intensity variations (Fig. 3f-g, Figure S8). For the O1 s and C1 s, a larger occupied area of C=OC was observed for Na2Fe(SO4)2, linked to non-carbonized antioxidant material (ascorbic acid) without sintering (Fig. 3h). Conversely, a larger occupied area of C=C/CC in the C1s spectrum of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 is due to carbonized antioxidant material post-sintering (Figure S9).",
                "The band structure was analyzed to unveil the inherent conductivity from a quantum mechanics perspective, as shown in Fig. 4a-b. The band gap of Na2Fe(SO4)2 measures at 3.570 eV, which is approximately 2.6 times wider than that of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. This indicates a higher energy requirement for electrons in Na2Fe(SO4)2 to hop into the conduction band, resulting in poor electronic conductivity [ ]. Bond valence sum (BVS) calculations were utilized to identify accessible Na+ diffusion pathways within the crystal lattice [ , ]. The ΔBVS plots illustrate isosurfaces that delineate the space available for Na+ migration, with maximum ΔBVS values below 0.4. Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 exhibits one-dimensional diffusion paths along the [001] direction [ , ], while Na2Fe(SO4)2 features three-dimensional helical diffusion tunnels along the [101] direction, as depicted in Fig. 4c-d. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the migration energies for accessible channels in Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 specifically the Na2-Na2, Na3-Na3, and Na1-Na3 paths, are estimated to be 0.78, 0.68, and 0.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 4f) [ , ]. In contrast, the migration energies for Na+ ions in Na2Fe(SO4)2 along the Na6-Na3 path, Na7-Na3 path, Na3-Na4 path, Na3-Na5 path, Na4-Na3 path, Na5-Na3 path, along Na3-Na6 path, Na3-Na7 path, Na2-Na7 path, Na2-Na6 path, Na6-Na7 path, and Na7-Na6 path are higher at 3.18, 2.20, 1.47, 2.63, 1.03, 1.90, 1.00, 1.64, 2.43, 1.54, and 1.30 eV, respectively (Fig. 4e)[ ]. The practical reversibility of Na+ (de)insertion in Na2Fe(SO4)2 might be impeded by these high migration barriers, despite the presence of three-dimensional helical Na+ migration channels in the ΔBVS plots. In summary, we infer that Na2Fe(SO4)2 is unlikely to show satisfactory specific capacity unless it is converted to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3.",
                "The electrochemical behavior of Na2Fe(SO4)2 was systematically investigated. Fig. 5a depicts the initial charge/discharge curves of the Na2Fe(SO4)2 at 1/20 C, with a voltage window of 2.0 to 4.5 V. Based on the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple, the average voltage of Na2Fe(SO4)2 cathode is approximately 3.5 V (vs. Na/Na+) at 1/20 C. The initial discharge capacity is recorded at 35 mAh g−1, which corresponds to a mere 38.5 % of its single-electron theoretical capacity (ca. 91 mAh g−1). The initial coulombic efficiency of 85 % might be attributed to potential electrolyte decomposition under the high cutoff voltage of 4.5 V [ , ]. The DQ/DV curves reveal two pairs of reversible redox peaks at 3.59/2.87 V and 3.73/3.44 V, without similar irreversible peak change as reported in Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathodes during the initial and subsequent charging cycles [ , ]. As the rate increases, 22 % of the theoretical capacity is available at 1/10 C, 13 % at 1/5 C, 5 % at 1/2 C, and close to 0 % above 1 C (Fig. 5b). This rapidly fading of rate capacity may step from poor electronic conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics. To further reveal underlying mechanisms of sluggish kinetics, the EIS, CV, and GITT analysis were conducted. The fitted resistances ohmic (Rs), cathode electrolyte interface (RCEI), and charge transfer (Rct) were determined to be 8.814 Ω, 143.7 Ω, and 684.2 Ω as detailed in Supplementary Table S7. The high RSEI and Rct are not conducive to rapid charge exchange and Na+ diffusion. CV analysis shows an increase in peak current with scan rate escalation, while maintaining the integrity of the redox peak pairs. The reaction kinetics are calculated as follows [ ]::(3)",
                "i = a v b(4)",
                "i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2",
                "The constants b in Eq. (3), with values of 0.5975 and 0.4391, approximate to 0.5, signifying diffusion-controlled kinetics during both charge and discharge processes (Fig. 5d)[ ]. The contributions from capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes were further delineated according to Eq. (4). Notably, the capacitive contribution escalates from 8 % to 20 % as the scan rate increases from 0.1 to 0.5 mV s−1 during discharge (Figure S10). Surface capacitive effects typically enhance reaction kinetics[ , , ]. During the charging process, the effective Na+ diffusion efficient was is determined within a narrow voltage window of 3.3∼3.7 V as shown in Figure S11a. For the discharging process, the effective Na+ diffusion efficient spans a broader voltage range of 3.6–2.45 V, with the Na+ diffusion efficient below 1.2 × 10−10 cm2s−1 (Figure S11b). GITT results indicate that insufficient and sluggish Na+ extraction at a narrow window may obstruct Na+ diffusion during the charging process, culminating in a capacity significantly below the theoretical 91 mAh g−1. Fig. 5e portrays a poor capacity retention below 40 %, with a discharge capacity of only 13.26 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, albeit maintaining a coulombic efficiency near 100 %.",
                "Fig. 6a shows the initial two cycles charge-discharge curves for both Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathodes. Notably, the first cycle demonstrates a distinct profile compared to the subsequent cycle, attributed to the irreversible migration of Fe3+ to sodium vacancies [ ]. The pristine Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 exhibited a discharging specific capacity of about 66.34 mAh g−1 with an average voltage of 3.70 V at 1/20 C, while the modified Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathodes exhibited a superior discharging specific capacity of 82 mAh g−1 and a higher average voltage of 3.75 V. The cyclic voltametric (CV) analysis also corroborates the irreversible alteration in redox peak count between the initial and second cycles (Figure S12). The Na+ diffusion coefficients, as calculated from GITT curves, was between 1 × 10−11 cm2s−1 and 6 × 10−10 cm2s−1 for both Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathodes, however, the highest value of Na+ diffusion efficient for Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C occur at higher voltage values due to the smaller polarization (Fig. 6b, Figure S13). The EIS measurements confirmed the charge transfer resistance (Rct) for Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathodes were 890.4 Ω and 706.5 Ω, respectively (Fig. 6c, Table S7). The rate capacities for Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 were recorded at 50.3, 41.5, 32.7, 26.3, and 19.8 mAh g−1 across the C-rates of 1/10 C, 1/5 C, 1/2 C,1 C and 2 C, respectively. The lower electron transfer resistance indicated that Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C may exhibit a superior rate capacity than Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. As shown in Fig. 6d, the rate capacities of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C were recorded at 74.5, 69.5, 65.6, 63.0, and 60.6 mAh g−1 across the C-rates of 1/10 C, 1/5 C, 1/2 C,1 C and 2 C, respectively. Moreover, the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathodes demonstrate remarkable stability during extended cycling tests, with a capacity retention of 92.3 % after 200 cycles at 1 C, 93.11 % after 500 cycles at 2 C and 92.2 % after 1000 cycles at 10 C.",
                "To evaluate the electrochemical robustness of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathodes under diverse climatic conditions, we conducted long-term cycling stability tests at −25 °C, 0 °C, and 60 °C, as depicted in Figs. 7a-7b. At a C-rate of 1 C, the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathodes exhibited specific capacities of 44.19 mAh g−1 at −25 ℃, 57.9 mAh g−1 at 0 °C, and 75 mAh g−1 at 60 °C, respectively, and the capacity retention rates of all cathodes exceeded 90 % after 100 cycles. When the C-rate increased to 2 C, the specific capacities of the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C cathode was 30.7 mAh g−1 at −25 °C, 54.4 mAh g−1 at 0 °C, and 69.3 mAh g−1 at 60 °C, respectively, and the capacity retention of all exceeded 95 % after 200 cycles. Subsequently, we assembled coin-type full cells using hard carbon (HC) as the anode and Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C as cathode to evaluate the practical electrochemical performance of full cells at 30 °C. The Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C//HC full cells manifested an initial discharge specific capacity of approximately 70.87 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, along with an initial coulombic efficiency of 89.6 % (Fig. 7c). The rate capability of Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C//HC full cells was determined to be 69.29, 65.68, 62.40, 59.91, and 57.37 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C rates, respectively (Fig. 7d). Concluding the series of tests, the long-term cycling performance of the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C//HC full cells was scrutinized at 1 C and 2 C rates. The cells exhibited capacity retentions of 88.7 % at 1 C after 100 cycles and 83.1 % at 2 C after 200 cycles, underscoring their potential for deployment in high-performance sodium-ion batteries (Figs. 7e-7f)."

                "For the first time, we synthesized a stable Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 material using a well-designed sol-gel method. This approach mitigated potential risks associated with low crystallinity, structural damage, and the irreversible formation of Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities by facilitating a unique transition from the anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor to the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode. DFT calculations and experimental data corroborate the low inherent conductivity and sluggish kinetics of pristine Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 during sodiation/desodiation processes, which contributes to poor rate capacity and cycle retention. Benefiting from the improved conductivity, the Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C composite cathode exhibited an average working potential of 3.75 V, an enhanced rate capacity of 60 mAh g−1 at 2 C, and remarkable capacity retention of 92.3 % after 200 cycles at 1 C, 93.11 % after 500 cycles at 2 C and 92.2 % after 1000 cycles at 10 C. In all-climate condition tests at −25 °C, 0 °C, and 60 °C, it also maintained excellent cycling stability, with capacity retention exceeding 90 % at 1 C after 100 cycles or over 95 % at 2 C after 200 cycles. Utilizing a commercial hard carbon anode, the assembled Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C//HC full cells demonstrated commendable rate capacity and sustained cycling stability. This work not only unveils a novel crystallization transition mechanism from the anhydrous Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor to the Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode, but also paves the way for developing cost-effective, all-climate Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C composite cathode for large-scale energy storage."
