                "In hard carbon (HC) anodes, elucidating the relationship between the solid electrolyte interphase formation and the solvated Na+ co-intercalation mechanism is crucial, particularly considering different anionic salts in ether-based electrolytes. Here, we comprehensively explore the impact of different anionic salts on the electrochemical performance of HC/Na half-cell and elucidate the underlying mechanism through experimental studies and theoretical calculations. The surface morphology of the HC anode and its interphasial property are further investigated to evaluate the differences endowed by the presence of various anionic salts in diglyme (2G). The HC/Na half-cells with NaPF6-2G and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3)-2G display superior electrochemical performance with faster kinetics and lower interfacial resistance than those with NaClO4-2G, sodium bis-(fluorosulfonyl) imide (NaFSI)-2G and sodium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (NaTFSI)-2G. NaClO4-2G forms a relatively thick interphase layer with high resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface owing to its insufficient stability. NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G exhibit severe side reactions with Na metal, producing a thick interphase layer on the HC surface with high interfacial resistance from excess electrolyte decomposition, thus deteriorating the electrochemical performance. In summary, the study on the stability of different anionic salts in ether-based electrolyte for the HC anode with the intercalation mechanism provides valuable insights for screening appropriate conductive salts for high-performance sodium-ion batteries, especially when considering Na metal counter/reference electrodes."

                "Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have gained increasing attention in battery research as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their low cost, abundance and environmental friendliness [1], [2], [3]. Although they possess conceptual similarity, NIB and LIB systems have considerable differences [4]. For example, although graphite is a commonly used anode material in LIBs, its use in NIBs is hindered because graphite cannot maintain its activity when ester-based electrolytes are used in NIBs; this is because of the energetically unstable Na-intercalated graphite [5]. The currently commercial anode material used in NIBs is carbonaceous material with low graphitization, i.e., hard carbon (HC), which consists of amorphous carbon and graphene nanosheets with a distinct turbostratic disorder and curvature [6], [7], [8], [9]. Taking advantage of the solvent co-intercalation mechanism, the HC anode exhibits a satisfactory initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and decent rate capability in ether-based electrolytes, superior to those of traditional ester-based electrolytes [2], [10]. However, the fundamental relationship between the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the solvated Na+ co-intercalation mechanism remains an intriguing question to researchers. On the one hand, the ultra-low intercalation voltage (<0.1 V) of solvated Na+ can inevitably induce electrolyte decomposition due to its electrochemical instability to form an SEI layer, which mainly depends on different solvents and anionic salts. On the other hand, the presence of the SEI layer can block solvated Na+ co-intercalation, allowing the passage of only Na+ into the host structure to maintain the electrode integrity. Therefore, elucidating the relationship between SEI formation and the solvated Na+ co-intercalation mechanism is urgently required, especially in different anionic salts in ether-based electrolytes.",
                "Exploration of SEI formation is notoriously challenging, especially considering its vulnerability to the air atmosphere and radiation sources before experimental analysis [11], [12]. Meng et al. reported a conformal and uniform SEI constructed on the HC surface with an ether-based electrolyte, which significantly altered the transfer kinetics and suppressed the parasitic reaction [13]. Furthermore, Xu et al. also revealed that a thinner and more sustainable SEI with a higher ionic conductivity was formed on the HC surface with an ether-based electrolyte than that with an ester-based electrolyte [14]. In contrast, Yang et al. reported that no SEI film was formed on the HC surface with diglyme (2G) owing to the co-intercalation of solvated Na+ into the HC host structure [15]. It should be noted that although all of them adopted ether-based electrolytes, different anionic salts were used in their respective experiments, thereby resulting in the distinct observation of the SEI layer. Thus far, a series of different salts [NaPF6, NaClO4, sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3), sodium bis-(fluorosulfonyl) imide (NaFSI), sodium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (NaTFSI)] have been used for graphite anodes with the solvent co-intercalation mechanism [16]. However, there is limited research on the impact of different anionic salts on commercially available HC anodes with sodium (Na) void filling or quasi-metallic Na formation mechanisms. Therefore, it is crucial to systematically investigate how different anionic salts affect both the electrochemical performance of HC anodes and the stability of ether solvents as well as the anionic stability with Na metal.",
                "Recently, we regulated the NaPF6 concentration in 2G solvent to maximize the capacity of the HC anode, revealing an innovative discontinuous SEI on the HC surface with 0.2 M NaPF6 in 2G [17]. To further elucidate the impact of anionic salts on both the HC anode and stability of 2G solvent as well as the anionic stability with Na metal, we comprehensively explored the use of different electrolyte salts such as NaPF6, NaClO4, NaCF3SO3, NaFSI and NaTFSI for HC/Na half-cells and Na/Na symmetric cells with 2G solvent. Based on the theoretical studies and experimental results, NaCF3SO3 and NaPF6 displayed the most superior electrochemical performances, followed by NaClO4, NaFSI and NaTFSI. The latter two, particularly NaTFSI, exhibited more parasitic side reactions and larger interfacial resistance, leading to inferior cycle stability and low Coulombic efficiency. The anionic stability of these salts was further evaluated through in situ Raman and F19 nuclear magnetic resonance (F19 NMR) measurement. The SEI properties endowed by the different anions on the HC surface were distinguished using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Taken together, the stability of different anionic salts in 2G for the HC anode provides valuable insights for screening appropriate conductive salts for high-performance NIBs, especially considering the Na metal counter/reference electrodes."

Fig. S1 reveals that there is no evident difference in wettability with different electrolyte salts in 2G. The ionic conductivities in Table S1 showed the following decreasing order: NaFSI-2G > NaTFSI-2G > NaPF6-2G > NaClO4-2G > NaCF3SO3-2G.",
                        "The cycle performances of the HC/Na half-cells with different electrolyte salts in 2G were compared to evaluate the impact of various anionic salts on long-term cycle stability and output charge capacity. The HC/Na half-cells were cycled at 0.2C for three cycles and then cycled at 0.5C for the subsequent cycles (1C = 250 mA g−1). Interestingly, as depicted in Fig. 1a, the HC/Na half-cell with NaCF3SO3-2G displays the highest charge capacity of 336.5 mAh/g, with a favourable initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 86.5 %, superior to those of NaPF6-2G (306.7 mAh/g/82.3 %), NaClO4-2G (285.0 mAh/g/75.0 %), NaFSI-2G (313.1 mAh/g/81.7 %) and NaTFSI-2G (90.6 mAh/g/64.7 %). After 200 cycles, the HC/Na half-cell with NaCF3SO3-2G maintains a higher charge capacity of 308.4 mAh/g, with a capacity retention of 95.0 %, similar to that achieved using NaPF6-2G (284.0 mAh/g/94.7 %) and superior to those achieved using NaClO4-2G (64.6 mAh/g/65.6 %), NaFSI-2G (90.9 mAh/g/49.8 %) and NaTFSI-2G (12.5 mAh/g/14.3 %). Considering the ICE values and cycle stability, NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G are the preferred electrolyte systems. Among these, NaCF3SO3-2G exhibits the most favorable electrochemical performance, characterized by the highest ICE and charge capacity. This superior performance is attributed to the stable interphase formation at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In contrast, the HC/Na half-cell with NaClO4-2G possesses relatively inferior ICE and lower charge capacity, likely due to excessive Na+/electrolyte consumption during interphase formation. Although NaFSI-2G demonstrates a sufficiently high initial charge capacity, its capacity retention over long-term cycling is relatively low, suggesting continuous electrolyte decomposition and associated parasitic reactions. NaTFSI-2G, on the other hand, exhibits extremely low ICE and capacity retention, indicating severe side reactions and electrolyte decomposition upon cycling. The negligible capacity variation switching from 0.2C to 0.5C further illustrates the fast electrochemical kinetics with NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G, superior to those with NaClO4-2G, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G. The corresponding voltage profiles (first and second) and dQ/dV curves are displayed in Fig. 1b and c. NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G display characteristic plateaus during the charging/discharging process with discernible peaks in dQ/dV. In contrast, the fast capacity decay of NaClO4-2G at the second voltage profile is likely attributed to the interphase formation with large resistance, consistent with the relatively evident peak at 0.9 V in dQ/dV and the low ICE value. Moreover, additional peaks are observed with NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G, indicating their underlying side reactions. The abnormal voltage profile of NaTFSI-2G without characteristic charge/discharge plateaus and discernible peaks in dQ/dV further indicate a severe side reaction in this system.",
                        "The Na||Na and HC||HC symmetric cells were assembled to evaluate the potential reaction and interfacial stability between Na metal or HC electrode and different electrolyte salts in 2G. As depicted in Fig. S2, NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G demonstrate a relatively low polarization potential upon cycling, indicating that these two electrolyte salts can form stable interphase layer on Na metal surface. NaClO4-2G is likely to form interphase layer with large resistance and insufficient stability, exhibiting the remittent sharp spikes of the polarization potential. NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G display an interactive reaction with Na metal, wherein NaFSI-2G maintains a relatively high polarization potential with continuous electrolyte decomposition at the electrode/electrolyte interface and NaTFSI-2G demonstrates a severe side reaction with Na metal with increasing polarization potential upon cycling. The interactive side reactions between NaFSI-2G/NaTFSI-2G and Na metal are further demonstrated through the color variation and the additional 19F NMR peaks in Fig. S3 after storing Na metal in NaFSI-2G/NaTFSI-2G. Additionally, the HC||HC symmetric cells in Fig. S4 show that NaCF3SO3-2G, NaPF6-2G and NaClO4-2G display relatively low polarization potential upon cycling, indicating normal Na depositing/stripping behavior with a stable interphase layer on the HC surface. Intriguingly, the considerably small polarization potentials with NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G in the HC||HC symmetric cells reveal that the side reaction mainly exists at the Na/electrolyte interface but not at the HC/electrolyte interface, which is mainly responsible for the distinct electrochemical performances.",
                        "The rate capability of the HC/Na half-cells with different electrolyte salts in 2G was measured to evaluate the impact of different anions on the kinetic properties. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the HC/Na half-cells with NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G possess relatively higher charge capacities at low C-rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 3C) than those with NaClO4-2G, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G. NaPF6-2G outperforms NaCF3SO3-2G at high C-rates of 5C and 10C. The modest charge capacity of NaCF3SO3-2G at 5C and 10C is likely due to the interphase on the surface of Na metal with relatively larger polarization potential (Fig. S2) or the lower ionic conductivity in bulk electrolyte (Table S1) than that of NaPF6-2G. The inferior rate capacity of NaClO4-2G is probably attributed to the interphase layer with large resistance. NaFSI-2G displays a low charge capacity at various C-rates due to its interactive reaction with Na metal and the insufficiently stable interphase with continuous electrolyte decomposition. The worst rate capacity is observed with NaTFSI-2G, indicating an evident side reaction with Na metal and high interphasial resistance upon cycling. The corresponding voltage profiles at different C-rates are displayed in Fig. 2b–f. NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G maintains the characteristic plateaus at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3 and 5C, superior to NaClO4-2G, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G. Thus, the rate capability and corresponding voltage profiles indicate that the anionic salts strongly influence the interfacial chemistry and kinetic properties of the HC/Na half-cell.",
                        "The interphasial properties of HC/Na half-cells with different electrolyte salts in 2G were further evaluated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As presented in Fig. 3a–e, the HC/Na half-cells with NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G display a relatively lower interphasial film resistance (Rf)/charge transfer resistance (Rct) than those with NaClO4-2G, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G, indicating a stable electrode/electrolyte interphase formation with fast interfacial kinetics. NaClO4-2G possesses a high Rf/Rct value, which is highly correlated to the interphase formation on the HC electrode/Na metal, leading to an inferior rate capability with sluggish kinetic properties. NaFSI-2G exhibits a modest Rf/Rct value, consistent with its relatively high rate capability, but compromises due to the interactive reaction with Na metal. NaTFSI-2G displays a notably high Rf/Rct value, attributed to the formation of a thick electrode/electrolyte interphase or sluggish interfacial kinetics, likely due to the significant side reactions with Na metal. This results in the worst electrochemical performance. To further unravel the interphasial and anionic stabilities of different electrolytes with Na metal, chronoamperometry (CA) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were performed on the HC/Na and Pt/Na half-cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3f–j, the HC/Na half-cells with NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G demonstrate a fast response to reach an equivalent residual current. In contrast, NaClO4-2G, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G exhibit a slow response with large residual current before reaching an equivalent level, indicating the formation of an insufficiently stable interphase upon cycling. Regarding the LSV curves shown in Fig. 3k–o, the Pt/Na half cells with NaCF3SO3-2G, NaPF6-2G and NaClO4-2G display a characteristic current peak during cathodic scanning. In contrast, NaFSI-2G and particularly NaTFSI-2G demonstrate a considerably broader current peak during cathodic scanning, indicating the occurrence of a potential side reaction with Na metal.",

NaPF6-2G shows a relatively more evident electrolyte decomposition at 0.9 V, consistent with its lower ICE value. NaClO4-2G exhibits an apparent electrolyte decomposition, which probably occurs on the electrode/electrolyte interface and is in agreement with its inferior cycle stability and rate capability. Importantly, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G display additional redox peaks with inexplicable protrusion peak during the repeated anodic/cathodic sweeping, indicating the underlying side reaction at the Na/electrolyte interface, consistent with their inferior electrochemical performance and high Rf/Rct values."

Before cycling, as displayed in Fig. 5a, the pristine HC particle displays a spherical morphology with a diameter of 1–3 μm and a clear and smooth surface. After cycling, as depicted in Fig. 5b, d, the HC electrodes with NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G maintain the smooth morphology of the HC particle with sporadic decomposition product accumulation on the surface, which contributes to the lower initial irreversible capacity loss and the relatively higher ICE value. The HC electrode with NaClO4-2G demonstrates a relatively agglomerated morphology after cycling (Fig. 5c), indicating an intensified electrolyte decomposition upon cycling, consistent with its inferior electrochemical performance and high Rf/Rct value. Interestingly, the HC electrodes with NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G display a wavy morphology on the HC surface after cycling (Fig. 5e and f), demonstrating severe electrolyte decomposition upon cycling due to the underlying side reaction with Na metal and leading to the unsatisfying electrochemical performance.",
                        "The interfacial information and mechanical property of the HC electrode before and after cycling were investigated through TEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, before cycling, the pristine HC particle shows a clear surface morphology without any decomposition product accumulation on the HC surface. After cycling, the HC electrodes with NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G display sporadic decomposition product deposition on the HC surface (Fig. 6b and d), likely a discontinuous SEI layer as reported in our previous work, due to the inevitable anionic salt decomposition upon cycling [17]. In the case of NaClO4-2G, the decomposition product is accumulated more evidently on the HC surface due to more severe electrolyte decomposition (Fig. 6c), leading to agglomerated morphology observed in the SEM images. In contrast, the HC electrodes with NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G demonstrate a more discernible decomposition product accumulation on the HC surface (Fig. 6e and f), likely due to severe electrolyte decomposition from the underlying side reactions at the Na/electrolyte interface. This phenomenon corresponds to the wavy morphology on the HC surface with NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G, which might be highly related to their inferior electrochemical performance and high interfacial resistance. Moreover, the three-dimensional (3D) contour profiles and Young’s modulus calculated through AFM measurements of HC electrodes with different electrolyte salts in 2G are displayed in Fig. 6g–l. Compared to the pristine HC electrode with a spherical 3D morphology and high Young’s modulus, the HC surface with NaClO4-2G demonstrates a coarser 3D morphology with agglomeration and a comparable high Young’s modulus due to severe electrolyte decomposition. In contrast, the HC surfaces with NaCF3SO3-2G and NaPF6-2G display a rugged 3D morphology but with a relatively low Young’s modulus due to sporadic decomposition product accumulation on the HC surface. Importantly, the HC surfaces with NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G exhibit a considerably thicker and wavy 3D morphology with lower Young’s modulus due to severe electrolyte decomposition from the underlying side reaction at the Na/electrolyte interface.",
                        "The interphasial composition and chemical information of the SEI layer on the HC surface with different electrolyte salts in 2G were further investigated using XPS. As depicted in Fig. 7, the decomposition of the electrolyte solvent (2G) and anionic salts (NaPF6, NaCF3SO3, NaFSI and NaTFSI) generates species such as sodium alkoxides (CH3–O and CH), polyethers (CO and CH), sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium oxide (Na2O). The NaClO4 salt participates in the construction of the SEI layer and modulates the interfacial property correspondingly, as characterized by the Cl 2p spectrum. The unique NaNO2 peak in the N 1s spectrum indicates the involvemnt of FSI− and TFSI− in the construction of the SEI layer on the HC surface [21]. Interestingly, as illustrated in the Cl 2p/S 2p/ F 1s spectra, the HC surfaces with NaClO4-2G, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G exhibit higher intensities of NaClO4/NaCl, SO42−/SO32− and NaxPFy/NaxPFyOz/NaF, revealing a more severe electrolyte decomposition upon cycling, consistent with their SEM and TEM results. The thick SEI layer from the intensified electrolyte decomposition can deteriorate the electrode/electrolyte interface with high resistance, which is detrimental to long-term cycle stability and output specific capacity."

                        "To gain insights into the electrolyte solvation structure endowed by the different anionic salts in 2G and to detect the interaction between different anionic salts and 2G directly, ex situ Raman measurement of different electrolyte salts in 2G was performed, along with only 2G solvent for comparison (Fig. S5). Additionally, the sodiation/desodiation processes and Na+ reversibility in the bulk HC structure were further evaluated through in situ Raman spectroscopy. As displayed in Fig. 8a–e, two characteristic peaks of D and G bands are observed in the Raman spectra of the HC electrodes with different electrolyte salts in 2G. The D band (∼1362 cm−1) corresponds to the disorder/defects in the graphene planes, while the G band (∼1585 cm−1) corresponds to the in-plane motion of the graphitic carbon. The sodiation/desodiation processes and Na+ reversibility upon cycling are indicated by the shifting of these bands and the evolution of a new peak [22]. These two characteristic peaks remain distinguishable in the HC electrode with NaPF6, NaClO4 and NaCF3SO3 during the entire initial discharging/charging processes, whereas they gradually diminish in that with NaFSI and NaTFSI, indicating considerable decomposition product accumulation on the HC surface in these two cases. The absence of new peaks and no splitting of the G band further reveal that there is no intercalation staging [23], [24]. Interestingly, because the position of the G band is indicative of charge transfer kinetics and lattice parameter variation in the graphitic carbon, the evolution of the G band position is highly informative. The G band positions of the HC electrode with NaPF6, NaClO4 and NaCF3SO3 first show ‘red shift’ in the slope region, followed by ‘blue shift’ in the voltage plateau region upon sodiation. The reverse shifting continues upon desodiation. The initial red shifting represents Na+ insertion into the graphitic layer, while the blue shifting corresponds to Na filling into the voids in the HC bulk structure or the quasi-metallic Na formation. A more significant blue shifting of the G band in the HC electrode with NaPF6 and NaCF3SO3 is observed, contributing to a higher specific capacity than that with NaClO4, NaFSI and NaTFSI. This phenomenon is likely ascribed to the high overpotential of the HC electrodes with NaClO4, NaFSI and NaTFSI owing to the thick SEI layer and severe side reaction, leading to a smaller amount of Na filling into the voids of the HC bulk structure or less quasi-metallic Na formation at the equivalent cut-off voltage.",
                        "The underlying mechanism for the distinctive electrochemical performances of HC electrodes with different electrolyte salts in 2G was further evaluated using DFT calculations. As presented in Fig. 8f, the electron affinity energies (EA) of different salt anions after combining with Na+ and 2G are calculated, and the optimized reductive structures are shown in Fig. S6. The EA results indicate that ClO4−, FSI− and TFSI− have higher reductive activities than PF6− and CF3SO3−, indicating a greater propensity to decompose by gaining one electron during reductive discharging to construct the SEI layer. This result is consistent with that indicated by the CV profiles of the HC/Na half-cell and the LSV curve of the Pt/Na half-cell. The electrochemical mechanism of the HC electrodes with different electrolyte salts in 2G is illustrated and summarized in Fig. 8g. The HC electrodes with NaPF6-2G and NaCF3SO3-2G maintain their superior cycle stability and rate capability owing to the reductive stability of anionic salts and 2G solvent, forming a discontinuous SEI layer with sporadic distribution. In contrast, the HC electrode with NaClO4-2G exhibits a considerably thicker interphase layer with large resistance and insufficient stability, leading to inferior cycle stability and rate capability. Furthermore, the anionic salts NaFSI and NaTFSI show a severe side reaction with Na metal, resulting in excess electrolyte decomposition upon cycling and deterioration of the normal sodiation/desodiation processes. Therefore, the HC electrodes with NaFSI-2G and NaFSI-2G accumulate large amounts of decomposition products on the HC surface with large resistance, which further increases the overpotential and limits the electrochemical kinetics, thus leading to the inferior cycle stability and rate capability."

                "The impact of different anionic salts on the electrochemical performance of HC/Na half-cell is comprehensively investigated, and the underlying mechanism is elucidated through experimental studies and theoretical calculations. The HC/Na half-cells with NaPF6-2G and NaCF3SO3-2G display superior electrochemical performance with faster kinetics and lower interfacial resistance than those with NaClO4-2G, NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G, as shown by the cycle/rate test, cyclic voltammetry/electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectrometry. NaClO4-2G forms a relatively thick interphase layer with high resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface owing to its insufficient stability. NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G exhibit severe side reactions with Na metal, producing a thick interphase layer on the HC surface with high interfacial resistance from excess electrolyte decomposition, thus deteriorating the electrochemical performance. The study on the stability of different anionic salts in ether-based electrolyte for the HC anode with the intercalation mechanism provides valuable insights for screening appropriate conductive salts for high-performance NIBs, especially when considering Na metal counter/reference electrode."
