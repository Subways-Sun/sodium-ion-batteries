                "We provide information on a straightforward process for creating sodium-carbon-based material for Na-ion batteries. The electric-controlled exfoliation method produced sodium intercalated graphene oxide (Na-GO). Na-GO has a crystalline structure with a few-layered scattered sheet shape, 87.9 percent crystallinity, a computed density of 2.26 g/cm3, and a cell volume of 35.29x106pm3. The Coulombic efficiency of the Na-GO material increased from 98.8% in the first electrochemical cycle to 100.5 percent in the 60th, and the specific capacity (S.C.) of the Na-GO electrode at a current density of 100 mA/g is about 368 mAh/g. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles against sodium metal were carried out as a reference electrode. This is a brand-new method for creating high-performing materials that do not require purifying or cleaning procedures."

                "Due to the rapid growth of portable devices and electric vehicles, there is a great need to utilize secondary ion batteries with higher energy and power densities, particularly lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIB/SIB). Increasing anode and cathode capacity is still necessary to meet the high demands for high specific capacity and high-rate performance. There are three distinct reaction processes on the anode side: deposition/dissolution, alloying/dealloying, and intercalation/deintercalation [1], [2]. Carbon-based materials with excellent cycling performance currently make up most of the commercial anode materials for LIBs. Instead, it has a low theoretical specific capacity of just 372 mAh/g [3], which is insufficient to meet market demand. As a result, anodes with high specific capacities have drawn much attention.",
                "Sulfur is one of the cathode materials that may be used for both Li-S and Na-S batteries, and it has a high capacity of 1673 mAh/g [4], [5]. Due to the insulative properties of sulfur and the dissolving and shuttling effects of polysulfides, it is challenging to fully utilize the high specific capacity, which results in short cycle life and subpar rate performance [6], [7]. Designing suitable carbon frameworks for improving electronic and ionic conductivities, buffer volume expansion, suppressing dendrite growth, and limiting the shuttle effect is an efficient way to address the issues with the anodes and cathodes.",
                "The application of metal anodes is constrained due to the safety concern with dendrite formation in both Li and Na metals. High surface area carbon frameworks make it possible to prevent Li or Na dendrite development. A carbon felt was proposed by Chi et al. to hold molten Na [8]. The carbon matrix efficiently induced homogeneous Na+ flow and prevented Na dendrite development due to its large specific area of 1461 m2/g. After 120 cycles in symmetrical cells, the Na/C composite showed dendrite-free Na deposition even at a higher current density of 5 mA/cm2.",
                "The uniform plating of lithium and sodium can also be encouraged by lithiophilic/sodiumophilic substances based on carbon frameworks. Increasing the specific surface area of carbon materials is essential to offer great nucleation sites for Li/Na metal. Jin et al. used bamboo to create a 3D hierarchical porous carbon (HPC), which was then adorned with ZnO to create the intricate ZnO@HPC framework [9]. A promising dendrite-free lithium metal anode was realized thanks to HPC’s high specific surface area, which reached 958 m2/g and offered plenty of ZnO sites for lithium deposition.",
                "Due to their high theoretical specific capacities, alloying/dealloying-based anodes made of silicon, phosphorus, germanium, and tin have attracted much attention. However, they have extreme volume increases [10], [11], [12], ranging from 259 to 420 per cent, which causes pulverization over time. The shuttle effect of polysulfides and extra-low electronic conductivity (5x10 -30 S/cm) of sulfur, as an example of the alloying/dealloying-based cathodes [13], [14], resulting in low sulfur usage and rapid capacity decay. Lithium and sodium metal are two desirable deposition/dissolution-based anode materials for secondary ion batteries. Although with limited practical applicability because of their significant volume changes and dendritic development.",
                "Due to their low cost, outstanding stability, excellent electronic conductivity, and exceptionally customizable architectures make potential carbon materials for energy storage. The following merit features should be present in the ideal carbon-based frameworks. The large specific surface area aids the active material’s mass loading. The pore/void structure helps to manage volume variations, improving long-cycle performance even further. By enabling electron/ion transmission, high electronic/ionic conductivity can improve rate performance. Effective methods to improve the interaction between carbon-based frameworks and active materials include surface chemical and interfacial modification [15].",
                "To enhance the electrochemical performance of LIBs/SIBs, it is crucial to build carbon-based frameworks reasonably. The conjugation of active materials depends on the interaction between the carbon matrix and the components at their interface. Improved carbon-active material affinity and electrochemical performance are two benefits of introducing a novel functional component [8], [16], [17]. Comparatively to interface alteration, surface chemical modification of carbon materials, such as the addition of active functional groups and heteroatom doping, can both increase the wettability of Li/Na metal and decrease the proportion of the inactive component [18], [19]. The rate performance of anodes and cathodes is improved by heteroatom doping with N, O, and F, among other heteroatoms, in carbon frameworks. A homogenous Li/Na deposition is produced because of the doped heteroatom’s improved interface compatibility with the matrix and Li/Na metal, thus boosting the safety of metal anodes. Inhibiting the formation of lithium/sodium dendrites and improving the affinity between carbon materials and the metal anode are two significant advantages of O doping in carbon substrates. The three frequent nitrogen dopants in carbon are pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and quaternary N.",
                "Additionally, pyridinic and pyrrolic N can produce many defects and active sites for the quick absorption and diffusion of surface ions [20]. A lot of an adsorbent can be held in place by carbon frameworks with high specific surface areas. Anodes and cathode framework materials must be designed based on alloying/dealloying and deposition/dissolution methods to increase the electrochemical performance of a high specific capacity.",
                "In this article, we discuss the use of functional carbon frameworks to load sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) active materials with a high specific capacity, which improves their electrochemical performance. We also provide a Na-GO material design of functional carbon frameworks. The material’s design improved deposition/dissolution processes to boost electrochemical performance. This carefully monitored enormous volume growth may result in poor use and severe pulverization of active components. The practical design of carbon-based frames effectively limited the volume change. The carbon matrix’s logically designed pore structure aids in the high mass loading of active materials. The graphene oxide (G.O.) matrix was purposefully designed to shorten the ion diffusion path and increase ionic conductivity in electrode materials [21]. The G.O. carbon compounds are advantageous for hosting active components to enhance rate performance and power density because they have exceptional electronic conductivity [22].",

                        "Due to their superior electrochemical stability, low cost, and environmental friendliness, carbon materials have received the most incredible attention as prospective NIB anodes. Graphite has been used as a typical anode for LIBs because it has a low operating voltage and a high specific capacity due to reversible Li de/intercalation. Additionally, it was recently discovered that K ions, which have ionic radii significantly bigger than Li ions’ (ionic radii of 0.76), can be reversibly intercalated into graphite in electrochemical cells. Attempts were made to use graphite as a Na intercalation host [23]. In contrast to Li (LiC6) and K (KC8, all the early works consistently produced restricted reversible capacities of 12 mAh/g, indicating the failure of stage 1 graphite intercalation compound (GIC) formation (KC8). Thermodynamic simulations using various structural models have also revealed the instability of stage 1Na-GIC formation (Fig. 1) [24], [25], [26], [27]. For example, the creation of LiC6 and KC8 exhibited a positive intercalation potential in a comparison study on the intercalation of alkali metals (Li, Na, and K) into graphite [26]. In contrast, the formation of either NaC6 or NaC8 was shown to be thermodynamically unfavourable.",
                        "With the unknown phenomenon of the underlying cause; (i) the high redox potential of Na+/Na causes the precipitation of metallic Na before Na intercalation, which is the cause of unstable stage 1Na-GIC; [26] (ii) the significant lengthening of C-C bonds in Na-GICs [25]; and (iii) the weak interaction between the Na layer and carbon [24]. Non-graphitic carbon materials (such as hard, soft, and amorphous carbon) have been thoroughly researched as replacements since pristine graphite as an anode for NIBs failed. The electrochemical characteristics and mechanistic analyses of non-graphitic carbon materials are covered in this part. Then we go on to a new study that uses pure graphite as an active anode material and anomalous Na-solvent co-intercalation.",
                        "It has been found that the storage of Na in carbon compounds, including functionalized graphite, defective graphene, hard carbon, and amorphous carbon is thermodynamically viable [28], [29], [30], [31]. Graphite, petroleum coke, and Shawinigan black, respectively, generated NaC70, NaC30, and NaC15 in the early research demonstrating that the degree of Na intercalation in carbon materials varies depending on the carbon structure [31]. Additionally, the carbon compounds underwent reversible Na ion extraction. Later, it was discovered by Stevens and Dahn that hard carbon (pyrolyzed glucose) could offer a high specific capacity (300 mAh/g), comparable to that of Li intercalation in graphite [23]. This made hard carbon a suitable anode for NIBs. The “card-house” model is used to describe the Na storage in two independent processes: (i) Na ion intercalation between graphene sheets in the sloping-voltage zone and (ii) Na ions filling in the gaps between nano-graphitic domains in the plateau region. Numerous studies have used the “card-house” model to explain the electrochemical characteristics of hard carbon anodes since the model’s inception [32], [33]. The Na insertion mechanism in diverse carbon materials, which can account for the reported Na storage potential and capabilities, is still not fully understood."

The morphological characterization was carried out with the Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) Gemini-SEM 500 M/s Carl ZEISS-EDAX Z2 Analyzer AMETEK, Bangalore, India. The crystal structure of the Na-GO powder sample was examined by X-Ray Diffraction (Rigaku Smart-lab Autosampler (RIGAKU Corp., Tokyo, Japan)) using a Cu kα radiation with the JCPDS-ICDD database. The surface and functional chemistry of Na-GO was investigated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) using spectra in the K-alpha Photoelectron spectrometer (omicron Nano Technology, London, UK). The examination was done to identify the chemical and elemental composition of the Na-GO sample for the confirmation of functional groups with their binding energy. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm was estimated based on the automated adsorption instruments (11-2370 Gemini Miceomeritics, Atlanta, GA, USA). The Na-GO sample were preheated at 90 °C (ramp 10 °C/min) and degassed at 300 °C in a vacuum with a holding time of 8 h.

The micropore volume (Vmic), microporous surface area (Smic) and external surface area (Sext) were obtained from the t-plot method. The mesopore volume (Vmes) was acquired by BJH (Barrett- Joyner-Halenda) method and the total pore volume (Vtot) estimated from the sum of mesoporous volume (Vmes) and microporous volume (Vmic). The mean pore radius (rmp) was estimated from the total pore volume and SBET with some assumption [34], [35]."

Adding functional groups like hydroxyl and epoxy to the carbon skeleton causes Na-GO to exhibit a strong D peak. A collection of phonons with various moments that a defect has activated is represented by the 2D peak (2922 cm−1). Due to the oxidation and ultrasonication processes used during synthesis, the tiny sp2 domains may be responsible for the broad D-band and the attenuated 2D-band. These peaks denote the development of disordered and graphitic carbon for the D-band and G-band, respectively. The disordered carbon is shown by the intensity ratio of ID/IG (1.122). These ID/IG values indicate that the generated materials have a reasonable degree of graphitization with a predominance of amorphous carbon from the G.O. utilized in the synthesis process [35].",

XRD spectrum was deconvoluted (COD R2 = 0.997) to separate the peaks for easy identification and an effective way to analyze the crystalline properties of a material for individual peaks. The XRD spectrum of Na-GO depicted several peaks at different positions, including 2θ = 22.1°, with the plane (2 2 0) as a position for sodium dioxide (Na2O). Peaks at 2θ = 26.4° and 2θ = 43.6° with D-spacing of 3.40Å and 2.14Å corresponding to (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) planes, respectively.

The 2D peak further depicted 2θ = 78.1° with the plane of (1 1 0) and D-spacing of 1.24Å, indicating a crystalline structure with a calculated density of 2.26 g/cm3 and cell volume of 35.29x106pm3. The XRD pattern database with ICDD 96-901-1578 corresponds with the semi-crystalline carbon structure materials [37], [38].

Due to various intercalation depths, the sodium ions are inserted into these sheets with variable interlayer spacing, creating a composite with electrical conductivity. Na-GO sheets have several functional groups like carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy on their surface. The Na-GO sample has certain areas that are not particularly smooth and have wrinkled displays, as shown in the micrographs (Fig. 4b). This might result from incomplete sample exfoliation or reaggregation of some GO sheets during drying because of the Van der Waals force [40]. The EDX analysis of the elemental composition of the Na-GO sample shown in Fig. 4 contained 99.01% C and 0.41% O, and 0.58% Na.

Fig. 7a shows the first, fifth, and tenth charge/discharge cycle profiles of the Na-GO electrode that were performed against Na/Na+ at a current density of 50 mA/g and a voltage range between 0.01 and 3.0 V. The first cycle’s specific capacity (S.C.) for charge and discharge was roughly 721mAh/g and 703.4mAh/g, respectively. In the fifth cycle, the SC was decreased to 680 and 688mAh/g for charge and discharge. The charge and discharge rates dropped slightly more in the tenth cycle, to 663 mAh/g and 659 mAh/g, respectively. The first cycle showed a coulombic efficiency of around 97.7 per cent, and the first cycle’s modest irreversible reactions caused a slight irreversible capacity reduction of about 2.4 per cent. But in the fifth cycle, as shown in Fig. 7a, the Na-GO discharge SC changed the coulombic efficiency to 101.2 per cent because there was less drop in SC under the current density of 50 mA/g.",

Two firm peaks at 0.61 and 1.22 V and two other small peaks at 1.89 and 2.7 V were seen in CV’s first cycle cathodic scan. They were attributed to surface reactions and electrolyte dissolution to produce a solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) [42]. Intriguingly, during the anodic scan in all four cycles, a voltage hump appeared almost at 1.39 V. This was caused by an irreversible process and other unwanted reactions or the trapping of Na ions at 1.39 V, which may be caused by anodic surface reaction and sodium ion trapping. To achieve Na-plating at a high current density, the Na-intercalation potential for Na-GO was shown to be extremely close to zero volts (V) [1], [43]. The insertion potential is zero with Na-plating when Na-GO is used as the positive electrode for a Na-ion battery, as shown in Fig. 7b. Therefore, the Na-GO material is a better cathode material for Na-ion battery storage from a safety perspective.",

The SC was decreased in the tenth cycle to 532.2 and 540.4mAh/g for charge and discharge, respectively. The SC values for charge and discharge were further decreased to 368.3 mAh/g and 366.4 mAh/g, respectively, in the 60th cycle. With a current density of 100 mA/g, the first cycle’s Coulombic efficiency was 101.2 per cent, while additional cathodic processes in the first cycle contributed to a capacity gain of about 1.2 per cent. A capacity reduction of 49% was observed at the 60th cycle. As consistently demonstrated by CV cycles, capacity fading was caused by undesirable reactions. The irreversible process happened at 0.61 on the cathodic side and 1.39 V on the anodic side (Fig. 7b). During charge/discharge cycles, the peaks for reduction and oxidation cannot be distinguished, unlike in the case of CV. The formation of the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) during the cycles is another irreversible mechanism contributing to the 49 per cent irreversible capacity decrease.",

Therefore, the limited generation of sodium-ion trapping and other surface reactions at the higher voltage causes stable electrochemical performance and improved specific capacity. The specific capacity of the Na-GO electrode after 10 electrochemical cycles at a low current density (50 mA/g) is roughly 663 mAh/g. In contrast, at a high current density (100 mA/g), it is 532 mAh/g (Fig. 8a). Even cycling with a higher current density in the intermediate cycles demonstrates outstanding cycling stability. A sodium ion battery application using nanoscale concentric-shelled disordered carbon and Na metal as a counter electrode was claimed to have a sodium storage capacity of 150mAh/g after 50 cycles under a current density of 200 mA/g [1].",

Fig. 8b displays the Nyquist impedance plot over a voltage range of 0.01 to 3.0 V. The semicircles on the Nyquist plot represented the high-frequency charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface with the fitted data after cycle stability. Na-GO charge-transfer resistance (Rct) was 39 Ω before 60 electrochemical cycles and climbed to 44 Ω after the 60th cycle was finished. Diffusion or Ohmic resistance is indicated by the charge transfer resistance’s (Rct) semicircle at high frequency and the slope line at low frequency [38]. The minimal difference between the Rct values before and after cycling shows that the Na-GO electrode’s charge transfer resistance increased very little after 60 electrochemical cycles. In the voltage range between 0.01 and 3.0 V, this exhibit improved electrochemical behaviour, strong capacity performance, and a high Coulombic efficiency against sodium. It is clear from the EIS results that Na-GO material serves as a viable electrode for applications involving sodium ion storage.",

                "The capacity of Na-GO material created by electrochemical exfoliation and deposition to store sodium ions is reported in this study. For sodium-ion batteries, the Na-GO material was investigated as a cathode electrode. The Coulombic efficiency increased from 98.8 per cent in the first cycle to 100.5 per cent in the 60th electrochemical cycle, and the S.C. of the Na-GO electrode at the current density of 100 mA/g is almost 368 mAh/g. As a reference electrode, galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles were performed against sodium metal. This work suggests that the electrochemical exfoliation and deposition process yields superior material for sodium-ion batteries with high capacity."
