                "High-entropy layered cathode materials have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional structural stability and capacity retention. However, the complex composition of these materials has posed challenges for performance optimization. Herein, an innovative high-entropy P2/O3 hybrid layered oxide cathode material with impressive reversible capacity and high-rate capabilities is designed according to the configurational entropy adjustment strategy. Specifically, the unique structure of Na0.85Li0.05Ni0.3Fe0.1Mn0.5Ti0.05O2 (LNFMT) exhibits not only enhanced anionic activity but also mitigated migration of transition metals at high voltage. The high-entropy effect facilitates the migration of Li+ to Na layer, forming a pseudo-tetrahedral structure that hinders the movement of Fe3+. Additionally, the robust Ti-O bond ensures the internal cohesion of transition metal layers, enhancing the structural stability during de-/intercalation processes. As a result, the undesirable P2-O2 phase transformation is effectively suppressed in 1.5–4.5 V, leading to a remarkable capacity retention of over 70% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Moreover, LNFMT shows a high discharge capacity of 116 mAh/g at 10 C with excellent capacity retention of 94.23% after 150 cycles in 2.0–4.2 V, demonstrating its superior rate capability. This research showcases the significant impact of the high-entropy effect and provides a novel perspective for the design of sodium-ion cathode materials."

                "The depletion of fossil fuels and escalating environmental pollution have prompted the rapid development of clean energy sources, including wind energy, solar energy, tidal energy, etc. To effectively integrate these renewable energy sources into the energy storage system, the development of energy storage devices has become an essential component . Among contemporary energy storage technologies, electrochemical energy storage is the most widely employed and holds significant developmental prospects. In this regard, lithium-ion batteries are extensively utilized in consumer electronic devices (3 C devices) due to their high capacity, extended cycle life, and stable energy storage capabilities , . However, the growing demand for lithium in the market and the diminishing availability of lithium resources in nature have resulted in significant fluctuations in the price of lithium-ion batteries. As a result, there is a need to explore alternative or supplementary energy storage batteries . Sodium-ion batteries share similar working principles and electrochemical performance characteristics with lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, sodium resources are abundant and widely distributed, making them a cost-effective option. As a result, sodium-ion batteries are considered one of the most promising secondary battery technologies . In the composition of sodium-ion batteries, the cathode material plays a crucial role in determining important parameters such as capacity and stability. As a pivotal component, the selection of cathode materials is vital for achieving optimal battery performance. Cathode materials can generally be classified into categories such as layered metal oxides, Prussian blue compounds, polyanionic compounds, and so on . Among these categories, layered metal oxides have attracted substantial research attention due to their high capacity, wide operating voltage window, and excellent cycling performance .",
                "Sodium layered oxide cathodes can be represented by the formula NaxTMO2, where TM corresponds to transition metal elements such as Ni, Mn, Fe, and others . Based on the sodium content and the arrangement of oxygen atoms, sodium layered oxide cathodes can be classified into different phases, such as P2 and O3 types. When the sodium content is high (0.8 < x < 1.0), an O3-type structure like LiCoO2 is formed. While the sodium content falls within the range of 0.4–0.8, the cathode materials tend to adopt a P2-type structure. In this nomenclature, \"P\" and \"O\" demonstrate the positions of sodium in the prismatic and octahedral sites, respectively, while the numbers 2 or 3 indicate the number of repeated units in the stacking of transition metal layers , . In layered cathodes, the TM layer serves a dual purpose. It not only provides redox couples for charge compensation during electrochemical reactions but also acts as a framework to stabilize the crystal structure of the cathode material. The composition of the TM layer plays a crucial role in influencing the electrochemical performance of the cell . Therefore, designing a well-optimized composition of the TM layer is essential for achieving enhanced battery performance.",
                "High-entropy materials, characterized by the coexistence of multiple metal elements in a single phase, have attracted considerable attention. These materials exhibit distinctive conformational entropy structures and demonstrate remarkable comprehensive performance . The integration of the high-entropy strategy into sodium layered oxide cathodes has shown promising results, particularly in terms of cycling stability and reversible phase transition structures . For example, a P2 Na0.6(Ti0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Ru0.2)O2 exhibits excellent rate capability. It achieves a high capacity of 164 mAh/g at a rate of 0.1 C, and even at a high rate of 86 C, it still maintains a significant capacity of 68 mAh/g . By constructing a Li+/transition metal arrangement to form a superstructure, Na2/3Li1/6Fe1/6Co1/6Ni1/6Mn1/3O2 inhibits irreversible phase transitions, achieving high reversible capacity (171 mAh/g at 0.1 C), high energy density (531 Wh/kg) and excellent cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention at 1 C for 90 cycles) . An O3 NaMn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Ti0.2O2 possesses superior Na+ transport efficiency due to its rapid occurrence of a high reversible phase transition . An O3 NaCu0.1Ni0.3Fe0.2Mn0.2Ti0.2O2 exhibits excellent long terms cycling stability, retaining 71% of its capacity even after 500 cycles at 0.5 C . However, the above mentioned single-phase materials have not yet addressed the inherent issues of the O3 and P2 phases, such as multiple irreversible phase transitions and low Na+ transport capability. The hybrid P2/O3 material Na0.7Mn0.4Ni0.3Cu0.1Fe0.1Ti0.1O1.95F0.1 achieves an incredible initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) up to 97.6%. It retains a discharge capacity of 86.7 mAh/g even at 800 mA/g and maintains stability from −40 °C to 50 °C . The unique hybrid structure of the P2/O3 phase, coupled with the high-entropy effect, contributes to the efficient Na+ transport and stable crystal structure observed in sodium-ion cathodes. The high-entropy P2/O3 hybrid phase material takes advantage of the enhanced Na+ transport efficiency offered by the P2 phase, as well as the abundance of sodium ions and reversible structural phase transition characteristic of the O3 phase. By harnessing the strengths of both the P2 and O3 phases, this approach holds promising potential for further extensive research and development.",
                "To tailor the configurational entropy for designing the high-entropy P2/O3 hybrid phase structure, it is essential to carefully select suitable transition metal elements. Additionally, thorough consideration of the stoichiometric ratios of the individual elements is required. These steps are depicted in Fig. 1a. The selection of transition metal elements for the high-entropy P2/O3 hybrid phase structure entails considering three key aspects: the arrangement order of transition metals, the distribution of charges, and the arrangement order of Na+/vacancies. These arrangements are interconnected and mutually influence each other in a complex manner . The initial step is to achieve a disordered arrangement of transition metals in the TM layer. In this process, the interplay of element radii plays a crucial role. The selected atoms are more likely to facilitate a disordered arrangement when the differences in their radii are subtle (around 15%). The formation of charge distribution disorder primarily depends on the disparities in redox potentials between transition metal elements. If there are noticeable differences in redox potentials, it becomes possible to realize disorder in charge distribution. Furthermore, the final Na+/vacancy disorder structure could be achieved through a combination of disordered transition metal arrangement and charge distribution . After selecting appropriate transition metal elements, the construction of the P2/O3 phase structure also requires to consider the stoichiometric ratios of the individual elements meticulously, as depicted in Fig. 1b. This step is mainly achieved by calculating the \"cation potential\":",
                "ϕ cation = ϕ TM ¯ ϕ Na ¯ ϕ O ¯. In this context,",
                "ϕ TM ¯,",
                "ϕ Na ¯ and",
                "ϕ O ¯ represent the average ionic potentials of the transition metal ions, sodium ions and oxygen ions, respectively. The selection of Na and transition metal contents can position an intermediate",
                "ϕ cation within the interval of the dividing lines of P2 and O3 phases, which will contribute to the formation of a P2/O3 hybrid phase structure .",
                "Combined with elemental screening and cationic potential calculations, the high-entropy P2/O3 hybrid phase Na0.85Li0.05Ni0.3Fe0.1Mn0.5Ti0.05O2 (LNFMT) was successfully designed and then compared with traditional Na0.85Ni0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 (NFM). By adjusting the inert cations Li+ and Ti4+ to modulate the configurational entropy, the Sconf increased from 1.03 R to 1.24 R, resulting in the formation of a high-entropy structure (Equation S1) . This high-entropy strategy reduces Gibbs free energy, leading to the formation of stabilized crystalline structures. Additionally, the unique disordered Na+/vacancy-P2/O3 structure, resulting from the high-entropy effect, plays a crucial role in enhancing anionic activity and combining the advantageous properties of two-phase electrochemical reactions. Through detailed analysis using operando X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that the high-entropy LNFMT satisfies the electrochemical performance requirements across various voltage ranges. This discovery offers a novel approach for designing sodium layered cathode materials in future research endeavors."

All the Bragg peaks can be well indexed to typical P2 phase (P63/mmc) and O3 phase (R-3m) structures. The results suggest that metallic atoms favorably enter into the TM layer as designed . The adjustments of configurational entropy change the occupancy of TM layers and the ratio of the P2/O3 phases. As a result, the ratio between O3 and P2 phases of NFM and LNFMT changes from 84:16–77:23. In addition, the high-entropy effect causes the elongation of O-Na-O layer in LNFMT, since the reduced atomic radius of Ti4+(0.605 Å) compared to that of Fe3+(0.64 Å) contributes to the contraction of the TM layer and expansion of adjacent Na layers .",

Both schemes involved an initial activation at 0.1 C (1 C = 150 mA/g) for the first three cycles. The performance of NFM and LNFMT under Scheme-I is shown in Fig. 3a,b. The initial discharge capacities of NFM and LNFMT are 188.3 mAh/g and 180.2 mAh/g, respectively. After 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the discharge capacities of NFM and LNFMT are 95.1 mAh/g and 115.2 mAh/g, with capacity retentions of 57.6% and 69.3%, respectively. In Scheme-Ⅱ, referring to Fig. 3d,e, the discharge curves of NFM and LNFMT at 0.1 C and 0.2 C show a good overlap, indicating less polarization occurring in this voltage range. After 100 cycles, the capacities of NFM and LNFMT decay to 53.7 mAh/g and 104.1 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 43.3% and 84.9%, respectively.",
                        "In Scheme-Ⅰ, there are several voltage plateaus can be observed for NFM during charge/discharge, especially at approximately 2.6 V and 4.25 V. It is reported that these two voltage plateaus are mainly caused by Na+/vacancy rearrangement and irreversible phase transition, which will be discussed in the following operando XRD analysis section , . In addition, the voltage plateau of NFM becomes indistinct and the capacity decreases rapidly after 100 cycles, indicating the collapse of the crystal structure for NFM during long cycling . For the high-entropy LNFMT, the entropy-tuned strategy causes a slight decrease (8.1 mAh/g) for the initial discharge capacity, but the capacity retention rate improves by 11.7% after 100 cycles, compared to NFM. Furthermore, this high-entropy effect weakens the voltage plateaus at 4.25 V and 2.6 V strongly. The voltage profile of LNFMT maintains a smooth and consistent shape across the entire charge/discharge process, which manifests remarkable structural stability and excellent Na+ transport capability . Moreover, it is noteworthy that the discharge capacities of both NFM and LNFMT exceed the capacity contributed by Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couples at 0.1 C in Scheme-Ⅰ, implying a high anion redox activity , .",
                        "In Scheme-Ⅱ, the high-entropy LNFMT exhibits only a slight decrease in capacity (1.3 mAh/g) compared to NFM. However, its capacity retention improves significantly by 41.6%. It is evident that LNFMT does not display a noticeable voltage plateau between 2.8 and 4.2 V due to the entropy-tuned strategy, which enhances the cohesion between adjacent layers in the TM layer. This suppression of phase transitions in the traditional NaxNiyMn1-yO2 system at high voltages (> 4.0 V) is achieved . Moreover, the configurational entropy plays a crucial role in modulating the ratio of Nae/Naf in the P2 phase, thus promoting the activation of oxygen activity . Additionally, it alters Na+ migration from \"dumbbell hop\" to \"tetrahedral hop\" in the O3 phase, resulting in a significant enhancement in Na+ transport capability . In summary, through the tuning of configurational entropy, the high-entropy LNFMT exhibits a slightly decreased discharge capacity compared to NFM. However, the capacity retention is significantly improved in both schemes.",

In Scheme-Ⅰ, the high-entropy LNFMT cathode demonstrates reversible capacities of 173.7 mAh/g, 158.4 mAh/g, 145.2 mAh/g, 131.5 mAh/g, 101.8 mAh/g, and 68.4 mAh/g at 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, and 10 C, respectively. Moreover, when the rate reverts from 10 C to 0.2 C, its capacity can be restored to 160 mAh/g, indicating that the structure of LNFMT remains relatively unchanged or undamaged. In Scheme-Ⅱ, LNFMT exhibits high discharge capacities ranging from 0.2 C to 5 C, remaining above 120 mAh/g. Even at 10 C, the capacity of LNFMT remains steady at 110 mAh/g, and it can recover to 130 mAh/g when the rate returns to 0.2 C. However, NFM shows clear and systematic capacity degradation with notable fluctuations over the different C-rates.",
                        "To further assess the performance of NFM and LNFMT under high rates, cycling tests were conducted at 10 C (1500 mA/g), as presented in Fig. 3g. After 150 cycles, the high-entropy LNFMT exhibits a remarkable capacity retention rate of 94.3%, retaining a high capacity of 109.4 mAh/g (the initial one is 116 mAh/g). This improvement in capacity retention is 23.7% higher compared to that of NFM, demonstrating the enhanced stability of LNFMT under high-rate cycling conditions. This discharge capacity and stability are considered quite outstanding compared to other reported ones (Table S2). The outstanding high-rate performance is closely related to the efficient transport of Na+ and stable crystal structure caused by high-entropy effect. Afterwards, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed for NFM and LNFMT cells after 100 cycles at 1 C and the results are shown in Fig. 3h. The raw data obtained from the experiments are accurately fitted by the provided equivalent electric circuit. The impedance values extracted from the fitted plots are summarized in Table S3. Notably, the refined values of Rs, Rf, and Rct for LNFMT are significantly smaller compared to those of NFM. This observation confirms the superior Na+ transport efficiency of LNFMT, which remains unaffected even after long cycling periods.",
                        "Subsequently, the electrochemical behaviors of NFM and LNFMT were further explored by CV studies, and the results are shown in Fig. 4a,b. In Scheme-I, the redox peaks of the high-entropy LNFMT at 3.28/3.05 V and 3.64/3.48 V originate from Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+ redox couples, respectively, while the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple occurs between 3.5 V and 4.5 V. Additionally, the peaks around 2.5 V are related to the redox of Mn3+/Mn4+ and the strong peak observed at 4.33/4.25 V corresponds to O2-/On- . In Scheme-II, a small redox peak of LNFMT can be clearly seen around 4.2 V which is absent for NFM, indicating the decrease of the energy barrier for activating anionic redox in the high-entropy framework. In addition, the electrochemical performance of LNFMT reveals a smooth Na+ transport capability during cycling. Fig. 4c,d show the GITT plots of NFM and LNFMT within two schemes (detailed information stated in Figure S3). Taking a comprehensive view, a clear decline of the Na+ transport efficiency can be observed for NFM, whereas that for LNFMT maintains a narrow range of fluctuations. In Scheme-I, the average Na+ diffusivity of LNFMT is determined to be 6.60×10−11 cm2s−1, which is nearly 1.5 times higher than that of NFM. Within Scheme-Ⅱ, the average Na+ diffusivity of NFM and LNFMT are calculated to be 1.19×10−10 cm2s−1 and 1.48×10−10 cm2s−1, respectively. Significant undulation in DNa+ can be clearly observed during the de-/intercalation process of NFM, which can be interpreted by the occurrence of reordering of Na+/vacancy . Comparatively, the DNa+ of LNFMT always maintains around 10−10-10−11 cm2s−1, which is consistent well with the expected results of the configurational entropy-tuned structure. From electrochemical performance analysis, it can be inferred that the high-entropy effect can prevent inherent Na+/vacancy reordering during Na+ de-/intercalation, which is crucial for enhancing the electrochemical performance of cathode materials."

Meanwhile, it can be found that a new O2 characteristic peak emerges around 25°, which signifies the occurrence of a P2-O2 phase transition . The appearance of the O2 phase results in a sharp contraction of the c axis and volume of the P2 phase crystal. Upon charging to 4.5 V, the P3 (104) peak shifts to a higher angle and the O2 peak continues to persist. The above phenomena indicate that the solid-solution reaction and the P2-O2 phase transition are dominant in the first charge process from 2.7 V to 4.5 V. During the discharge process until the voltage is reduced to 2.7 V, the peaks of P3 phase shift back to initial angles nearly. When continuously discharged to 2.0 V, the O2 peak weakens and the P3-O3 transition begins. As discharged to 1.5 V, the P3 phase completes the transition into the O3 phase with a small amount of the O2 peak remaining. Throughout the entire charge/discharge process, the phase transition occurs as follows: P2/O3-P2/P3-O2/P3-O2/O3-P2/O3. As mentioned above, the P2 phase undergoes a drastic contraction of the c axis leading to a large volume change (14%) from charging at 3.5 V to discharging at 1.5 V. This significant volume change could lead to the collapse of the crystal structure, resulting in the degradation of the electrochemical performance. Besides, the occurrence of the P2-O2 phase transition is not completely reversible during the discharge process, indicating a poor structural recovery and loss of capacity. The main reason for the emergence of the O2 phase is the migration of TM and the slip of the TMO2 layer at high voltage, which leads to the enhancement of electrostatic repulsion between oxygen atoms in adjacent layers, thus resulting in the structural degradation of NFM .",
                        "In contrast to NFM, the phase transition behavior of high-entropy LNFMT in Fig. 5b is relatively straightforward. During the initial charge from open circuit voltage (OCV) to 4.2 V, only the O3-P3 transition is observed. As the charging process continues to 4.5 V, the P2 phase and the newly formed P3 phase transform into hexagonal phases known as OP4 and OP2, respectively. Throughout the charging process, the characteristic peaks corresponding to the P2 (002) and O3 (003) phases gradually shift to lower angles. This phenomenon can be attributed to the expansion of the c axis caused by an increased repulsive force between adjacent oxygen layers , . Additionally, during the charging process, the P2 (101), (012), (102) peaks, as well as the O3 (104) peak, gradually shift towards higher angles. This phenomenon is attributed to the contraction of the lattice's a and b axes. The contraction is induced by the oxidation of transition metal ions such as Ni2+ and Fe3+ during the charging process . During the discharging process, the OP4 and OP2 phases gradually transform back into the P2 and P3 phases, respectively, starting from 4.2 V and persisting until 3.8 V. As the discharge continues from 3.8 V to 1.5 V, the characteristic peaks corresponding to the P2 and P3 phases remain relatively unchanged. To summarize, the overall phase transition process can be described as follows: P2/O3-P2/P3-OP4/OP2-P2/P3. It is important to note that throughout this process, there is no evidence of the appearance of the O2 phase. The dominant presence of the P2/P3 phases during the charging and discharging cycles indicates that the adjustment of configurational entropy effectively maintains the stability of the crystal structure and suppresses the occurrence of irreversible O2 phase transitions."

                        "Since exceptional electrochemical performance strongly relies on a highly stable and reversible charge compensation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to verify the chemical state of elements in NFM and LNFMT, and the results are shown in Fig. 6a-d and Figure S5. All constituent elements in this material can be observed from the survey spectrum. Among them, the binding energy of Ni 2p is fitted to Ni2+ (Ni 2p3/2 located at 854.48 eV), and the binding energy of Fe 2p is close to Fe3+ in the high-resolution spectrum (Fe 2p3/2 located at 711.08 eV) . Mn 2p spectrum can be divided into Mn3+ (Mn 2p3/2 located at 641.88 eV) and Mn4+ (Mn 2p3/2 located at 643.58 eV), which suggests that Mn3+ and Mn4+ coexist in NFM and LNFMT. Last but not the least, O 1 s spectrum can be divided into three parts: the lattice oxygen characteristic peak (Oα) located at 528.97 eV, the surface adsorbed oxygen (Oβ) around 531.2 eV, and the hydroxyl group, chemisorbed water, and characteristic peaks of carbonate (Oγ) at 535.48 eV . During the initial charge/discharge process at various voltages (Fig. 6e,f), the O characteristic peaks of NFM and LNFMT exhibit obvious differences. For the high-entropy LNFMT, the intensity of the O2- peak decreases during charging to 4.2 V, meanwhile a new anionic peroxide On- peak appears at 530.5 eV. The intensity of the On- peak continues to increase when the voltage is increased to 4.5 V, which means that the proportion of lattice oxygen transition from O2- to On- increases along with Na+ extraction. However, for NFM, On- only appears at 4.5 V, and no lattice oxygen transition is detected at 4.2 V. Thus, the high-entropy effect in LNFMT is beneficial for lowering the anionic redox energy barrier and enhancing the anionic redox activity. After discharging to 2.0 V, the On- group in LNFMT is reduced back to O2-. Even when the cell is further discharged to 1.5 V, the intensity of the peak corresponding to O2- still remains constant, confirming the highly reversible O2– and On- redox reaction . On the contrary, the intensity of the lattice oxygen O2- peak for NFM decreases significantly during the discharge process from 2.0 V to 1.5 V, which implies that the O2- to On- redox reaction is not entirely reversible and there is a certain degree of lattice oxygen loss .",
                        "The electrical and local environments of transition metal (TM) atoms in LNFMT were investigated using ex-situ XAS, as shown in Fig. 7a-c. During the charging/discharging process, the main absorption edge of Ni progressively shifts to higher energy regions before returning to its initial position, aligning perfectly with the measurement from the pristine sample. A similar reversible shifting trend is observed at the Mn and Fe K-edge, but its magnitude is not significant, indicating the dominance of reversible Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+ redox couples in the charge compensation mechanism , . What’s more, as shown in Fig. 7d-f, shortened Ni-O bond is detected when the electrode is charged to 4.2 V, indicating the oxidation of Ni ions in this process. Conversely, Fe/Mn-O bonds only undergo a slight change, proving that Fe and Mn are not highly reactive during the entire electrochemical process. Furthermore, in the second coordination shell of Ni/Fe/Mn-TM bonds, it is observed that the Ni-TM distance decreases during the charging process because of the oxidation of Ni ions. This change in distance is associated with the in-plane interatomic distance. However, the distance for Fe/Mn-TM bonds nearly overlaps with the corresponding steps in the charging/discharging process, which reflect that the local structures of FeO6 and MnO6 have not undergone significant changes. This invariant in-plane interatomic distance indirectly evidences that the migration of Fe3+ and the Jahn-Teller effect are effectively suppressed .",
                        "The anion redox reaction is widely acknowledged to have a significant influence on the capacity and structural stability of cathodes in lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. To better understand the high-entropy effect associated with the anion redox reaction in LFNMT, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to investigate the binding energies of TM-O (TM = Li, Ti, and Fe). The calculated results are presented in Fig. 8. In terms of all binding energies, although the Fe-O remains constant, the Ti-O consistently exceeds the Fe-O as x varies from 0.67 to 0.32 in NaxLi0.05Ni0.3Fe0.1Mn0.5Ti0.05O2, corresponding to capacity from 45 mAh/g to 135 mAh/g. The stronger Ti-O binding energy means that the TM layer structure can be more stable and cohesive. The binding energy of Li-O decreases dramatically as Na+ is extracted/inserted, forming a Li-O-Li structure, which eventually leads to the generation of isolated pair oxygen. Due to the weak Li-O bond, the 2p orbitals of oxygen become closer to the Fermi level, thus activating the anion redox of lattice oxygen O2-/On-, which in turn compensates the capacity loss caused by the inactive cations doping . With further de-/intercalation, the Fe-O binding energy shows a significant decrease as the discharge capacity reaches 180 mAh/g, resulting in a strong migration tendency of Fe3+ in the structure. In response to the same situation in LFNMT, the weaker Li-O binding energy forces Li+ migrates before Fe3+, leading to the formation of a pseudo-tetrahedral structure, which inhibits the movement of Fe3+. Similar situations have also been observed in the P3 phase structure Na0.67[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2 . Meanwhile, since Li+ is unstable at the sodium tetrahedral site, it migrates back to the TM layer during subsequent electrochemical process, showing a good reversibility. As a result, the migration of Fe3+ can be effectively suppressed. Moreover, the Ti-O binding energy remains relatively unchanged even in the high-capacity ranges, which helps maintain the local stability of O-TM-O. Hence, the high-entropy effect formed by the interaction of multiple metal ions in LFNMT not only ensures the stability of the crystal structure but also delivers high reversible capacity throughout the cycling process , ."

                "In conclusion, a high-entropy P2/O3 hybrid phase cathode material Na0.85Li0.05Ni0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5Ti0.05O2 (LNFMT) has been successfully designed and synthesized by strategically selecting transition metal elements and adjusting the configurational entropy through calculating the “cationic potential”. The unique high-entropy effect of LNFMT ensures highly reversible oxygen activity and effectively suppresses the formation of irreversible O2 phases during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the LNFMT cathode combines the advantages of both P2 and O3 phases, achieving a harmonious balance between high capacity and high-rate performance. It exhibits superior cycling stability, with approximately 84.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles, and remarkable rate capability. The reversible capacity of LNFMT reaches 109.4 mAh/g, with 94.3% capacity retention at 10 C after 150 cycles, demonstrating significant improvement compared to traditional cathode NFM. This work advances our understanding of the design, synthesis, and mechanistic studies of high-entropy hybrid phase cathode materials. It also provides valuable guidelines for future research on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries."
