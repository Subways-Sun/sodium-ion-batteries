The cost of these batteries is expected to increase with the increasing global demand for Li, which, together with the limited availability of Li resources and their frequent location in politically unstable countries, presents a problem and necessitates the development of viable Li‐free alternatives. Among these alternatives, sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise due to the broader availability and lower cost of Na compared to those of Li and the similarity of the respective redox potentials (−2.71 vs 3.04 V vs standard hydrogen electrode). To date, numerous SIB cathode materials have been developed by utilizing the technologies previously adopted for Li‐ion batteries.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0001 #smll202102618-bib-0002 #smll202102618-bib-0003 #smll202102618-bib-0004 #smll202102618-bib-0005 #smll202102618-bib-0006 #smll202102618-bib-0007"><sup>1–7</sup></link><sup>]</sup></p><p>SIB anode materials can be classified by their reaction mechanisms (intercalation/deintercalation, plating/oxidation, alloying/de‐alloying, and conversion reaction). Among the multitude of SIB anode materials, Na metal foil plating‐type anodes are an ideal choice, as they contain nothing but the active material.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0008 #smll202102618-bib-0009"><sup>8,9</sup></link><sup>]</sup> However, the Na dendrites that grow on such anodes during the plating reaction can penetrate the porous separator and form a direct connection between the anode and cathode, causing internal short‐circuiting and rapid discharge. As a result, the battery cycle lifetime drastically decreases, while the heat generated upon rapid discharge can trigger fire and even battery explosion.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0008 #smll202102618-bib-0009"><sup>8,9</sup></link><sup>]</sup></p><p>Alloying/de‐alloying anodes are a promising alternative to Na plating‐type anodes.

Sn anodes have a high theoretical specific capacity of 847 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> (6150 mAh cm<sup>−3</sup>), high electrical conductivity, and a low potential (vs Na/Na<sup>+</sup>) plateau.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0010"><sup>10</sup></link><sup>]</sup> However, they expand by as much as 424% upon sodiation to form Na<sub>3.75</sub>Sn, which can lead to Sn pulverization during charge/discharge cycling. Most previous researchers believed that this pulverization is the cause of the poor cycling behavior of Sn anodes. Thus, they focused on decreasing the effect of volume change by decreasing the particle size or depth of discharge, such as by preparing Sn composite anodes with nanoscale Sn structures (e.g., spherical particles,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0011 #smll202102618-bib-0012 #smll202102618-bib-0013 #smll202102618-bib-0014 #smll202102618-bib-0015 #smll202102618-bib-0016 #smll202102618-bib-0017"><sup>11–17</sup></link><sup>]</sup> hollow shapes,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0018 #smll202102618-bib-0019 #smll202102618-bib-0020"><sup>18–20</sup></link><sup>]</sup> thin films,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0021"><sup>21</sup></link><sup>]</sup> nanorods,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0022 #smll202102618-bib-0023"><sup>22,23</sup></link><sup>]</sup> or nanofibers<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0024 #smll202102618-bib-0025 #smll202102618-bib-0026"><sup>24–26</sup></link><sup>]</sup>). Nevertheless, despite their advantages, nanoscale active materials are expensive and have a low active material loading.</p><p>Recently, our group reported the long‐term cycling stability of micrometer‐sized Sn particles,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0027"><sup>27</sup></link><sup>]</sup> which might originate from a “self‐healing” effect, that is, the reformation of a stable porous structure after pulverization. Thus, we hypothesized that pulverization might not be the origin of poor cycling stability in Sn alloying‐type anodes, which contrasts the understanding in previous reports. To determine whether the self‐healing ability can be extended from micrometer‐sized Sn powder to millimeter‐sized Sn bulk materials, we prepared Sn metal foil for use as an anode material. Some researchers have studied Sn metal foil anodes previously. Obrovac et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0028"><sup>28</sup></link><sup>]</sup> reported that they have an unstable and incomplete first‐charge curve. Li et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0029"><sup>29</sup></link><sup>]</sup> used a pre‐sodiated Sn foil anode to achieve cycling stability, realizing a capacity of 100 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> at a current rate of 0.1 C. However, they only achieved one‐eighth of the theoretical capacity of 847 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, which reduced the overall volume change. Therefore, the long‐term cycling ability of Sn metal foil anodes at high capacity is still unknown.</p><p>Based on the results of previous studies,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0027"><sup>27</sup></link><sup>]</sup> a flat Sn foil (6 mm diameter, 30 µm thickness) anode was used with a dual separator and dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte. The conductive additive‐ and binder‐free Sn foil anode exhibited stable and well‐pronounced charge/discharge behavior, which was ascribed to the preservation of its electrochemical and topological properties. A full cell with a Na<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (NVP) cathode showed good capacity as well as cycling stability. We confirmed that cracking or pulverization of the Sn anode is not the primary origin of its poor cycling performance. This provides a new horizon for the development of alloying‐type anodes (such as Sn, Sb, Bi, and Si) that undergo volume changes during charge/discharge cycling.</p></section><section xml:id="smll202102618-sec-0020"><title type="main">Results and Discussion</title><p>The discharge curve of Sn foil at 0.01 C (<b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001"><b>1</b>a</link>) had three distinct plateaus at 0.18, 0.10, and 0.04 V, the end positions of which reflected the capacities corresponding to Na/Sn atomic ratios of 1, 2.25, and 3.75, respectively. The phase transformation of the Sn foil anode was probed by in situ X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis during the discharge process (Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1b</link> and Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S1a</link>, Supporting Information). The thus‐obtained patterns featured peaks corresponding to the Sn foil anode, the polypropylene nanoporous membrane and glass fiber filter separator, and the Be window of the XRD holder.

Nevertheless, the intensity ratios of the peaks deviated from those of the reference, which was ascribed to texturing (preferential orientation) of the film from the rolling process used to prepare it.</p><figure xml:id="smll202102618-fig-0001"><label>1</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202102618:smll202102618-fig-0001" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202102618-fig-0001-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>a) Voltage profile, b) XRD patterns, c) macrophotographs, and d) low‐ and e) high‐magnification SEM images of Sn foil anode at various stages of the first discharge process (0.01 C‐rate, yellow arrow: island‐like spherical protuberances, red arrow: multiple wires of churro‐like shapes, white arrow: V‐shaped wires).</caption></figure><p>After a discharge of 20 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the intensity of the peak at 32.0° decreased, which reflects the (partial) disappearance of the preferred orientation. New peaks emerged at 27.7° and 34.0° (blue arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1b</link>) that were assigned to Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>Sn with <i>x</i> &lt; 1, although no reference corresponding to these positions was found. The new peaks persisted until a discharge of 100 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, but they almost disappeared as the specific capacity increased to 200 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>. β‐NaSn peaks emerged at 31.8° and 34.6° (green arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1b</link>) at a specific capacity of 200 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, and persisted to 300 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>.

At a specific capacity of 500 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the peaks of β‐NaSn had almost disappeared, and two strong peaks of Na<sub>2.25</sub>Sn appeared at 33.0° and 33.9° (purple arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1b</link>). As the position of this capacity (500 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>) is close to the end of the second plateau in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1a</link>, we concluded that NaSn reacted with Na during the second plateau to afford Na<sub>2.25</sub>Sn, in good agreement with previous reports.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0007 #smll202102618-bib-0017 #smll202102618-bib-0030 #smll202102618-bib-0031 #smll202102618-bib-0032"><sup>7,17,30–32</sup></link><sup>]</sup> After a discharge of 600 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to the third plateau in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1a</link> of 0.04 V, peaks of Na<sub>3.75</sub>Sn (at 31.92°, 33.38°, and 34.78°; navy arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1b</link>) and Na<sub>2.25</sub>Sn emerged.

The pristine Sn foil had a silvery‐white appearance with a metallic luster. The white metallic luster was lost after a discharge of 20 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, but the disk shape and area did not change. The disk shape was retained as the specific capacity continued to increase, while the area increased. Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S3a</link>, Supporting Information, shows the variation in the apparent area of the anode during the discharge process, revealing that the areal expansion was not proportional to the sodiation degree. Up to a discharge of 60 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the areal expansion was close to 0%; subsequently, it increased continuously until 700 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, and was then stable at 93% until the end of the discharge process. Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S4</link>, Supporting Information, shows images of the back side of the anode (the surface contacting the current collector during discharge) after bending. Both sides of the pristine Sn anode had the same color and metallic luster. However, the back side of the Sn anode after a discharge of 20 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> was golden with a metallic luster. After a discharge of 200 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the back side lost its metallic luster and became similar to the front side. This behavior implies that the initial sodiation in the first plateau progresses from the front side to the back side of the Sn anode and does not occur throughout the anode.</p><p>To understand anode expansion in detail, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to explore the changes in the Sn foil surfaces during the first electrochemical cycle (Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1d,e</link>). The surface of the pristine Sn foil anode exhibited traces of rolling, as shown in the low‐magnification SEM images. After a discharge of 20 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the surface of the Sn foil became covered by island‐like spherical protuberances (yellow arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1e</link>) with diameters of ≈1 µm, as revealed by high‐magnification SEM. These protuberances probably reflect the expansion accompanying the conversion of Sn to NaSn, as the presence of a free surface would have caused expansion to occur perpendicular to the surface. Therefore, the initial expansion of the Sn foil anode probably occurred perpendicular to the surface, which could explain why no areal expansion was observed in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1c</link> or Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S3</link>, Supporting Information, during the initial stage of the discharge process.</p><p>At a discharge of 200 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the Sn foil surface was too rough to observe the traces of rolling by low‐magnification SEM imaging. In the high‐magnification images, the foil surface appears as if multiple wires of churro‐like shapes have been pulled out and bent at the end (red arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1e</link>). After a discharge of 400 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the entire surface was covered by V‐shaped wires (white arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1d,e</link>) that could be seen in both the low‐ and high‐magnification SEM images. The low‐magnification SEM image of the film after a discharge of 600 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> shows that the Sn foil is composed of several zones with a size of a few hundred micrometers. The insides of these zones (called V‐shaped zones) comprised V‐shaped wires (white arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1e,d</link>), which were same shape as those at a specific capacity of 400 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>. Each V‐shaped zone was surrounded by a boundary (marked by the white dotted line in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1d</link>), which could be formed by the connection and growth of the V‐shaped wires. The V‐shaped wires can be clearly observed in the high‐magnification image (white arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1e</link>). To identify the factors influencing the V‐shaped zones and their boundaries, we observed the etched pristine Sn foil anode by optical microscopy (Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S5</link>, Supporting Information). The optical microscopy images revealed that this foil was divided by etched grain boundaries with sizes of hundreds of micrometers. The boundaries between the V‐shaped zones probably correspond to the etched grain boundaries in the optical microscopy images.</p><p>The shape evolution that occurs during the discharge process is complex. However, from the above data, we propose the following sequence. Once the surface is covered by protuberances, sodiation occurs below the surface. Since the grain boundaries have an open structure, Na diffuses along the grain boundaries much faster than that in the bulk Sn lattice. It is plausible that NaSn compounds (Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>Sn, <i>x</i> &gt; 1) nucleate and grow at the grain boundaries. If two growing NaSn compounds meet at a grain boundary, they could produce the observed V‐shaped grains by compressive stress due to the volume expansion that occurs during sodiation, which might induce areal expansion. At the end of the discharge process, the churro‐like strands disappear but leave traces in the form of cracks. As the only crystalline phase observed by XRD corresponds to Na<sub>3.75</sub>Sn (Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1b</link>), the shape of Sn foil might be attributable to the formation of Na<sub>15</sub>Sn<sub>4</sub> as the final sodiation product.</p><p><b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0002"><b>2</b>a</link> presents the first‐charge curve of the Sn foil anode recorded at 0.01 C in a Na/Sn half‐cell.

However, no peaks of β‐NaSn were observed during charging, even though this phase was observed during the discharge process. Considering previous results,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0032 #smll202102618-bib-0033"><sup>32,33</sup></link><sup>]</sup> the NaSn formed in the Sn foil anode might have a nanocrystalline or amorphous structure. Sharp peaks of crystalline Sn appeared during subsequent charging and persisted until the end of the charging process. The charge reaction was the reverse process of the discharge in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1a</link>.</p><p>Although we used a Sn foil anode herein, its first discharge/charge profile and phase transformations are very similar to those previously observed for anodes comprising Sn nano‐ and microparticles. However, the morphology variation of the Sn foil anode during charging is very different. Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0002">2c</link> shows the macrophotographs of Sn foil anode taken during the first charging process. At a charge of 200 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the anode appeared dense, hard, and dark, similarly to the fully discharged sample. After charging to 600 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the anode appeared as a round dark disk divided by visible cracks into pieces that were several hundred micrometers in size. After subsequent charging, the disk shape with divided pieces was still observed. Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S2b</link>, Supporting Information, shows the evolution of the practical apparent area of the Sn foil anode during the first charge. In terms of size, the pristine state of the Sn foil anode was not recovered after the first charge because of visible cracks. Although the Sn anode was divided into pieces, a stable charge curve was obtained, which indicates that these pieces were electrically connected, that is, the anode was electrically connected in the vertical direction from the current collector.</p><p>To understand the anode cracking in detail, we used SEM to explore the changes in the Sn foil surfaces during the first electrochemical charging process (<b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003"><b>3</b>d</link>,<link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003">e</link>). The foil exhibited a porous structure with pores of &lt;500 nm, as shown in the high‐magnification SEM image. After charging to 400 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, churro‐like wires appeared in the high‐magnification SEM images, similar to those at a discharge capacity of 200 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> (Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1e</link>). After charging to 700 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, the film surfaces were covered by protuberances with sizes of &lt;1 µm, similar to the morphology at a discharge capacity of 20 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> (Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1e</link>). At the end of the charging process, the Sn foil had a dense and smooth surface. We could not find out any traces of the boundaries (shown by white dotted lines in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1d</link>) in any of the low‐magnification SEM images taken during the charging process. However, the pieces in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1c</link> have a size similar to those of the V‐shaped zones in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0001">1d</link>. During the charging (desodiation) process, the V‐shaped zones might return to their original shape with volume contraction, thereby inducing visible cracking. Based on above data, we concluded that the Sn foil anode reversibly reacts with Na during the first cycle.</p><figure xml:id="smll202102618-fig-0003"><label>3</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202102618:smll202102618-fig-0003" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202102618-fig-0003-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>a) Cycling stability, b) discharge/charge curves, c) Nyquist plots, d) macrophotographs, and e) SEM images of Sn foil anode at 0.1 C‐rate during electrochemical cycling (white arrow: small (diameter of &lt;500 nm) spherical particles, red arrow: larger (diameter of &lt;2 µm) spherical particles).</caption></figure><p>The discharge/charge curves of the Na/Sn half‐cell recorded at 0.01 C during three cycles are presented in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S6</link>, Supporting Information.

The Sn foil anode exhibited initial discharge and charge capacities of 766 and 666 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. After five cycles, the reversible capacity had increased to a maximum of 803 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> and the coulombic efficiency stabilized at ≈100%. The anode comprised only Sn metal; nevertheless, a high reversible capacity of 692 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> was achieved even after 100 cycles. Since the Sn foil anode did not contain a binder or conducting agent, the stable cycle life was an unexpected and notable phenomenon considering that pulverization occurred due to the volume change. The Sn foil anode delivered better capacity retention than the previous composite and free‐standing electrodes.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0011 #smll202102618-bib-0019 #smll202102618-bib-0026"><sup>11,19,26</sup></link><sup>]</sup></p><p>The corresponding charge/discharge curves for 100 cycles are shown in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003">3b</link>.

The Na/Sn half‐cell was probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to observe changes in internal resistance, with the obtained Nyquist plots shown in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003">3c</link>.

The <i>R</i><sub>ct</sub> of the Sn foil anode was as high as 72 Ω before cycling but decreased to &lt;1 Ω after 10 cycles, which coincides with the previous results using microsized Sn powder and DME electrolyte.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0033"><sup>33</sup></link><sup>]</sup></p><p>Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003">3d</link> shows macrophotographs of the charged Sn foil anode taken after 1, 3, 5, 20, and 100 cycles. Contrary to the conventional belief, the widths of cracks present after the first cycle had decreased after the third cycle, and no cracks were observed from the fifth cycle onward. During repeated cycling, the Sn foil anode retained its circular shape, but the diameter increased. The apparent and real areas of Sn anodes were calculated by image analysis and are presented in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S8</link>, Supporting Information. The apparent area of Sn foil increased from 28.27 to 82.79 mm<sup>2</sup> after 100 cycles.</p><p>Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003">3e</link> shows SEM images of Sn anodes acquired during 100 cycles at 0.1 C. The change in the morphology of the Sn anode during cycling made it possible to consider the reason for its fractures. At the fifth cycle, small protuberances (diameter of &lt;500 nm) with spherical shape (white arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003">3e</link>) appeared on the surface. At the 20th cycle, larger (diameter of &lt;2 µm) spherical particles (red arrows in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0003">3e</link>) were connected to each other and with pores. Finally, a coral‐like 3D porous structure was observed at the 100th cycle. This behavior indicates that the anode density decreases upon cycling, which could also be responsible for the increase of area and disappearance of visible cracks. In a previous study,<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0027"><sup>27</sup></link><sup>]</sup> we observed the formation of a coral‐like 3D porous structure after 5000 cycles in a Sn composite anode with micrometer‐sized Sn particles, demonstrating that they underwent self‐healing after initial pulverization. Since this process can proceed both at the surface and inside the divided pieces, the area of the divided pieces is expected to increase as the foil merges into one piece.</p><p>To investigate the morphology change induced by sodiation, a sample that had been exposed to 100 cycles was subjected to two further cycles, discharged at the 103rd cycle, and observed by SEM (<b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0004"><b>4</b></link>). SEM image revealed that the pore volume decreased by increasing thickness of arm of the coral‐like Sn structure due to sodiation. However, the coral‐like porous structure was well maintained without any cracks or fractures. In other words, the coral‐like structure was mechanically robust, enabling it to survive from the volume expansion/contraction. The coral‐like porous structure providing the space required to accommodate volume expansion. Thus, the coral‐like structure was very stable through volume variation, and could give stable cycling life. Most researchers consider pure Sn metal to be an unsuitable SIB anode because of the problems associated with its cracking and pulverization upon cycling. Especially, the pulverization has even been reported for thin Sn films.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0021"><sup>21</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Wang et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0032"><sup>32</sup></link><sup>]</sup> observed that the Sn particles could fracture severely above 1.6 µm during sodiation. Thus, most of researchers have focused on the nanosized Sn particles. However, our results explained that pulverization should not be the main reason of poor cyclability.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0018"><sup>18</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Further, the alloying‐type anodes could be good candidate for SIBs.</p><figure xml:id="smll202102618-fig-0004"><label>4</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202102618:smll202102618-fig-0004" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202102618-fig-0004-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>SEM images of the discharged Sn foil anode after 103 cycles at 0.1 C‐rate.</caption></figure><p>Based on the above results, we considered the variation in the Sn foil shape (<b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202102618-fig-0005"><b>5</b></link>). During discharging process, sodium–tin compound was initially formed protuberances shape on the surface without areal expansion. And then, V‐shaped wires were lifted up by expansion due to the formation of sodium tin compounds (Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>Sn, <i>x</i> &gt; 1), which induced the areal expansion. The V‐shaped zones were surrounded by boundaries which could be formed by the connection and growth of V‐shaped wires. By charging, contraction resulted in tensile stress and thus induced the division of Sn into several plates with visible cracks at the boundaries of V‐shaped zones. During repeated charge/discharge cycling, divided plates were joined together into one body via rebinding small Sn plates. In other words, the Sn foil pulverized into nanosized particles (protuberances) due to volume change during charge/discharge. The nanosized particles could assemble to big particles and arm of coral like structure due to the room temperature sintering.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202102618-bib-0027"><sup>27</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Coral like porous structure could be expanded and compressed without pulverization, and the others could be destroyed and reassembled. After repeated cycling, the stable porous structure was remained. The pulverization or cracking could be healed to robust stable porous structure during repeated cycling. We called this curing process, that is, the formation of stable porous structure, as self‐healing. Thus, the origin of the self‐healing of Sn could be related to the room temperature sintering, which should be due to the low melting temperature, ductility, and high electric conductivity of Sn. This self‐healing eventually afforded a very stable porous coral‐like morphology, providing stable long cycle life.</p><figure xml:id="smll202102618-fig-0005"><label>5</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202102618:smll202102618-fig-0005" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202102618-fig-0005-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>Schematic of morphological variation of Sn foil anode during cycling.</caption></figure><p>The rate performance of the Sn foil anode was explored in the region of 0.1–1.6 C, with the typical charge/discharge curves of this anode presented in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S9a</link>, Supporting Information.

The fabrication of composite electrodes involves many processes such as active material pulverization, mixing with binder, and conductive additive for slurry preparation, the pasting or casting of the slurry on the current collector, drying, and electrode cutting, whereas only rolling and cutting were required to prepare the Sn foil anode. Another advantage of metal foil electrodes is their high mass loading. As conventional electrodes contain powders, pressing is needed to increase the tap density and achieve high loadings. However, it is difficult to achieve a high tap density close to that of the bulk while maintaining the powder morphology of the anode material. Taken together, the above advantages allow one to decrease the battery cost and increase anode capacity (and hence, battery energy density). Finally, the Sn foil anode did not suffer from Na dendrite formation, which is the main problem of Na metal anodes. It is commonly thought that the poor cycle life of alloying‐type metal anodes (Sn, Bi, Sb, Si, etc.) originates from pulverization during sodiation/desodiation cycling. However, our data reveals that Sn foil alloying‐type anodes have a stable cycle life, despite repeated volume changes during charge/discharge cycling. Thus, we believe this will provide a new strategy for the development of alloying‐type anodes.</p></section><section xml:id="smll202102618-sec-0030"><title type="main">Conclusion</title><p>The developed Sn foil anode showed a high specific capacity of 692 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> and a coulombic efficiency of 99% during 100 cycles at 0.1 C, with a high areal specific capacity of 13.6 mAh cm<sup>−2</sup>.

The XRD patterns of the Sn foil anodes were obtained using an in situ X‐ray diffractometer (1.2 kW, PANalytical) instrument equipped with an Ar‐filled electrochemical cell with Be window, as illustrated in Figure <link href="#smll202102618-supitem-0001">S13</link>, Supporting Information. For optical microscopy imaging, pristine Sn foil was polished with sandpaper (grit size = 4000) and etched for 10 s in HNO<sub>3</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub>COOH/glycerol (1:3:5 volume ratio).</p></section></section></section></section><section xml:id="smll202102618-sec-0090" type="acknowledgments" numbered="no"><title type="main">Acknowledgements</title><p>C.K. and H.K. contributed equally to this work.
