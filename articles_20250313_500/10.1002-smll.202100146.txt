The rapid growth of LIB productions and usage, however, consistently threatens the price of raw materials such as lithium and cobalt.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0001 #smll202100146-bib-0002 #smll202100146-bib-0003"><sup>1–3</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Therefore, considerable research has been geared toward developing beyond lithium‐ion technologies, which expect to provide large energy‐to‐cost ratio. Given this background, sodium‐ion battery (SIB) received remarkable attention as one of the post LIB systems. It is expected that the utilization of Earth‐abundant sodium resources in well‐established alkali‐ion intercalation chemistry would potentially lower the cost of manufacturing cells with minimal sacrifice in the electrochemical performances.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0002 #smll202100146-bib-0004 #smll202100146-bib-0005"><sup>2,4,5</sup></link><sup>]</sup></p><p>The layered transition metal oxides have been studied extensively as cathode materials for SIBs, which consist of stacked sheets of MO<sub>6</sub> (M = transition metal elements) octahedra, thus forming 2D channels that allow intercalation/deintercalation of alkali cation. Depending on the stacking of oxygen sequence and environment of alkali cations, the layered structure can be classified by Delmas’ notation.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0006"><sup>6</sup></link><sup>]</sup> In general, the O3‐type layered structure is stable in the range of high sodium content (Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>MO<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 &lt; <i>x</i> &lt; 1.0), which is advantageous in achieving high coulombic efficiency at the initial cycle of the full cell. The flip side is that the O3‐type exhibits relatively lower reversible capacity and rate capability than those of P2‐type with similar composition, on account of constraints on sodium (Na) hopping between octahedral sites. Meanwhile, the P2‐type structure is stable when sodium content is in relatively lower (Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>MO<sub>2</sub>, 0.3 &lt; <i>x</i> &lt; 0.7) range. Notably, this P2‐type layered structure has high specific capacity and good rate capability because the face‐sharing prismatic sites provide a wider path for Na movement. Conversely, this low sodium content of P2‐type structure can be problematic in designing the full cell. It is because the small sodium reservoir at an initial state might lead to excess coulombic efficiency during the first cycle. More critically, at higher potential range (&gt;4.0 V), P2‐type layered structures generally undergo phase transitions to O2, OP4, or P2‐O2 intergrowth structures, thereby triggering structural deteriorations and rapid capacity decay. Furthermore, Mortemard de Boisse et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0007"><sup>7</sup></link><sup>]</sup> and Talaie et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0008"><sup>8</sup></link><sup>]</sup> reported a high voltage induced phase transition so called “Z” phase. Further studies have revealed that “Z” phase could be described as intergrowth structure of P‐ and O‐type stacking. Phase transition of P2‐type layered structure, whether to O2, OP4, or “Z” phase, involves a gliding of the transition metal layer, which can lead to formation of stacking faults after phase transition.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0009"><sup>9</sup></link><sup>]</sup> The repeated phase transition accompanied by formation of stacking faults and degradation of layered structure deteriorates the electrochemical performance of the cell. For above reasons, finding structurally stable P2‐layered compounds at the high potential range is a key factor for achieving high‐energy‐density cathode materials.</p><p>With this goal in mind, several studies have investigated that forming multiphase layered structure turns out to be an effective approach to achieve stable layered structure and electrochemical performance. As an example, Keller et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0010"><sup>10</sup></link><sup>]</sup> reported P3/P2/O3‐type multiphase layered oxide with outstanding electrochemical performance, in which coexistence of multiphase had synergetic effect on the electrochemical performance. Guo et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0011"><sup>11</sup></link><sup>]</sup> and Lee et al.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0012"><sup>12</sup></link><sup>]</sup> demonstrated P2/O3 intergrowth structure. These integrated multi‐phase layered transition‐metal oxides led to improved structural stability and electrochemical performance. Still, to this point, the most persistent barriers to achieve high performance SIB cathodes is finding a crystal structure that withholds phase transformation over wide potential range, which leads to stable cycling performance as well as large energy density.</p><p>Herein, we report a novel biphasic iron/manganese‐based layered oxide compound that addresses the chronic phase transformation of P2‐type layered structure during the battery cycling. By engaging synchrotron‐based structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we confirmed that the substitution of lithium at the transition metal sites generates P2/O3 biphasic layered structure. Most importantly, the transition metal ordering and the P2/O3 biphase that are induced by substitution of lithium (Li) minimized the phase transition throughout wide potential region. Absence of phase transition at both high potential and low potential region leads to a high specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling performance. Our findings suggest that stabilization of layered structure at both extents of potential range is the key to achieving superior phase stability and electrochemical performance.</p></section><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0020"><title type="main">Results and Discussion</title><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0030"><title type="main">Synthesis and Structural Analysis of P2‐Layered Compounds</title><p>From the electrochemical perspective of SIBs, both iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are attractive elements for composing layered transition metal oxides, on account of their low cost as well as modest toxicity.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0013 #smll202100146-bib-0014 #smll202100146-bib-0015"><sup>13–15</sup></link><sup>]</sup> The P2‐type layered transition metal oxide with Fe and Mn displayed relatively high operating potential by Fe<sup>3+/4+</sup> redox couple and large capacity by utilizing both Fe<sup>3+/4+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+/4+</sup> redox reaction. On the other hand, phase stability of P2‐type Fe/Mn‐based layered material is hindered by phase transition at high voltage region and Jahn–Teller distortion at low voltage region. As explained above, we have exploited formation of multiphase layered oxide by substitution of non‐transition metal element in order to minimize undesirable phase transition. In this exploration, we selected P2‐type Na<sub>0.67</sub>Fe<sub>0.25</sub>Mn<sub>0.75</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (P2‐FMO) as a model compound and conducted lithium doping at the transition metal sites, thus achieving Na<sub>0.67</sub>Li<sub>0.1</sub>Fe<sub>0.225</sub>Mn<sub>0.675</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (P2‐LFMO) and Na<sub>0.67</sub>Li<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (P2/O3‐LFMO). The lithium substitution increased from 0.0 to 0.2, while the total amount of Mn and Fe decreased from 1.0 to 0.8. Since the ratio between Fe and Mn is one of the key factors that affects phase transition behavior and electrochemical performance, the stoichiometric ratio of 1:3 for Fe and Mn was maintained constant for all three compounds on purpose to minimize the effect from the different Fe/Mn ratio.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0016 #smll202100146-bib-0017"><sup>16,17</sup></link><sup>]</sup> The final composition of samples were confirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP‐OES) analysis in Table <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S1</link>, Supporting Information, and detailed experimental procedures are summarized in the Experimental Section.</p><p>In terms of understanding structure–electrochemical property relationships, it is critical to understand the substitution site and configuration within a layered structure.

As mentioned, while P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO display pure P2‐type structure, P2/O3‐LFMO exhibits P2/O3 biphasic structure, which indicates that increasing substitution of lithium induced the formation of O3 phase. Based on previous reports, it is expected that the P2 and O3‐type structure of P2/O3‐LFMO formed intergrown composite.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0011 #smll202100146-bib-0012 #smll202100146-bib-0026"><sup>11,12,26</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Also, P2/O3‐LFMO showed more intense and sharp superstructure peaks, suggesting that the substituted lithium is located at the transition metal site more regularly. The superstructure and substitution site of lithium in the P2/O3‐LFMO were further confirmed by Rietveld refinement of NPD patterns (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0001">1c</link>). The occupancy of Mn, Fe, and lithium were refined in the three different transition metal sites. The pattern was best refined when the lithium is mostly located at Li3 site, whereas the Mn is mainly on Mn1 and Mn2 sites, displaying that Li is surrounded by Mn. The refined superstructure and its schematic illustration are provided in Table <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S4</link>, Supporting Information, and Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0001">1d</link>, respectively.</p><p>DFT calculations also confirmed that that the refined honeycomb‐ordered Li and Fe are energetically more stable than disordered cases (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S2</link>, Supporting Information). Interestingly, Figure <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S2</link>, Supporting Information, shows that the stability of the Li–Fe–Mn mixed phases are linearly correlated with the electrostatic energy of the system. It indicates that the cation ordering of lower‐charged species (Li and Fe) minimizes the electrostatic repulsion of the system, contributing to the formation of the superstructure in addition to the above‐mentioned ionic radius difference.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that all diffraction peaks in P2/O3‐LFMO have a sharp peak profile compared to the other cases, indicating the high crystallinity and less stacking faults. In comparison, P2‐FMO exhibited anisotropic full width at half maximum (FWHM) values: 0.111, 0.394, and 0.494 for (100), (102), and (104) peaks, respectively. It implies worse periodicity along the interlayer direction (<i>c</i>‐axis) compared to planar direction (<i>ab</i>‐plane), which can be attributed to strong presence of stacking faults in the P2‐type layered structure.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0013 #smll202100146-bib-0022"><sup>13,22</sup></link><sup>]</sup> In addition, based on the broadness of the (104) and (102) peaks compared to the (100) peak, the degree of stacking fault in P2‐LFMO seems less severe than P2‐FMO.

The relatively low initial charge capacity of the P2‐FMO can be attributed to low Na content and mixed oxidation state of as‐synthesized materials, as is often observed in P2‐type layered oxides. On the other hand, the redox reaction of transition metal elements could not solely explain the high initial charge capacity of the P2/O3‐LFMO, suggesting that other charge compensation and redox mechanism may be at play. The possible charge compensation and anion redox will be explored in a later section. The charge capacities and coulombic efficiencies are shown in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S3a–d</link>, Supporting Information. The P2‐FMO compound exhibited rapid capacity decay throughout the cycling (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2b</link>). The P2‐LFMO and P2/O3‐LFMO displayed relatively large capacity decline during the initial five cycles and became stabilized in the consecutive cycles. We suspect this initial capacity loss may be attributed to the irreversible oxygen evolution reaction or lithium extraction.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0027 #smll202100146-bib-0028"><sup>27,28</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Nonetheless, the P2/O3‐LFMO displayed superior cycling performance than the other samples (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2b</link>). P2/O3‐LFMO retained 158.7 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> capacity after 60 cycles, showing 83.5% capacity retention compared to the capacity of the 6th cycle, which is significantly higher than the capacity retention of P2‐FMO (5.4%) and P2‐LFMO (6.5%). Under a higher current density of 50 mA g<sup>−1</sup> (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S3a</link>, Supporting Information), P2/O3‐LFMO also performed excellent cycling stability, reaching 99.9% capacity retention during 120 cycles in reference to the capacity of 6th cycle.</p><figure xml:id="smll202100146-fig-0002"><label>2</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202100146:smll202100146-fig-0002" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202100146-fig-0002-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>a) The discharge profile of the first cycle of P2‐FMO, P2‐LFMO, and P2/O3‐LFMO. b) The discharge capacity of the cycle test at a constant current density of 10 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. c) Discharge capacity from rate capability test under current density from 10 up to 600 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. d) The discharge capacity of each sample under different cut‐off potential.

P2/O3‐LFMO compounds displayed outstanding rate performance, where the discharge capacity was preserved as much as 73 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> when the current was increased to 60 folds (600 mA g<sup>−1</sup>). Meanwhile, both P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO displayed less than 10 mAh g<sup>–1</sup>, as the current rate increased to higher than 200 and 400 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. It should be noted that the capacity retention in these results is affected by both cycle stability and rate capability. Even with excluding the cyclic degradation as described in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S3b</link>, Supporting Information, P2/O3‐LFMO exhibited better rate performance than the other electrodes. This result is rather unexpected since the O3 phase often displays slower kinetics than the P2 phase in terms of the sodium ion migration.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0029 #smll202100146-bib-0030"><sup>29,30</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Our outcomes indicate that incorporating a marginal O3 phase did not deteriorate but instead improved the rate capability of the P2/O3‐LFMO electrode. We strongly suspect the increased rate capability of P2/O3‐LFMO is resulted from improvement in structural properties such as phase transition behavior and structure stability, even if the O3 phase may hinder the intercalation of sodium. The underlying mechanism of improved electrochemical performance by incorporating the O3 phase are discussed in the forthcoming sections.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that pure P2‐type layered structures are prone to structural degradation, on account of phase changes at the high potential range. Hence, we performed galvanostatic measurements with different cut‐off potentials (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2d</link>), in order to determine the high potential stability. As shown in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2a</link>, the initial specific capacity with cut‐off potential of 4.5V is more or less the same for three samples; however, when the cut‐off potential is set to 4.0 V (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2d</link>), the specific capacity was P2‐FMO &gt; P2‐LFMO &gt; P2/O3‐LFMO in its decreasing order. It indicates that less sodium ions were (de)intercalated in P2/O3‐LFMO at this potential range (1.5–4.0 V); that is, the P2/O3‐LFMO has a higher redox potential. This result reflects the successful incorporation of Li since the substitution of transition metals with Li increases the oxidation state of transition metals and thus elevates the average redox potential.</p><p>When the charge cut‐off voltage was increased to 4.2 V, all samples exhibited increased specific capacities. Apparently, increment of the cut‐off voltage resulted in further extraction of sodium at high potential region. Therefore, capacity increment with raising the cut‐off voltage is noticeable in P2/O3‐LFMO which has lower sodium utilization below 4.2 V.</p><p>As the charge cut‐off voltage was further increased to 4.5 V, noteworthy changes were observed in the trends for capacity retention and voltage profile. We confirmed severe capacity decay for both P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO, implying that the stability of P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO was significantly diminished at the high voltage range of 4.2–4.5V. To our surprise, P2/O3‐LFMO compound consistently exhibited stable capacity even at higher cut‐off voltages. In the voltage range of 4.2–4.5 V, we confirmed a gradual capacity increment up to 137.5 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> during the initial few cycles. A proposed explanation for this observation is that the layer structure experiences gradual activation of redox reaction by further extraction of sodium without experiencing structure degradation.</p><p>The P2/O3‐LFMO compound still maintained stable capacity retention even after adjusting the voltage to 4.2 V, preserving 84.5 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> after 100 cycles. From these potential‐wise electrochemical measurements, it was confirmed that the capacity decay of the P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO observed in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2b</link> is attributed to the high voltage operation. Furthermore, the result provides an insight that substitution of lithium and formation of biphasic structure can be a key to resolve electrochemical performance degradation at high voltage region. The phase transition behavior and structure stability at the high voltage range will be further analyzed and discussed in the later sections.</p></section><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0050"><title type="main">In Situ Synchrotron Powder X‐Ray Diffraction Analysis</title><p>In order to reveal the phase transition and identify the role of the biphasic structure and lithium substitution, we conducted in situ XRD analysis. <b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0003"><b>3a</b></link> displays in situ XRD patterns of P2‐FMO during the first cycle. The peaks derived from P2‐type layered structure — (002), (100), and (102) — are clearly identified at the initial state. The gradual shift of (100) and (102) peaks toward a high angle during the charging process indicates a decrease in lattice parameter <i>a</i> (=<i>b</i>), which reflects the oxidation of transition metals. The (002) peak at around 16° slightly shifted toward a low angle with the deinsertion of sodium. As deinsertion of sodium continues, however, its behavior changes in two aspects: the peak splits into two and its evolution begins at high voltage. As the voltage reached close to 4.5 V, the (002) peak correlated with the P2‐type structure decreased significantly, while a new peak was observed around 17–18<sup>°</sup>. The occurrence of a new phase can be identified as the “Z” phase, corresponding with previous study.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0016"><sup>16</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Phase transition of P2 to “Z” phase occurs by slab gliding in the layered structure. Similar to P2–O2 phase transition, the slab gliding in P2‐“Z” phase transition occurs randomly in two different directions, resulting in stacking faults as cycles are repeated. Therefore, this phase transition at a high voltage region can deteriorate the original crystal structure and electrochemical performances. This in situ XRD data agrees well with the abrupt capacity decay of the P2‐FMO after operating at high voltage (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2d</link>). In addition, we also confirmed a peak around 37.2<sup>°</sup>, which reflects the formation of P'2‐type layered structure, at low voltage (i.e., highly sodiated) region. The P'2‐type structure is a distorted form of P2‐type layered structure and the formation of P'2‐type structure provides the solid evidence of undergoing Jahn–Teller distortion by Mn<sup>3+</sup>.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0007 #smll202100146-bib-0013 #smll202100146-bib-0031"><sup>7,13,31</sup></link><sup>]</sup> The P2‐“Z” phase transition at high voltage region and the formation of distorted structure at low voltage region potentially resulted in low cycling performance of the P2‐FMO compound.</p><figure xml:id="smll202100146-fig-0003"><label>3</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202100146:smll202100146-fig-0003" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202100146-fig-0003-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>In situ SPXRD patterns, voltage profile, and corresponding structure change of a) P2‐FMO during first cycle and b) P2/O3‐LFMO during first and second cycles.

Notably, in contrast to the P2‐FMO case, we could not find any indications of a new phase such as O2‐, OP4, or “Z” phases in the entire potential range. While the peak intensities of the P2 phase were decreased in charging, they restored during the discharge process, demonstrating the reversible nature of the biphasic structure. To further confirm the phase stability of P2/O3‐LFMO, in situ XRD analysis was continued to consecutive cycle. Again, there was no indication of phase transition of P2 phase at both high voltage ad low voltage regions. Our result suggests that the stability window of P2‐type layered structure in P2/O3‐LFMO was widened, which is in accordance with previous studies where substitution of lithium stabilized P2‐type layered structure over wide potential range.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0018"><sup>18</sup></link><sup>]</sup> The absence of new peaks corresponding to the “Z” phase implies that the gliding of the transition metal layer has been prevented at the charged state. Also, the absence of the P'2 phase at the discharged state indicates that the Jahn–Teller active species, such as Mn<sup>3+</sup> were disappeared. As discussed in the previous section, substitution of Mn with Li increases the oxidation state of remaining Mn to 4+, decreasing the number of the Mn<sup>3+</sup> at deeply discharged state.</p><p>For the O3‐phase in the P2/O3‐LFMO, the corresponding (104) peak shifted to higher angle during initial charge process, indicating deintercalation of sodium and oxidation of transition metals. The peak intensity deceased as voltage increased, making it difficult to determine phase transition behavior of the O3 phase at high voltage region. Notably, previous reports have recognized that the lithium substitution in the O3 phase could minimize the O3‐P3‐O'3 phase transition which occurs at the high voltage region.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0019 #smll202100146-bib-0032 #smll202100146-bib-0033 #smll202100146-bib-0034"><sup>19,32–34</sup></link><sup>]</sup> Based on the previous reports, we suspect that the lithium substitution in the P2/O3‐LFMO could minimize the phase instability of the O3 phase. The (104) peak of the O3 phase was restored during discharge in the low voltage region (&lt;2.0 V) with reversible peak shift. The (104) peak showed similar peak shift and intensity change in the consecutive cycle as well. The reversible changes of the O3 phase imply that the O3‐type structure also participates in the intercalation of sodium ion and that the biphasic structure was stable throughout cycling. In the case where sodium content is high, the O3 phase in the biphasic structure could function as a sodium ion reservoir at the low voltage region.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0010 #smll202100146-bib-0011"><sup>10,11</sup></link><sup>]</sup> The in situ XRD verifies reversible shift of (104) peak at low voltage region, supporting that O3 phase may potentially accommodate sodium ions. As a result, the O3 phase prevented the formation of the distorted P'2 phase by accommodating sodium ions instead of the P2 phase at the low voltage region. Overall, we predict a cooperative role of the O3 phase in intercalating within the biphasic structure, specifically minimizing the structure distortion at low voltage regions, which would be the cause of additional structural stability of P2/O3‐LFMO.</p></section><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0060"><title type="main">Density Functional Theory Calculations of Layered Structure with Lithium</title><p>Our findings in the in situ XRD analysis highlight the excellent structural stability of P2/O3‐LFMO at high potential range. This observation is in line with the potential‐wise electrochemical data (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0002">2d</link>), which suggests the enhancement of cycle stability at the high potential region by the Li substitution. In order to understand how lithium substitution regulates the transition metal ordering at a highly charged state, we performed DFT calculations and investigated correlation with Na–Li distance.</p><p>As in P2/O3‐LFMO case, when Na‐ions are in the interlayer space, they experience electrostatic repulsion from the neighboring cations in the transition metal layer. Therefore, it is anticipated that the Na‐ions prefer to be placed near the Li‐ions rather than the higher‐valanced transition metals. In this direction, we calculated the total energy of the system and compared with the distance between Na and Li (<b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0004"><b>4a</b></link>). The obtained result exhibits a tendency that the closer the Na–Li distance is, the more stable the system energy is at a highly charged state (<i>x</i> = 0.16 at Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>MO<sub>2</sub>). The most stable atomic structure, corresponding to the result marked by arrow, is displayed in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0004">4b</link>, where the Li in the transition metal layer and Na in the interlayer are closely located with each other, forming Na–vacancy–Li and Na–Li–Na pairs. This pairing of monovalent ions across the transition metal layer is commonly observed in the layered‐type metal oxides.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0035 #smll202100146-bib-0036 #smll202100146-bib-0037"><sup>35–37</sup></link><sup>]</sup> It can be seen in a way that the Li‐ions in the transition metal layer anchor the Na‐ions, preventing the depletion of Na in the interlayer. In consideration of the phase transformation to the “Z” phase at high voltage region, which is accompanied by a gliding of the transition metal layers after the depletion of interlayer Na‐ions, the anchoring of Na‐ions by the substituted Li is advantageous for retaining the original crystal structure. Furthermore, as identified by the neutron diffraction and DFT calculations, the substituted Li‐ions generate a honeycomb ordering in the transition metal layer. This specific ordering makes the Li‐ions and thereby the anchored Na‐ions dispersed uniformly within the structure; therefore, gliding of transition metal layer could be diminished effectively. Our findings suggest that the pairing of monovalent ions along with ordered distribution of Li in the transition metal layer is the key to preventing phase transformation and stabilizing layered structure.</p><figure xml:id="smll202100146-fig-0004"><label>4</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202100146:smll202100146-fig-0004" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202100146-fig-0004-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>a) Total energy of the system as a function of the distance between Na and Li ions. b) The Li–vacancy–Na and Na–Li–Na pairs in the most stable atomic structure (corresponding to the arrow in Figure 4a).

In the P2‐FMO sample, the discharge profiles were similar under different cut‐off potentials, suggesting that the discharge reaction is identical regardless of the cut‐off potential. On the other hand, the voltage profile of the P2/O3‐LFMO showed noticeable change when the cut‐off potential was 4.5 V: The overall voltage profile was extended with increasing the cut‐off potential, while the discharge voltage between 3.0 and 4.5 V was decreased compared to the lower cut‐off potential cases as denoted with an arrow in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0004">4c</link>. The change in discharge voltage can be further confirmed by comparing the dQ/dV plot (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-supitem-0001">S4</link>, Supporting Information). Since the voltage is the free energy difference between charged and discharged phases, a relatively lower output voltage indicates that the charged phase becomes stable. It can be stated that the cation ordering, which stabilizes the desodiated phase as shown in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0004">4a</link>, possibly lowered the cell voltage as observed in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0004">4d</link>.</p><p>As discussed in the previous section, the high initial charge capacity of P2/O3‐LFMO exceeds the capacity that could be explained by the transition metal oxidation reaction of Na<sub>0.67</sub>Li<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting the possibility of charge compensation by oxygen redox.</p><p><b>Figure</b> <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005"><b>5</b></link> shows averaged net magnetic moments and density of states (DOS) of the P2/O3‐LFMO model structure (Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>Li<sub>1/6</sub>Fe<sub>1/6</sub>Mn<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) with varying sodium content (<i>x</i>). At a high sodium content (from <i>x</i> = 1.0 to 0.67 in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005">5a</link>), the magnetic moment of Mn was altered from 3.54 to 3.12 during the dissociation process, indicating that Mn plays a major redox center at this stage. The disappearance of the occupied Mn states near the Fermi level after charging from <i>x</i> = 1.0 (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005">5b</link>) to <i>x</i> = 0.67 (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005">5c</link>) consistently demonstrate the oxidation of Mn. In the intermediate charging stage (from <i>x</i> = 0.67 to 0.16), O and Fe lose their electrons as evidenced by the evolved unoccupied states of O and Fe (arrow in Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005">5d</link>) as well as significant net moment changes from 4.29 to 3.43(Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005">5a</link>). During this stage, the variation of the net moment of O (decrease by 0.17) is smaller than that of Fe (decrease by 0.86); however, the contribution of O to the redox process is higher than that of Fe due to its larger number of atoms per formula unit (i.e., multiplicity). At a deeply charged state with low sodium content (from <i>x</i> = 0.16 to 0.0), the net moment of O was further decreased (enlarged in negative), but the net moments of Mn and Fe were rather increased. This suggests that the majority (up) spin electrons moved from O to Mn and Fe. Such charge compensation phenomena can be examined with more details using the DOS analysis. On the charging from <i>x</i> = 0.16 (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005">5d</link>) to <i>x</i> = 0.0 (Figure <link href="#smll202100146-fig-0005">5e</link>), the unoccupied states of Mn and Fe near the Fermi level were almost unchanged, while only the unoccupied up‐spin state of O was increased by ≈44%. It indicates that the up‐spin electrons were transferred from O to Mn and Fe, decreasing the net moment of O and increasing the net moment of Mn and Fe. These results suggest that the oxygen redox is contributing to the electrochemical reaction of P2/O3‐LFMO, providing possible explanation for its high initial charge capacity.</p><figure xml:id="smll202100146-fig-0005"><label>5</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource href="urn:x-wiley:16136810:media:smll202100146:smll202100146-fig-0005" alt="image"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/smll202100146-fig-0005-m.png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>a) Net magnetic moments of Fe, Mn, and O in the P2/O3‐LFMO at various Na contents (<i>x</i>) in model structure (Na<i><sub>x</sub></i>Li<sub>1/6</sub>Fe<sub>1/6</sub>Mn<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). b–e) Density of states near the Fermi level when Na content (<i>x</i>) is b) 1.0, c) 0.67, d) 0.16, and e) 0.0.

By increasing the concentration of lithium doping at the transition metal site, we confirmed formation of a honeycomb ordering of the substituted lithium and the stable P2/O3 biphasic structure. The extensive structure–electrochemical relationship studies uncovered that the biphasic structure and lithium substitution effectively minimizes the critical Jahn–Teller distortion at the low potential region. Moreover, in the highly charged state, the honeycomb ordering of lithium limits the P2–”Z” phase transition by the formation of monovalent ion pairings (Na–vac–Li and Na–Li–Na pairing) coupled with the uniform distribution of honeycomb ordered Li‐ions. Both the P2/O3 biphasic structure and honeycomb ordering of lithium induce suppression of structure change, eventually avoiding phase transition and performance degradation. We conclude that lithium substituted biphasic structure is an effective approach to improve the phase stability as well as achieving high electrochemical performance.</p></section><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0080"><title type="main">Experimental Section</title><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0090" numbered="no"><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0100" numbered="no"><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0110" numbered="no"><title type="main">Synthesis of Active Materials</title><p>Active materials with substituted Li were synthesized by a simple solid‐state method from Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (ACS reagent, anhydrous, Sigma–Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (99+%, Junsei, Tokyo, Japan), Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (97%, Sigma–Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Sigma–Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) powders as precursors.

In situ synchrotron XRD data for the operating batteries were obtained at the 3D‐XRS and 6D‐C&amp;S beamline of PAL at a wavelength of 1.0334 Å. 2D patterns were converted to 1D XRD patterns with the Fit2D program. For in situ observations of battery cells, modified CR2032 coin cells with holes in the center covered with polyimide films were used. A LaB<sub>6</sub> standard reference material (NIST SRM 660c, Sigma–Aldrich) was used for calibration. Diffraction data were collected every few minutes while the in situ cell was cycled under a current density of 25 mA g<sup>−1</sup> with an SP‐200 potentiostat (Biologic) in constant charge mode during charge and discharge processes. Rietveld refinements of the SPXRD, NPD, and in situ SPXRD data were performed using the refinement program GSAS with EXPGUI.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0038 #smll202100146-bib-0039"><sup>38,39</sup></link><sup>]</sup></p></section><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0140" numbered="no"><title type="main">Density Functional Theory Calculation</title><p>DFT calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional with the projector augmented wave method as implemented in the VASP software.<sup>[</sup><link href="#smll202100146-bib-0040 #smll202100146-bib-0041 #smll202100146-bib-0042"><sup>40–42</sup></link><sup>]</sup> The plane‐wave basis set with an energy cut‐off of 520 eV and the gamma centered k‐point mesh with a grid spacing of 0.03 A<sup>−1</sup> were used.

The experimentally refined crystal structure was used as an input geometry and it was expanded to 2 × 2 × 1 supercell to explore the sodium‐ion ordering at charged states. All possible sodium‐ion configurations were generated and sampled on the basis of the Ewald summation of the system. Electrostatically, the most stable 20 cases were used to figure out the ground state structure, and more unstable 20 cases were additionally compared to identify the correlation between electrostatic energy and total energy of the system.</p></section></section></section></section><section xml:id="smll202100146-sec-0150" type="acknowledgments" numbered="no"><title type="main">Acknowledgements</title><p>J.E.W. and H.K. contributed equally to this work.
