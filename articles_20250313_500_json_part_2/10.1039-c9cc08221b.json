                "The rapid growth of the usage of fossil energy, along with the massive emissions of green-house gas, has become a global challenge. The development of large-scale energy storage technologies is one of the critical factors for the widespread application of renewable energies due to their intermittency in time and space. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as ideal technologies for large-scale energy storage because of the abundant and inexpensive sodium resources. The exploration of suitable electrode materials, especially the anode materials, is a critical issue for the application of SIBs. Extensive investigations into anode materials have focused on carbonaceous materials and alloy materials, such as hard carbon, graphene sheets, hard–soft composite carbon, and Si–Sb alloy. Among them, hard carbon is the most promising candidate, since it was first reported by Dahn's group in 2000. In the early times, hard carbon showed a low reversible capacity with low initial coulombic efficiency. Recent efforts have greatly enhanced its reversible capacity and cycling stability. Nevertheless, challenges, such as high-cost and poor rate capability, still exist and hinder its practical application in SIBs. Nano-sized hard carbons are reported to possess excellent electrochemical performance, owing to the sufficient contact between the electrolyte and electrode and short Na+ ion diffusion path. However, the large surface area causes serious side reactions with the electrolyte, which leads to a low Coulombic efficiency and capacity decay. On the other hand, micro hard carbon materials with lower surface areas often show high initial Coulombic efficiency, but the long Na+ ion diffusion path results in a low rate performance. To incorporate the advantages of both nano- and micro-size materials, a micro-nano structure was proposed as an effective strategy.",
                "Three different sodium storage processes in hard carbon have been proposed: adsorption on the surface-active sites, intercalation into graphitic layers, and filling into nanopores. However, there is still a lack of consensus on the assignment of each voltage region to the corresponding sodium storage modes and the unclear mechanism results in difficultly in tuning the electrochemical behavior of hard carbon. Dahn et al. proposed a two-step mechanism. The slope region was ascribed to interlayer intercalation, while the plateau below 0.1 V was due to Na+ filling into nanopores. Ji and Cao et al. proposed an adsorption–insertion mechanism, in which the sloping part in the voltage profile was ascribed to sodium adsorption on the defect sites and the low-voltage plateau was attributed to sodium intercalation into the graphitic layers. Recently, Grey et al. found that the sodium inserted in the slope range is ionic in nature, which corresponds to ions adsorbing onto near defects, and at the plateau voltage, the ions gradually become more metallic and form quasi-metallic sodium clusters in an angstrom level, which is different from the bulk metallic sodium. It can be clearly seen that the main disagreement of the sodium storage mechanism is whether the low-voltage plateau belongs to metallic sodium formation or sodium intercalation into the graphitic layers.",
                "Herein, the biomass of kapok fibers with natural hollow tube structures was selected as a precursor to prepare hard carbon with a micro-nano structure through a two-step pyrolysis method at 1200 °C (1200HCMNT) or 1400 °C (1400HCMNT), which have been suggested as the most suitable carbonizing temperatures. As expected, the carbonized products exhibited an excellent sodium storage performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency, high reversible capacity, and excellent rate capability. To further understand the sodium storage mechanisms in the hard carbon materials, multiple characterization tools, such as galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and the thermal analysis technique, were applied to investigate the sodium insertion/extraction process.",
                "The kapok fibers show a hollow type structure with a diameter of 15–20 μm and a wall thickness of 0.8–1 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†). During the carbonization, the kapok fibers underwent aromatization, polycondensation, and the formation of short graphite layers. The morphology remains well with merely a shrink in the diameter of 5–10 μm and wall thickness of about 200 nm (Fig. 1a). Compared to bulk hard carbon, the micron tube structure is considered to facilitate liquid electrolyte diffusion and give little contribution to total special surface area. Moreover, nano-sized wall thickness can reduce the solid-state diffusion length for Na+. Fig. 1b shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms for the HCMNTs. With increasing carbonization temperature, the specific surface area of the HCMNTs decreases gradually, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The small specific surface area is expected to reduce the SEI formation and improve the initial Coulombic efficiency. The element species and distribution of 1400HCMNT obtained from the XPS and EDS results are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Compared to other biomass-derived carbons, the HCMNTs show high purity of carbon with only traces of Si and Al. The C1s peak of 1400HCMNT (Fig. S2, ESI†) is deconvoluted into a major peak of C–C (sp2) at 284.8 eV and three weak peaks of C–C (sp) at 285.2 eV, C–O at 286.2 eV, and CO at 288.3 eV, which indicates the high carbon-content. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1c) of both samples present a highly disordered nature. Two broad diffraction peaks of the (002) and (100) planes can be attributed to the presence of small graphene-like layers. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the interlayer spacing (d002) of HCMNTs is in the range of 0.38–0.39 nm, which is larger than that of graphite (0.335 nm). The Lc values, calculated via the Scherrer equation using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) information of the (002) plane, decrease with the increase of carbonization temperature. The Raman spectra (Fig. 1d) of both the carbonized samples exhibit two peaks of the D band (the defect-induced band) at 1327 cm−1 and G band (the crystalline graphite band) at 1587 cm−1. Along with the increase of the carbonization temperature, the relative integrated intensity ID/IG ratios increase, and the crystallite size La values decrease (Table S1, ESI†), indicating the transformation of interior defect concentration and the crystals shrink for the (100) direction at higher carbonization temperatures. The microstructure analysis is further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1e and f, both samples display non-graphitized structure. A gradual development of local graphitic structure and diffraction rings are observed in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns with increasing treatment temperatures.",
                "Galvanostatic discharge–charge experiments were carried out to evaluate the sodium storage behavior of the HCMNT samples. Electrolyte of NaClO4 or NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 w/w) is assessed, as shown in Fig. S3 and Note S1 (ESI†). Finally, 1 M NaClO4 in EC/DMC was used in further research, for higher coulombic efficiency and better cycling performance. As shown in Fig. 2a, the two HCMNT samples show similar sodium storage behaviors with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of ∼80%, attributed to the low specific surface areas. The charge–discharge profiles exhibit two distinct parts: slope areas above 0.1 V and a plateau region around 0–0.1 V, indicating two different sodium storage mechanisms, which is also verified by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results (Fig. S4, ESI†). The reversible capacity of 1400HCMNT is 292.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, much higher than that of the 1200HCMNT (228 mA h g−1). The higher capacity of 1400HCMNT may benefit from the lower specific surface area and more closing pores, resulting from the higher treatment temperature. The HCMNTs possess excellent rate capability, because of the uniform hollow micro-nano structure with shorter diffusion distance of the Na-ion and better infiltration of electrolyte (Fig. 2b). 1400HCMNT shows better rate performance with a reversible specific capacity of 250, 224, and 167 mA h g−1 at the current rate of 0.5, 1, and 2C, respectively. To understand the capacity decline at high rates, discharge curves and the slope/plateau region contribution of 1400HCMNT at different current densities are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). With increasing charge–discharge rates, the plateau capacity declines rapidly and the slope capacity is well preserved. Compared with the previously reported hard carbon materials, 1400HCMNT exhibits a comparable rate performance with nanostructure materials, such as hollow carbon nanowires synthesized by hollow polyaniline nanowires (Fig. S7, ESI†). 1400HCMNT reveals a superior capacity retention ratio, among the biomass-based hard carbon materials. Fig. 2c shows the cycling performance of HCMNTs. After 200 cycles, the capacity retentions are higher than 93%, which is attributed to the stable micro-nano structure. The electrochemical properties in a full cell were also tested with Na2MnFe(CN)6 as the cathode. However, the performance still needs to be further improved (Fig. S8, and Note S2, ESI†).",
                "To understand the sodium storage behavior in HCMNTs, especially the contribution at the low-voltage plateau, XPS, EPR, Raman, HR-TEM, and DSC measurements were applied for the samples at different states. Fig. 3a shows the quasi-open circuit voltage (Q-OCV) plots of the 1200HCMNT and 1400HCMNT. There is no noticeable difference for the low-voltage plateau region, indicating that the sodium storage mechanism at the low-voltage plateau is independent of the treatment temperature.",
                "Fig. 3b shows the Na 1s XPS spectra for the 1400HCMNT at different states. A small broad peak in the Na 1s spectrum of the pristine electrode is contributed by the CMC binder (Na+ at 1071.2 eV). When the electrode was discharged to 0.1 V, a strong peak ascribed to the ionic sodium ions (1071.2 eV) can be observed, which is suggestive of the solid electrode interface (SEI) components (such as Na2CO3, NaC2H3O2, NaClO3 and NaCl, with the significant Na and Cl signals in the EDS mapping, Fig. S10 and Note S3, ESI†) and adsorbed sodium ions. When discharged to 0 V, the Na 1s peak shifts to a higher binding energy (1071.8 eV) and approaches the bond energy of sodium metal, suggesting the formation of metallic sodium. To further confirm the formation of metallic sodium, EPR, a powerful technique to detect unpaired electrons, was applied. For comparison, the EPR spectra of the 1400HCMNT electrode after plating sodium metal (Fig. S11, ESI†) were also collected (Fig. 3c), which contain two parts: a symmetrical broad line and an asymmetrical narrow peak. The broad line, which fits the Lorentz line shape and follows Curie magnetism, belongs to the Carbon center free radicals and delocalized electrons, which can be ascribed to the complex components of the SEI films. The narrow peak centred at the g-value of 2.002, conforms to the Dysonian asymmetry shape in the small line asymmetry parameter A/|B| (the absolute ratio of the maximum to the minimum signal). It suggested the existence of a metallic bond, as observed in lithium-ion batteries, demonstrating the formation of metallic sodium. The pristine 1400HCMNT electrode has no obvious signal in the EPR spectra except a little structural defect signal, since the highly pure carbon shows no carbon-center free radical and delocalized electron. After being discharged to 0.1 V, the EPR spectra are dominated by a symmetrical broad peak. However, when discharged to 0 V, an obvious narrow peak centred at g = 2.002 can be observed, demonstrating the formation of metallic sodium. Compared to the spectra of bulk sodium metal, the sharp peak belonging to the electrochemically formed metallic sodium shows a higher g-value, which could be attributed to the small size of metallic sodium, like metallic sodium clusters reported by K. Gotoh and C. Grey et al. Further TEM and Raman characterizations also verify that no prominent insertion into the graphitic layers was observed, as discussed in detail in the ESI† (Fig. S12, S13 and Table S3, ESI†). The 1200HCMNT shows a similar sodium storage mechanism to 1400HCMNT, so only the mechanism studies on 1400HCMNT are shown in the manuscript. More results of 1200HCMNT are shown in Note S4 in the ESI.†",
                "These results and analyses demonstrate that the sodiation process can be divided into ionic state and metallic state storage (Fig. 4). Above 0.1 V (slope region), sodium is stored in the hard carbon in the ionic state, such as adsorbing on the defects or surface of the graphene sheets. At the low voltage range plateau, metallic sodium clusters or domains form in the nanopores of hard carbon. The aforementioned EPR results and previously reported NMR results confirmed the formation of metallic sodium in hard carbon after being discharged to 0 V. However, metallic sodium was barely detected by other characterization techniques, such as XRD or Raman. This may result from the small size of metallic sodium. The DSC measurements in the temperature range of −20 to 200 °C under Argon flow with samples at different sodium storage voltages were employed. As shown in Fig. 3d, only a small exothermic peak for PTFE binder at 23 °C can be seen in the DSC profile of the pristine electrode, indicating the thermal stability of the carbon material and binder. The melting phenomena can be easily detected in the hard carbon with plating sodium at 98 °C. For the samples discharged to 0.1 and 0 V, no peak at ∼98 °C can be observed. However, the two samples experienced a low voltage plateau (the sample discharged to 0 V and the hard carbon with plating sodium) exhibiting an endothermic peak at around 2 °C, which could be ascribed to the melting of metallic sodium clusters. The Kelvin equation suggested that the melting point of a metal would greatly decrease with the reduction in particle size. Therefore, the electrochemically formed metallic sodium clusters or domains in the hard carbon may be in a quasi-liquid state at room-temperature. It can be well explained that the electrochemically formed metallic sodium is hardly detected by crystallographic characterization techniques.",
                "In summary, HCMNTs with a micro-nano structure were synthesized from hollow Kapok fibers. The 1400HCMNT sample delivers high reversible capacity, high initial coulombic efficiency, and excellent rate performance. The nano-sized tube walls bring good infiltration of electrolyte, shorten the diffusion distance of sodium-ions, and enhance the rate capacity of the HCMNTs. Combining EPR with thermal analysis, the sodium storage mechanisms in the HCMNT were also investigated. Sodium is stored in the hard carbon in the ionic state in the slope region and metallic sodium state in the low-voltage plateau. Moreover, the physical state of metallic sodium in the hard carbon could be quasi-liquid at room temperature. These results will guide the design of high-performance hard carbon anode materials for SIBs.",
