                "O3-type layered oxides are considered ideal cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities, but these materials undergo complex phase transitions during the Na+ extraction and insertion, resulting in serious structural degradation and reduced cycling stability. Herein, we employ “Cu/Mg co-doping strategy” to synthesize a stable O3-type layered transition metal oxide NaNi0.25Cu0.1Mg0.05Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (NaNCMFMO) with excellent structural reversibility. The resulting NaNCMFMO achieves reversible specific capacity of 123 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and remarkable improvement in capacity retention of 79.4 % over 300 cycles at 1.0 C, compared to the pristine NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 cathode (42.1 % retention after 300 cycles). Additionally, ex situ X-ray diffraction pattern of NaNCMFMO indicates a highly reversible phase evolution of O3-P3-O3 during charge/discharge cycles, and GITT measurements reveal faster Na+ diffusion kinetics. Moreover, a NaNCMFMO//hard carbon full-cell battery exhibits superior electrochemical performance: a high reversible specific capacity of 105.1 mAh g−1 at 1.0 C and capacity retention of 81.1 % over 200 cycles. This work presents a facile and effective strategy to suppress structural degradation in O3-type layered cathodes materials of high-performance SIBs."

                "The growing demand for energy storage has prompted the exploration of alternative storage systems to supplement traditional rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and address the rapid rise in global energy consumption , . Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant attention as promising candidates for energy storage owing to the characteristic of low cost, abundant raw materials, and environmental friendliness , . Cathode materials, as the important component of SIBs, are critical in determining the specific capacity and voltage range, making the development of advanced cathode materials essential for enhancing battery performance .",
                "Among various candidates, layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, where TM represents transition metals) have become the most potential cathode materials as a result of their ease of preparation, diverse compositions, and excellent electrochemical activity , , . Currently, NaxTMO2 materials can be classified into P2 and O3 types, in which O3-type layered oxide materials possess higher initial sodium content and Coulombic efficiency compared to P2-type. These obvious advantages enable O3-type materials more suitable for high energy density storage applications , , . However, most of them experience irreversible phase transitions and substantial structural degradation during cycling, resulting in poor cycling stability , , , .",
                "To address these issues and develop advanced materials, considerable efforts have been devoted to mitigating the multistage phase transition and preventing the rapid capacity fading. Elemental doping strategies were proved to be particularly effective , , , , , , . For instance, Sun et al. developed a layered oxide cathode Na0.912Ca0.048Ni0.320Fe0.333Mn0.330O2, by doping with the inactive Ca2+ ions in the sodium layer, slightly expanding interlayer spacing to facilitate Na+ diffusion . The Ca-substituted cathode exhibits improved cycling stability, delivering a reversible specific capacity of 116.3 mAh g−1 with 92 % capacity retention over 200 cycles. Zhou et al. reported a P3-Na0.65Li0.2Co0.05Mn0.75O2 cathode by substitution Co ions in transition metal layers to realize the reversible Mn2+/Mn4+ redox, which achieves a high discharge capacity and excellent cycling stability . Wang et al. reported a low-Ni, Co-free layered cathode, NaNi0.2Fe0.2Mn0.35Cu0.05Zn0.1Sn0.1O2, in which Cu, Zn, and Sn elements not only stabilized valence states but also enhanced charge localization to prevent interlayer slipping. Finally, this high-entropy cathode demonstrates zero volumetric strain and highly reversible phase evolution .",
                "Recent studies have shown that Mg doping can stabilize the crystal structure of layered transition metal oxides, suppress phase transitions, and enhance structural reversibility during cycling , . Meanwhile, Mg substitution increases interlayer spacing and reduce the lattice strain, which effectively accelerates Na+ diffusion and enhances the rate capability . Mishra. et. al demonstrated that Mg-doped Na0.7Ni0.3Mn0.5Mg0.1Fe0.1O2 cathodes exhibit an enhanced cycle performance and rate capability by stabilizing the layered structure using Mg2+ to substitute Mn3+ . Similarly, Zhang et. al synthesized a Mg-substituted O3-type cathode material, NaMn0.48Ni0.2Fe0.3Mg0.02O2, achieving improved electrochemical performance . Although significant progresses have been made with Mg-doped layered oxide cathodes, non-toxic and low-cost transition metals co-doping requires further research to develop more advanced cathode materials.",
                "Herein, we present a Mg/Cu co-doping strategy to fabricate an O3-type NiFeMn-based layered transition metal oxide (NaNi0.25Cu0.1Mg0.05Fe0.2Mn0.4O2, NaNCMFMO) by simultaneously incorporating Cu2+ and Mg2+ ions into the transition metal layers. In this study, a series of contrast oxides, including pristine NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (NaNFMO), Cu2+ ions doped NaNi0.3Cu0.1Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (NaNCFMO) were also synthesized. Accordingly, we systematically investigate the effects of Cu and Cu/Mg ions co-doping on the crystal structures, morphologies, and electrochemical performance of various oxides. In the NaNCMFMO, the Cu ions serve as charge compensators to increase the specific capacity, while Mg ions stabilize the structure and enhance the structural reversibility, and the reversible O3-P3 phase transition during Na+ extraction and insertion is verified by ex situ XRD. Eventually, the O3-type NaNCMFMO achieves a reversible specific capacity of 123 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, with capacity retention of 79.4 %@300 cycles at 1.0 C from 2.0 to 4.0 V.

The acquired slurry was further spread onto aluminum foil to create a thin film, which was then cut into a circular disk with a diameter of 12 mm, and vacuum-dried at 100 ◦C overnight. The mass loading of active cathode materials was controlled approximately 2.0 mg cm−2. For both half and full cell, the electrochemical performance of cathode materials was investigated using a CR2032 coin-type cell in an argon-filled glove box. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 2 % fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) by volume, and porous glass microfiber membrane (Whatman, GF/F) was applied as the separator. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed using a Neware battery tester within a potential range of 2.0–4.0 V.

                "The cathode materials were synthesized using a facile high-temperature calcination method by regulating the ratios of various transition metal compositions. The structural characteristics were detected and analyzed through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and Rietveld refinement. As depicted in Fig. 1(a), the XRD patterns of all cathode materials display well-crystallized O3-type stacking with the R —3 m space group , . However, a small amount of NiO phase is present in NaNFMO due to solid-solution formation , . Additionally, the (003) diffraction peak located at 16–17° shifts slightly toward a lower angle in the Cu- and Cu/Mg-doped samples, indicating an expansion of the interlayer spacing. Compared to Ni2+ ions (0.69 Å), the Cu2+ (0.73 Å) and Mg2+ (0.72 Å) ions have larger ionic radius, which result in a slight increase in the a and c lattice parameters, as well as the overall volume. To further confirm the shifts and variations in lattice parameters, the Rietveld refinement of XRD was performed on the different samples, and the results are shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S1. Tables S3 provides the detailed refinement results, indicating that multiple Ni, Cu, Mg, Fe, and Mn elements occupy the transition-metal positions. Furthermore, the Na-O band length in NaNCMFMO is 2.3839 Å with Cu/Mg doping in the transition metal layer, which is shorter than that of NaNCFMO (2.3868 Å) and NaNFMO (2.3880 Å). The smaller Na-O band length suggests a reduction in the sodium layer spacing.",
                "The particle morphology and nanostructure of different samples were investigated using SEM and HRTEM. Fig. 2(a) and (b) exhibit the detailed morphology of NaNCMFMO at different magnifications, revealing irregular granules with diameters ranging from 10 to 15 μm. The high magnification SEM images further demonstrate that NaNCMFMO consists of flake-like structures with a thickness of approximately 1 μm. TEM analysis was conducted to further examine the characteristic of NaNCMFMO, which also exhibits a flake-like nanostructure (Fig. 2(c)). The morphologies of NaNFMO and NaNCFMO were also investigated and shown in Fig. S2, which differ from that of the NaNCMFMO. Additionally, the HRTEM image of NaNFMO is displayed in Figs. S3(a)-3(b). HRTEM images of NaNCMFMO reveal the lattice distance of 0.532, 0.245 and 0.216 nm, corresponding to the (003), (101) and (104) planes of the O3 phase (Fig. 2(e), Figs. S3(c)-3(d)) . High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (DES) elemental mapping show a uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, Mn, Cu, Mg and O elements in NaNCMFMO, confirming the successful doping of Cu and Mg into the NaNFMO lattice.",
                "The valence states of various metal elements in different samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. Fig. S4 presents the high-resolution spectra of the Ni 2p, Fe 2p, and Mn 2p in three cathode materials. The Ni 2p spectrum can be divided into Ni 2p3/2 (854.8 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (872.4 eV), and two satellite peaks at 879.1 and 860.8 eV, confirming the presence of + 2 valence state of Ni in all cathode materials , , . Similarly, the Fe 2p spectrum for the three samples, depicted in Fig. S4(c), displays two peaks located at 710.8 and 724.4 eV, relating to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, and satellite peaks were also observed at 717.0 and 731.8 eV. The position and spectral feature of Fe 2p reveals the valence of iron is + 3 state , . Additionally, the Mn 2p spectra of different samples shown in Fig. S4(d), in which two typical peaks around at 641.7 and 653.3 eV are associated with Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, demonstrating the presence of Mn4+ in all samples , , . The high-resolution spectrum of Cu 2p in Fig. S 4(e) displays four peaks for NaNCMFMO and NaNCFMO, with peaks at 933.2 and 953.4 eV corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, while another two peaks positioned at 943.2 and 961.8 eV represent for satellite peaks. The fitted XPS spectra of Cu 2p for both NaNCMFMO and NaNCFMO confirm the presence of Cu2+ valence state . The Mg 1 s high-resolution spectra for NaNCMFMO also was exhibited in Fig. S4(f), where one main peak around at 1304.5 eV is aroused from Mg 1 s , . The above XPS results confirm that Ni, Cu, and Mg are in + 2 oxidation state, while Fe and Mn are in + 3 and + 4 valence state, respectively.",
                "The obtained samples were used as cathode materials and assembled half cells with Na metal as anode to study the electrochemical performance within a voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. Fig. 3(a) displays the initial four galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) profiles of NaNCMFMO at 0.1 C (1 C = 140 mAh g−1). The first cycle of charge/discharge capacities is 129.3/124.4 mAh g−1, and the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) is 96.2 %. The GCD profiles for subsequent three cycles are nearly overlapping, indicating an excellent reversibility of NaNCMFMO cathode. The sodium storage properties of NaNFMO and NaNCFMO were also investigated in Fig. S5. The reversible specific capacities of NaNFMO and NaNCFMO are 142.3/132.2 and 140.4/131.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, with ICE of 92.9 % and 93.7 %, respectively. A slightly lower reversible specific capacity of NaNCMFMO can be ascribed that Mg does not undergo redox reaction. Moreover, compared to NaNFMO and NaNCFMO, the distinct voltage plateau in the charge/discharge profile is vanished, demonstrating that the multiphase transition is effectively suppressed in the Cu/Mg co-doped NaNCMFMO sample. Additionally, the cycling stability for different Cu doping of NaNi0.4–0.05xCu0.05xFe0.2Mn0.4O2 was also investigated in Fig. S6. With increase of the doping amount of Cu2+, the specific capacity of NaNi0.4–0.05xCu0.05xFe0.2Mn0.4O2 is decreased which is attributed to Cu contributes less capacity to redox reaction compared with Ni. When the doping amount of Cu2+ reaches 0.1, the NaNCFMO displays a high specific capacity and good cycling stability.",
                "The corresponding dQ/dV profiles for the initial 20 cycles of NaNCMFMO were displayed in Fig. 3(b), where the characteristic peaks located at 2.98/2.87 V represent the charge/discharge plateau. The corresponding dQ/dV profiles of NaNFMO and NaNCMFMO were also investigated in Fig.S7. Compared with NaNCFMO and NaNFMO, the dQ/dV curves of NaNCMFMO are nearly overlapped in the initial 20 cycles, which indicates a high reversibility of the phase transition during cycling. The cycling stability of all samples is displayed in Fig. 3(c), NaNCMFMO achieves a reversible capacity of 107.4 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, with high-capacity retention of 87.0 %. In contrast, the reversible capacities of NaNFMO and NaNCFMO are 85.8 and 94.7 mAh g−1, respectively, and only retain 65.0 % and 72.2 % capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Although the initial reversible capacity of NaNCMFMO is lower than that of NaNFMO and NaNCFMO cathodes, NaNCMFMO exhibits significantly better cycling stability, indicating that the Cu/Mg co-doping strategy enhances structural reversibility and suppresses multistage phase transition during cycling.",
                "The rate capability of all samples was also investigated and shown in Fig. 3(d), NaNCMFMO cathode delivers specific capacities of 122.5, 117.6, 109.3, 100.5, 88.1 and 71.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively, retaining nearly 60 % capacity at 5.0 C compared to 0.1 C. As the current density comes back to 0.1 C, NaNCMFMO can still maintain a reversible capacity of 121.0 mAh g−1. Meanwhile, NaNFMO and NaNCFMO exhibit higher reversible capacity at 0.1 C, but both of them display an inferior specific capacity at large current density of 5.0 C, with values of 55.3 and 69.1 mAh g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the long-term cycling performance of three samples is illustrated in Fig. 3(e). NaNCMFMO still shows higher reversible specific capacity of 92.0 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1.0 C and more increased capacity retention of 79.4 %. In contrast, NaNFMO and NaNCFMO only maintain the specific capacity of 51.6 and 73.1 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles, corresponding to 42.1 % and 58.5 % capacity retention, respectively. The significant improvement in the cycling performance of NaNCMFMO can be attributed to Cu/Mg co-doping, which strengthens the structure stability and suppresses phase transition. Finally, we listed the electrochemical performance of NaNCMFMO and other NiFeMn-based O3-type layered oxide materials in Table S5 to obviously demonstrate its competitive cycling and rate capabilities.",
                "The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was performed to evaluate the kinetic characteristic of different cathodes during the entire charging/discharging process, and the Na+ diffusion coefficient (DNa+) at different states was calculated using the simplified equation. As shown in Fig. 4(a)-(c), during the initial charging process up to 3.0 V, the DNa+ began to decrease, which can be attributed to the slower diffusion of Na+ ions when they pass through the intermediate tetrahedral sites , , . Subsequently, as the charging voltage exceeds 3.0 V, the diffusion coefficient increases in the later stage of charging, indicating the phase transition from O3 to P3. This change represents a more favorable diffusion channel for Na+ in NaNCMFMO , . During the discharging process, a notable decrease in the diffusion coefficient occurs near 3.0 V, corresponding to the phase transition from P3 to O3 phase . Fig. 4(a)-(c) display the GITT curves and the corresponding detailed DNa+ values for the different cathode materials. The average diffusion coefficient for NaNCMFMO during charge process calculated to be 1.19 × 10−10 cm2 S−1. It exhibits a comparatively higher Na+ diffusion coefficient than NaNFMO (5.06 ×10−11 cm2 S−1) and NaNCFMO (6.37 ×10−11 cm2 S−1). During the discharge process, the average diffusion coefficients for NaNCMFMO, NaNCFMO and NaNFMO are 9.45 × 10−11 cm2 S−1, 5.78 × 10−11 cm2 S−1 and 3.55 × 10−11 cm2 S−1, respectively. The GITT results reveal the enhanced reaction kinetic in Cu/Mg co-doped NaNCMFMO sample.",
                "Moreover, EIS were performed to assess the Na+ diffusion impedance of NaNCMFMO, NaNCFMO and NaNFMO cathodes after 20 cycles at 1.0 C, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The EIS spectrum for three cathodes exhibits a semicircle at high frequency, corresponding to charge transfer resistance (Rct). The NaNCMFMO displays a lower Rct than NaNCFMO and NaNFMO, demonstrating a faster electrochemical reaction rate. The oblique line at low frequency represents the Warburg impedance (Rw). The Nyquist plots show that NaNCMFMO has the lowest Rw, suggesting superior Na⁺ ion transfer within the material, which contributes to its excellent rate capability.",
                "To further examine the impact of doping on the structural evolution of NaNCMFMO, ex situ XRD pattern was conducted to investigate the phase transitions and structural changes during the charging and discharging process at the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V in the initial cycle (Fig. 5). As the charging progresses, the characteristic peaks of (003) and (006) move to the lower angel. This indicates the expansion of interlayer spacing because of enhanced electrostatic repulsion of O2− during Na+ extraction , . Simultaneously, the typical peaks of (104) and (012) gradually shift to higher angle reflecting interplanar contraction caused by transition metal oxidation. Upon charging to 3.6 V, the intensity of characteristic peaks for the pristine O3 phase decrease, while new peaks corresponding to P3-phase (003) and (006) emerge at lower angles. The characteristic peak of P3 phase (015) generates indicating the onset of the P3 phase formation , , . When charged to 3.8 V, the (015) peak related to P3 phase gradually becomes more significant, demonstrating the coexistence of O3 and P3 phases in this region. When charging to 4.0 V, all diffraction peaks are well indexed to the P3 phase and O3 phase peaks disappearing completely. The result illustrates the full conversion from O3 to P3 phase. Subsequently, during the discharge process, the diffraction peaks of O3 phase gradually appear again when Na+ inserted back to the structure of sodium layer. With the further intercalation of Na+, the O3 phase peaks become more prominent as the discharge voltage approaches to 3.8 V. As the discharge continues, the materials eventually return back to initial O3-type structure with no impurity peaks detected in XRD pattern. This process demonstrates the highly reversible phase transition between O3 and P3 during charge and discharge process for NaNCMFMO.",
                "The ex situ XRD pattern of NaNFMO was also investigated at the same voltage range in Fig. S8. In contrast, compared with 3.8 V for NaNCMFMO, it is worth noting that the P3 phase emerges for NaNFMO upon charging to 3.2 V indicting the delay of O3-P3 phase transition in NaNCMFMO cathode. With the further charging to 3.8 V, the characteristic peaks of O3 phase disappear completely, and the P3 phase maintain until the end of charge process revealing the completion of conversion from O3 to P3 phase. While during the discharge process, the characteristic peaks of O3 phase gradually becomes visible until charged to 3.0 V indicating phase transition process of P3-O3. Upon reaching 2.5 V, all characteristic peaks are well indexed to O3 phase in XRD pattern demonstrating completion of P3 to O3 phase transition. Comparison of XRD patterns of NaNFMO and NaNCMFMO, the NaNCMFMO maintains the O3 structure more steadily and durably than NaNFMO during the whole intercalation/deintercalation process which strengthen the structure stability resulting in a improved cycling stability.",
                "Furthermore, the full cell was assembled using the NaNCMFMO cathode paired with a HC anode to evaluate the practical application. Prior to full cell assembly, the sodium storage properties of HC anode were first investigated. As shown in Fig. S9, the HC anode displays a reversible specific capacity of 292 mAh g−1 within the voltage range of 0–2.0 V during the initial cycle and maintains approximately 240 mAh g−1 over 50 cycles. Therefore, the full cell was prepared with a cathode-to-anode mass ratio approximately at 1.2:1. As depicted in Fig. 6(a), the NaNCMFMO//HC full-cell delivers a reversible capacity of 125.4 mAh g−1 with high ICE of 92.1 % in the voltage range of 0.5–4.0 V at 0.1 C. Even at 1.0 C, the full-cell delivers an enhanced reversible specific capacity of 105.1 mAh g−1. After 200 cycles at 1.0 C for discharge/charge, the full-cell preserves a high reversible specific capacity of 85.3 mAh g−1 that corresponds to 81.1 % capacity retention (Fig. 6(b)). Also, the full cell demonstrates excellent rate capability, with reversible specific capacity of 126.5, 115.2, 101.9, 90.3 and 77.8 mAh g−1 at various current densities of 0.1 C、0.2 C、0.5 C、1.0 C and 2.0 C，respectively (Fig. 6(c)-(d)). These superior electrochemical properties suggest that the NaNCMFMO cathode has significant potential for practical applications in SIBs."
