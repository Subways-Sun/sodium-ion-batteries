                "In recent years, lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in portable electronic products, electric vehicles and other fields. However, the amount of lithium resources in the crust of earth is only 0.0065%, with the lack of reserves and uneven distribution increasing its production cost [1, 2]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel secondary batteries with more economical and easy accessibility. Sodium-ion batteries have regained widespread attention due to the low price, wide abundance of sodium resources and the increasing demand for large-scale energy storage [3]. High-performance embedded sodium cathode materials are a key part of sodium-ion battery applications, among which layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2) have attracted a research surge because of their high reversible specific capacity, high operating voltage, easy preparation and two-dimensional ion diffusion channels [4, 5].",
                "Based on the coordination configuration of Na+ and the repetition periodicity of the transition metal stacking, Delmas et al. [6] classified the layered oxides into four types: O2, O3, P2 and P3. In the P2-type structure, the Na+ intercalation/extraction passes through the central part of a wider planar tetragonal, with low diffusion potential barrier and open pathway, which is outstanding in terms of structural stability and high ionic conductivity [7]. However, the order of Na+/vacancy, surface side reactions and P2-O2 phase transition under high voltage can lead to structural distortion and irreversible capacity decay of the materials, resulting in deterioration of the electrochemical performance [8,9,10,11]. In order to further improve the cycling stability and rate performance of P2-type layered oxide cathode materials under high voltage, recently researchers have emphasized ion doping and surface coating for modification. Element doping (Li+ [12], Ti4+ [13], Al3+ [14], Mg2+ [15], Zn2+ [16], etc.) can change the layer spacing between the transition metal layer and the sodium layer, enhancing the structural stability and inhibiting the irreversible phase transition. Zhang et al. [17] inhibited the P2-O2 phase transition under the voltage window of 2.0–4.4 V by partially replacing Ni2+ with Zn2+. When the doping amount was 0.1, the material had optimal electrochemical performance with 90% capacity retention after 30 cycles, compared to 56% for the pristine material. Xu et al. [18] reported that Ti-doped Na(Ni0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5)1-xTixO2 could effectively inhibit the formation of the P3 phase at high voltage, thus decreasing the variation of the lattice volume during the sodiation/desodiation reaction, with capacity retention of 87.5% for 300 cycles at 1C. In addition, Li et al. [19] showed that Li doping not only induced oxygen anions to participate in charge compensation at high operating voltage, slowing down the voltage decay, but also inhibited the P2-O2 phase transition, promoting the diffusion of electrons and sodium ions. Li-doped layered oxide cathode materials produce more defects to maintain charge neutrality and exhibit higher conductivity as well as average discharge voltage.",
                "Although these doping strategies have successfully solved the problems of phase transition under high voltage, most of them replace the transition metal active sites in the TMO2 layer at the expense of the capacity contribution of Ni. Meanwhile, they cannot effectively reduce the electrostatic repulsion of the O layer when the Na+ content is low, so the synergistic modification is an effective solution to the above problems [20,21,22]. Chu et al. [23] proposed Co and Ni co-doping P2-Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 material. The synergistic modification of the two elements improved the structural stability, energy density and reversible specific capacity of the material. Wang et al. [24] designed a dual modification method of Mg/Ti co-doping and MgO surface coating for the P2-type Na0.67Ni0.17Co0.17Mn0.66O2 cathode defect. The results demonstrated that Mg/Ti co-doping can stabilize the P2 structure, while the MgO layer effectively prevented HF corrosion and enhanced Na+ migration. Consequently, the electrochemical performance of the prepared MgO-coated Na0.67Ni0.17Co0.17Mn0.66Mg0.1O2 had been significantly improved. Inspired by which, Zn/F dual doping is carried out in this study to improve the electrochemical performance of Ni-Mn-based cathode materials. In this paper, carbonate precursors are synthesized by a hydrothermal method and Zn/F is introduced as doping ions to enhance the crystal structure and electrochemical properties of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode materials. A series of Zn/F dual-doped Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O2-xFx (x = 0.02, 0.05, 0.08) and Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode materials are synthesized. The results show that Zn/F is successfully embedded inside the lattice during high-temperature calcination, which suppresses the order of Na+/vacancy and P2-O2 phase transition, enhances the structural stability of the material, and exhibits superior cycling performance. F substitution further improves the initial discharge capacity of the cathode materials. The electrochemical properties of similar materials are listed here for comparison (Table S1). The effects of Zn/F dual doping on structural evolution and performance improvement are investigated by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and CV, and the conclusions can be applied to similar cathode material systems."

                "The XRD and local magnification pattern of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (ZF-0) and Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O2-xFx (x = 0.02, 0.05, 0.08) are depicted in Fig. 1a. The XRD results show that ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5 and ZF-8 in the hexagonal lamellar structures belong to the P2-type P63/mmc space group. All diffraction peaks correspond to the standard card PDF#54–0894 [27] and there are no impurities NaF (PDF#70–2508) and ZnO (PDF#21–1486), indicating that all F− and Zn2+ have entered the lattice interior with the material synthesized well. However, the local magnified pattern shows that with the increase of Zn2+ and F− doping content, the peak at 15.96° gradually shifts to a lower angle, which corresponds to the leftward shift of the crystalline plane of (002), symbolizing that the intergranular spacing c on the crystalline plane of (002) increases. The peaks at 27.33° and 28.35° are related to the Na+/vacancy ordering, which will increase the diffusion barrier of Na+. It disappears after Zn/F doping, demonstrating the effective suppression of Na+/vacancy ordering, which further promote the diffusion of alkali metal ions.",
                "The XRD refinement profiles of materials are showed in Fig. 1b–e to better investigate the effect of Zn/F co-doping on the crystal structure of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 [26]. The Rw values of all samples are less than 6%, indicating that the refinement results are within the acceptable error range. Detailed lattice data of ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5, ZF-8 can be obtained from Rietveld refinement software GSAS II (Table 1), where the lattice parameters of the pristine material are a = b = 2.8826 Å, c = 11.1516 Å and V = 80.250 Å3, while those of ZF-5 are a = b = 2.8881 Å, c = 11.1556 Å and V = 80.585 Å3, with c increasing significantly after doping, which also coincides with the left shift of the (002) peak and indicates Zn2+/F− is indeed doped into the lattice. This may be related to the different ionic radius of F− (1.33 Å), O2− (1.40 Å), Ni2+ (0.69 Å) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å). And the strong electronegativity of F enhances the overall chemistry bonding on a local scale, which causes the transition metal layer to shrink and the alkali metal layer spacing to increase [28,29,30]. P2-type oxide cathode materials undergo O2−/On− redox reactions at voltages above 4.15 V, which can result in the loss of lattice oxygen and lead to irreversible capacity decay [31]. The enhancement of the overall bonding will inhibit the escape of O, thus improving the reversibility of the anionic redox reaction [32]. Compared with ZF-0, Zn/F co-doped cathode materials have longer Na–O bonds, which weakens the electrostatic repulsion between O2− and favours the movement of Na+ [33]. Figure 1f shows the crystal structures schematic of the ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples with the corresponding Na and TMO2 layer spacing labelled, which based on the Rietveld refinement method. Where the transition metal layers (TMO2, TM = Ni, Mn, Zn) consist of a stack of TMO6 octahedra shared along the c-axis edges, the cubic density of oxygen is stacked as an AB-BA array, and Na+ is distributed at the trigonal positions between the TMO2 layers [34]. Compared to ZF-0, ZF-5 shows an increase in the spacing of the Na layers and a decrease in the spacing of the TMO2 layers, which would lower the diffusion barrier of Na+, improving the stability of the lamellar structure. This result is consistent with previous literature [35].",
                "The microscopic morphology and structure of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 and Zn/F co-doped materials are investigated by FE-SEM. The carbonate precursor (Fig.S1) has a diameter of 2–4 µm and is composed of a secondary spherical structure formed by several primary plates stacked according to a specific orientation.The formation of the special morphology can be attributed to the influence of solvent polarity on the crystallization process. Specifically, the preferential growth of certain crystal surfaces leads to the eventual development of the nano flower morphology [36].The rough surface of the precursor exposes a multitude of active sites, which facilitates the diffusion of sodium ions during the sodium mixing process and mitigates the formation of high or low sodium phases. Figure 2a shows the micromorphology of ZF-5 as secondary spherical particle aggregated from hexagonal lamellar primary particles with a particle size of about 3 μm. As shown in Fig.S2, the pore size of ZF-5 is about 5.7 nm. The specific porous structure forms due to the release of CO2 gas from the decomposition of carbonates during calcination, which alleviates the internal stresses generated by the volume change under high voltage, reducing the generation of cracks during charge/discharge and improving the structural stability. Meanwhile, the spherical shape has a short diffusion distance which can effectively promote the transport of sodium ions [37]. In addition, the small specific surface area also reduces the contact with the electrolyte, further inhibiting the surface side reactions.",
                "By SEM–EDS energy spectrum analysis of the ZF-5 sample, the elemental distribution is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the elements Na, Ni, Mn, Zn, F and O are uniformly distributed in the ZF-5 sample, indicating that the hydrothermal method is successful in preparing materials with homogeneous elemental distribution.",
                "Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) further reveals the microstructure of the material, as shown in Fig. 3. The TEM (Fig. 3a) shows that ZF-0 has a clear dotted lattice stripe (the magnified image of the white frame is shown on the upper right) with a stripe spacing of 2.07 Å, which corresponds to the (103) crystallographic plane in Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, demonstrating that the material is highly crystalline. The TEM images of the ZF-5 sample are shown in Fig. 3b–c, and the lattice stripe spacing is calculated to be 2.43 Å, which corresponds to the P2-type (101) crystal plane, indicating that the material is well synthesized. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results (Fig. 3d) reveal that the lattice type of ZF-5 belongs to P63/mmc in the hexagonal system, which is consistent with the XRD results.",
                "In order to confirm and investigate the influence of Zn/F co-doping on the elements’ chemical valence of the cathode materials, ZF-0 and ZF-5 are characterized by XPS and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The XPS patterns of Ni element in the two materials are shown in Fig. 4a where four different peaks can be observed. The binding energies of 854.35 eV and 871.93 eV belong to the characteristic peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, while the binding energies of 871.93 eV and 861.03 eV are the satellite peaks of Ni. And the characteristic peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 can be divided into those representing Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively, where the binding energies of 854.17 and 871.59 eV represent Ni2+ and those of 855.44 and 872.67 eV represent Ni3+[38, 39]. Figure 4b shows the Mn 2p spectra and the corresponding fitted curves for ZF-0 and ZF-5 where the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 characteristic peaks are split into four peaks belonging to the valence states of Mn3+ and Mn4+. Binding energies of 641.46 and 653.26 eV are Mn3+ and those with binding energies of 642.64 and 654.25 eV are Mn4+ [40]. Additionally, the proportions of Ni2+, Ni3+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ in ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples are calculated separately, as shown in Table 2. We learned that the Ni2+ content in ZF-0 is 59.86%, while the Ni2+ content in ZF-5 increases to 62.7%, and the content of Mn3+ increases from 36.01% to 38.30%. Compared to ZF-0, ZF-5 has higher Ni2+ and Mn3+ content, which may be due to the substitution of F− for O2− induces the transition of high valence ions (Ni3+, Mn4+) to lower oxidation states (Ni2+, Mn3+) through charge balance [21]. Figure 4c shows the Zn 2p spectra of the materials, in which ZF-0 does not contain Zn element, while ZF-5 has two characteristic peaks at 1020.78 and 1044.09 eV, belonging to Zn 2p3/2. Figure 4d shows the F elemental spectrum of the material, where the peak with binding energy of 688.91 eV corresponds to the F 1 s orbital. The above XPS results indicate that Zn/F is successfully doped into the interior lattice and adjusts the valence states of Ni and Mn, changing the single redox centre of Ni2+, allowing more Mn3+ to participate in the redox reaction and increasing the specific capacity [41].",
                "To investigate the electrode responses during charge/discharge before and after modification, CV tests are carried out on all samples in the range of 2.0 to 4.5 V. As shown in Fig. 5a–d, there is a cyclic voltammetry curve containing four pairs of redox peaks. Among them, 2.0/2.5 V corresponds to the Mn4+/Mn3+ reaction, in which there is no obvious peak intensity for ZF-0, but the peak intensity is gradually increasing with the increase of the doping content, indicating that more Mn3+ participates in the redox reaction. 3.40/3.23 V corresponds to the Ni3+/Ni2+ reaction and 3.70/3.60 V corresponds to the Ni4+/Ni3+ reaction. It is noteworthy that the ZF-0 redox peak splits into two peaks around 3.7 V, which is a Na+/ vacancy ordering phenomenon, increasing the diffusion barrier of Na+ and hindering the diffusion of Na+. However, with the doping of Zn/F, the split two redox peaks merge into a single peak, which effectively inhibits the Na+/vacancy ordering. The peak with voltage above 4.15 V correlates to the charge compensation of lattice oxygen, which overflows the lattice to transform gaseous oxygen, leading to an increase in repulsion between adjacent oxygen layers. Consequently, to reduce system energy, the transition metal layer slips, with an irreversible P2-O2 phase transition [42]. The peak is extremely sharp on the ZF-0 sample, while the redox peak intensity is decreasing with the increase of doping content, which indicates that Zn/F co-doping inhibits the redox reaction of O2−/On−, thus reducing the chance of lattice oxygen detachment from the lattice. Finally, the first three circles of ZF-5 have better overlapping curves with excellent reversibility.",
                "To explain how Zn/F modification affects the electrochemical properties of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, the electrochemical properties of all samples are analysed in depth. Constant-current charge/discharge curves for the first three cycles at 0.1 C(1 C = 190 mAh g−1) are shown in Fig. 6a–d. It can be seen from the results that the initial specific discharge capacities for ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5 and ZF-8 are 146.57, 132.49, 137.13 and 143.28 mAh g−1, respectively. The initial specific capacity decreases and then increases with the doping amount, which is due to the fact that the substitution of the inactive metal Zn for the active Ni reduces the active ions involved in the redox reaction. However, an increase in F doping induces the production of more reactive ions (Mn3+, Ni2+) in lower valence states to participate in the redox reaction, allowing more Na+ to be de/embedded from the Na layer [21]. Furthermore, multiple charge/discharge plateaus appeared in the charging/discharging curves of ZF-0, where the plateaus below 4.0 V corresponded to Na+ de/embedding processes exhibiting complex Na+/vacancy ordering, and the long plateaus above 4.15 V corresponded to the P2-O2 phase transition, which is the main reason for the irreversible capacity decay[42]. In contrast, the charge/discharge curve of the Zn/F doped material is smoother than that of ZF-0, showing a sloping solid solution curve. This is attributed to the fact that the larger Zn–O bonding inhibits the irreversible reaction of lattice oxygen and suppression of the Na+/vacancy ordering by F doping. This result is consistent with the above XRD and CV results. It is noteworthy that the reversibility of the material is rather better despite the increase in the proportion of Mn3+. Because of the larger radius of Zn2+ than Ni2+, the smaller radius of F− than O2−, introduced lattice strain inherently increase the asymmetry of the crystal field, changing the stress distribution inside the crystal to reduce the risk of structural distortion and optimizing the electronic structure to make the transport of electrons in the crystal more efficient. Meanwhile, the strong electronegativity of F enhances the interaction between the transition metal ions and anions, suppressing the Jahn–Teller aberration as well as the solvation of the transition metal ions.",
                "Figure 6e shows the cycling performance of all the samples at 1 C. The coulomb efficiency of all samples is close to 100% except the first circle. The initial discharge specific capacities of ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5 and ZF-8 electrode materials are 131.87 mAh g−1, 125.31 mAh g−1, 134.47 mAh g−1 and 144.34 mAh g−1, respectively. After 100 cycles, the discharge specific capacities are 15.24 mAh g−1, 88.99 mAh g−1, 110.37 mAh g−1 and 102.53 mAh g−1, respectively. Capacity retention is 11.56%, 71.00%, 82.08% and 71.03% in that order, where ZF-5 exhibits a relatively high initial discharge capacity and excellent cycle performance. Even at a current density of 2C(Fig. S3), ZF-5 can still maintain initial discharge capacity of 111.24 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention rate of 61.36% after 200 cycles. This is due to the induced effect of F− which promotes the increase of Ni2+ and Mn3+ content, thus more active ions participate in the redox reaction and contribute to the specific capacity. Moreover, Zn/F co-doping enhances the structural stability of the material and reduces the diffusion barrier of Na+. Figure 6f shows the rate capability of all samples. We can see that ZF-5 has a better rate capability than ZF-0. The discharge capacities of ZF-0 samples at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C and 5C are 146.57 mAh g−1, 121.58 mAh g−1, 102.29 mAh g−1 and 89.88 mAh g−1, 62.45 mAh g−1 and 45.43 mAh g−1, respectively, while ZF-5 are 130.68 mAh g-1, 131.93 mAh g-1, 128.04 mAh g-1, 121.29 mAh g-1, 108.18 mAh g-1 and 94.71 mAh g-1, respectively. The capacity of ZF-0 decays sharply with the increase of current density, and the discharge specific capacity of 5C is only 31.02% of 0.1C. In comparison, the discharge specific capacity of 5C is 72.47% of 0.1C. When reaches 0.1 C again, the discharge specific capacity of the ZF-0 sample is only 95.19 mAh g−1, while the ZF-5 sample even exceeds the initial discharge specific capacity. This can be attributed to the full activation of the active ions after several charge/discharge tests, which prompts more Na+ to participate in the electrode reaction. The Zn/F co-doping enlarges the layer spacing, which results in a more stable crystal structure with a better rate performance. As known from the energy band theory, the high spin state of Mn3+ produces Jahn–Teller distortion, which reduces the crystal symmetry and leads to severe structural collapse during charge/discharge, disrupting the interior structure. The interaction of the transition metal atoms mainly depends on the bonding energy and the occupation of the d orbital, where the enhancement of bonding energy triggers a strong electron delocalization phenomenon, leading to a decrease in the energy of the whole system [14, 43]. The strong electronegativity of F as well as the larger bond energy of Mn-F (423 kJ mol−1) than Mn–O (402 kJ mol−1) enhance the overall chemical bonding of the Mn–O/F bond in the local range, which suppresses the Jahn–Teller effect and enhances the electrochemical properties of ZF-5 [44]. In summary, it is shown that ZF-5 has excellent cycling and rate properties, which can be attributed to the fact that excessive Mn3+ will weaken electron delocalization with the destabilization of structure as the doping increases [45]. An appropriate amount of Zn/F doping can synergistically modify to optimize the electrochemical properties of the material and suppress the unfavourable P2-O2 phase transition.",
                "Electrochemical impedance tests (EIS) are performed on ZF-0 and ZF-5 in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz before and after 100 cycles of 1 C and the results are depicted in Fig. 7. Figure 7a, b show the fitted Nyquist plots of ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples before and after cycling. In general, the Nyquist plot consists of an x-axis intercept corresponding to the ohmic resistance (Rs), two semicircles corresponding to the interfacial resistance (Rf) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the high frequency range, and a diagonal line corresponding to the Warburg impedance (W) in the low frequency range [46]. Among them, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) related to the reversibility of the electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface is mainly involved in the electrochemical reactions, which is an important parameter to explain the electrochemical properties of the materials [47]. The fitting results are shown in Table 3. The Rs values of ZF-0 and ZF-5 are similar before cycling, but the Rs value of ZF-0 is higher after cycling. The Rf and Rct values of the two samples before and after cycling differ considerably, with 156.3 and 415.9 Ω for the ZF-0 sample before cycling, while those of the ZF-5 material are 246.9 and 255.7 Ω, respectively. After 100 cycles, the Rf and Rct increased to 279.7 and 757.4 Ω for the ZF-0 material, contrary to the 251.8 and 529.6 Ω for the ZF-5 material. The changes in Rf and Rct (ΔRf and ΔRct) before and after cycling of the ZF-5 sample are ΔRf = 42 Ω and ΔRct = 292.3 Ω, respectively, which are smaller than ΔRf = 123.4 Ω and ΔRct = 341.5 Ω of ZF-0 sample. This suggests that Zn/F co-doping stabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, inhibits the growth of the SEI membrane, and improves the diffusion kinetics of Na+, which is in agreement with the results of the electrochemical tests.",
                "Furthermore, based on Eqs. 1 and 2, the sodium ion diffusion coefficients (DNa+) of the ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples after 100 cycles of 1C can be calculated.",
                "In Eq. (1), R represents the gas constant, T for the absolute temperature, A for the cathode’s surface area, n for the number of transferred electrons, F for the Faraday constant, C for the concentration of Na+, σ for the Warburg's constant [48].",
                "where the value of σ can be calculated from Eq. (2):",
                "In Eq. (2), Z' denotes the impedance and ω denotes the angular frequency. σ value is the slope of the straight line calculated from Eq. (2), and the calculated results are shown in Table 3. The DNa+ of ZF-5 is 1.04 × 10–11 cm s−1, which is higher than the sample of ZF-0 (DNa+ = 2.58 × 10–12 cm s−1). The sodium ion diffusion coefficients of the modified samples increase, indicating that Zn/F co-doping can reduce the diffusion barrier of sodium ions, accelerate the sodium ion migration rate, and effectively improve the electrochemical properties."

                "In summary, a series of P2-type Zn/F dual-doped Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O2-xFx (x = 0.02, 0.05, 0.08) cathode materials are synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Compared with the unmodified material, the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ increases in the doped material, which promotes more active ions to participate in the redox reaction and improve the specific capacity to some extent. Meanwhile, synergistic doping enlarges the Na layer spacing with the low Na+ migration barrier, promoting the diffusion of Na+. It significantly suppresses the P2-O2 phase transition under high voltage and reduces the volume change of the cathode material during Na+ de/embedding. Additionally, the strong electronegativity of F suppresses the Jahn–Teller effect as well as the vacancy ordering of Na+. The above factors together lead to the excellent electrochemical performance of Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O1.95F0.05 (82.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C), whereas the capacity retention of the original sample (ZF-0) is only 11.6%. These results indicate that P2-type Zn/F dual-doped Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O1.95F0.05 has the potential to be commercialized as a high energy density sodium ion battery cathode material."
