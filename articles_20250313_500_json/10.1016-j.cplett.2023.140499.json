                "We provide information on a straightforward process for creating sodium-carbon-based material for Na-ion batteries. The electric-controlled exfoliation method produced sodium intercalated graphene oxide (Na-GO). Na-GO has a crystalline structure with a few-layered scattered sheet shape, 87.9 percent crystallinity, a computed density of 2.26 g/cm3, and a cell volume of 35.29x106pm3. The Coulombic efficiency of the Na-GO material increased from 98.8% in the first electrochemical cycle to 100.5 percent in the 60th, and the specific capacity (S.C.) of the Na-GO electrode at a current density of 100 mA/g is about 368 mAh/g. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles against sodium metal were carried out as a reference electrode. This is a brand-new method for creating high-performing materials that do not require purifying or cleaning procedures."
