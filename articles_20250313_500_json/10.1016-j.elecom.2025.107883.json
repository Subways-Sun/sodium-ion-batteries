                "Due to the open 3D framework structure and relative high capacity, the NASICON type Na3V2(PO4)3 has aroused enormous attention as the cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, it still suffers from the toxicity and high cost of vanadium elements, coupled with low electronic conductivity. In this study, we partially substituted V with the environmentally friendly and cost-effective transition element Fe and doped K into the Na site to fabricate a series of Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C composites using a facile sol-gel method. The structural stability, Na+ mobility and electronic conductivity can significant improved by replacing Na+ with K+ and applying a carbon coating. Consequently, the Na3.9K0.1FeV(PO4)3@C electrode delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 83.85 mAh g−1 at 5C after 3000 cycles, with a capacity retention of 91.7 %. It also exhibits an outstanding rate performance with a specific discharge capacity of 83.88 mAh g−1 even at 20.0C. The kinetic analyses and ex-situ characterizations confirm that a small volume change, the pseudocapacitive- dominated sodium storage behavior and highly reversible redox reaction (Fe2+/3+ and V3+/4+) occur during the electrochemical reaction process. Finally, the optimized K-doped NFVP cathode also demonstrates great potential in practical utilization through the evaluation of electrochemical performance for full cells."

                "In recent years, the swift advancement of sustainable and renewable energy sources spurred the great progress in energy storage technologies [[1], [2], [3]]. Because of the rich resources, cost-effectiveness, competitive electrochemical properties, and even geographical distribution of sodium resources, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been viewed as a promising candidate to replace lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in the realm of large-scale energy storage systems [[4], [5], [6]]. However, the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) still faces substantial challenges, primarily stemming from the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) compared to Li+ (0.76 Å). It will results in sluggish kinetics and significant volume variations during the sodiation and de-sodiation processes [[7], [8], [9]]. Hence, the exploration of advanced electrode materials that exhibit high-energy density, rapid and outstanding reversible Na+ insertion and extraction properties holds significant importance. Among the various materials explored for SIBs, NASICON structure Na3V2(PO4)3(NVP) has garnered significant attention owing to its stable three-dimensional open-framework structure with a fast sodium transport channel and high reversible capacity [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. However, the toxicity of V elements and their high cost, coupled with the low electronic conductivity of NVP material, will hinder its commercial applications. For this reason, partially or entirely substituting V with the eco-friendly and more affordable transition metals like Co, Ti, Zr, Mn and so on, will be a promising solution [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. For example, Hu et al. reported free-standing Na4MnV(PO4)3@C fiber membranes prepared via an electrospinning and stepwise sintering process, which could deliver 89.5 mAh g−1 at 110 mA g−1 after 150 cycles with a capacity retention of 91.2 % [19]. Liu et al. prepared Na3Mn0.5V0.5Ti(PO4)3@RGO composites through a sol-gel process, which exhibit a capacity of 135.2 mAh g−1 and maintain 76.2 % of the capacity after 500 cycles [21].When V was entirely replaced with Ti and Mn, the Na3MnZr(PO4)3@C- rGO sample can be prepared using a spray-drying strategy. After 1500 cycles, it demonstrates a capacity of 81.2 mAh g−1 with a retention rate of 97.4 % [18]. However, introducing these elements into the NVP material also entails some other adverse effects. For instance, the Jahn-Teller effect arising from Mn3+ during the charge and discharge processes will cause structural deterioration and poor cycling performance [22,23]. Additionally, the Zr element is non-electrochemically active in SIBs, which will decrease the specific capacity of the NVP material. Meanwhile, the relatively low potential plateau (only 2.1 V vs. Na+/Na) originating from the redox couple Ti3+/Ti4+ limits its utilization in terms of application as the cathode for SIBs. For comparison, substituting V3+ with Fe2+ in NVP is one of the ideal choices, as it can generate an appropriate voltage platform around 2.5 V (vs. Na+/Na), deriving from the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox reaction [24,25]. Furthermore, compared to the V element, and even the aforementioned replaced elements, the Fe element is low-cost, abundant on the earth, and eco-friendly. Lu et al. successfully prepared Na4FeV(PO4)3@C (NFVP) by a ball-milling assisted sol-gel method. After 800 cycles, it still exhibits a high capacity 87.7 mAh g−1 at 5C [26]. However, the low ionic diffusion coefficient stemming from large ionic radius and mass of Na+, as well as poor electronic conductivity of Na4FeV(PO4)3, still needs to be improved to obtain better electrochemical performance. Ionic doping combined with carbon coating is an efficient approach to addressing these challenges, which has been widely utilized in various electrode materials [[27], [28], [29]]. For example, Ma et al. successfully prepared Na3.9FeV0.9Zr0.1(PO4)3/C material via substituting V3+ with a small amount of Zr4+, and the sample exhibits an outstanding rate performance and remarkable cyclic stability [30].",
                "However, to our knowledge, there are limited studies that have concentrated on doping at Na-sites for the modification of NFVP materials. Due to the larger radius (1.38 Å), K+ doping at Na-sites can expand the sodium ion transport channels and increase the unit cell volume by substituting a portion of sodium ions, showing a notable improvement in both the rate capability and cycling stability of NASICON-type cathode materials. Cong et al. [31] reported a Na2.9K0.1V2(PO4)3/C composite by using a lager radius K-doping to enhance the electronic conductivity of the material. Moreover, Shen et al. [32] reported that the K+ was employed to doped at Na site in Na3V2(PO4)3, which promoted Na ion migration, efectively alleviated volume variation and improved structural integrity. Cao et al. [33] confirmed that the K-doping can improve the structural stability and get high intercalation- deintercalation kinetic of Na+ for Na3Fe2(PO4)3. In many different cathode materials, K-doped method is a significant way to improve the cycle stability and rate capability performance of cathode materials in SIBs. Motivating by the above researches, in this work, a series of low-cost and low-toxicity Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) composites were synthesized by using a facile sol-gel method followed a high-temperature calcination process. The influence of K+ doping on the structural characteristics, morphological features, and electrochemical properties was investigated. Furthermore, we also systematically evaluated the influence of K+ doping, combined with carbon coating, on the electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion in NFVP materials. From these analyses, K-doping significantly broaden the Na ion transport channels, enhances the Na+ diffusion coefficient, stabilizes the structure, and thus improves the electrochemical performance for SIBs."

Pure sodium metal foils were used as counter electrodes; the organic solvent consisting of 1 M NaClO4 in EC:DMC:EMC = 1:1:1 vol% with 2.0 % FEC, was used as the electrolyte; and the porous glass fibers (Whatman GF/D) were punched into 14 mm-diameter discs and used as separators. The cathodes were prepared by mixing the Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3 composites, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (dissolved in an amount of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent) in a mass ratio of 7:2:1. After thorough mixing, the slurry was uniformly pasted on aluminum foil, and then dried at 120 °C in a vacuum oven for one night. Finally, the disks with a diameter of 12 mm were punched out from the aluminum foil. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) were conducted using the Neware (CT-4008 T) battery tester in a potential range of 2.0–3.8 V for half cell. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (0.1 Hz - 100 kHz) tests were performed by using a BioLogic SP-300 electrochemical working station. The procedures for fabricating full cells are the same as those for half-cells, except for the use of a presodiated hard carbon electrode as the counter electrode. The loading mass of the NFVP cathode and hard carbon anode are 1.0 mg/cm2 and 0.5 mg/cm2. For the both half-cells and full-cells, the specific capacity was calculated based on the mass of NFVP."

                "Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C(x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) composites were characterized using XRD technique to investigate the impact of K+ doping on their structural properties. As shown in Fig. 1(a), all the diffraction peaks align well with the standard XRD spectrum of rhombohedral NASICON structure with a R-3c space group [26,34]. Meanwhile, no impurity phases corresponding to diffraction peaks are detected. It suggests that low-content K+ doping does not change the structure of the materials. Moreover, compared with the pristine sample, as the doping amount of K+ increases, the position of the enlarged (200) peaks shifts progressively to lower angles (in the inset of Fig. 1(a)), suggesting an expansion of the lattice constant and confirming the successful incorporation of K+ into the structure. The enlargement of the lattice constant after K+ doping can broaden the Na ion transport channels and facilitate the diffusion of Na+ ions, thereby enhancing the electrochemical properties. The XPS spectra of the selected x = 0 and x = 0.1 samples were used to elucidate the chemical compositions and valence states of elements for the material surface. The Na1s, Fe2p, V2p, P2p, O1s, and C1s signals are detected in the XPS survey spectra of x = 0 and x = 0.1 samples (Fig. 1(b)), while the K2p signals are only observed in x = 0.1 sample(Fig. 1(c)). Although the K2p XPS peak is not obvious causing by the low content of K, it is significantly different from that of x = 0. The results indicate that the K+ has been successfully introduced into the NVFP, which is consistent with the EDS mapping testing results. Fig. 1(d)-(f) and Fig. S1(a)-(c) show the high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe2p, V2p, C1s for the x = 0.1 and x = 0 samples. As can be seen, both samples exhibit similar valence states. The Fe 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 1(d)) can be resolved into four peaks: those located at about 710.8 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 723.8 eV (Fe 2p1/2) correspond to Fe2+ species, while the peaks at 713.7 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 727.2 eV (Fe 2p1/2) correspond to Fe3+ species. Additionally, the other two peaks, situated at 719.5 and 731.0 eV, are satellite peaks [35,36]. The XPS results reveal that Fe exhibits a mixed valence state, which can be ascribed to unavoidable oxidation during the calcination process for x = 0 and x = 0.1 sample, and this is in agreement with previous reports [34,37]. The characteristic peaks of V 2p spectrum (Fig. 1(e)) can be deconvoluted into two major peaks located at 517.08 and 523.98 eV, which can be assigned to the V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, respectively, corresponding to the V3+ species. An additional weak peak at 520.4 eV can be attributed to shake-up satellite peak of the V 2p spectrum [38,39]. Fig. 1(f) displays the C 1 s spectrum, which consists of three convoluted peaks centered at 284.8 eV, 286.3 eV and 288.7 eV, corresponding to the CC bond, CO bond, and O-C=O bond, respectively [[40], [41], [42]]. The specific surface areas of the x = 0, x = 0.05, x = 0.1 and x = 0.15 composites are 48.8, 60.8, 83.1 and 54.2 m2 g−1, as shown in Fig. 1(g) and Fig. S2(a)-(c). Moreover, pore size distributions are displayed in Fig. 1(h) and Fig. S2(d)-(f), the average average pore diameter of the of x = 0, x = 0.05, x = 0.1 and x = 0.15 samples are 3.26, 3.65, 3.78 and 3.70 nm, respectively. From the results, it can be seen that the BET surface area of x = 0.1 sample is the largest among the four samples and it is approximately 1.7 times that of x = 0 sample. The high surface area and the abundant mesoporous not only guarantees the high availability of active sites but also promote electrolyte permeation, which facilitates the diffusion of Na+ ions [43,44]. Fig. 1(i) shows the TGA curves, a minor weight loss from room temperature to 200 °C can be attributed to the evaporation of physically absorbed water. Subsequently, the period of weight loss between 200 °C and 450 °C corresponds to carbon combustion. Finally, due to the oxidation of V(III) and Fe(II) to higher valence states and the absorption of oxygen, the curves show a slight increase between 450 °C and 700 °C. The carbon contents of x = 0, x = 0.05, x = 0.1 and x = 0.15 composites can be calculated as about 13.3 wt%, 13.5 wt%, 12.7 wt% and 15.6 wt%, respectively. The appropriate amount of coated carbon can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of materials and then and achieve improved electrochemical performance.",
                "To investigate the effects of K doping on morphological features, SEM measurements were conducted on the four samples. As seen, the low-magnification of the SEM images of the composites with x = 0, x = 0.1, x = 0.05, and x = 0.15 exhibit obvious differences in morphologies, as shown in Fig. 2(a), 2(d), Fig. S3(a) and S3(c), respectively. For the pristine NFVP sample (x = 0), a significant number of irregularly shaped particles clustered together, resulting in the formation of considerably larger particles with a relatively broad size range, spanning from 1 to 20 μm. However, such aggregation has been significantly suppressed in the K-doped samples. As the level of K doping rises, the extent of particle aggregation initially diminishes and then increases. Specially, among these samples, x = 0.1 sample displays a relatively uniform and smaller particle size, ranging from tens of nanometers to a few micrometers. Fig. 2(b), 2(e), Fig. S3(b), S3(d) show the high magnification of the SEM images of x = 0, x = 0.1, x = 0.05 and x = 0.15 composites. As can be seen, x = 0 sample exhibits a smooth surface formed by the close packing of particles, while the K-doped samples show porous and loose surface morphologies. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the selected x = 0 and x = 0.1 composites, shown in Fig. 2(c) and (f), suggest that a uniform amorphous carbon coating layer with a thickness of approximately 7 nm thickness was continuously anchored on the surface of NFVP. And from the insets, it is observed that the distinguishable lattice fringes of the x = 0 and x = 0.1 samples have d-spacings of 0.432 nm and 0.443 nm respectively, which match well with the (110) planes of NFVP phase. From the results, the decreased particle size, porous and loose surface morphologies, as well as larger spacing of lattice fringes in K-doped samples, facilitate the diffusion and transport of Na+ within the electrode.",
                "In order to further evaluate the effects of K+ doping in NFVP, the electrochemical properties of the Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C(x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) samples were systemically measured by using half-cells. Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S4(a)-(c) display the CV curves of the Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C samples for initial four cycles at 0.2 mV s−1, respectively. As seen, the four samples show similar shape with two pairs of redox peaks approximately centered at 3.35/3.51 V and 2.41/2.58 V. These peaks correspond to the reversible redox reactions involving V3+/V4+ and Fe2+/Fe3+, respectively [26,34]. For the material with x = 0.1, the differences in potential between the two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks are 0.16 V and 0.17 V, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of x = 0 (0.42 V and 0.38 V), x = 0.05 (0.27 V and 0.30 V) and x = 0.15 (0.20 V and 0.19 V) materials. The lower potential difference of the x = 0.1 material suggests that the K-doped sample possesses lower polarization and enhanced diffusion kinetics of Na+ ions, which is beneficial for the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Na+. The smaller potential difference observed in x = 0.1 sample indicates that the K-doped sample exhibits reduced polarization and improved diffusion kinetics for Na+ ions. Moreover, compared to the x = 0, 0.05 and 0.15 samples, the x = 0.1 sample shows a well-overlapped subsequent three cycles of CV curves following the 1st cycle, even in the enlarged picture between 3.25 and 3.55 V was shown in Fig. S5, suggesting good reversibility of x = 0.1 cathode [30,45]. Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S6(a)-(c) show the galvanostatic charge/discharge voltage curves of the x = 0.1, 0, 0.05, 0.15 samples for the initial three cycles at 0.2C (1C = 110mAh g−1), respectively. It is evident that the initial charge curve differs from the subsequent ones for all the samples. It can be ascribed to the higher open circuit voltage which causes the exclusive presence of V3+/V4+ oxidation reaction, except the Fe2+/Fe3+, and then inducing the initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 100 %. All the electrodes exhibit two distinct plateaus at approximately 2.5 V and 3.4 V, corresponding to the Fe2+/Fe3+ and V3+/V4+ redox reactions, respectively. These observations align well with the findings from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. With the increase in the doping amount of K+, the capacity of K-doped NFVP materials first increased and then declined. Specifically, the x = 0.1 sample displays the highest capacity of 109.9 mAh g−1 during the first discharge process, while the values of x = 0, x = 0.05, and x = 0.15 sample are 101.7 mAh g−1, 104.6 mAh g−1, and 102.6 mAh g−1, respectively. Moreover, Fig. S6(d) and Table S1 shows the gap in potential plateau between charge and discharge for the four electrodes. As seen, the potential gap for the x = 0, 0.05 and 0.15 samples are 0.05, 0.03, and 0.04 V respectively. The x = 0.1 electrode demonstrates the smallest potential difference (0.02 V), implying the enhanced redox kinetics.",
                "The long-term cycling capability of the Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C were tested at 5C in Fig. 3(c). As shown, compared to the pristine sample (x = 0), the K-doped samples present improved cycling capability, and the x = 0.1 sample exhibits the best electrochemical performance. In detail, the x = 0, x = 0.05 and x = 0.15 composites deliver reversible discharge capacities of 50.54, 68.65 and 66.26 mAh g−1 after 2500 cycles and the corresponding capacity retention rates are 65.5 %, 78.3 % and 76.8 %, respectively (based on the first discharge capacities of 77.16, 87.68 and 86.23 mAh g−1 for x = 0, x = 0.05 and x = 0.15 electrodes). The x = 0.1 composite can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 83.85 mAh g−1 after 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of 91.7 % (based on the first discharge capacity of 91.43 mAh g−1). Correspondingly, the charge/discharge curves of all Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3 @C electrodes during the selected cycles are shown in Fig. 3(d) and Fig. S7(a)-(c). As the number of cycles increases, the discharge/charge plateau x = 0 sample cannot be found obviously. However, the K-doped NFVP samples still remain the obvious potential plateau. Especially, the potential curves from 100th to 800th cycle for the x = 0.1 electrode overlapped well, suggesting a relatively stable cycling performance. In addition to their exceptional cycling performance, the K-doped electrodes exhibit enhanced rate capacities compared to the pristine NFVP (x = 0). The rate performance of all the electrodes was measured at varying current densities, ranging from 0.2C to 20.0C, and then recovered 0.2C (in Fig. 3(e)). The rate capacity testing was conducted for eight cycles at each C-rate. Obviously, the x = 0.1 electrode possesses the best rate capability, delivering average discharge capacities of 109.85, 105.52, 102.22, 98.82, 93.98 and 88.50 mAh g−1 at the rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0C, respectively. Conversely, the corresponding values for the x = 0 electrode are only 100.06, 89.25, 85.22, 78.69, 68.08 and 56.63 mAh g−1. Remarkably, the x = 0.1 sample still exhibits 83.88 mAh g−1, even at 20.0C. However the values for x = 0, x = 0.05 and x = 0.15 electrodes are only 39.15, 64.58 and 58.65 mAh g−1, respectively. Upon the current rate decreasing back to 0.2C, the reversible discharge capacity of 108.25 mAh g−1 can be obtained for the x = 0.1 electrode, which is about 98.5 % of its initial value (109.94 mAh g−1), demonstrating the good reversibility even after many cycles at high C-rate. For comparison, the ratio values of x = 0, 0.05 and 0.15 are only 90.1 %, 92.4 % and 91.8 %, respectively. Fig. 3(f) and Fig. S8(a)-(c) exhibit the corresponding galvanostatic charge and discharge curves at 0.2C - 20.0C. Compared to the other three samples, we can see that the x = 0.1 electrode still shows the two obvious voltage plateaus even at the high rates, and the curves are also well overlapped. In summary, compared to the pristine NFVP material, the K+ doped materials, especially the x = 0.1 sample, exhibit a significant enhanced electrochemical performance. This can be attributed to the following three aspects: (1) The nano/μm-sized particles of the K-doped NFVP can increase the area of electrode/electrolyte contact and reduce the diffusion distance for Na+ ions; (2) The uniform carbon layer coated on the surface of particles can effectively improve the electronic conductivity of the material, buffer the volume expansion and maintain a stable structure during the charge and discharge processes; (3) The expanded lattice caused by K+ doping can promote the diffusion of Na+ ions in the lattice, and the K+ in the NFVP also acts as a pillar to stabilize the host structure and suppress the volume change during the desodiation/sodiation process, thereby presenting an enhanced electrochemical performance.",
                "To gain a deeper insight into the impact of K+ doping within NFVP material on sodium ion diffusion kinetics, various sweep rate of CV measurements from 0.1 to 2.0 mV s−1 were conducted, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S9(a)-(c). The electrochemical behavior was analyzed using the following equation:(1)",
                "i = avb",
                "In this equation, i stands for the peak current, v represents the scan rate, a and b are derived from the linear fit of log(i) versus log(v). When the value of b is close to 0.5, it suggests a Faradaic diffusion-limited mechanism, whereas the b close to 1 indicate the capacitance-controlled electrochemical behavior. The b values of the selected oxidation peak (at about 3.5 V) are calculated to be 0.82, 0.67, 0.78, and 0.73 for x = 0.1, 0, 0.05 and 0.15, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S9(d)-(f). This suggests that the capacitive process dominantly controls the kinetic behavior for all the samples. Additionally, the proportion of capacitive contribution during sodium storage can be determined by employing the equation below [46,47]:(2)",
                "i v = k1 v + k2 v 1 / 2here, k1v corresponds to the capacitive capacity, while k2v1/2 represents the diffusive capacity. For instance, the proportion of pseudocapacitive contribution for x = 0.1 was calculated as 84.7 % at 0.4 mV s−1 (Fig. 4(c)). The capacitive contributions at various scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mV s−1 for x = 0.1, 0, 0.05 and 0.15 samples are exhibited in Fig. 4(d) and Fig. S10(a)-(c), respectively. As observed, the proportion of capacitive contribution steadily increases as the scan rate rises. More importantly, the x = 0.1 electrode shows the highest proportion of pseudocapacitive contribution at all scanning rates among the four samples. The contribution of the capacitive capacity for the x = 0.1 electrode rises from 80.3 % to 92.8 % as the scan rate varies from 0.1 to 2.0 mV s−1. These findings indicate that the primary mechanism for sodium-ion storage in the x = 0.1 electrode is pseudocapacitive-dominated sodium storage behavior. The high contribution of pseudocapacitive behavior indicates that x = 0.1 possesses a favorable kinetic characteristic between the active materials and electrolyte, which is beneficial for the fast charge-discharge capability of electrode, and the results align well with the above remarkable cyclic stability and rate capacity.",
                "To comprehensively understand the sodium storage mechanism for the x = 0.1 electrode during the process of charging and discharging, ex situ XRD test was conducted at different voltage states in the second cycle. The XRD patterns for the x = 0.1 sample, within the range of 10° to 80°, were recorded and presented in Fig. 5(a). All the diffraction peaks at different charge/discharge voltage states can be assigned to a space group of R-3c. The partially enlarged patterns in the range 2θ of 23°-24.5° and 35°-36° corresponding to the (2",
                "1 ¯3) and (300) planes were also shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively. During the desodiation process, the diffraction peaks initially shift towards higher 2θ angles, subsequently reverting to their initial positions during charge process, suggesting a highly reversible electrochemical reaction. It's worth noting that the shift of diffraction peaks is small, indicating minimal volume variation in a complete charge-discharge cycle.",
                "Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 electrodes was also conducted to assess the impact of K-doping on the kinetics of Na+ insertion/extraction. As illustrated in Fig. 5(d), all electrodes exhibit similar profiles, characterized by a semicircle corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a sloping line representing the Warburg impedance (Zw) in the low-frequency region [48]. Compared to the pristine sample, the K-doped electrode reveals a reduced charge transfer resistance. In detail, the charge transfer resistance of x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 electrodes are 350.8 Ω, 215.9 Ω, 116.7 Ω and 164.5 Ω, respectively. Therefore, the K-doped NFVP not only facilitates sodium transport but also increases the electronic conductivity of the material, leading to enhanced electrochemical performance.",
                "In order to reveal the origin for the enhanced rate performance of K-doped NFVP material, the galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) technique during the K+ insertion/extraction process was utilized to evaluate the sodium-ion diffusion coefficient. Fig. 5(e) shows the GITT curve of x = 0.1 sample after 20 cycles. The diffusion coefficient of Na+, denoted as DNa+, can be determined using the subsequent Eq. [49]:(3)",
                "D = 4 πτ m B V M M B S 2 △ E S △ E τ 2 τ < < L 2 Dwhere τ, mB, MB and VM represent the current pulse time (s), mass, molar mass, molar volume of the active material, respectively. And the S is the area of the electrode. The representations of ΔEs and ΔEτ parameters during the charge and discharge process are shown in Fig. S11(a) and (b), respectively. And it also can be seen that the current pulse time and the relaxation time are 1200 s and 4800 s, respectively. The calculated diffusion coefficients during charge and discharge process for the selected x = 0 and x = 0.1 electrodes are plotted in Fig. 5(f) and (g), respectively. As seen, the DNa + of x = 0.1 ranges from 3.3 × 10−9 to 1.2 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, which is higher than that of x = 0 (from 3.0 × 10−10 to 4.3 × 10−14 cm2 s−1). The significant enhancement in Na+ diffusion for the x = 0.1 sample can be attributed to K+ doping, which increases the lattice constant and subsequently leads to outstanding electrochemical performance.",
                "To further evaluate the practical application prospects, the Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3 @C (x = 0.1) and hard carbon (Kuraray) were used as the cathode and anode, respectively, to fabricate a sodium ion full cell (denoted as K-NFVP//HC). Before assembling, both Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C (x = 0.1) and hard carbon underwent a process of pre-sodiation in a half-cell, and the galvanostatic charge/discharge voltage plots are shown in Fig. 6(a). After that, the full cell was assembled and the galvanostatic charge/discharge voltage curves are exhibit in Fig. 6(b). The K-NFVP//HC cell delivers a discharge capacity of 90.38 mAh g−1 at 0.5C after 100 cycles a capacity retention of 89.4 % (compared to the first discharge capacity of 101.10 mAh g−1), as shown in Fig. 6(c). Significantly, the fabricated full cells can illuminate a set of LED lights(in the inset of Fig. 6(c)), showcasing their potential practical application."

                "In this work, a series of Na4-xKxFeV(PO4)3@C(x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) composites were synthesized via a facile sol-gel method followed by a high-temperature calcination process. The Na3.9K0.1FeV(PO4)3@C composite delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 83.85 mAh g−1 at 5C after 3000 cycles, with a capacity retention of 91.7 %. In addition, the Na3.9K0.1FeV(PO4)3@C electrode also presents an outstanding rate performance, with a discharge specific capacity of 83.88 mAh g−1 even at 20.0C. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the Na3.9K0.1FeV(PO4)3 @C electrode is attributed to its expanded Na ion transport channels, the improvement of structural stability, enhanced Na+ diffusion coefficient, and lower charge resistance through K-doping, which can be confirmed by the (ex situ) XRD, GITT and EIS measurements. Moreover, the various sweep rate CV measurements are also confirmed the pseudocapacitive-dominated sodium storage behavior, which leads to enhanced electrochemical kinetics. Meanwhile, the as-fabricated K-NFVP//HC full cell demonstrates a high reversible specific capacity (90.38 mAh g−1) and good cycling performance. This work provides a facile and economical approach for NFVP modifications, it is believed that the combinations of high performance, low-cost and low-toxicity make the NFVP cathode a strong competitor for large-scale SIBs cathodes. In addition, to further achieve the practical application of NFVP cathodes in the large-scale storage field, high safety and electrochemical performance across a wide temperature range are also key focuses of future research."
