                "Owning to the advantages of high operating voltage, long cycle life, high energy density and wide applicable temperature range, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have become an ideal choice for portable electronic devices.  However, the high cost of lithium resulting from limited lithium resources leads to a crucial limitation of LIBs for large-scale applications.  Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received a lot of attention, due to abundant, widely distributed sodium resources and the potential of lower-cost batteries for large-scale energy-storage applications.  However, due to heavier sodium ions, SIBs cannot compete with LIBs in terms of energy density. Therefore, the urgent problem of SIBs is to improve the energy density, especially the cathode material which is the limiting component in terms of operating voltage and specific capacity.",
                "Among the various cathode materials like layered oxides,  Prussian blue analogues,  and organic cathodes,  polyanions have been intensively investigated due to their 3D framework feature and a small volume change during sodium intercalation/deintercalation.  Particularly, NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3F3 (NVPF) has been considered one of the most promising cathode materials for SIBs. Because of its energy density (∼507 W h kg–1) and theoretical capacity (128 mA h g–1), which is an important milestone to approach the performance of commercial LIB cathodes (LiFePO4, 580 W h kg–1; LiMn2O4, 480 W h kg–1).  Nevertheless, the intrinsic poor electronic conductivity (10–12 S cm–1) and sluggish electrochemical kinetics-induced worse rate performance are primary problems impeding its further development.  Especially, the rate performance is a crucial indicator for large-scale application of batteries. Intensive efforts have been dedicated to developing strategies for facilitating Na+ migration and electron transfer to improve rate performance. Li et al. improved the kinetics of NVPF through uniformly compositing with reduced graphene oxide, and the composite delivered a high capacity of 59 mA h g–1 at 70 C.  Hu et al. successfully prepared spherical Br-doped NVPF/C by a one-step spray drying technology, and the unique spherical cathode exhibits a moderate capacity at a high rate (95.2 mA h g–1 at 30 C).  Li et al. improved the intrinsic ion/electronic conductivity of NVPF through Fe-substitution in NVPF/C on the vanadium site for high power SIBs, achieving a discharge capacity of 47.1 mA h g–1 at 80 C.  However, due to the low sodium bulk mobility in feature, it is rare to get the reported results of ultrahigh rate performances (above 100 C, charge and discharge less than 36 s), which is great significance to realize the rapid charging and discharge of energy-storage applications.",
                "Recently, 2D nanostructures with an ultrathin layered structure and infinite planar length have aroused the interest of researchers in energy storage, especially fast Li+ or Na+ migration with the following advantages.  First, its relatively large specific surface can provide abundant electrochemically active sites and short Na+ transport pathways. Second, its open layered structure is beneficial for the access of electrolyte ions and reduces volume change. However, the preparation of nanostructured NVPF with complicated multicomponent is a big challenge because of particle growth and aggregation during high-temperature treatment, let alone constructing a 2D nanostructure. Coating the inorganic sources (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and mesoporous carbon CMK-3) on the surfaces of NVPF is a facile way of enhancing the extrinsic electronic conductivity.  However, an inefficient electronic contact between these two components and their uneven distribution may lead to a limited improvement in the electrochemical performance. In addition, these commonly used inorganic sources are relatively expensive, which is less favorable for practical applications. Low-cost organic carbon sources should be considered to modify NVPF, while the homogeneity, thickness, and coverage rate of pyrolytic carbon should also be taken into account. The selection of organic carbon sources becomes critical for achieving a homogeneous carbon-coating layer. Therefore, it is still a challenge to develop a simple, effective, and economical method to synthesize NVPF/C with a 2D nanostructure and satisfactory carbon coating. A satisfactory structural model is one in which carbon is in situ coated on NVPF nanosheets. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, such a satisfactory structure has not been reported for NVPF cathodes.",
                "Here, in situ carbon-coated NVPF nanosheets (NVPFC-NS) were prepared by using cost-effective amylopectin as a carbon source and structure direction agent. The obtained nanosheets showed excellent cycling stability and impressively high rate performance (93 mA h g–1 at 60 C, 51 mA h g–1 at 150 C). The extraordinary performance of NVPFC-NS can be associated with its unique 2D nanostructure and in situ carbon coating. Furthermore, to achieve real applications of NVPFC-NS cathode, it also can be paired up to fabricate full cells, which presents satisfactory full-cell performances, suggesting its potential practical sodium storage applications."

First, 0.25 g of amylopectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25 g of urea (Aladdin) was initially put into 50 mL of distilled water under vigorous agitation for 10 min, then stoichiometric amounts of NH4VO3 (Aladdin), NH4H2PO4 (Aladdin), and NaF (Aladdin) were sequentially dissolved into the solution under agitation for 20 min, the obtained yellow turbid solution was poured into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept in an electric oven at 80 °C for 4 h. The resulting yellow transparent solution was frozen by a vacuum drying process for about 24 h. Then, the dried powder was annealed at 350 °C for 3 h and then at 650 °C for 8 h under an Ar atmosphere to yield the final product of NVPFC-NS. For comparison, a control experiment was also performed, the other experimental steps are the same, except that amylopectin was replaced with oxalate, and the obtained product was named NVPF-NP."

                "The schematic illustration of the preparation of NVPFC-NS is shown in . Briefly, urea, amylopectin, and NVPF precursors are added into deionized water forming a turbid solution (I), because both the NVPF precursor of NH4VO3 and amylopectin are all insoluble. After low-temperature hydrothermal treatment, the urea is hydrolyzed and releases ammonia, and then reacts with the hydroxyl along the polymer chain of amylopectin to form amino by hydroxy ammonolysis, turning the amylopectin from hydrophobic to hydrophilic; in addition, NVPF precursor (NH4VO3) is also soluble in ammonia water, in good agreement with the final obtained transparent solution shown in II. Due to the redox reaction between oxidant of the NVPF precursor (NH4VO3) and reductant of amino along the polymer chain of modified amylopectin, NVPF tends to nucleate along the polymer chain of amylopectin to form 2D nanosheets after heat treatment; meanwhile, pyrolytic carbon derived from amylopectin is in situ coated on the nanosheets.",
                "The XRD patterns of NVPFC-NS and NVPF-NP were collected and plotted, as shown in a. All diffraction peaks can be unambiguously assigned to a single-phase of NVPF, consistent with the JCPDS data (PDF#01-089-8485) and the reported literature without carbon,  speculating that the small amount of carbon has a rare impact on the phase structure of NVPF. The carbon contents of both samples are further tested by thermogravimetry (TG) (b). There is almost no carbon in NVPF-NP, indicating the carbon derived from pyrolytic oxalic acid is only enough to reduce the precursors in the calcining process, and no extra carbon is left in the final product. While NVPFC-NS had a modest carbon content of 6 wt % derived from pyrolytic amylopectin. As shown in c, the Raman spectrum of the NVPFC-NS sample shows obvious characteristic peaks of carbonaceous materials at ≈1356 (D band) and 1579 cm–1 (G band), suggesting the existence of carbon in the composite. A much higher intensity ratio of D versus G band (ID/IG = 1.06) compared with that of ordered synthetic graphite (ID/IG = 0.09) demonstrates a higher degree of disorder for the carbon present in the coated NVPF.  However, only a few bands in the range of 250–1100 cm–1 can be detected in NVPF-NP, verifying again that almost no carbon is left in this sample.",
                "XPS was used to further understand the chemical compositions of the carbon in NVPFC-NS. The N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into three peaks located at 398.4, 400.2, and 401.4 eV, which are attributed to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and N–C═O bond, suggesting the doped N species in the carbon matrix (d).  C 1s spectra further confirm the existence of the N in this composite which is derived from the precursor of urea (e). These results can also explain the relatively lower intensity ratio of ID/IG of the NVPFC-NS sample, which might be attributed to the structural changes of carbon caused by the increase in disorder and the influence of N doping. The N-doped carbon is more favorable to conductivity and can provide more active sites or defects for sodium storage.  The XPS spectra of F 1s and V 2p of NVPFC-NS are also supplied to confirm the element valance states. As shown in , the dominant peak at 683.2 eV can be assigned to F 1s, which is associated with the V–F bond.  shows the V 2p XPS core level of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 peaks with binding energies located at 517.3 and 524 eV, respectively, demonstrating the trivalent V in NVPFC-NS.  The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the NVPFC-NS and NVPF-NP are shown in f. The NVPFC-NS material displays a type-IV isotherm of mesoporous characteristic with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area up to 28.9 m2 g–1, which is larger than that of NVPF-NP (16.5 m2 g–1). The pore-size distribution curves of both samples determined by the BJH method are provided. As shown in , the pore size distribution results confirm again of their mesoporous properties. The pore-size distribution of NVPFC-NS centered around 3.87 nm is more uniform than that of NVPF-NP. In addition, NVPF-NP also has micropores. The relatively high surface area and mesoporous structures of NVPFC-NS are believed to be advantages of providing more active sites and an easy pathway for electrolyte penetration, facilitating the migration of Na+ at high-rate charge/discharge operations.",
                "a and b display the SEM images of NVPFC-NS and show the as-prepared sample has a 3D cross-linked structure constructed by interconnected nanosheets. Generally, the electrode materials with 3D architectures composed of 2D nanosheets present improved performance, which is conducive to obtaining high power by shortening diffusion paths and energy density by increasing loading per unit area.  The higher magnification SEM image of c also displays that the nanosheets are interconnected with each other with macropores between them. Macroporous structure yields superior performance with high power density, which can serve as Na+/electron transfer shortcuts in dense structure and lead to rapid response to fluctuant current densities.  The SEM and TEM images of NVPF-NP are also provided in , and the SEM images show that the NVPF-NP is composed of nanoparticles with slight agglomeration. TEM images display the nanoparticles agglomerate together matched well with its SEM result.",
                "The TEM image of NVPFC-NS, shown in d, further confirms its unique 3D architecture constructed by continuous wrinkled nanosheets. e shows the HRTEM image, presenting obvious lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.151 nm and 0.452 nm, coinciding well with the lattice space of (335) and (200) facets of NVPF, respectively. In addition, amorphous carbon in situ coated on the nanosheets can also be seen at the edge, which ensures the rapid transfer of electrons across the nanosheets. The SAED image shown in f certifies the existence of (200) facet with the other two crystal facets of (111) and (002) of NVPF. g shows the dark-field image of d and the corresponding elemental mappings of carbon (C), vanadium (V), nitrogen (N), and fluorine (F), indicating that all the elements are uniformly distributed on the nanosheets.",
                "To evaluate the performances of NVPFC-NS in the batteries, coin-type cells of the NVPFC-NS cathode of SIBs were assembled with sodium metal as the anode and tested in the voltage range from 2.3 to 4.5 V, where the specific capacities were calculated based on the total mass of the composites. Owing to the unique structure of NVPFC-NS with carbon in situ coated on 2D nanosheets, the NVPFC-NS electrode delivered a high initial capacity of 129 mA h g–1 with 97.6% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 C (a), which shows the higher initial capacity and capacity retention compared with NVPF-NP. b shows the rate performances of both samples with a 300-fold increase in current density (from 0.5 to 150 C). The NVPFC-NS electrode delivers an average discharge capacity of 132, 115, 110, 104, 93, and 65 mA h g–1 at the corresponding rates of 0.5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 100 C, respectively. Even at a high rate of 150 C (charge/discharge within 24 s), a highly reversible capacity of 51 mA h g–1 could still be achieved. More importantly, when such an ultra-high current density of 150 C returns to 0.5 C, a remarkable specific capacity of 130 mA h g–1 could turn back as well, because these in situ carbon-coated nanosheets with 3D integrated connected networks could not only achieve highly effective, continuously short and ultrafast pathways of both electrons and Na+ but also buffer the variation of volume originated from the repeated extraction/insertion of Na+. However, the sample of NVPF-NP without carbon coating exhibits a very inferior rate performance.",
                "The charge and discharge profiles of NVPFC-NS under different rates are displayed in c. Three distinct charge and discharge plateaus located at 3.4/3.2, 3.7/3.6, and 4.2/4.1 V are observed at 0.5 C corresponding to reversible extraction/insertion of two sodium ions. Note that the first two plateaus could be ascribed to Na+ (de)intercalation from Na (2) sites by a two-step process, while the higher potential at about 4.2 V is attributed to the (de)intercalation of the other Na+ from Na(1) sites.  Besides, as the rate increased, though presenting an obvious IR drop due to increased inner resistance of the cell, the voltage profiles of NVPFC-NS still show clear plateaus at all rates from 0.5 to 150 C, also confirming its superior rate performance and ultrafast kinetics of extraction/insertion.",
                "On basis of a comprehensive summary (d), to the best of our knowledge, this is the best rate capability among recently reported NVPF/C composites for SIBs,  further demonstrating its advancement for ultrafast Na storage. Remarkably, the cycling performance of NVPFC-NS is outstanding as well. As shown in e, the sample attains a reversible discharge capacity of 102 mA h g–1 at the completion of 500 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 93% relative to the first cycle, maintaining almost 100% Coulombic efficiency, highlighting the advantages of this in situ carbon-coated nanosheets-constructed 3D cross-linked cathode material in cycling performance.  shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the NVPFC-NS sample after 500 cycles at 10 C. Although the surface of NVPFC-NS has some cracks due to the variation of volume induced by Na+ continuous insertion/extraction processes. The overall 2D nanosheet structure still exists, benefitting from the carbon in situ coated on the active material surface as the skeleton of the material preventing the collapse of the 2D structure. Besides, the HRTEM image shows that the active material still retains excellent crystalline after a long cycle ().",
                "To more deeply understand the remarkable high-rate performance of this cathode material, the CV was performed with different scan rates from 0.1 to 10 mV s–1 for NVPFC-NS, as shown in a. The three pairs of redox peaks (O1/R1, O2/R2, and O3/R3) correspond to reversible extraction/insertion of two sodium ions, which is in good agreement with their charge/discharge profile results. The well-defined three pairs of redox peaks still exist even when the sweep speed increases to 10 mV s–1, indicating rapid kinetics of the electrochemical reaction. The redox pseudocapacitance-like contribution in the NVPFC-NS sample was also analyzed by researching the kinetics (b). The degree of capacitive effect can be qualitatively analyzed according to the relationship between measured current (i) and scan rate (v) from the CV curves: i = avb, the value of b is calculated from the slope of the linear plot of log i versus log ν.  It is well known that for a diffusion-controlled process, b approaches 0.5, while for a surface capacitance-dominated process b is close to 1.0.  The calculated b-values of these three pairs of redox peaks are all around 0.7, close to 0.5, suggesting a diffusion-controlled process of sodium (de)intercalation for NVPFC-NS. The slightly higher b-values might be attributed to the fact that in situ carbon-coated nanosheets can provide fast transfers for Na+ ions and electrons, which ensures an outstanding high rate performance of the NVPFC-NS electrode. CV curves at different scan rates and b values at different potentials of the NVPF-NP electrode are also provided in . As shown in , at lower scan rates, three pairs of redox peaks are obviously presented in CV curves, corresponding to its typical redox reaction potentials. With the increase of scan rates, the peaks gradually widen and the polarization gradually increases, suggesting poor electrochemical reaction kinetics.  reveals the calculated b values, which are close to 0.5, suggesting a diffusion-controlled process.",
                "As shown in c,d, the good linear relationships for plots of peak current (Ip) versus square root of the scan rate (v1/2) also confirm that the sodium (de)intercalation reactions are controlled by a diffusion process. For the semi-infinite and finite diffusion, the peak current is proportional to the square root of the scan rate and can be expressed by the classical Randles–Sevcik equation: Ip = 2.69 × 105n3/2AD1/2Cv1/2, where Ip is the peak current, A corresponds to the active area in cm2, D is the Na+ diffusion coefficient in cm2 s–1, n represents the number of transferred electrons, v is the scanning rate in V s–1, and C is the concentration of Na+ in mol cm–3. The calculated D values of NVPFC-NS are 2.07 × 10–8 (O1), 1.118 × 10–7 (O2), 1.116 × 10–7 (O3), 2.25 × 10–8 (R1), 8.02 × 10–8 (R2), and 9.6 × 10–8 (R3), which are almost 2 order of magnitude higher than those reported previously by the same the calculation method (), demonstrating that the rational design of in situ carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanosheets not only shortens the Na+ transfer path but also improves the electronic conductivity during the charging/discharging process.",
                "Besides, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are performed to better understand the superior rate performance of the in situ carbon-coated NVPF nanosheets for sodium energy storage with frequencies ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The Nyquist plots of the NVPFC-NS and NVPF-NP electrodes are all made up of a semicircle in the high-frequency range and a sloped straight line in the low-frequency range, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg impedance, respectively. As shown in , the NVPFC-NS electrode displays a smaller Rct (84.5 Ω) than that of the NVPF-NP electrode (129.5 Ω), while a steeper line than that of the NVPF-NP electrode, suggesting the NVPFC-NS possesses a faster charge transfer and reduced Na+ diffusion impedance, which can be ascribed to the mesoporous structured NVPFC-NS with a relatively high surface area facilitating charge transfer between active material and electrolyte, and in situ carbon-coated nanosheets prompting fast transports of both electrons and Na+.",
                "Considering the advantages of NVPFC-NS discussed above, it was used as the cathode to pair up porous carbon (PC) as the anode to fabricate full cells. The porous carbon anode material was synthetized by using modified polyacrylonitrile as the carbon source.  The current density and specific capacity of the full cell shown in a,d are all based on the mass of NVPFC-NS. Following conventions, the desodiation process of NVPFC-NS is defined to be charged, and the sodiation process is defined to be discharged. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles in a demonstrate three sloping stages suggesting a combination effect from both the intercalation cathode and the pseudocapacitive anode. The overlapped charge–discharge profiles of the initial three cycles illustrate the excellent reversibility of NVPFC-NS//PC full cells and display a remarkably reversible capacity of 109 mA h g–1. Notably, the charge capacity increases from the first to the second cycle due to further activation of the material. Considering that the capacity mismatch between the two electrodes will affect the full cell’s performance, the mass ratio of the active material for the cathode and anode should be optimized. For achieving the highest energy/power density, this mass ratio is determined to be 1.5:1 according to the result shown in b (all the data are obtained based on this mass ratio). The Ragone plot with a mass ratio of 1.5:1 also reveals the relationship between energy and power density. As expected, the assembled NVPFC-NS//PC fuel cell delivers a maximum energy density of 94.8 W h kg–1 at a low power density of 155.4 W kg–1. As power density increases to 7295 W kg–1, the energy density of this full cell can still reach 44.5 W h kg–1. Note that the energy and power densities of the full cells were all calculated based on the active materials in both electrodes by  and  (see ).  More importantly, as shown in c, apart from the power density can get to an appropriate value, which can rival the power density of supercapacitors, our assembled full cell still maintains the comparable energy density of traditional lithium-ion batteries. We also compare the Ragone plots of NVPFC-NS//PC full cells with other reported Na-ion storage devices (). As disclosed, our device exhibits the highest energy and power densities in comparison to others. Moreover, the charge/discharge capacity of the full cell was maintained at about 61 mA h g–1 even after 200 cycles at 1000 mA g–1(d), achieving a capacity retention of 93.7% during the entire cycle process, demonstrating a relatively stable cycling performance. The electrochemical performance of full cells based on NVPF-NP//PC is also provided shown in . Three pairs of charge–discharge platforms can still be observed in continuous slope galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles, indicating the electrochemical properties of cathode and anode electrodes are displayed simultaneously. However, the NVPF-NP//PC full cell displays a poorer cycling performance than that of the NVPFC-NS//PC full cell, only less than 40 mA h g–1 capacity can be obtained after 200 cycles at 100 mA g–1. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the device in tentative applications by driving a mini fan. After fast charging to 3.8 V, a single sodium-ion full cell was able to drive a mini fan (inset of b, Video S1, ), which suggests the high-power output of this full cell for practical applications."

                "In summary, we have demonstrated a low-cost and scalable amylopectin-assisted synthesis of in situ carbon-coated NVPF nanosheet-constructed 3D cathode material, where the amylopectin functions as both an organic carbon source and structure direction agent. Electrochemical tests of the obtained sample exhibit good electrochemical performance for sodium storage, especially in terms of the superior rate capability (93 mA h g–1 at 60 C, 51 mA h g–1 at 150 C) as well as long cycling stability (≈93% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 10 C), because its unique in situ carbon-coated 2D nanostructure shorten the Na+ diffusion length and endows the composites with effective electron transport. Moreover, when applied to full cells, it still demonstrates a remarkably high energy density of 94.8 W h kg–1 and a power density of 7295 W kg–1 with excellent cycling performance in the voltage range of 1.0–3.8 V.
