                "As fossil fuels become depleted, the search for renewable energy sources, such as solar, hydropower, wind, biomass, and tidal resources, has intensified in the past decade. This is due to the appealing characteristics of these energy forms in terms of huge development potential, green, pollution-free use, recyclability, and low exploitation costs.  In this context, the development of more advanced large-scale electrical energy storage technologies is critical. ",
                "Some of the most suitable energy storage systems include lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)  and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).  Among them, LIBs are already employed in several daily activities and industrial fields, ranging from portable electronic gadgets to grid-scale storage.  As a result of their high energy density and reliability, it is expected that LIBs will be used in large-scale applications, including pure electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and hybrid plug-in electric vehicles (HPEVs).  On the other hand, SIBs have garnered much research interest as an excellent alternative to LIBs thanks to their abundant sodium resources, suitable redox potential, low cost, and similar storage mechanism to LIBs.  However, Na+ ions have a larger radius (1.06 Å vs 0.76 Å for Li+), heavier molar mass (23.0 g mol–1 for Na vs 6.9 g mol–1 for Li), and higher ionization potential, meaning that SIBs face challenges, for example,  delayed ion transport and reaction kinetics that diminish their energy outputs.  As a result, the selection of suitable electrode materials remains tricky. ",
                "The anode material, the principal component of a lithium-ion cell, plays a vital role in limiting the energy density and accounts for 10–15% of the overall battery cost.  The first commercialized anode material, graphite, has been extensively studied, but numerous inherent disadvantages, such as limited rate capability and theoretical capacity (372 mAh g–1), make its long-term practical deployment rather complicated.  Other carbon-based materials, particularly multiwalled carbon nanotubes and graphene, have shown promising performance, with reversible capacities between 250 and 750 mAh g–1.  Nonetheless, these anode materials still have relatively low energy densities, which are insufficient to address the increasing demand for energy storage.  Therefore, the development of higher capacity anode materials is of crucial importance for the deployment of LIBs and SIBs. ",
                "Due to their unique layered structure and excellent energy storage performance, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which have the general formula MX2 (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Mo, W, Ti, or V; X = S or Se), are being widely investigated as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs,  particularly layer-structured tungsten disulfide (WS2). Due to its higher theoretical capacity (∼433 mAh g–1 vs 372 mAh g–1 for graphite) and larger interlayer spacing (0.62 nm vs 0.34 nm for graphite), WS2 is capable of hosting Li+ and Na+ ions, which offers beneficial conditions for rapid intercalation and deintercalation.  Moreover, the presence of weak van der Waals interactions between WS2 layers, enables it to form graphene-like structures (thin nanosheets), fullerene-like (semispherical or polyhedral) and nanotube (tubular) ones.  Actually, several works have reported the preparation and electrode application of 2H-WS2 (hexagonal) platelets;  results demonstrated that 2H-WS2 has poor electrical conductivity and serious volume variation during cycling, narrowing its practical applications. ",
                "Various approaches have been proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance of 2H-WS2 flakes. These include partial elemental doping/substitution,  carbon coating,  morphological tailoring,  and nanoarchitecture.  One of the most used strategies is to prepare carbon-WS2 hybrids; this involves different carbonaceous sources, such as ordered mesoporous carbon,  glucose,  citric acid,  and carbon spheres,  which can improve the electrical conductivity of the materials. Sucrose, with the chemical formula C12H22O11, is deemed to be one of the best carbon sources for the homogeneous surface coating. In fact, 2H-WS2 flakes have been widely studied for LIBs or SIBs, whereas the Li-storage and Na-storage performances of WS2 nanotubes (NTs-WS2) have rarely been explored in detail.  These nanotubes have closed cage structure, which bestows them chemical stability and limits volume expansion. Furthermore, we may take advantage of the nanostructure properties (a large specific surface area, favorable electrical conductivity, and desired highly active sites) of the NTs-WS2, which are not presented in the platelets.  The carbon film can be formed around the surface of the nanotubes via a carbonization process. Indeed, carbon coating is a popular technique; however, in current work the carbon coating was done on the nanotubes and not on the platelets as previously. In this regard, utilizing NTs-WS2 for preparation of carbon-WS2 hybrids may combine the distinct properties of the nanotube configuration with the carbonaceous film. Herein, the conformal coating of the nanotubes by a thin carbonaceous film provided extra cycling stability and improved the electronic conductivity of the nanocomposites.",
                "In line with this trend, our simple, fast, and inexpensive production method involves precipitation of sucrose precursor on WS2 nanotubes and their subsequent pyrolysis, forming carbon-coated NTs-WS2 (NTs-WS2@C) nanocomposites. The crystal structure, morphology, and composition of the produced NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites were thoroughly studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM-EDX) techniques. The metal ions intercalation/deintercalation processes of the electrode were investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time  sucrose was employed as an organic carbon source for the coating of one-dimensional (1D) WS2 nanotubes. Such a facile synthesis method resulted in the formation of pure NTs-WS2@C products in high yield. Therefore, this type of carbon coating provides an attractive alternative strategy for designing and modifying WS2 nanotubes. The NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites exhibited remarkable electrochemical properties that mark them attractive anode materials for LIBs and SIBs. Commercial 2H-WS2 powder was used as a reference for comparing the electrochemical performance and then for emphasizing the novelty of NTs-WS2@C."

                "The XRD spectra of the two principal samples (NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C) are presented in a. The peaks of pristine NTs-WS2 correspond well with the (International Centre for Diffraction Data-Powder Diffraction File) ICDD-PDF card of hexagonal WS2 (No. 08-0237). The diffractogram of NTs-WS2@C is identical to that of NTs-WS2, pointing that the carbon coating processes did not affect the crystallinity of NTs-WS2 and no new crystalline phases were generated during the calcination step. Furthermore, any carbon diffraction peaks resulting from sucrose were not observed due to the minimal amount of carbon present on the particle. ",
                "b presents the Raman spectra of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C. The two characteristic bands located at 351 and 419 cm–1 are assigned to the typical in-plane E2g1 and out-of-plane A1g vibration modes of WS2, respectively, indicating on the preservation of high crystallinity of NTs-WS2 after carbon coating and thermal treatment. For the NTs-WS2@C sample, the Raman signals at 1354 and 1600 cm–1 correspond to the D-band and G-band of carbon, indicating on the signatures of sucrose-derived carbon after thermal treatment. The D-band is characterized by disorder originating from the edge or defected sites of the carbon structure, whereas the G-band can be associated with the sp2 hybridization mode of the graphitic carbon structure.  The intensity ratio of the D-band peak to the G-band peak (ID/IG) is related to the degree of graphitization. The ID/IG of the NTs-WS2@C sample herein is estimated to be 0.85, implying the high disorder feature of carbon in NTs-WS2 after pyrolysis at 550 °C for 8 h. In addition, the increase in defects and disordered regions caused by the introduction of a carbon coating in NTs-WS2 can be conducive to electronic and ionic diffusion.  It is also worth noting that the mostly intensive Raman scattering peaks for NTs-WS2@C are observed below 1000 cm–1, which is in agreement with the crystalline nature of NTs-WS2.",
                "TGA helps to identify the carbon content in NTs-WS2@C material considering that all carbon was oxidized to CO2, while WS2 was oxidized to WO3 and SO2 during the heating in the presence of oxygen. NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C underwent a TGA measurement under the same conditions (30–850 °C) to obtain weight variation. As shown in c, both materials lost about 1% of their weight up to 300 °C, which might be due to residual moisture and traces of sulfur. The major decomposition started for both materials at ≈400 °C and was finished at ≈570 °C without any additional process taking place when heated up to 850 °C. The total weight losses for NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C are 8% and 13%, respectively. The weight loss for pristine NTs-WS2 implies that WS2 was oxidized into WO3 (theoretical weight loss 6.5%). The weight loss of NTs-WS2@C is ≈13%, which reflects the WS2 oxidation to WO3 as well as the amorphous carbon oxidation to CO2.  Based on the assumption that the residual phases after the completion of the TGA test are pure WO3; the carbon content in NTs-WS2@C is estimated to be ≈5%.",
                "As shown in d and e, N2 adsorption–desorption analyses of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C exhibit similar type IV isotherms followed by a H3 hysteresis loop, revealing their mesoporous structures; such a configuration can be attributed to the interlayer spaces and hollow core within WS2 nanotubes and the spaces between the intercrossed WS2 nanotubes.  The carbon coating of NTs-WS2 has a significant effect on the surface area and total pore volume, as shown in . The specific surface areas of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C are 19.19 m2 g–1 (with pore size distributions centered at 24 and 27.07 nm) and 50.09 m2 g–1 (characterized by the pore size distributions centered at 3.65 and 24 nm), respectively. It has to be highlighted that the measured surface area for NTs-WS2@C is higher (≈2.5 times), indicating better separation of the nanotubes after the hybridization-mixing process and, therefore, better deagglomeration and lower van der Waals attraction between carbon-coated nanotubes. In turn, the increased specific surface area may offer more reaction sites for ions migration and guarantee sufficient contact area between electrode and electrolyte.  The pore size distribution of each sample was examined with the assistance of the (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) BJH method (f). When compared to NTs-WS2 (0.596 cm2 g–1), the introduction of a carbon coating results in a big  decrease (4 times) in total pore volume (0.138 cm2 g–1). Such porous structures may not only markedly minimize the diffusion path for Li+/Na+ ions but also effectively reduce the volume change of electrode materials during the charge/discharge process, thereby improving the electrochemical kinetics. ",
                "SEM and TEM were used to examine the morphological features of the different samples (commercial 2H-WS2, NTs-WS2, and NTs-WS2@C), as shown in . The commercial WS2 sample is formed by aggregates of interconnected micron-sized primary 2H crystals ranging from 1 to 5 μm, presenting a platelet-shaped configuration, as depicted in a. The pristine NTs-WS2 sample has tubular shape with diameter distributions ranging typically from 50 to 400 nm and lengths ranging between 2 and 10 μm (see b). c reveals that, in NTs-WS2@C, the tubular structure of WS2 was preserved after carbon coating and the diameters of the nanotubes were slightly decreased (50 to 200 nm). Meanwhile, d shows the SEM-EDS elemental mappings of W, S, and C, which demonstrate the uniform distribution of all elements throughout the specimen.",
                "The TEM images illustrate a hollow tubular structure assembled by multiwall WS2 (e–f). As shown previously,  the interlayer spacing for nanotubes (inset of e) usually exceeds the corresponding distance in bulk 2H-WS2 (0.62 nm), which can be put down to the high levels of stress within the bent layered structure. High-resolution TEM demonstrates that the NTs-WS2 sample is highly crystalline and multilayered (10–15 layers), with an interlayer spacing of 0.63 nm, which corresponds to the (002) interplanar distance (g).",
                "The presence of a carbon coating covering the NTs-WS2 uniformly is observed in inset of i. j displays the HAADF-STEM-EDS elemental mappings, which indicate that the W and S elements are evenly distributed within the WS2 nanotubes and the C on the nanotube surface. The HRTEM image (k) indicates a layer distance of 0.64 nm, which refers to the (002) interplanar distance. The mostly multichiral nature of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C is implied by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (h and l), which show scattered diffraction spots rather than continuous diffraction rings. In addition, the amount of carbon (≈5 wt %) is too small and is just not visible compared to the strong diffraction from crystalline NTs-WS2.  shows the morphological features of the NTs-WS2@C individual nanotube at different sides of its volume (left, middle, and right). Due to the low carbon contents (≈5%) in NTs-WS2@C, there is no apparent difference in these TEM images, which reflects the fact that the overall crystallinity of the multiwall WS2 nanotubes is rather high.",
                "These findings ( and ) suggest that the synthesis method and conditions used in this study can yield high-purity and high-quality NTs-WS2@C composite material. Moreover, the formation of a carbon coating in mild conditions (at 550 °C) has no deleterious effect on the integrity of NTs-WS2, which could be beneficial for high-capacity conversion reactions during the lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes. ",
                "XPS analysis was carried out to shed light on the oxidation states of NTs-WS2@C, as reported in . The XPS survey spectrum for NTs-WS2@C is presented in a, exhibiting W, S, and C elements, which correspond to the sample composition. The high-resolution XPS spectra of W 4f and S 2p confirm the existence of WS2 compound, as shown in b and c. One pair of peaks at 32.6 and 34.7 eV is observed in the core-level spectrum of W 4f, which can be assigned to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 characteristic peaks for the W–S bond. The W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 characteristic peaks for the W–O bond are represented by the other pair of peaks at 36.0 and 38.0 eV, which can be attributed to the inevitable partial surface oxidation of the NTs-WS2@C sample prior to XPS measurement. Besides, a peak at 38.4 eV is assigned to W 5p3/2. The NTs-WS2@C sample exhibits the doublet profile of S 2p, which is characteristic of the S2– species, at 162.3 and 163.5 eV, and is attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. The C 1s peaks of the NTs-WS2@C sample, as can be seen in d, are attributed to the C═C, C–C, C–O, C═O, and O–C═O bonding states, which are centered at 284.3, 285.3, 286.2, 286.8, and 288.2 eV, respectively; this could be ascribed to residual oxygen-containing functional impurities. The XPS results are clearly consistent with the theoretical expectations in this regard. ",
                "CV and EIS measurements were conducted in two-electrode lithium and sodium half-cells over the voltage range of 0.01 to 3.0 V vs Li+/Li at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s–1 to evaluate the metal storage  process of the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes. Panels a and c in  depict three voltammetry cycles as well as the Nyquist plots documented at the open circuit voltage (OCV) and after three CV cycles in LIBs. Three cathodic peaks of pristine NTs-WS2 appear at around 0.91, 0.71, and 0.61 V vs Li+/Li in the first cycle (a), and similar peaks of NTs-WS2@C appear at about 0.89, 0.68, and 0.59 V vs Li+/Li (c). These responses can be assigned to the insertion of Li+ ions into WS2, the conversion reaction of WS2 and Li+ ions into W in a Li2S matrix, irreversible electrolyte decomposition, and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.  The intense oxidation potential of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes respectively at 2.42 and 2.41 V vs Li+/Li reflects the partial oxidation of W to WS2, corresponding to the lithium extraction processes.  Such reduction potential between ∼0.9 and ∼0.6 V vs Li+/Li shifts to higher values in the following cycles, i.e., to 2.06 and 1.83 V vs Li+/Li as well as 2.08 and 1.84 V vs Li+/Li, respectively, implying enhanced reversibility for the electrochemical lithiation and delithiation processes. Both electrodes show two highly reversible cathodic peaks at ∼2.10 and ∼1.80 V vs Li+/Li, and one anodic peak at ∼2.40 V vs Li+/Li, corresponding to the reversible lithium insertion and desertion processes, respectively. Despite the similar CV response, NTs-WS2@C display a rather negligible decrease in polarization within three CV cycles, and all peaks seem to be kept at almost the same positions as the initial ones, implying their high reversibility. Therefore, one may reasonably conclude that the presence of a carbon coating favors the enhancement of the electrochemical kinetics of the electrode.",
                "The corresponding Nyquist plots for the electrodes under study are shown in the insets of a and c. Nova 2.1 analyzed all impedance spectra. The EIS measurements show an electrode/electrolyte interphase, which can be represented by a medium- to high-frequency semicircle at the OCV with a resistance of around 65 Ω for the pristine NTs-WS2 electrode, which decreases to about 44 Ω after the first CV cycle and then increases to around 51.5 Ω following the third CV cycle (inset of a). These changes in resistance could be due to microstructural reorganization within the NTs-WS2 electrode, as well as the gradual growth and alteration of the SEI layer. c (inset) shows an initial low resistance (around 28.4 Ω) for NTs-WS2@C at the OCV, which is then slightly decreased to around 15.0 Ω after the first CV cycle and then increased to around 15.7 Ω after three CV cycles, indicating an improved electronic conductivity.  reports the results of the fitting of the impedance spectra for the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes in lithium coin cells.",
                "In analogy to LIBs, in the first cycle, two reduction potentials of both NTs-WS2 (0.83 and 0.36 V vs Na+/Na) and NTs-WS2@C (0.93 and 0.40 V vs Na+/Na) electrodes are observed in SIBs (b and d). The weak reduction potential at about ∼0.90 V vs Na+/Na is attributed to Na+ ions insertion into the layers of WS2.  The dominant peak at ∼0.40 V vs Na+/Na is caused by the conversion reaction of WS2 with Na+ ions resulting in metallic W embedded in an amorphous Na2S matrix and the formation of the SEI film.  The first oxidation of W to WS2 during the desodiation process is reflected by three oxidation potentials at 1.92, 2.30, and 2.56 V vs Na+/Na in the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C (1.91, 2.29, and 2.54 V vs Na+/Na) electrodes. In the following sweeps, three cathodic peaks at ∼2.00, ∼1.30, and ∼0.90 V vs Na+/Na and three anodic peaks at around ∼1.90, ∼2.30, and ∼2.50 V vs Na+/Na appear in both electrodes, suggesting the presence of a multistep Na+ intercalation and deintercalation process.",
                "The NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes exhibit different tendencies in following cycles, as suggested by EIS (insets in b and d). The NTs-WS2 electrode shows a significant change in the electrode/electrolyte interface resistance from a high value (1437 Ω) at the OCV to about 90.5 Ω after the first CV cycle and then to 59.7 Ω at the third CV cycle, which can be extracted from impedance measurements at a high-to-middle frequency (b, inset). As shown in the inset of d, the interfacial resistance of the NTs-WS2@C electrode is about 42.3 Ω after one CV cycle and then decreased to approximately 41.2 Ω after three CV cycles, which is lower than 256.5 Ω for the initial resistance determined at the OCV.  presents the fitting results of the impedance spectra for the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes in sodium coin cells.",
                "Given that Na+ has a larger ionic radius (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), the transport of Na+ through the SEI layer and diffusion into the bulk electrode were quite sluggish in comparison to Li+. This means that a thicker SEI film formed on the SIBs electrodes than on the LIBs ones. As a result, in Li-ion cells, the electrode has a much lower impedance value than in Na-ion cells. Overall, the WS2-carbon matrix effectively improves the kinetic properties of the electrodes in both LIBs and SIBs, which is associated with the excellent electrochemical activity of NTs-WS2@C.  These EIS results and the CV responses give clear evidence of the improvement of the Li+ and Na+ ion diffusion thanks to the carbon coating and layered tubular structure of the electrode material, which enhance the electrode kinetics.  Such optimized charge transfer kinetics of NTs-WS2@C may ameliorate the electrochemical properties, resulting in reduced cell polarization and improved cycling ability.",
                "CV and EIS measurements indicate that the one-step carbon coating accelerates the electrochemical activity of nanotubular WS2 by triggering a quick and reversible lithiation/delithiation. Such improvements were further demonstrated by comparative cycling tests of the NTs-WS2, NTs-WS2@C, and commercial 2H-WS2 electrodes in lithium half-cells at a current density of 80 mA g–1. a–d display the selected voltage profiles and cycling response. The first inclined discharge plateau of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C are observed at about 0.7 V, leading to discharge capacities of 504 mAh g–1 and 684 mAh g–1 (see a and b). The pristine NTs-WS2 has an initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.1%, which is higher than that of NTs-WS2@C (81.5%) and commercial 2H-WS2 (85.2%), as shown in d. This is partly ascribed to the conversion reaction of WS2 to metallic W embedded in a Li2S matrix, irreversible electrolyte decomposition, and formation of the SEI film. According to the remarkable hysteresis of conversion materials, the subsequent charge evolves over a broad voltage range, which is distinguished by an oxidation plateau at about 2.2 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Li2S to S, with specific capacities of 444 mAh g–1 and 528 mAh g–1 for NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C, respectively. In the first lithiation and delithiation process, the same peaks at 0.7 and 2.2 V for commercial 2H-WS2 are also found, delivering reversible capacities of 512 mAh g–1 and 436 mAh g–1 (c). In fact, a slight participation of carbon to the lithium exchange via low-voltage insertion and a certain extent of interfacial Li+ storage at the W/Li2S interface could partially explain the relatively high reversible capacities of NTs-WS2, NTs-WS2@C, and commercial 2H-WS2. ",
                "d shows that commercial 2H-WS2 fails fast during cycling, while NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C have much higher capacities  and better Coulombic efficiencies. At the 60th cycle, the capacity of commercial 2H-WS2 drops to roughly 147 mAh g–1. Pristine NTs-WS2 undergoes a rapid capacity fading down to around 157 mAh g–1 after 60 cycles, whereas NTs-WS2@C has a much more stable cycling stability, with a specific capacity of 305 mAh g–1 at the 60th cycle. The higher capacity of NTs-WS2 than commercial 2H-WS2 could be ascribed to the nanotube structure of WS2, which provides shorter diffusion paths and a higher population of active sites for Li+.  The 2H-WS2 flakes have possibly larger crystallites than the WS2 nanotubes, also resulting in longer diffusion lengths for Li+. Moreover, the interlayer distance in nanotubes is larger, which enables easier movement of Li+ .  The carbon coating in the NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites deterred polysulfide dissolution, which helped to boost capacity retention.  The carbon coating acted as an elastic buffer, allowing the electrode to accommodate large volume changes during cycling, resulting in good cycle stability for the NTs-WS2@C electrode. Some capacity loss in the three electrodes could be caused by mechanical degradation, such as loss of electrical contact and active material. Furthermore, similar to lithium–sulfur batteries, polysulfide dissolution in the electrolyte could account for some of the capacity loss. ",
                "The rate capability of the NTs-WS2@C electrode was then assessed by cycling it at current densities ranging from 80 to 600 mA g–1. e and f presents the selected voltage profiles and specific capacities. The NTs-WS2@C electrode reveals a slight polarization as the current density is increased stepwise to 200 mA g–1, which shows a moderate degree polarization until 600 mA g–1. The specific capacity decreases as the current density is increased for every 10 cycles, as depicted in e. The NTs-WS2@C electrode delivers reversible capacities of about 497, 456, 419, 373, 307, and 209 mAh g–1 at the current densities 80, 160, 200, 300, 400, and 600 mA g–1, respectively (see f). As the current is turned back to 80 mA g–1 at the 62nd cycle, the NTs-WS2@C electrode exhibits a discharge capacity of around 321 mAh g–1 at the 70th cycle. This promising rate capability suggests that the carbon coating (around 5 wt %) could enhance the electronic/ionic transport within the electrode, allowing for better electrochemical kinetics. ",
                "Furthermore, the long cycle performance of the NTs-WS2@C electrode was tested at a high current density of 400 mA g–1 after 200 cycles (g). The initial reversible capacity of the electrode in LIBs can reach around 485 mAh g–1, then gradually decreases to 146 mAh g–1 in the 100th cycle, and slightly declines to 103 mAh g–1 and a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 99.5% after 200 cycles, indicating its good cycling stability.",
                "In terms of morphological features and particle size, the work published in Chemistry─A European Journal  shows that WS2 has nanowire morphology (WS2 NWs) with a quite thin diameter of ∼25 nm. However, the particle size of the active material is too small, resulting in a low compaction density of the electrode material and a reduction in energy density. On the other hand, the work published in Carbon  states that a graphene-doped self-assembled WS2 nanohoneycomb (WS2/rGO Nano-HC) composite has nanoplanar structure. As we mentioned before, the NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites used in this study have nanostructure properties (a large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, and desired highly active sites) as well as tubular shape with diameter distributions in the range 50–200 nm. According to the carbon coating approach, WS2 NWs published in Chemistry─A European Journal  were prepared via a simple solvothermal process followed by a thermal treatment. The WS2/rGO Nano-HC composite published in Carbon  was prepared through an improved one-step hydrothermal method. However, the solvothermal or hydrothermal reaction has the following drawbacks: it is unsuitable for mass production and has a low level of safety. Our simple, fast, and inexpensive production method involves precipitating sucrose precursor on WS2 nanotubes and then pyrolyzing it to form NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites. What distinguishes our synthetic approach presented herein from previously reported ones is that these nanotubes have closed cage structure, which provides them with chemical stability and restricts volume change. From the point of view of uniformity, the EDS mapping of the WS2 NWs published in Chemistry─A European Journal  illustrates a homogeneous dispersion of W and S along the nanowires. As a result, WS2 NWs display an extremely long cycle life while also having a high capacity and rate capability. According to the TEM elemental EDS mapping results in the paper of Carbon,  graphene accounts for roughly 14% of the weight percentage. Because of its high strength, graphene enhances the mechanical characteristics of nanostructures as well as the specific charge capacity, cycling life, and high charge/discharge rates of as-prepared batteries. The results of SEM-EDS and HAADF-STEM-EDS in our work demonstrate that the W and S elements are uniformly distributed within the WS2 nanotubes, with the C layer located on the nanotube surface (see j). Low carbon content (around 5%), as revealed by combining TGA, SEM-EDS, and HAADF-STEM-EDS results, leads to high practical capacity, satisfactory cycling stability, and suitable rate capability for use in both LIBs and SIBs. Overall, even though the cycling performance of our electrode material (NTs-WS2@C) is not as stable as the works reported in the literature, we highlight that the chemical stability, the robust mechanical properties, the low carbon content, together with the facile and cost-effective production method of the present nanostructures render them as an “interesting player” in the field of LIBs and SIBs. Accordingly, our results indicate that the synthesis pathway plays a significant role in improving the electrochemical properties of metal sulfide nanomaterials through strengthening the electric contact within the electrode. The enhanced charge transfer kinetics of the NTs-WS2@C electrode indicates its applicability as an anode material for LIBs and SIBs.  presents the electrochemical properties of several recently reported WS2-based anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, allowing a facile visual comparison. The cycling stability of NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites in our work is superior to that reported for recently published materials, such as Co-doped WS2 (380 mAh g–1 at a current density of 50 mAh g–1 after 40 cycles in LIBs) and WS2 nanoplates (158 mAh g–1 at a current density of 100 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles in SIBs).

                " depicts the selected voltage profiles and capacity trends of the NTs-WS2, NTs-WS2@C, and commercial 2H-WS2 electrodes in sodium half-cells at a 80 mA g–1 current density. The three short plateaus at about 1.18–1.06 V, 0.62–0.52 V, and 0.32–0.18 V in the first discharge curves of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C are attributed to the insertion of Na+ ions into WS2, the WS2 conversion into W nanoparticles and Na2S, as well as the formation of the SEI film (a and b). There are three plateaus in the first charge process: a major plateau at 1.66–1.86 V and two small plateaus at 2.26 and 2.55 V, which should be directly related to the conversion reaction of W into WS2. These sodiation and desodiation behaviors are consistent with the CV curves, as depicted in d. In comparison, the sodium intercalation platforms of commercial 2H-WS2 are 0.75 V, 0.47 V, and 0.21–0.16 V (c), being significantly lower than those of NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C. This shows that the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes have much lower energy barriers for Na+ intercalation. Similar to the cycling performance of LIBs, the NTs-WS2@C electrode of SIBs outperforms the pristine NTs-WS2 and commercial bulk 2H-WS2 electrodes. The practical capacity of SIBs in the same NTs-WS2 electrode is found to be lower than the corresponding LIBs, which could be directly associated to the slow electrode kinetics of Na+. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the NTs-WS2 electrode are 540 mAh g–1 and 407 mAh g–1, respectively, yielding a Coulombic efficiency of 75.4% (calculated from the data in a). The first discharge and charge capacities of the commercial 2H-WS2 electrode are 499 mAh g–1 and 373 mAh g–1, leading to a Coulombic efficiency of 74.7% (calculated from the data in c). This clearly shows that the few-layered WS2 nanotubes and suitable interlayered distance improve the kinetic characteristics of the electrode. The NTs-WS2@C electrode demonstrates higher initial discharge and charge capacities (605 mAh g–1 and 465 mAh g–1, respectively) with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 76.8% (calculated from the data in b), which is higher than those of pristine NTs-WS2 (75.4%) and commercial 2H-WS2 (74.7%). As stated in the section on LIBs performance, such an irreversible capacity may be directly attributable to the irreversible reaction of electrolyte decomposition and the formation of the SEI film.  Therefore, pristine NTs-WS2 shows a rapid capacity decline, with a reversible capacity of approximately 57 mAh g–1 after 60 cycles (d), whereas NTs-WS2@C shows a significantly more stable behavior (a reversible capacity of 152 mAh g–1 in the 60th cycle). This improved cycling stability might be ascribed to the volume confinement effect of the carbon matrix that tolerates the volume variations during cycling. Meanwhile, the specific capacity of commercial 2H-WS2 is also very limited, decreasing to 52 mAh g–1 in the 60th cycle.",
                "The rate capability of the NTs-WS2@C electrode was then investigated by cycling at current densities ranging from 80, 160, 200, 300, 400, to 600 mA g–1 (e and f). f shows a delivered capacity of approximately 458 mAh g–1 at 80 mA g–1, which decreases to about 272 mAh g–1 once the current density is increased to 300 mA g–1 due to an expected slight increase in polarization (e). A further increase in current density to 600 mA g–1 reduces the reversible capacity to 115 mAh g–1. Furthermore, as the current density decreases back to the initial value of 80 mA g–1 at the 62nd cycle, the cell exhibits a discharge capacity of about 318 mAh g–1, but still the capacity quickly fades because of electrode degradation.",
                "The cycling performance of the NTs-WS2@C electrode in SIBs at a high current density of 400 mA g–1 was further investigated, as shown in g. The initial reversible capacity of the electrode is about 321 mAh g–1 and then speedily decreases to 59 mAh g–1 in the 100th cycle and progressively decreases to 29 mAh g–1 in the 200th cycle. LIBs (g) clearly outperform SIBs in capacity performance at the high current density because the larger diameter of the Na+ ion makes embedding more difficult and causes more damage to electrode materials.",
                "The NTs-WS2@C electrode demonstrates good cycling performance and rate capability in both LIBs and SIBs, which is thought to be due to the synergistic effect between the tubular architecture of WS2 and the advanced electronic conduction pathways contributed by carbon. These findings imply that the synthesis pathway used herein enables the development of an improved NTs-WS2@C electrode that could be employed successfully as the anode in LIBs and SIBs.",
                "To emphasize the optimized electrochemical properties of NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites, the morphology features of the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes after 60 cycles at 80 mA g–1 in lithium and sodium coin cells were investigated by SEM, as shown in a–d. The NTs-WS2 electrode material shows obvious agglomeration in LIBs, as demonstrated in a, and the structure was impaired. After 60 cycles in SIBs, WS2 nanotubes were severely crushed and shed (b). This morphology change is due to the fact that the nanotube structure cannot effectively mitigate volume expansion, resulting in poor capacity retention (see  and ).",
                "On the contrary, as presented in c and d, the nanotube morphology of the NTs-WS2@C electrodes remains intact, further supporting the claim that the WS2 nanotubes are protected by carbon coating. The carbon covering efficiently prevented NTs-WS2 morphological change while allowing the formation of the stable SEI film in both LIBs and SIBs. However, as the carbon covering thinned during cycling, it might potentially obstruct Li+ and Na+ intercalation and deintercalationas well as the SEI formation, resulting in the deterioration of cycling performance, as revealed in  and .",
                "To further determine the phase change during cycling, the NTs-WS2@C electrodes before and after cycling at 80 mA g–1 in LIBs and SIBs were investigated by XRD and Raman. The XRD graphs of the cycled electrodes reveal a transition of WS2 from crystalline to amorphous, as shown in e. The 2θ peaks at 42.7°, 49.8°, and 73.4° correlate to the peaks of the Cu foil. The peak of the (002), (103), (006), and (114) WS2 crystal planes in both lithium and sodium coin cells stays consistent, denoting that Li+ and Na+ are preferentially inserted into certain crystallographic planes. The peaks of the (110) and (101) crystal planes vanish in both LIBs and SIBs, implying that preferential intercalation and deintercalation of Li+ and Na+ damage the structure of specific crystal planes. It is interesting to note the preservation of WS2 stoichiometry with prevalence after the 60th charging/discharging cycle. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that Li+ and Na+ intercalation and deintercalation in NTs-WS2@C are likely to alter the structure of some crystal planes, and thus, certain peaks will no longer be present in the XRD diffractogram. ",
                "As illustrated in f, the distinctive peaks of the D-band and G-band (at roughly 1354 and 1600 cm–1), which correspond to the sucrose-derived carbon, are located at almost the same positions in all samples after 60 charging/discharging cycles. At the same time, the D-band and G-band peaks of the NTs-WS2@C electrodes in LIBs show weaker intensity than in SIBs, which may be attributed to the faster electrode kinetics of Li+ than Na+. The characteristic E2g and A1g peaks (at about 351 and 419 cm–1) become indistinguishable in all specimens after cycling in both LIBs and SIBs, reflecting a structural transformation from crystalline to amorphous structure.",
                "To obtain a better overall view of the electrochemical behavior, the morphology features of the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes before and after 60 cycles at 80 mA g–1 in lithium and sodium coin cells were examined by TEM, as shown in  and . TEM and HRTEM images of the NTs-WS2 () and NTs-WS2@C (a and b) electrodes before cycling show the original 1D nanotube morphology, with visible lattice fringes. The SAED pattern of NTs-WS2 in  demonstrates rather clear and bright diffraction spots. When the SAED pattern was taken from the fresh NTs-WS2 with C before cycling (c), the amount of carbon is too small, which still shows strong diffraction spots.",
                "After being charge–discharged for 60 cycles in LIBs, the TEM and HRTEM images of the NTs-WS2 () and NTs-WS2@C (d and e) electrodes demonstrate the 1D nanotube morphology, but with no apparent lattice fringes. In fact, NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C transform to amorphous structure as further indicated by the SAED patterns in  and f. These diffraction spots are substantially weaker than those before cycling, indicating that the nanotube structure has been largely broken.",
                "The 1D nanotube morphologies of the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes after 60 cycles in SIBs were preserved, as depicted in  and g. The HRTEM images of the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrodes after 60 cycles in SIBs show no visible lattice fringes, as displayed in  and h. Furthermore, the SAED patterns in  and i suggest that the diffraction spots are significantly weaker after cycling, indicating that the crystallinity degree of the nanotube was modified and highly crystalline NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C were converted from strong diffraction to amorphous materials during cycling.",
                "Interestingly, the morphologies of the NTs-WS2 and NTs-WS2@C electrode materials before and after cycling are still 1D nanotubes but with numerous structural changes. The lattice fringes of the NTs-WS2@C electrode in both LIBs and SIBs after cycling cannot be specifically identified, which is probably because the structures experienced some volume expansion during cycling."

The resulting NTs-WS2@C material consists of nanotubes with increased (compared to bulk 2H-WS2) interlayer distances that create porous structures in their intersections; these structures promote electrode electrochemical activity by suppressing side reactions between the electrolyte and electrode. Furthermore, the conductive carbon coating offers effective electronic transfer routes as well as fast Li+ and Na+ diffusion, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance. Notably, the NTs-WS2@C electrodes deliver comparatively high discharge capacities of 305 and 152 mAh g–1 after 60 cycles for LIBs and SIBs, respectively; moreover, the cycling trend is relatively stable and the rate capability is satisfactory. Ultimately, the simple, fast, and inexpensive synthesis proposed appears to be an advantageous and scalable pathway for producing high-capacity conversion metal sulfides for rechargeable battery applications."
