                "The world will be running out of fossil fuels shortly and in the very limited time it is expected to look out for a good replacement for non-renewable resources of energy, which calls for a need to research environment-friendly, cost-effective conventional resources [1], as far as vehicles are concerned, they are mainly dependent on fossil fuels, the only good alternative to it is to switch into EVs [2]. Lithium has become extremely popular in a lot of energy storage industries for EVs mainly due to its outstanding energy density as well as long cycle life. It is a fact that lithium resources are scarce, but further still, their low availability makes it difficult to use lithium widely for energy storage on a large scale, not to mention that they are costly [3]. Na is a highly promising candidate, located near to Li on the periodic table. Sodium exhibits numerous alkali metal chemistries in common with Li and is found in large quantities and widely spread. A lot of research is going on in the domain of sodium-ion batteries [4]. They were studied alongside lithium-ion batteries in the 1980s [5]. In recent times, there has been a renewed focus on ambient-temperature sodium-ion batteries for grid-level applications due to their sustainability advantages. Considerable advancements have been achieved in anodes by applying the knowledge gained from lithium batteries [6]. Graphite, which is a popular negative electrode material of lithium-ion batteries [7], is not suitable for sodium ion batteries because of its inability to accommodate Na ions resulting in very low capacity. A lot is yet to be done to discover appropriate anodes for Sodium-ion batteries [8]. ",
                "Despite multiple advantages, Sodium-ion batteries currently face challenges in achieving the same level of energy density, cycling stability, and rate performance as lithium-ion batteries. With the abundant and affordable nature of sodium compared to lithium, sodium-ion batteries have garnered significant attention. To make progress in the development of sodium-ion battery technology, it is crucial to produce anode materials with exceptional performance [9, 10]. Three main categories of anode materials are often considered appealing, based on the reaction process There has been a great amount of interest in transition metal tellurides as potential candidates for silicon indium boron anodes due to the distinctive structural and electrochemical features that they possess.",
                "Intercalation, alloying, and conversion are the three main reaction processes which are seen among the negative electrodes, the one with the processes of intercalation are TiO2, Li4Ti5O12, and Nb2O5, and the alloying phenomenon is seen in anodes such as Silicon, Germanium, and Tin, and conversion can be observed in anodes such as Co3O4, NiO, and MoS2 [3, 11, 12]. However, their capacity and energy density are somewhat limited. The significant fluctuations in volume during the charging and discharging operations are the main cause of this phenomenon. The conversion anodes possess a significantly greater theoretical capacity than the intercalation anodes, even though they experience a smaller volume change in comparison to the alloy anodes [11,12,13]. They are also recognized as potential battery anode solutions as they have minimal environmental impact and ample operational capacity. There are in total 18 different metal chalcogenides (MCs) that are considered to be conversion anodes and have the necessary properties for further exploration. Metal tellurides as anodes for sodium-ion batteries have shown impressive capacities, but they also come with their own set of challenges and solutions [14, 15]. ",
                "Certain metal tellurides, like molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), nickel telluride (NiTe2), and cobalt telluride (Co Te2), have layered structures that facilitate the efficient introduction and withdrawal of sodium ions. Less attention has been paid to tellurides of group VIA elements, such as GeTe and SnTe. In the case of GeTe, carbon addition suppresses phase separation, and enhances lithium and sodium storage capability; further modification with the incorporation of TiC results in further improved performance. In the case of SnTe, which has cubic phase recoverability after lithium/sodium extraction, it still suffers capacity fading due to volume changes during cycling. Among these, a very promising anode material for LIBs/SIBs was ZnTe. However, the initial performances of it were pretty poor due to volume changes. The creation of ZnTe/C nanocomposites therefore improved it through mechanical alloying. Moreover, in MoTe2 only intercalation is observed, there are no alloying and conversion mechanisms [16, 17], which makes it superior to all in choosing negative electrode material for sodium-ion batteries. 1T′- MoTe2 was made by two different methods and then assessed as negative electrode material in Na+ batteries. The 1T′- MoTe2 layered material has shown encouraging electrochemical data, providing a possible advantage in real-life battery applications [17]. ",
                "The methods used in the preparation of MoTe2 are the hydrothermal method, which is a one-step synthesis method, and the electrodeposition method. This study gives an insight into the pros and cons of both methods and the variation seen in the products of both methods. As it is known that the hydrothermal method, popularly known as “one-pot synthesis,“ [18] is convenient for the synthesis of entire materials in one go, whereas the electrodeposition method, is easy to commercialize, and scalable and its morphology is tuneable [16, 17, 19]. In the present work, MoTe2 was synthesised by the hydrothermal method and electrodeposition techniques. which is confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and FESEM analysis. Tellurium nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the Mo-coated Al substrate, followed by annealing leads to the synthesis of MoTe2. The uniform layered nano-blocks provide sufficient surface area and Na-ion can intercalate between the layers of molybdenum ditelluride. This paper demonstrates that better electrochemical results are obtained in the process of the electrodeposition method as compared to the hydrothermal method of synthesis [20,21,22,23]. "

                        "As illustrated in Fig.1, MoTe2 was synthesised by hydrothermal method. The solution for the hydrothermal reaction was prepared by using 8 mM sodium molybdate dihydrate (NaMoO4, 2H2O), 16 mM tellurium metallic powder, and 12 mM sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Firstly, it is required to make 12 mM NaBH4 solution in 5 ml de-ionised water, then add 16 mM tellurium powder while stirring in the ice bath until the solution becomes clear. Meanwhile, solution of 8 mM NaMoO4, 2H2O is to be made into 30 ml of de-ionised water. Then mix both solutions with the help of stirring and transfer them to the 50 ml Teflon liner. The final solution in the liner should be placed into the autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 48 h. [18] Further, it was cleaned with water and dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The prepared product was named as MTH is going to be used as an active material for slurry making for electrode preparation to fabricate the Na-ion coin cell.",
                        "Electrodeposition is an easy, scalable, and cost-effective method for synthesising nanoparticles, which helps to get well-defined morphologies. Molybdenum-coated aluminium foil was used as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. Molybdenum coating on aluminium foil has been done by a Radio-Frequency Sputtering system (RF sputtering) of the thickness around 50 nm [24]. Tellurium oxide is used as a tellurium precursor. Tellurium oxide is insoluble in water. Acidic medium was used to dissolve TeO2. Thus, electrolyte was prepared using 20 mM TeO2 and 1 mM nitric acid. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, it can be observed the reduction peak of the tellurium around − 0.2 V from the cyclic voltammetry curve. The chronoamperometry technique was used for electrodeposition of tellurium nanoparticles on the molybdenum-coated aluminium substrate at -0.2 V for 900 s at room temperature. The electrodeposition of tellurium is following the chemical reaction mentioned below,",
                        "After electrodeposition of Te nanoparticles on Mo-coated Al foil, the sample was annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in an Ar atmosphere in an MTI furnace. Thus, Molybdenum Telluride is synthesized using Electrodeposition named as MTE, which will be used directly without a binder-free negative electrode for Na+ batteries."

The MTE sample is used as a binder-free electrode directly. Initially, the MTH samples were ground up into a fine powder to create a slurry to construct negative electrodes. These particles were subsequently combined with a binder known as PVDF and carbon black in a weight ratio of 80:10:10. The dissolving solvent for the mixture was NMP. The slurry that resulted was magnetically stirred for 12 h. An etched aluminium foil with a thickness of 15 μm was then coated with the prepared slurry. The coating procedure was conducted using a doctor’s blade. The coated negative electrodes were subsequently vacuum-dried at 60 °C overnight. Our electrolyte consisted of 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DC). Whatman GF/D fibre is used as a separator in Na+ ion batteries. Moisture and oxygen concentrations were maintained at or below 0.1 ppm during the assembly and disassembly of the coin cells in a glove box with an Ar atmosphere. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests and cyclic voltammetry experiments were done in the BT lab.

                        "The morphologies were analysed by FESEM as shown in Fig. 2. We observed MoTe2 nanorods in the MTH samples, which smaller particle sizes in one-dimensional structures can enhance the surface area associated with Na-ion diffusion in the electrolyte and provide the short diffusion length, which leads to good capacity. However, it is evident noticed from the Fig. 2(a, b, c) that the uniform distribution of nanorods is not there in the sample, which may lead to low capacity and poor cycling stability. On the other end, it can be observed that the uniform distribution of the MoTe2 nanoparticles synthesized by electrodeposition. Figure 2 (d, e) shows the nano needle-like structure of tellurium nanoparticles electro-deposited on the Mo-coated aluminium substrate. After annealing, morphology changed drastically. Tellurium nano needle-like structure converts into uniformly distributed MoTe2 nano blocks with a sharp layered structure, which can facilitate the sodium ion insertion during the charging-discharging process and provide a smooth path for the sodium ion storage mechanism. These layered nano blocks have a high surface area, which helps in intercalation-deintercalation of Na+ ions into the layers of molybdenum tellurides. The elemental mapping of the MTH and MTE shows the all-over distribution of Mo and Te, discussed in detail in the supplementary information in Fig. S (1,2).",
                        "Photons scatter at different energies due to vibrational modes (phonons) in a sample, while interacting with the light in a Raman spectrometer. The resulting Raman spectra reveal lattice vibrations and the crystal structure of the material. Raman spectroscopy of the materials synthesized by electrodeposition and hydrothermal, distinct vibrational modes that confirm the successful formation of the 1T’ phase of molybdenum telluride. The signature peaks of Tellurium can be seen at 123 cm⁻¹ and 142 cm⁻¹ in Fig. 3(a), which confirms that the electrodeposition of Te nano-needles has been successfully completed on the Mo-coated Al substrate. It can be clearly observed from the Raman that conversion of MoTe2 occurs after giving an annealing temperature of 450 °C for 1 h. We also compared MoTe2 synthesized by hydrothermal and electrodeposition in Fig. 3(b). Here, we observe that the distinct peaks of 1T′-MoTe2, including Au (106.1 cm− 1), Ag (122.5 cm− 1), Bg (152.3 cm− 1), Bg (195.1 cm− 1), and Ag (275. 2 cm− 1) are indicative of sample [17]. The Ag vibrational modes are attributed to symmetric vibrations and Bg modes of vibrations are attributed to anti-symmetric vibrations. These modes of vibrations correspond to the 1T′-MoTe2 phase present in both samples.",
                        "X-ray diffraction profiles help to examine the crystallographic features, structural properties, and information about the phase of the transition metal chalcogenides. As per Fig. 3(c, d), we can see XRD patterns of the MoTe2 synthesized by hydrothermal and electrodeposition is matching with the JCPDS-71-2157, which corresponds to the 1T’ phase of MoTe2. The crustal structure of the 1T’- phase of MoTe2 is monoclinic. The layers of 1T’- phase of MoTe2 are linked together by van der Waals interactions and can be exfoliated into thin 2D layers.",
                        "This XRD result confirms the successful conversion of MoTe2 in the 1T’ phase from the electrodeposited tellurium on Mo-coated aluminium after annealing at 450 °C for 1 h in the Ar atmosphere. This shows the prominent lattice plane of (012). MTH was synthesised at 200 °C for 48 h and 60 h. But both are giving the same phase formation, thus we here discuss about the results of 48 h only. It has a prominent crystallographic plane of (103). Here, it can be observed that the FWHM of all peaks is too small, which suggests the highly crystalline nature of the material. The prominent crystallographic planes in both samples are different, which may lead to different morphologies, which results into different electrochemical performances. Thus, from Raman spectroscopy, FESEM images and XRD patterns, it can be concluded that 1T’- MoTe2 have successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method as well as electrodeposition. The film synthesized by electrodeposition is highly crystalline and uniformly distributed with structural stability and high surface area, which may result into smooth Na-ion diffusion and facilitate the intercalation-deintercalation mechanisms. As compared to MTE, the samples synthesized by hydrothermal may not provide good cycling stability and high capacity due to the non-uniform structure of the material."

                        "The electrochemical performances of the Na-ion battery in a half-cell configuration using molybdenum ditelluride electrodes synthesized by hydrothermal and electrodeposition have been investigated. The schematic diagram of the Na-ion coin cell assembly is discussed in supplementary information in Fig. S (3). The cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates is elaborated in supplementary information in Fig. S (4). The CV at different scan rates shows two reduction peaks co-relate to the alloying and de-alloying phases of Na2Te in the material. The two reduction peaks attributed to Na-ion intercalation in the MoTe2 matrix and oxidation peaks correspond to the de-intercalation of Na-ion from the MoTe2 lattice [19]. Figure 4(a) shows the comparison of galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles between MTE and MTH electrodes for 50 cycles at 0.05 A g− 1 current rate in a voltage range of 0.1 V to 2.5 V. In the initial cycle, the MTH electrode showed 380 mAh g− 1 capacity; this was stabilized at about 277 mAh g− 1 capacity after 50 cycles, thereby displaying 72.8% retention of capacity. Whereas the MTE electrode shows 425 mAh g− 1 capacity in the 1st cycle, that stabilised around 355 mAh g− 1 capacity after 50 cycles, thereby delivering 84.5% capacity retention. Here, from Fig. 4(a), it is observed that MTE is giving high-capacity with high-capacity retention after 50 cycles. Whereas, MTH is giving low capacity with poor capacity retention. Thus, it can be concluded that the MTE electrode has better cycling stability and high capacity because of its uniformly distributed layered nano blocks-like morphology and pure stable structural properties as compared to MTH electrodes. Thus, a uniform and stable structure provides a better path to intercalate into the layers of molybdenum ditelluride, which results into an enhancement in charge-discharge capacity.",
                        "Further to analyse electrochemistry MTH and MTE, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was analysed as per Fig. 4(b). The high-frequency range of the EIS data shows a semi-circle, which corresponds to charge transfer resistance at electrode-electrolyte interphase RCT and the low-frequency range shows linear slop describing about the diffusion of sodium-ion into the layers of molybdenum ditelluride, which corresponds to Warburg impedance. By fitting the EIS data to the equivalent circuit, which is illustrated in Fig. 4(b), the values computed of charge transfer resistance RCT of MTE and MTH, are 78 Ω and 236 Ω, respectively. Here, it is concluded that the electric conductivity of the MTE is more than the MTH electrode, which may result into low-capacity values. The unique and uniform structure of the MTE provides conducting and stable diffusion of Na+ ions on the electrode surface, leading to low charge transfer resistance resulting into high capacity and high cycling stability. Thus, it can be said that MTE has better morphology.",
                        "GCD was performed to examine the cycling performance of the MTE electrode for 100 cycles at 0.1 A g− 1 current rate in the potential range of 0.1 V to 2.5 V as displayed in Fig. 4(c). MTE electrode gives 348 mAh g− 1 capacity in initial cycles, which stabilized around 299 mAh g− 1 after 100 cycles. Thus, the MTE shows 85.98% of capacity retention after 100 cycles. The I.C.E. of the MTE electrode is 78%, in the 1st cycle, which may be because of unstable SEI layer, conversion and electrolyte decomposition in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the C.E. showed a significant improvement of 90%, which improved after 10 cycles to 99%. A stable SEI layer formation may be the reason behind the enhancement of Coulombic efficiency. Galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles having graph of specific capacity Vs. voltage are shown in the supplementary information Fig. S (5). The working potential at around 0.31 V shows a plateau region that may attributed to SEI layer formation and conversion of MoTe2 in the initial cycle. The working potential becomes stable after the first cycle around 1.5 V corresponding to the intercalation of MoTe2 during sodiation and desodiation. Thus, it is concluded here that the MTE electrode shows excellent cycling stability of the material because of the stability and uniformity in structure.",
                        "The rate performance of the MTE electrode has been examined for 5 cycles at 0.05 A g− 1, 0.1 A g− 1, 0.2 A g− 1, 0.5 A g− 1, 0.8 A g− 1 and 1 A g− 1 current rates as illustrated in Fig. 4 (d). The MTE electrode gives a stable capacity of around 352 mAh g− 1, 298 mAh g− 1, 235 mAh g− 1, 165 mAh g− 1, 135 mAh g− 1, 115 mAh g− 1 at 0.05 A g− 1, 0.1 A g− 1, 0.2 A g− 1, 0.5 A g− 1, 0.8 A g− 1 and 1 A g− 1 current rates, respectively. The MTE electrode shows capacity retention of 95% at 0.05 Ag− 1 current rate after running on higher current rates. Even though MoTe2 has a capacity of 305 mAh g− 1 (theoretical) (estimated using four mol of sodium ions for one mole of MoTe2) [19], the interfacial Na+ storage and the Na2Te alloy’s production might be the cause of the additional specific capacity found at 0.05 A g− 1.",
                        "Figure 4(e) shows the EIS of the MTE electrode before and after 100 cycles. The RCT was analysed, which is between the electrolyte and molybdenum ditelluride surface. The value of RCT before CD was 78 Ω, which increased to 276 Ω after 100 cycles. The increment in RCT occurs because of the unstable SEI layer formation between the electrode-electrolyte surface and electrolyte degradation during the sodiation/desodiation process, which results in a decrement in the conductivity of the materials, which leads to a decrement in capacity. Thus, from the primary electrochemical data, it can be concluded that uniform-layered MoTe2 can be effectively used as a negative electrode."

                "In metal tellurides, especially MoTe2 exhibit remarkable potential as a good-rate negative electrode material as it has layered structure, high electrical conductivity, and large interlayer spacing.

The advantages of using the highly conductive 1T′-MoTe2 for the SIB can be concluded. Raman spectroscopy analysis supports the fact that both the hydrothermal method and electrodeposition were successful in producing the 1T′-MoTe2 anode material. The FESEM images indicated a sharp multi-layer structure of metal ditelluride, which results in great capacity and excellent electrochemical performance as it properly accommodates Na-ions to have a smooth sodiation and desodiation process.
