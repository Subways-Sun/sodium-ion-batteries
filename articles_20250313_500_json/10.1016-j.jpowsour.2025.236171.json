                "Layered germanium phosphide (GeP) is considered a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity and rapid Li+/Na+ diffusion. Herein, we first reveal that the pristine GeP nanosheet shows ∼110 % and 128 % volume expansion during the first lithiation/sodiation by in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively, which leads to severe detectable fractures or cracks of the GeP anode. Thus, we revisit the failure mechanism of the GeP anode is attributed to the unsatisfactory mechanical robustness. Then, we propose a simple and efficient strategy that combines GeP nanosheets with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to design a GeP/SWCNTs composite anode. Nanoindentation experiments and theoretical calculations confirm that the GeP/SWCNTs composite exhibits reduced internal stress to alleviate expansion in the first lithiation/sodiation. As a result, the GeP/SWCNTs composite anode delivers an initial Coulombic efficiency of ∼85 % and ∼90 % in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. More importantly, the specific capacity retentions are improved from ∼11 % and ∼8 % after 50 cycles to ∼50 % and ∼51 % remarkably after 200 cycles in LIBs and SIBs, respectively."

                "Energy storage devices are key to making the best use of clean energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels [ , ]. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are prominent among rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and long-cycle stability, which have already been incorporated into portable electronic devices and electric cars [ , ]. Considering the shortage of lithium resources and the high cost, alternative energy storage systems with low cost and abundant resources will become an urgent need for future applications. Since Na+ is abundant on the earth and has similar chemical properties to Li+, more researchers are focusing on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) [ ]. The SIBs are regarded as a complementary technology to LIBs, potentially becoming the next generation of energy storage devices [ ].",
                "Anodes play a crucial role in ion battery performance. In recent years, the anodes used for LIBs and SIBs have been mainly carbon-based materials [ , ]. However, the capacity of these materials is relatively low. To meet the high-capacity requirements for LIBs and SIBs [ ], anode materials with better performance are being developed. Metal phosphides have been explored as potential anodes for LIBs and SIBs [ , ]. GeP is one of the typical materials among them [ , ]. On the one hand, GeP has good conductivity owing to the increased conductivity of the Ge component compared to pure phosphorus [ ]. The conductivity of GeP (50 000 S/cm2) is far higher than that of graphite [ ]. On the other hand, the expansion of GeP during lithiation or sodiation is also much lower than that of P. In addition, GeP resembles black P and graphite in a unique layered structure, which is believed to be very beneficial for Li+/Na+ intercalation and deintercalation [ ]. GeP serving as an anode material, delivers the expected theoretical capacity of 1900 mAh g−1 and 1033 mAh g−1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively [ ]. These advantages are considered very convincing for Li+/Na+ storage. However, the electrochemical performance of a GeP as anode is not ideal in LIBs and SIBs, especially with an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and cycling stability significantly lower than that of similar anodes.",
                "To enhance the electrochemical performance of the GeP anode, numerous related studies have been conducted [ , , ]. In our previous work, the lithium storage mechanism of GeP was investigated by in-situ TEM, and its cycling stability was improved by narrowing the voltage range. A recent study by Zeng et al. found that the hollow nitrogen-doped carbon fibres encapsulate GeP nanoreactors with a self-supported conductive network, which ensures sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport, and accommodates the volume expansion of GeP simultaneously [ ]. In addition. Tseng et al. discovered that mesoporous germanium phosphide microspheres composed of about 10 nm nanoparticles with a narrow pore size distribution of about 4 nm, which can shorten the diffusion path of energy carriers and provide buffer space for Li+/Na+ transport [ ]. Many factors affect the electrochemical performance of GeP, including the SEI layer, conductivity, mechanical properties, etc [ , ]. The expansion of GeP nanosheets during charge-discharge cycles can lead to mechanical instability, resulting in a low ICE and rapid decay. Therefore, mechanical properties are one of the key factors influencing its electrochemical performance. It is necessary to study the relationship between the mechanical properties of the GeP electrode, its ICE and cycling stability, and take further measures to improve the mechanical properties of the GeP electrode during Li+ or Na+ insertion/extraction. At present, compositing with carbon-based materials (carbon nanotubes [ , ], graphene [ , ], reduced graphene oxide [ ], nitrogen-doped porous carbon [ , ], etc.) is a very effective method to improve the alloy-type anodes’ mechanical properties. For example, Li et al. found that a dual-carbon network of AB/GO was a good choice to improve the mechanical properties of GeP5 as an anode material for SIBs [ ]. However, among the carbon-based materials, compositing GeP with SWCNTs has more advantages in alleviating the stress caused by expansion for GeP electrodes [ , ]. Consequently, the conductive network formed by SWCNTs provides pathways for the transport of electrons and ions. At the same time, the intertwined network structure can constrain GeP, enhancing the mechanical strength of the electrode [ ].",
                "In this study, we first investigate the failure mechanism of layered GeP in LIBs and SIBs comprehensively by in-situ TEM combined with ex-situ techniques [ , ]. No cracks were found, indicating that individual GeP nanosheets can resist expansion after complete lithiation/sodiation. However, GeP nanosheets display about 110 % and 128 % area expansion. The expansion of GeP nanosheets resulted in a large number of cracks on the electrode during the prolonged cycles, further leading to a decrease in its mechanical performance. This directly presented a low ICE of GeP electrode, only ∼71 % and ∼49 % in LIBs and SIBs. The key to improving the ICE and stability of the GeP electrode is to effectively maintain its integrity during the cycles. Thus, GeP nanosheets can be mixed with SWCNT to improve their mechanical properties. The GeP/SWCNTs exhibited reduced internal stress and improved ion transport as shown by nanoindentation experiments and theoretical calculations. GeP/SWCNTs electrode delivered considerable Coulombic efficiency of approximately 85 % and 90 % in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. Beyond that, the cycling behaviour of GeP/SWCNTs electrode was greatly enhanced with capacity retention values of ∼50 % and ∼51 % after 200 cycles in LIBs and SIBs. The improvement in the performance of GeP/SWCNTs electrodes can be attributed to the efficient recombination of SWCNTs."

Bulk GeP was exfoliated into few-layer GeP by sonicating for 2 h under high-power at 1000 W, which have been reported in our group's previous work [ ]. SWCNTs were purchased from OCSiAl company (Russia). The corresponding SEM was shown in Fig. S1.

                        "As shown in Fig. 1a and d, the GeP electrode exhibited an initial high specific capacity of 1024/1435 mA h g−1 and 403/819 mA h g−1 with the corresponding CE of 71 % and 49 % for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The first CE of GeP as anode was poor, especially in SIBs. Thus, it can be predicted that the cycling durability of the original GeP electrode was also unsatisfactory. As shown in Fig. 1b, the capacity retention of the electrode was ∼11 % after 50 cycles in LIBs. In addition, the capacity retention of GeP electrode was also poor in SIBs with only ∼8 % after 50 cycles in Fig. 1e. The method of limiting discharge capacity was applied to explore the electrochemical performance of GeP electrodes in both LIBs and SIBs [ ]. The charge capacity remained almost 100 %, 97 % and 86 % after 10 cycles by limiting the discharge capacity to 400, 600 and 900 mA h g−1, respectively in Fig. 1c.

The charge capacity remained almost 97 %, 52 % and 26 % after 5 cycles when the discharge capacity was limited to 400, 600 and 800 mAh g−1, respectively in Fig. 1f. Whether in LIBs or SIBs, the stability of the GeP electrode was significantly improved as the discharge capacity decreased. Fig. S2 showed the impedances of the GeP electrode became better with the reduction of the limiting capacity. It indicated that the GeP electrode was more severely damaged due to the intercalation/deintercalation of abundant Li+/Na+. The results revealed once again that the poor electrochemical performance of GeP generally originates from expansion due to the insertion and expulsion of a large number of ions.",
                        "Understanding the mechanical robustness of the GeP anode is crucial for improving its electrochemical performance in LIBs or SIBs within an actual battery cell. The solid-state battery device inside the in-situ TEM is shown in Fig. S3. Fig. 2a–d showed the typical morphological evolutions of individual GeP nanosheets during lithiation and sodiation by in-situ TEM [ , ]. There were no noticeable cracks or fractures in GeP nanosheet. This indicated that GeP nanosheets possess the ability to resist expansion during Li+/Na+ storage. The original width of 462 nm significantly expanded to 489 nm after full lithiation at the same marked position, resulting in a total area expansion of approximately 110 %. Furthermore, Fig. 2c and d showed that the marked length of 113 nm expanded to 144 nm with a total area expansion of 128 % after full sodiation. Our previous studies have demonstrated that GeP stores more ions during lithiation than during sodiation. However, the larger radius of Na⁺ results in a more significant area expansion of GeP during lithiation compared to sodiation. The area expansion of GeP in the alloying process far exceeded that in the intercalation process [ , ]. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2e and f, multiple cracks were observed in GeP electrodes after 10 cycles in ex-situ SEM due to the expansion of individual GeP nanosheets. Fig. S4 showed that the viscosity of GeP electrode is poor after lithiation or sodiation, and GeP easily detached from the copper foil in lithiation. As exhibited in Fig. 2g, this expansion caused GeP nanosheets to lose contact with other media and current collectors, resulting in the destruction of GeP electrode framework during charge and discharge cycles in the cell. It led to poor mechanical robustness. The primary reason for electrode failure is attributed to a low initial coulombic efficiency."

                        "Compared with the high-temperature and high-pressure methods, simple mixing by ultrasonication is less likely to damage the original GeP. As shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S5, the GeP nanosheets were small and uniform, rich in germanium and phosphorus, and uniformly distributed on the surface without any other elements, as confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Fig. 3a and c revealed that the surface of the GeP/SWCNTs electrode exhibits a typical morphology of SWCNTs. The GeP nanosheets are well-dispersed within the carbon matrix, creating a three-dimensional network that supports the GeP nanosheets in Fig. S6 and Fig. S7. This structure provided the GeP/SWCNTs electrode with superior resistance to expansion. Fig. 3d demonstrated that the GeP nanosheet has an ultrathin and transparent lamellar shape within the GeP/SWCNTs. The marked diffraction spots in Fig. 3e can be attributed to the (−20-1), (1–11), and (-1-10) planes, respectively. The HRTEM images in Fig. 3f showed parallel lattice fringes corresponding to the (201) planes, with a d-spacing of 5.19 Å for GeP, consistent with the SAED pattern viewed along the same zone axis. These results indicate that GeP retained its original structure and no new phases were formed after the creation of GeP/SWCNTs. The pristine GeP and GeP/SWCNTs composite exhibited sharp diffraction peaks at 13.9°, 21.1°, and 26.8°, corresponding to the GeP (20-1), (20-2), and (111) planes, as shown in Fig. 3g and Fig. S8 [ ]. The impedance of the GeP/SWCNTs electrode was lower than that of the GeP electrode, as illustrated in Fig. 3h, indicating that SWCNTs contributed to enhancing the electronic conductivity of GeP. Fig. 3i presents a comparison of Young's modulus for the GeP electrode and the GeP/SWCNTs electrode. The GeP electrode containing SWCNTs demonstrates a higher Young's modulus. The conductive network formed by SWCNTs reduces the strain experienced by GeP under unit stress, resulting in greater resistance to deformation during the charge/discharge processes of the GeP electrode [ ]. The incorporation of GeP/SWCNTs significantly enhances the mechanical toughness of the entire electrode while also effectively controlling the discharge capacity and improving electrical conductivity."

As shown in Fig. 4a–c (lithiation) and Fig. 5a–c (sodiation), GeP anode with SWCNTs exhibits better ion transport properties, leading to a higher diffusion coefficient. Therefore, the ion distribution along the thickness direction of the GeP/SWCNTs electrode is more uniform [ ]. The result is consistent with the analysis of impedance comparison. The distribution of Li+ or Na+ in the electrode has an important effect on its internal stress in Fig. 4d–f and Fig. 5d–f. The internal ion distribution of the electrode is more uniform, resulting in lower diffusion stress and improved mechanical properties. This also means enhanced ion transport properties, increased resistance to expansion deformation, and reduced internal stress [ ]. Fig. 4g–i and Fig. 5g–i showed that the displacement of GeP/SWCNTs anode is also smaller, which further confirms that SWCNTs have a constraining effect on the lithiation/sodiation process of GeP at the same depth, reducing the overall expansion of the electrode. Overall, mixing with SWCNTs can significantly enhance the mechanical properties of the GeP electrode, thereby improving its ability to store Li+ and Na+."

The first discharge/charge curve also displayed two platforms in the range of 0.79-0.45 V and 0.3–0.01 V in Fig. 6d, respectively.

With a ratio of 7:3 between GeP and SWCNTs (GeP loading mass: 1.1–1.4 mg cm−2), the electrode demonstrated optimal performance, striking a balance between the specific capacity and stability of the electrodes.

Fig. 6f showed that the GeP/SWCNTs electrode delivered a considerable initial specific capacity of 719/793 mA h g−1 and Coulombic efficiency of approximately 90 % in SIBs. The obtained capacity was still high and reached 397 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. The cyclability at high current density is shown in Fig. S10.",

Fig. S11a showed two sets of binding energies of 126.8 eV, 133.2 eV and 127.8 eV, 133.1 eV [ , ]. The binding energies were identified by the two phases of Li3P, LiaPOb and the phases of Na3P, and NaaPOb, respectively [ ]. LiaPOb and NaaPOb were generated by the decomposition of electrolytes on the surface of GeP/SWCNTs [ ]. As shown in Fig. S11b, the peaks at 29.6 eV and 23.4 eV were attributed to the binding energies of LixGe and NaxGe, respectively on the basis of the reported articles [ ]. The results were consistent with the CVs of GeP/SWCNTs in LIBs and SIBs. CVs showed an irreversible peak near 0.73 V attributed to the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) in Fig. S12a. The redox peaks at 0.04 V and 0.46 V corresponded to the alloying and dealloying of LixGe. The peaks around 0.42 V and 0.86 V could be attributed to the Li3P redox behaviour [ ], which is consistent with that of previous work. The CVs showed two distinct oxidation peaks at 0.47 V and 0.74 V on the first cycles in Fig. S12b, which were consistent with the dealloying of Na3P, and NaxGe [ , ].

GeP nanosheets exhibited an average 110 % area expansion after the first lithiation, and an average 128 % area expansion after the first sodiation. Nevertheless, the expansions of GeP nanosheets caused obvious cracks or fractures among the active material, binder and collector in charge-discharge cycles, leading to the least desirable first CE. Thus, we developed a strategy to mitigate the stress and strain caused by expansion and enhance the mechanical properties of GeP electrodes in lithiation and sodiation by incorporating SWCNTs. GeP nanosheets were wrapped up by mixing SWCNTs, aiding in the formation of a cohesive network structure. GeP/SWCNTs electrode showed an initial specific capacity of 778/911 mAh g−1 with a CE of ∼85 % in LIBs and a considerable initial specific capacity of 719/793 mAh g−1 with a CE of approximately ∼90 % for SIBs. After 200 cycles, the capacity of 456 mAh g−1 and 397 mAh g−1 were still maintained for GeP/SWCNTs electrode in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. GeP/SWCNTs were superior to GeP in terms of cyclic stability and rate capacity."
