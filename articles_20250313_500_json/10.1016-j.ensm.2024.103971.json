                "The strategy of multiphase engineering has garnered significant interests due to the potential for achieving high energy density and long cycling lifespan towards layer-structured oxide cathode materials. However, challenges such as phase separation arising from different expansion coefficients among phases under high voltage or during prolonged cycling have been a concern. Bridging effect from a spinel phase was in-situ introduced herein via a target element quenching process. The introduced stabilized spinel-bridged phase can create a structural confinement between the O3 and P2 phases and realize interface reconstructing simultaneously by target-element optimization. Based on the experimental and computational results, the multiphase riveting-structured O3/spinel/P2 triphasic structure provides a structural constraint and alleviates the internal stress, which can suppress detrimental irreversible phase changes to enhance the structural reversibility and stability. Beneficial to the optimized ions high diffusion kinetics and lower diffusion barriers, the obtained O3/spinel/P2-Na0.98Ni0.3Cu0.1Ti0.05Mo0.05Mn0.5O2-δSδ demonstrates an impressive initial capacity of 178.6 mAh g-1 at a current density of 10 mA g-1, with a remarkable capacity retention rate of 86.65% over 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1. This innovative approach offers a new solution for preparing structurally stable, high-performance layer-structured oxides with satisfied cycling performance for sodium-ion batteries.",

                "The abundance of sodium resources has played a pivotal role in driving the rapid advancement of sodium-ion batteries. To satisfy the increasing high energy density requirement, various types of sodium-ion cathode materials have been explored, mainly including polyanionic structured materials, organic compound materials and layered transition metal oxide materials [ ]. Among these, the layer-structured transition metal oxide cathode materials have attracted considerable attention due to their straightforward synthesis conditions and promising application potential [ , ]. Layer-structured transition metal materials are categorized into O3, P2, and P3 phases based on the stacking sequence of oxygen and the coordination environment of sodium atoms [ ]. The P2 phase has much more open prismatic paths, lower Na+ diffusion barriers and better cycling stability. However, the initial Na+ content of the P2 phase is lower than that of the O3 phase. Nevertheless, the O3 phase material has a higher initial theoretical capacity, accompanied by a series of complex phase transformations during sodium (de)intercalation process. The structural phase is more likely to be destroyed and the cycling stability is poorer than that of the P2 phase material.",
                "To achieve a balance between cyclic stability and high initial theoretical capacity, the strategy of multiple-phase synergistical engineering is proposed, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance to singe phase [ ]. The primary method for preparing multiphase composite involves doping with transition metals such as Cu, Zn, Mo, etc [ ], thereby creating composite structures like P2/O3, P2/P3, P3/O3. The biphasic material exhibits a good cycle stability and a higher initial theoretical capacity. In pursuit of high energy density, the charging voltage typically exceeds 4 V. The phase structure of biphasic material become severely irreversible. In addition, the high-voltage OP2 phase will gradually disappear during the cycle, resulting in an unsatisfied reversibility of the overall material structure and damage to the structure. It is mainly attributed to the severe phase transitions induced during the high-voltage stage, leading to intense stress and substantial damage to the internal structure of material [ , ]. Moreover, the phenomenon of phase separation under high pressure appears due to the different expansion coefficients between two phases. A spinel bridging phase was in-situ constructed during the targeting-elements quenching process in this work. The targeting-elements sulfur (S) from thiourea solution can be in-situ infused into the O3/P2 layer-structured oxide through cracks created by quenching. A stabilized spinel phase between the O3 and P2 phases can be formed and played as a bridging to relieve the internal stress from both the O3 and P2 phases generated by the severe phase transitions at high-voltage. The multiphase riveting O3/spinel/P2 triphasic structure provides a structural constraining effect [ ], inhibiting detrimental irreversible phase changes, thereby increasing the structural reversibility and stability and significantly of material enhancing its electrochemical performance [ , ]. Meanwhile, the compression of the transition metal layer of the adjoined O3 phase in the direction of the c-axis is caused by the introduction of the spinel phase, ultimately leading to the formation of the superior diffusion channels."

                "The benchmark biphasic material, O3/P2-Na0.98Ni0.3Cu0.1Ti0.05Mo0.05Mn0.5O2 (NNMO), was synthesized using a simple solid-state high-temperature sintering method, by allowing the product to cool naturally after the annealing process of 950 °C for 12 hours (detailed information in the experimental section). As for the experimental sample, the cooling process was different. The NNMO powder was immersed into a thiourea solution directly from the 950 °C, following by second-round high-temperature sintering for O3/spinel/P2-Na0.98Ni0.3Cu0.1Ti0.05Mo0.05Mn0.5O2-δSδ (NNMO-S) (Fig. 1a). In the quenching process, numerous cracks or defects form inside of the material [ ], enabling the targeting-elements S2- ions penetrating from the quenching agent into the NNMO and bonding with the Mo6+ ions, resulting in the creation of the Na2MoS4 spinel phase as shown in the X-ray diffraction results (XRD) (Fig. 1b and 1c)",
                "The Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD data indicates a precise match between the Bragg peaks of the synthesized NNMO and those of the typical O3 structure with the R-3m space group and the P2 layered structure with the P63/mmc space group. These diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern align well with the combined standard cards of PDF#97–009–0113 (P2) and PDF#00–054–0887 (O3) (Fig. S1a and S1b), confirming the formation of a coexistent structure comprising O3 and P2 phases [ , ]. The Rietveld-refined XRD data of NNMO-S reveals a triphasic structure with the additional Fd-3m spinel phase, specifically the Na2MoS4 phase formed by the combination of S2- introduced during quenching with Mo6+ in the transition metal sites. The XRD image of NNMO-S distinctly shows a minor characteristic peak at 27.68°, representing the (311) peak of Na2MoS4. The proportions of O3 and P2 phases in NNMO are 87.87 % and 12.13 %, respectively, while in NNMO-S, the proportions of O3, P2, and the spinel phase are 82.83 %, 11.11 %, and 6.06 % respectively, the structural comparison between NNMO and NNMO-S indicates that the c-axis length of the O3 phase in NNMO-S is slightly larger than that in NNMO, providing a wider channel for Na+ diffusion (Tables S1 and S2). The percentage of the P2 phase in quenched NNMO-S is significantly lower than in NNMO, as indicated by the refined XRD data. This is due to the consumption of part of the P2 and O3 phases to form the bridging Spinel phase between the O3 and P2 phases. In addition, the O3 phase and P2 phase Na+ Formation energy in NNMO can be calculated by DFP. Less energy is required to remove Na+ from the P2 phase compared to the O3 phase, which makes it easier to remove Na+ ions from P2 compared to the O3 phase (Fig. S2). As a result, a greater proportion of the P2 phase is consumed in NNMO-S, leading to a lower P2 phase content in NNMO-S compared to NNMO.",
                "The XRD refinement map reveals that NNMO-S exhibits additional peaks in the 20°-25° range compared to NNMO. This is primarily due to the formation of Na-Mn impurity phases, which arise from Mn precipitation during the firing process. These impurity phases are unstable and degrade the overall stability of the materials. In contrast, NNMO-S undergoes quenching to refine the grains, followed by re-firing to remove the impurity peaks [ , ].",
                "Based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of NNMO and NNMO-S, the comparison diagram of Mo elements (Fig. S3a and S3b) reveals characteristic peaks of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 at 235.5 eV and 232.4 eV, respectively [ ]. It confirms the presence of Mo in the highest valence state of Mo6+, which forms a spinel structure through the spillover from the transition metal sites and bonding with S2-. The analysis of Mn elements, with characteristic peaks of Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 at 655.1 eV and 642.5 eV (Fig. S4a and S4b), signifies the existence of mixed valence states of Mn4+ and Mn3+ in the material [ , ]. There is a significant increase in Mn4+ content, suggesting a higher average valence state of Mn in NNMO-S, making it more effective in suppressing Jahn-Teller distortions than NNMO [ ]. Further XPS analysis of the S element in NNMO and NNMO-S confirms the presence of S2- oxidation state of sulfur, as evidenced by the characteristic peaks in the S 2p orbital spectra of NNMO-S (Fig. 1e), aligning with previous research findings and demonstrating the successful incorporation of S2- into the material post-quenching [ , ].",
                "To further investigate the structural characteristics of NNMO-S, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize the NNMO-S crystals at the atomic scale. They revealed that the NNMO-S material exhibits a smooth crystal surface and an interlaced layer stacking structure as shown in Fig. S5a. However, the rapid cooling during quenching results in the grain size refinement and the formation of cracks (Fig. S5b), enabling the ingress of sulfur into the material [ , ]. The interlocking configuration enhances the stability of NNMO-S during subsequent charge/discharge cycles. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images captured after quenching (Fig. 2a) reveal the coexistence of the O3 phase, spinel structure and P2 phase arranged in an interlocking pattern, resembling a bridging-connected structure. These structural components are distributed across various regions on the material surface, with magnified HRTEM images showcasing distinct striations and exceptional cleanliness [ ]. Moreover, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of NNMO-S (Fig. 2b) confirms the status as a three-phase coexisting cathode material. The crystal plane distances for the O3, spinel and P2 phases measure 0.215 nm, 0.162 nm, and 0.248 nm respectively, corresponding to the (104) plane of the O3 phase, the (220) plane of the spinel phase and the (100) plane of the P2 phase. The discernible diffraction spots for O3 (104), spinel (220), and P2 (100) further validate that quenching induces the formation of a spinel phase between O3 and P2, resulting in an intricately interlocked composite structure (O3/spinel/P2). These findings align with the outcomes of the Rietveld refinement analysis discussed earlier. The Fourier inverse transformation of the labeled region in Fig. 2a reveals clear lattice stripe spacing, as depicted in Fig. 2 (d-f). The analysis shows that the O3 phase of the NNMO-S material exhibits a d-spacing of 2.154 Å, aligning with the (104) crystallographic plane of the O3 phase. Additionally, the spinel phase displays a d-spacing of 1.621 Å, corresponding to the (220) plane, while the P2 phase showcases a d-spacing of 2.487 Å, corresponding to the (100) plane. The Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) images of the NNMO-S material [Fig. S6(a-h)] demonstrate a uniform distribution of all elements throughout the crystal. Based on the HRTEM findings of the NNMO-S material, it can be inferred that the arrangement of the O3, spinel, and P2 phases in NNMO-S is intricate, disordered, and interlaced. The bridging-connected structure illustrated in Fig. 2g plays a crucial role in facilitating phase transitions during the battery's charging and discharging cycles. This structure provides mutual support and tension, effectively reducing the occurrence of detrimental phase transitions.",
                "To better visualize the distinctions introduced by the third phase through quenching, TEM testing and characterization were performed on the NNMO material, as shown in Fig. S7. Fig. S7a demonstrates that NNMO exhibits a disordered distribution of the O3 and P2 phases, without evidence of the third phase. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. S7e further confirm the presence of only O3 and P2 phases, consistent with previously reported TEM images of these phases [ , ]. Fig. S7b highlights the coexistence region of the O3 and P2 phases, where the crystal plane spacings of 0.251 nm and 0.108 nm correspond to the (100) plane of the P2 phase and the (104) plane of the O3 phase, respectively. As shown in Fig. S7c, NNMO is confirmed to exhibit a standard layered structure, with no traces of quenching evident. While this conventional P2 and O3 structure is superior to single-phase materials, it remains prone to significant structural collapse and lattice distortions under high pressures. In contrast, the NNMO-S material, with the spinel phase introduced by quenching, demonstrates superior structural stability and enhanced cycling properties at high pressures due to its unique multiphase structure.",
                "The electrochemical testing of NNMO and NNMO-S materials was carried out within a voltage range of 1.50–4.25 V. The comparison of the first and second charge-discharge cycles of NNMO and NNMO-S materials is illustrated in Fig. 3a and 3d. The unquenched NNMO material exhibited an initial capacity of 138.20 mAh g-1, while the quenched NNMO-S material demonstrated an initial capacity of 178.60 mAh g-1. The substantial enhancement in the initial capacity of NNMO-S can be attributed to the rise in Mn4+ content, inducing a cationic effect that triggers the partial conversion of the P2 phase to the O3 phase [ , ]. NNMO-S also demonstrates an extended discharge plateau at 1.90 V, effectively mitigating voltage fading. The plateau observed at 2.80 V corresponds to the oxidation–reduction of Mn4+ and Mn3+, while above 3.0 V, the plateau is primarily due to the redox of Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+. In the second charge-discharge curves, NNMO shows a noticeable decrease in capacity during the second cycle compared to the first, indicating an irreversible phase transition [ ]. On the other hand, NNMO-S exhibits superior performance, demonstrating reduced capacity loss and improved reproducibility in the charge-discharge curves. It can be observed that NNMO-S has a stronger discharge capacity around 2 V compared to NNMO, primarily due to the fact that the Spinel phase in NNMO-S exhibits a longer discharge plateau near 2V (Fig. S8), providing greater discharge capacity for NNMO-S at 2 V. Additionally, the O3 phase has a larger capacity and stronger discharge capability than the P2 phase, and the larger proportion of O3 in NNMO-S further contributes to the enhanced discharge performance of NNMO-S.",
                "Fig. 3b and 3e illustrate the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of NNMO and NNMO-S during the initial two cycles at a scan rate of 0.1 mV·s-1. Consistent with the charge-discharge curves, the three oxidation–reduction peaks observed between 3.29 V to 4.25 V primarily stem from the activation of Ni2+/3+/4+ redox pairs and the organized rearrangement of Na+ vacancies. NNMO-S displays reduced polarization and more closely spaced redox peaks [ ], indicating a more reversible electrochemical process. Furthermore, NNMO exhibits an irreversible peak near high voltage (3.94 V), while NNMO-S demonstrates highly reversible behavior at elevated voltages. The comparison chart of the five-cycle cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of NNMO and NNMO-S (Fig. S9) clearly illustrates the superior cyclic reversibility of NNMO-S in comparison to NNMO. In Fig. 3i, the comparison of cycling performances of NNMO and NNMO-S under 50 mA g-1 current densities reveals notable differences between the two cathode materials. At a current density of 50 mA g-1, after 200 cycles, NNMO exhibits a capacity retention of 64.25%, whereas NNMO-S demonstrates a substantially improved capacity retention of 86.65%. at a high current density of 500 mA g-1 (Fig. S10), after 200 cycles, NNMO-S exhibits a remarkable capacity retention rate of 62.34%, in contrast to NNMO retention rate of only 33.50%.",
                "The incorporation of sulfur leads to the formation of more robust and stable Mo-S bonds compared to Mo-O bonds [ , ]. This results in the contraction of the TMO6 octahedra, inducing compression between the layers of transition metals and expanding the interlayer spacing. The triphasic structure featuring the spinel phase is better equipped to withstand volumetric expansion along the c-axis during phase transitions. It also inhibits the sliding of TMO2 crystal planes caused by phase transitions, providing a more stable pathway for Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. This enhanced stability of the original biphasic structure under high voltage is crucial for improved performance.",
                "To demonstrate the contribution of the three-phase staggered stabilized structure of NNMO-S to overall structural stability and reduced lattice distortion, SEM images of NNMO and NNMO-S materials before and after cycling were obtained. As shown in Fig. S11a and S11b, the grain size and distribution of NNMO-S are more uniform compared to NNMO. This is primarily due to grain refinement and uniform distribution induced by the quenching process. Fig. S11(c-f) illustrate that after a few charge/discharge cycles, both NNMO and NNMO-S exhibit some degree of grain fragmentation and cracking due to repeated volumetric strain and stress release. However, NNMO-S demonstrates reduced particle fragmentation and enhanced structural stability compared to NNMO. This improvement is attributed to the unique three-phase interleaved structure of NNMO-S, which mitigates volumetric strain, controls uneven stress distribution and release, reduces structural damage caused by high-voltage stresses and phase transitions, and enhances electrochemical performance.",
                "The comparison plots of NNMO and NNMO-S at various current densities in Fig. 3c indicate that the cycling performance of NNMO-S surpasses that of NNMO at high current densities. Fig. 3f illustrates that NNMO-S outperforms NNMO in terms of voltage, capacity, cyclic stability, energy density, and rate capability. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) were employed to investigate the Na+ diffusion kinetics of the materials discussed in this article. The Na+ diffusion coefficients during charging and discharging of NNMO and NNMO-S (Fig. 3g) fall within the ranges of 2.0208 × 10–11 to 2.2579 × 10–10 cm2 s-1 and 2.0251 × 10–13 to 2.2081 × 10–12 cm2 s-1, respectively. By examining the temperature-dependent charge transfer resistance through EIS (Fig. 3h), the corresponding energy-quist plots of NNMO-S and NNMO, as well as the equivalent circuit diagrams, are shown in Fig. S12. The apparent activation energies of NNMO and NNMO-S were measured 65.75 kJ mol-1 and 61.46 kJ mol-1. This indicates that NNMO-S possesses a lower potential for ion mobility compared to NNMO. Moreover, the remaining capacity and capacity retention rate after 200 cycles of the O3/Spinel/P2 triphasic NNMO-S material excel compared to other previously reported NNMO materials, as shown in Fig. 3j [ , , , , , , , , ]. This highlights the superior electrochemical performance and stability of the NNMO-S material, emphasizing its potential for advanced sodium-ion battery applications. The superior performance of the O3/spinel/P2 three-phase interleaved structure in NNMO-S is corroborated by the practical validation in the battery charge/discharge cycles.",
                "The charge-discharge tests of O3/P2 NNMO and O3/Spinel/P2 cathode materials were conducted using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques within the voltage range of 1.50–4.25 V to investigate the impact of the three-phase structure of spinel (Na2MoS4). The structural evolution mechanism of Na+ insertion/extraction in the layered NNMO and NNMO-S materials was successfully elucidated Fig. 4a and 4b. Initially, in NNMO (Fig. 4a), the material starts in the initial biphasic O3/P2 state. During the first charging and discharging cycle spanning 1.50 V to 4.25 V, the phase transitions in the NNMO material evolve as follows: O3/P2 → O3/P3/P2 → P3/P2 → OP2/X → P3/P2 → O3/P3/P2 → O3/P2. However, a significant observation is that after the first charge-discharge cycle, NNMO enters the second cycle with a notable decrease in the intensity of the prominent peak. Furthermore, there is a delay in the transition of the P3 phase to the OP2 phase, and once the OP2 phase is entered, the phase transition process shortens, reducing from 1.23° to 0.82° This alteration impacts subsequent phase transitions, diminishing the reversibility to return to the initial state at the end of charging and discharging. This deterioration suggests that NNMO undergoes substantial deformation during the cycling process, leading to structural collapse, deformation, and irreversible changes [ , ]. These effects are primarily attributed to the intense phase transitions at high voltages, exacerbating sliding between TMO2 layers, resulting in distortions, severe structural damage [ , , ], and irreversible phenomena. In contrast, NNMO-S exhibits remarkable performance in-situ XRD tests during the charge-discharge process, indicating enhanced structural stability and superior electrochemical behavior compared to NNMO. As depicted in Fig. 4b, the primary phase transitions in NNMO-S during charging and discharging involve the sequence: O3/spinel/P2 → O3/P3/P2/spinel → P3/P2/spinel → OP2/X/spinel → P3/P2/spinel → O3/P3/P2/spinel → O3/P2/spinel. From Fig. 4b, it is evident that the reversibility of the OP2 phase in two charge-discharge cycles of NNMO-S is exceptional. In the first cycle, the degree of phase change for OP2 is 1.14°, and in the second cycle, this degree reduces by only 0.02° Furthermore, minimal phase changes are observed in other phases during both charge-discharge cycles, underscoring the remarkable reversibility of NNMO-S. Generally, a pronounced voltage plateau may indicate a larger phase transition; however, NNMO-S exhibits a more pronounced voltage plateau at high voltages compared to NNMO, while also demonstrating a more reversible phase transition and a smaller peak offset. This is because the pronounced high-voltage plateau in NNMO-S is primarily attributed to the Spinel phase (Fig. S8a). The high-voltage phase transition in NNMO-S is primarily driven by the O3 phase, with no significant phase transition occurring in the Spinel phase. Furthermore, the Spinel phase, acting as an intermediate phase bridging the O3 and P2 phases in NNMO-S, also helps stabilize the structure at high voltage. As a result, NNMO-S demonstrates a more pronounced high-voltage plateau, while also exhibiting a more reversible phase transition and a smaller peak shift.",
                "Throughout the charge-discharge process, the spinel structure within NNMO-S undergoes slight shifts, with the phase transitions displaying subtle changes in the in-situ XRD patterns. The presence of the interlaced O3/spinel/P2 triphasic structure, incorporating the spinel phase, significantly contributes to the enhanced performance of NNMO-S. The spinel structure within this triphasic configuration exerts an inward restraining force on both the O3 and P2 phases (Fig. 4c), providing structural support, particularly under high-voltage conditions.",
                "To further investigate the phase structure changes of NNMO-S at high voltage, we conducted ex-situ XRD tests on NNMO-S and NNMO after charging to a high voltage of 4.25 V. The results of these tests are presented in Fig. S13a and S13b. The peaks of the O3 phase in NNMO-S and NNMO shift to a lower angle when charged to a high voltage, forming a distinct OP2 phase. Notably, the peak shift in NNMO-S is significantly smaller than in NNMO when charged to 4.25 V. This is corroborated by the results of in situ XRD tests.",
                "The structural mechanism diagrams of the two materials discussed in this article are illustrated as shown in Fig. 4c. During the charging process in NNMO, the primary phase transition involves the transformation from the O3 phase to the P3 phase upon surpassing the high threshold voltage of 4 V. Subsequently, the P3 phase transitions into the OP2 phase. This progression from P3 to OP2 during charging, particularly under high-voltage conditions, results in continuous sliding of crystal planes and lattice distortions, leading to detrimental irreversible phase changes. During the discharge process, as the OP2 phase reverts to the P3 phase [ , ], the decrease in the P3 phase significantly impacts the recovery of the subsequent O3 phase. The high-voltage impact exacerbates the occurrence of harmful irreversible phase transitions, diminishing the reversibility of the structural integrity of NNMO and thereby reducing the cycle life of the battery [ ]. Conversely, NNMO-S incorporates the spinel structure (Na2MoS4) positioned between the O3 and P2 phases. This configuration exerts a structural constraining effect on both the O3 and P2 phases, effectively suppressing harmful irreversible phase transitions under high-voltage conditions and absorbing the stress induced by high voltages. This mechanism enhances the stability and reversibility of the structure, contributing to the improved performance and longevity of the battery.",
                "To deeply explore the structural stability and the degree of improvement of sodium ion diffusion in the three-phase material NNMO-S obtained through quenching, the bulk modulus, which typically indicates the material ability to resist stress, was considered. In this study, the Born-Huang's mechanical stability theory was initially employed to calculate the elasticity coefficient of the various phases in the NNMO-S material. The obtained bulk modulus (B) is visualized in 3D plots in Fig. 5. The 3D diagrams in Fig. 5 (a-c) visualize that the spinel phase in NNMO-S is spherical, indicating excellent compressive anisotropy. This suggests that the introduction of the spinel phase enhances the material strength, which may aid in reducing structural collapse and enhancing the electrode material toughness during the subsequent cycling process. The bulk modulus of the introduced Spinel phase is 29.197 Gpa, which is significantly lower than that of the O3 phase (147.362 Gpa) and the P2 phase (145.312 Gpa) in the NNMO-S material. It can be hypothesized that the introduction of the spinel phase can reduce the internal stresses in the original NNMO two-phase material. Subsequently, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, which are widely used for accurate simulation and modeling of atomic-scale interactions, were employed [ ]. In this experiment, the sodium ion migration mechanisms were simulated using DFT, and the activation energies of the sodium ions along the diffusion paths were calculated. Fig. 5d shows the ideal NNMO-S and NNMO sodium ion migration paths. Along these selected paths, the sodium ion migration barriers were calculated, and the energies of the migration barriers are shown in Fig. 5e. The results indicate that the diffusion barriers of NNMO-S are lower than those of NNMO. It is attributed to the compression of the TM layer of the adjoined O3 phase in the direction of the c-axis caused by the introduction of the spinel phase, ultimately leading to the formation of the NNMO-S diffusion channels. This effect is caused by the compression of the TM layer of the bonded O3 phase along the c-axis, resulting from the introduction of the spinel phase, which ultimately leads to an increase in the spacing between the layers of NNMO-S. This is consistent with the results of the c-axis distances of NNMO-S and NNMO measured in the refined XRD in the previous section. Additionally, the bulk modulus calculations and the calculation of the sodium migration barriers of the DFT indicate that the bridging structure constructed by quenching alleviates the internal stresses of the material, and contributes to the diffusion of the sodium ions and the enhancement of structural stability. These calculations can enhance the mechanistic study of the quenched bridged three-phase structure and provide a reference for the subsequent design and development of excellent cathode materials.",
                "The positive electrode of the assembled whole cell utilizes NNMO-S material, while traditional hard carbon is employed for the anode [ , ]. The electrochemical performance of the hard carbon material used for the anode is depicted in Fig. 6a and Fig. S14. The charge-discharge cycling graph of NNMO-S//hard carbon at 10 mA g-1 over five cycles (Fig. 6b) reveals an initial discharge-specific capacity of 123.6 mAh g-1 for the NNMO-S//hard carbon full cell. The good reversibility observed after five cycles indicates stable performance without noticeable capacity degradation. The charge-discharge curves of the NNMO-S//hard carbon full cell at different rates exhibit a progressive decrease in initial discharge capacity with increasing charge-discharge rates. However, at higher rates, such as 500 mA g-1, the capacity degradation is minimal. This superior performance can be attributed to the unique interlocking O3/Spinel/P2 triphasic structure of NNMO-S, which effectively suppresses harmful irreversible phase transitions under high voltage and current conditions, ensuring structural stability during cycling. The cycle stability of the NNMO-S//Hard carbon full cell is remarkably excellent, with capacity retention values of 73.95 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and 60.45 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 200 cycles (Fig. 6g). Furthermore, the NNMO-S//hard carbon whole cell exhibits higher average operating voltage, energy density, and working voltage during operation compared to various existing NNMO materials (Fig. 6c and 6e). To showcase the practical application capabilities, the complete cell successfully powers the colorful light strips (Fig. 6h), highlighting the real-world potential of the NNMO-S cathode beyond expectations [ ]. The comprehensive electrochemical data of the full cell underscores the robust structural integrity of NNMO-S throughout the charging and discharging process, emphasizing its significant potential as a sodium-ion battery cathode for future large-scale energy storage systems."

                "In summary, the targeting-elements quenching method was utilized to in-situ introduce sulfur into the O3/P2 layer-structured oxide, realizing a bridging-connected effect between the O3 and P2 phases by constructing a molybdate-type spinel structure. This strategy can enhance the stability and mitigates structural collapse and irreversible phase transitions at high voltages. The obtained O3/spinel/P2-Na0.98Ni0.3Cu0.1Ti0.05Mo0.05Mn0.5O2-δSδ material demonstrates a superior cyclic stability and higher up to 178.6 mAh g-1 initial specific capacity. Even under high current density conditions of 500 mA g-1, it maintains a remarkable capacity retention rate of 86.65% after 200 cycles. Experimental and computational results show that the unique O3/spinel/P2 bridging-connected structure plays a crucial role in enhancing performance by constraining harmful irreversible phase transitions and preventing continuous slippage of TMO2 layers during Na+ intercalation and deintercalation, particularly at higher current densities. The assembled whole cell coupled with hard carbon also exhibited impressive electrochemical performance, showcasing significant potential for practical applications. An excellent cycle stability was exhibited, with capacity retention values of 73.95 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and 60.45 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 200 cycles."
