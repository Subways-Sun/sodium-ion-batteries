                "Blue phosphorene (Blu-Pn) has recently been identified as a new two-dimensional (2D) form of black phosphorus via the epitaxial growth method and has shown the ability to host a substantial amount of Na while serving as an anode in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, its structural instability is an issue that hinders its further exploitability in NIBs. In this paper, we propose to chemically modify the Blu-Pn network by substituting six phosphorus atoms with a carbon source in the form of a C6 ring, constructing a new and robust CP2 nanosheet. Based on the state-of-the-art non-local van der Waals corrected density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations, we systematically explore the feasibility of the designed CP2 as a potential anode material for NIBs. Adding a C6 ring in the Blu-Pn lattice reduces its energy gap from 2 eV to 1.3 eV, which disappears after Na adsorption, indicating a conductive character. Attributed to the synergistic effect, the adsorption energy of Na on CP2 nanosheet (−2.22 eV) is greatly decreased in comparison to the pristine carbon source (e.g., graphene with −0.78 eV) and pristine Blu-Pn (−1.85 eV). The Na diffusivity on CP2 at 300 K is predicted to be 4.90 × 10−11 m2/s by AIMD. The specific capacity is up to 604.1 mAh/g, which exceeds that of the commercialized graphite anode (372 mA h/g). Ultimately, the designed electrode provides a small open circuit potential of 0.66 V that falls within a desirable voltage range. This work paves the way for exploring Blu-Pn 2D anode materials for NIBs technology and provides valuable insights into surface chemical modification towards the long-term stability of Blu-Pn.",

                "The depletion of natural resources worldwide, along with the worsening environmental crisis and increasing energy needs in the field of electronics, has created an immediate need for energy storage technologies that are efficient and cost-effective [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. To meet this demand, it is essential to create sustainable energy storage systems that can provide high energy density at an affordable cost. In the world market, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are taking a big place among several electrochemical energy storage technologies developed thanks to their high energy and power density, ecological friendliness, and extended lifespan [5,6]. Furthermore, it is expected that LIBs will shortly be widely used in the automotive industry, particularly in plug-in hybrid and electric cars, to lessen energy reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels [7,8]. According to the literature, the global battery energy storage market is expected to experience an annual growth rate of 23 % or higher by the end of 2030 [[9], [10], [11]]. Nonetheless, lithium (Li), a key resource for battery production, is scarce in the Earth's crust, making up only 0.0017 % by weight [5,12]. Moreover, it is found in politically unstable regions, making its extraction difficult and expensive; indeed, these challenges make the process of exploiting Li as the “white gold” for battery production a daunting task [12,13]. This has led to significant research and development in sustainable energy storage, and one promising solution is the use of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), which rely on the abundant and eco-friendly element sodium (Na) [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. It is worth noting that sodium (Na) has an estimated total concentration of 2.8 wt% in the earth's crust [19,20]. In addition, Na and Li share similar physical and chemical properties despite their different energy densities due to their standard electrode potentials and atomic radii [21]. Therefore, it is important to design suitable anode materials that can accommodate the larger size of Na, while having adequate electrochemical properties such as high storage capacity, structural stability, good adsorption energy, fast mobility, and affordability to create high-performance NIBs.",
                "Since Sony Corporation introduced LIBs in the late 20th century, graphite has been recognized as the perfect marketable negative electrode material owing to its high energy density, abundance, low manufacturing price, and extended lifespan [22,23]. However, graphite is thermodynamically inactive for NIBs due to its small interlayer distance compared to the large size of the sodium atom [24], which limits the number of ions that can be stored between the layers; only an impractical storage capacity of 35 mAh/g has been obtained for NaC64 [25]. Over the past decade, enormous ongoing research has been conducted on the development of adequate Na hosts as alternatives to graphite, involving several chemistry mechanisms, including organic, intercalation, alloying, conversion, and conversion-alloying anodes [14,26]. Black phosphorus (BP), a good example of the alloy family along with silicon, tin, antimony, and germanium, has recently captured much research interest as a potential alternative anode to graphite for both LIBs and NIBs. It showed an exceptional specific capacity of 2596 mAh/g (for Li3P and Na3P) [27,28]. Nevertheless, this capacity is unstable and fades rapidly during cycling due to the enormous volume change of active material accompanied by fatal structural loss [27,29]. To mitigate these failures, several nano-structuring design methods have been proposed, most of them adopting nanosizing strategies, notably reducing the dimension from the bulk 3D to the two-dimensional (2D) streamlined structure and zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles [28,30]. The latter idea has been inspired by Novoselov et al.'s pioneering work since 2004, where they isolated graphene, the 2D-layer form of graphite [31]. Indeed, these extraordinary emerging 2D nanomaterials possess unique morphology and structure and exhibit excellent characteristics that could not be provided in their 3D counterpart, mainly on account of their large surface-to-volume ratio, super-hardness, intriguing optical properties, strong quantum confinement effects, etc. [28,32,33].",
                "Black phosphorene (Black-Pn) is the first 2D configuration of BP obtained through mechanical delamination [34]. It exhibits unprecedented properties like in-plane structural anisotropy, high carrier mobility, and distinct band gap tunability, which makes it suitable for diverse applications [28]. Several research studies have suggested that Black-Pn can be employed as an anode material for advanced alkali metal-ion batteries owing to its interesting electrochemical features [28,[35], [36], [37]]. Blue phosphorene (Blu-Pn), a new 2D allotropic phase of BP brother to Black-Pn, has gained attention from researchers since its theoretical proposal by Zhou et al. in 2014, joining the 2D family [[38], [39], [40], [41]]. It is a semiconductor with a wide indirect gap energy of 2 eV [32,39,42]. Shortly after, Zhang et al. successfully prepared Blu-Pn using the epitaxial growth method with BP as a precursor [43]. Unlike Black-Pn with a puckered structure, Blu-Pn has a buckled structure with slightly flatter zigzag edges and a wrinkled surface, which is beneficial for achieving strong adsorption and rapid diffusion of metal ions when used as anodes for batteries [42,44,45]. Despite its promising potential, Blu-Pn, like other 2D materials, has some shortcomings that need to be overcome. For instance, it is vulnerable to rapid chemical degradation in the open air [46], and it has low electronic conductivity due to its sizeable indirect bandgap [39]. These limitations may restrict its exploitability in battery devices unless they are addressed. To mitigate these weaknesses, various strategies have been proposed, such as strain and defect engineering [[47], [48], [49], [50]], hetero-molecule/atom doping [51], applying an external electric field [52,53], and building Blu-Pn-based heterostructures [32,54]. Research works focused also on surface functionalization and modification of Blu-Pn [38,[55], [56], [57], [58], [59]].",
                "In this paper, we present significant findings on the development of a host anode for NIBs. Our approach involves chemical surface modification, wherein we propose a new CP2 nanosheet made of Blu-Pn that has been chemically modified with a carbon source, C6. This approach is aimed at overcoming the inherent drawbacks of Blu-Pn and achieving high-performance NIBs. This is a new and unexplored approach for Blu-Pn, and we believe it has the potential to be a promising anode material. We used non-local van der Waals-based density functional theory (DFT) approximation methods to investigate the stability of CP2 nanosheets. Additionally, we studied how Na adsorbs on the CP2 surface and calculated the activation energy barriers for Na diffusion. We also verified the thermal stability of the CP2 system at elevated temperatures using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our computations of the average potential and maximum adsorption-specific capacity indicate a remarkably high capacity."

                "All simulations conducted in the present work are performed using the DFT-based Quantum Espresso code [60]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the formalism proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) is used to estimate the exchange and correlation functional in conjunction with the projected augmented wave (PAW) method to describe the electron-ion interactions [61]. Furthermore, we employed the original non-local density functional (vdW-DF) method developed by Dion et al. in all simulations, utilizing the “optB88-vdW” functional to accurately model the vdW interactions [62]. The energy cutoff applied for wave functions and charge density were set to 50 Ry and 400 Ry, respectively. Moreover, all structures were relaxed by the conjugate gradient method until the forces on each atom were less than 0.02 eV/Å, and the energy convergence with the energy difference was less than 10−8 eV. We use a 6 × 6 × 1 k-point of the Monkhorst-Pack method for the structural optimization and 12 × 12 × 1 for the density of states (DOS) and the electronic band structure, respectively. The diffusion barriers of Na on the CP2 nanosheet were performed using the standard NEB method [63]. To analyze the charge redistribution and transfer mechanism between Na and CP2 nanosheet, we use the Bader charge algorithm [64]. We also utilized AIMD simulations to check the thermal stability of the designed system at elevated temperatures. Ultimately, all these analyses are visualized using (XCrySDen) and (VESTA) software [65,66]."

                        "The morphology and structure of materials have a significant impact on their physical and chemical properties. To accurately simulate the properties of the CP2 nanosheet, we began by examining the stability of its hexagonal structure and its electronic properties. We prepared the unit cell of the CP2 nanosheet, which is illustrated in Fig. 1(a, b). This nanosheet has a pleated honeycomb structure and consists of 12 phosphorus atoms and 6 carbon atoms. The Blu-Pn is known for its distorted honeycomb layer structure, which gives it some unusual properties [[67], [68], [69]]. In this particular study, each phosphorus atom is connected to two adjacent phosphorus atoms in the same plane (marked as in-plane) and to another carbon atom in a different plane (designated as out-plane). These atoms are covalently bonded, forming a two-dimensional CP2 structure. The lattice constants for this structure are a = b = 8.94 Å and c = 30 Å. The lengths of the out-of-plane (dout) PP and in-plane (din) PP, PC, and CC bonds after the structure has relaxed are 2.243, 2.213, 1.913, and 1.438 Å, respectively, and CC bond angle (θ) is 120°, The obtained structural properties exhibit a strong agreement with previous theoretical findings [61,[70], [71], [72]].",
                        "Understanding the bonding process between Blu-Pn and carbon atoms (PC) is crucial for enhancing the edge stability of the CP2 nanosheet and developing high-performance materials, we calculated the charge density of the CP2 nanosheet to determine the nature of the bond between P and C atoms. If there is charge accumulation in the center of the two atoms, a covalent bond must develop between the P and C atoms, as we know. Fig. 2(a, b) illustrates the charge distribution within the system, indicating that the majority of the charge is concentrated on the surface between P and C atoms. This observation suggests that the bond between P and C atoms is covalent. The value obtained from the Bader charge analysis is 0.57 |e|. This validated the formation of the previously stated PC bonds in the CP2.",
                        "Additionally, the cohesive energy of the pristine CP2 nanosheet was calculated using the following formula [73]:(1)",
                        "E C = E C P 2 − 12 E P − 6 E C u",
                        "Here,",

                        "E C is −6.17 eV/atom, suggesting the structural stability of the designed CP2 system. This value is also of the same order of magnitude as those of other published results on, for example, BlackP (−3.71 eV/atom) [68], graphene (−7.95 eV/atom) [73], and Be2C (−5.78 eV/atom) [74], also implying that the CP2 nanosheet could be prepared experimentally.",
                        "The corrected optB88-vdW DFT calculations were performed to investigate the electronic band structure of the CP2 nanosheet. The corresponding results are presented in Fig. 3(a). It is evident from the figure that the CP2 structure behaves as a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.3 eV. This value is notably smaller than that of pristine Blu-Pn reported in the literature using optB86b-vdW (2.02 eV), DFT-D2 (2.00 eV), and GGA (1.94 eV) methods [75,76]. Given that these approximations are known to underestimate the gap energy and the HSE06 method is more suitable for describing semiconducting materials [39], our calculation of the gap energy using this method also aligns with the gap energy reduction trend observed in vdW approximation. Specifically, we compare the gap energy of 2.10 eV for CP2 with the previously reported results for pure Blu-Pn, which is 2.73 eV [53]. We subsequently computed the TDOS and PDOS characteristics of the pure CP2 nanosheet to get a better understanding of the projected electronic state of our designed material. Fig. 3(b) gives the partial DOS and the total DOS of CP2. It is obvious that the p-states of the P and C atoms are located around the fermi level at the top and bottom of the valence and conduction bands, respectively. The overlap between the P-3p and C-2p orbitals leads to strong hybridization sp3, due to the five and four valences' electrons of phosphorus and carbon, respectively. These valence electrons are saturated by the formation of PC covalent bonds, we also know that the system is thermodynamically more stable because the electronic states are located at lower energies [71]. As a result, the electrical conductivity of the CP2 nanosheet could be greatly improved by incorporating a carbon source compared to the pristine Blu-Pn.",
                        "In addition to the cohesive energy previously determined, it is crucial to evaluate the kinetic and thermal stability of CP2 before investigating its electrochemical features. To this end, we initially employed phonopy software to calculate the phonon spectra [77]. The results are presented in Fig. 4. It is evident that there are no imaginary frequencies throughout the entire path of the first Brillouin zone, indicating the kinetic stability of the designed nanosheet. Subsequently, AIMD simulations within the NVT ensemble were conducted to examine the structural stability of the CP2 system at 400 K. In Fig. 5(a), the total energy and temperature variations are depicted over a period of 1 to 20 ps, with a time step of 1 fs. It is observed from the figure that the fluctuations appear to stabilize throughout the MD simulation. Additionally, Fig. 5(b, c) provides snapshots of the structure of the CP2 nanosheet taken at 20 ps, revealing the absence of structural deformation and atomic shifts throughout the simulation. This result suggests the potential stability of the CP2 nanosheet structure under elevated temperatures."

                        "To select a material to use as a negative electrode in alkali metal-ion batteries, it must have the capability to adsorb the metal ions with large adsorption energy. Therefore, the potential Na adsorption sites on the CP2 nanosheet surface were investigated in order to methodically explore the adsorption characteristics of Na ions on the material. We investigated this surface for Na binding by putting one alkali atom in various locations. In order to achieve the lowest binding energy, the single Na atom is positioned at several locations for thorough structural optimization. Furthermore, owing to the symmetry of the designed CP2 nanosheet, there are four stable sites, which are HP (HP1, HP2), HP-C, and HC site. HP is located above the center of the Blu-Pn hexagonal, HP-C is positioned on the center of the hexagonal formed by P and C atoms, HC is situated on the center of ring C6, and the last site, BP-C is located at the midpoint of the CP bond. The adsorption energy (EA) is calculated as follows [65]:(2)",

                        "E Na is the total energy of a single alkali-metal atom. Fig. 6(a, b) demonstrates that the CP2 nanosheet has five adsorption sites as we have mentioned above. Table 1 shows the adsorption energies for a single Na atom adsorbed on the different sites of the CP2 nanosheet compared with Blu-Pn and graphene. In the case of CP2, the HP1 is the most stable and favorable site for accepting sodium atoms and becomes energetically favorable site thermodynamically with an adsorption energy of −2.22 eV. Similarly, when the Na atom is adsorbed at Site HP1, it has three nearest neighbors, the NaP distances in this site are 2.86, 2.92, and 2.92 Å, as observed after the process of adsorption, the NaP ionic bonds are strong because of the hexagonal ring of Blu-Pn. On the other hand, the other sites have a lower number of phosphorus atoms surrounded by Na than for the H site. For the sake of comparison, we also investigated Na adsorption on the original freestanding Blu-Pn and graphene layers. Upon optimizing the structures, we identified three stable sites for Na adsorption on Blu-Pn (Vp, Hp, and Tp), while graphene exhibited one stable Na site (Hc). These sites are illustrated in Fig. 6(c, d), and their corresponding adsorption energies are listed in Table 1. The stable Na site on Blu-Pn has an energy of −1.52 eV (Vp), while Hc on graphene has an energy of −0.78 eV, in agreement with previously reported results [32,76,78]. It is important to note that these values indicate lower stability compared to the CP2 nanosheet. This indicates that the Na atoms prefer adsorption sites with a large coordination number with high electronegativity [37], which suggests a strong interaction between the Na atom and the CP2 nanosheet at the Hp1 site. However, this result can be useful in inhibiting the formation of Na dendrites. In comparison to other 2D examples in the literature, this binding energy is more than that recently reported for Na in 2D Blu-Pn (−0.96 eV), borophane (−1.08 eV), arsenene (− 1.91 eV), silicene (− 1.58 eV), stanene (− 1.54 eV), graphene (− 0.71 eV), phosphorene (− 1.59 eV) and germanene (1.54 eV) [42,[78], [79], [80], [81], [82]].",
                        "Electronic conductivity is another key factor in measuring the suitability of an anode material for NIBs. In other words, the bandgap has a direct effect on the electronic conductivity characteristic of the material studied, a low or no bandgap is highly desirable. Therefore, we studied the impact of Na adsorption on the CP2 nanosheet at the most stable site Hp1, and calculated partial and total densities of states (PDOS) as depicted in Fig. 7. As we previously evidenced there is no DOS around the Fermi level of the pristine CP2 nanosheet, featuring semiconductor nature. However, after the adsorption of the Na atom, the system changes its nature and becomes metallic due to Na's charge-giving property (Fig. 7). Additionally, when Na is adsorbed in the CP2 nanosheet, the Fermi level is drawn into the conduction band. The system's electronic conductivity is increased compared to the pure material (Fig. 3(a)). As a result of the increase of charge carriers in the system, the behavior changes to metallic. This is advantageous to the battery's anode electrode.",

Most charge distribution occurs at the interface of Na and CP2 nanosheet, the contour of charge accumulation can be seen close to the host CP2 surface, indicating a charge transfer from Na to the system. This could establish a substantial coulombic interaction between the Na atom and the CP2 system, because of the strong binding energy between the Na and CP2 nanosheet. Moreover, the Bader charge analysis was used to determine the number of charges exchanged during the adsorption process of Na in CP2, Blu-Pn, and graphene. In Table 1, all values found during the calculation for the chosen sites are displayed. After adsorption, the Na atom experiences charge losses of 0.75|e| for HP1 and HP2, and 0.86 |e|, 0.85|e|, and 0.91|e| for Hp-c, Bp-c, and Hc, respectively. Moreover, the Bader charge values at the stable site of Blu-Pn and graphene are 0.85 |e| and 0.71 |e|, respectively. Which is consistent with the literature (Bleu-Pn 0.89 |e| and graphene 0.76 |e|) [37,42,84]. The charge losses for HP1 and HP2 sites are lower compared to the other sites."

                        "In rechargeable NIBs, the speed of Na ion during the charge/discharge cycle is also a crucial factor in measuring their suitability, which depends on the mobility of metal atoms on the anode materials. This mobility is influenced by the diffusion barrier associated with atom transport and the electrical conductivity of the system. To ensure the long-term use of anode materials in rechargeable batteries, it is important to have low barrier energy. Poor ionized diffusion can lead to structural damage during continuous cycling, reducing battery lifespan [85,86]. We utilized NEB simulations to investigate the transport characteristics of alkali metals in anode materials [63]. Atoms will diffuse into the CP2 by jumping from the Hp1 site to their nearest neighbors in order to find the minimum energy paths for Na diffusion. Two distinct paths were investigated, taking into account the binding energy of each site. As previously indicated, the Hp1 site is the most stable with the lowest ground state energy as shown in Table 1. The trajectories on which we based our calculations are presented in Fig. 9(a, b). According to the calculations and computations, it is determined that path I, which starts from HP1 and passes through the points (HP1–HPC4–HC–HPC1–HP2), has a barrier energy of 0.76 eV, indicating that the Na diffusion from Path I of the CP2 nanosheet to the other side is a little bit difficult. On the other hand, path II, starting from the same location but following a different trajectory (HP1–HPC3–HPC2–HPC1–HP2), has a barrier energy of 0.56 eV. As a result, path II has a lower energy compared to path I. Furthermore, pathway II is the more favorable route for Na diffusion. However, this value is higher than some 2D anode materials, such as BlackP (0.04 eV) [37], Bi (0.06 eV) [79], V2CSi2 (0.08 eV) [87], GeS (0.09 eV) [88], Blu-Pn (0.11 eV) [42], TiS2 (0.13 eV), ReS2 (0.16 eV) [89], Ti2CSi2 (0.22 eV) [87], but it has the same value with MoN2 (0.56 eV) [90], and still very lower than Ge (2.19 eV) and Si (3.56 eV) [81]. These results indicate that the CP2 nanosheet provides an activation energy barrier within an acceptable range compared to existing 2D materials gathered in Fig. 10.",
                        "It is believed that increased ion adsorption, along with higher temperatures during battery loading, can substantially influence its overall performance [91]. Therefore, determining the diffusion coefficient (D) of Na ions can provide insights into the ionic conductivity of the electrode material. To determine D, we simulated multiple Na ions within the CP2 structure, conducting AIMD simulations at 300 K in the NVT ensemble. Based on previous work on determining D by atomic scale MD via the Arrhenius equation, defined as follows [92,93].(4)",

This value is of the same order of magnitude as other reported promising 2D anodes, such as graphene (2.00 × 10−11 m2/s for Li) [94], and C2N (4.74 × 10−11 m2/s for Li). However, it is lower than that observed in experimental graphite (4.40 × 10−10 m2/s for Li) [95], Blu-Pn (7.2 × 10−9 m2/s for Na) [42], Black-Pn (7.38 × 10−10 m2/s for Na) [90], BN/VS2 (1.15 × 10−10 m2/s for Li), and G/WS2 (5.54 × 10−10 m2/s for Li) heterostructures [92,93]. As the D value of Na ions on the designed CP2 falls within the accepted range based on the literature, this suggests a favorable potential for improving the ionic conductivity and thus the rate performance of NIBs using CP2 as a negative electrode."

                        "Theoretical specific capacity and open-circuit voltage (OCV) are two essential indicators of a rechargeable battery's performance. Based on these suggested characteristics for ion battery materials, these two indices can generally be calculated to observe changes as the metal is introduced into the system. In order to determine the maximum concentration of Na that can be accommodated by the CP2 nanosheet, the OCV must be positive, which requires negative average binding energy, and the structure of the final loading process should be maintained to avoid structural damage and related problems. The reaction that occurs in the CP2 nanosheet anode during the charging process can be expressed as [71,72]:(5)",
                        "CP 2 + uNa + + ue _ → Na u CP 2",
                        "Based on this reaction the OCV can be estimated using the expression as follows [42].(6)",

                        "E Na u CP 2 and",
                        "E CP 2 are the total energies of CP2 with and without Na concentration u. ENa is the total energy of metal Na, and e is the elementary charge. Based on the adsorption energy listed in Table 1, dilute Na was found to be stable at the HP1 site. Then, as the coverage increases on both sides of CP2, at least six possible adsorption configurations are tested for each concentration u, and the one with the minimum ground state energy is selected for further calculation. The corresponding OCV is plotted and presented in Fig. 11(a). It is evident from the figure that the OCV decreases from 2.22 V (u = 0.17) to 0.12 V (u = 1.67) as the Na concentration coverage increases. The structure of CP2 after storing a concentration of 1.67 Na atoms is presented in Fig. 11(b, c). It is important to note that for any value of u greater than 1.67, the structure becomes unstable, as the increased ionized Na atoms generate more electron shielding, rendering the system more repulsive. Therefore, the loading process should be stopped to avoid any issues that can negatively impact the battery's performance. The overall calculated OCV is 0.66 V, which falls within the desired voltage range for anode materials [82,[96], [97], [98], [99]].",

                        "M CP 2 is the molar mass of CP2, u = 1.67 is the maximum concentration of Na in CP2 and F is the Faraday constant (26.801 Ah/mol). Based on Eq. (7), CP2 can provide a theoretical specific capacity of 604.1 mAh/g, which is approximately double that of commercial graphite. Our estimated storage capacity is compared with other existing materials as presented in Fig. 12, showing a higher value than TiS2 (479 mAh/g) [100], SiS (446mAh/g) [101], ReS2 (428 mAh/g) [89], Ge (399 mAh/g),Ti3C2 (352mAh/g) [87],1-TMoS2 (335 mAh/g) [102], Ti2CSi2 (335 mAh/g), V2CSi2 (315 mAh/g) [87] and GeS (256 mAh/g) [88]. As a result, the designed CP2 nanosheet can serve as a promising material for NIBs as an anode.",
                        "Before closing the discussion, we examined the thermal stability of the CP2Na1.67 nanosheet by AIMD simulations. The simulation was carried out at 400 K on a time-scale of 20 ps. We present the results in Fig. 13, the fluctuations in the total energy of the system between −810 eV and −813 eV are stable throughout the simulation and very stabilized. In the meantime, the snapshots taken at the end of the MD simulation of the CP2Na1.67 nanosheet (Fig. 13(b, c)), revealed that there is a complete absence of structural deformation during adsorption. This observation strongly suggests that the CP2 nanosheet demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, even at elevated temperatures such as 400 K. This result suggests that CP2Na1.67 is thermally stable at 400 K."

                "In summary, this study has investigated the electrochemical properties of CP2 nanosheet through chemical modification utilizing a carbon source, with the aim of utilizing them as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries. In this study, we relied on first-principles DFT simulations with non-local van der Waals correction. The obtained results demonstrate the stable adsorption of Na atoms on the surface of the CP2 nanosheet, with an adsorption energy of around −2.22 eV. Additionally, during the sodiation process, the material demonstrates good electronic conductivity. Moreover, it is determined that the storage can reach a high theoretical specific capacity of about 604.1 mAh/g, greater relative to many other 2D materials identified to date. The average open circuit voltage is 0.66 V. Furthermore, the remarkable characteristics exhibited by the CP2 nanosheet offer potential applications in various fields such as optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, nanomechanics, photodetectors, and more. Consequently, CP2 holds significant promise as a suitable choice for utilization as an anode in NIBs."
