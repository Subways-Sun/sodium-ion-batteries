                "Pore structure engineering has been acknowledged as suitable approach to creating active sites and enhancing ion transport capabilities of hard carbon anodes. However, conventional porous carbon materials exhibit high BET and surface defects. Additionally, the sodium storage mechanism predominantly occurs in the slope region. This contradicts practical application requirements because the capacity of the plateau region is crucial for determining the actual capacity of batteries. In our work, we prepared a novel “core-shell” carbon framework (CNA1200). Introducing closed pores and carboxyl groups into coal-based carbon materials to enhance its sodium storage performance. The closed pore structure dominates in the “core” structure, which is attributed to the timely removal of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to prevent further formation of active carbon structure. The presence of closed pores is beneficial for increasing sodium ion storage in the low-voltage plateau region. And the “shell” structure originates from coal tar pitch, it not only uniformly connects hard carbon particles together to improve cycling stability, but is also rich in carboxyl groups to enhance the reversible sodium storage performance in slope region. CNA1200 has excellent electrochemical performance, it exhibits a specific capacity of 335.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1 with ICE = 51.53 %. In addition, CNA1200 has outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 91.8 % even when cycling over 200 times. When CNA1200 is used as anode paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, it demonstrates a capacity of 109.54 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and capacity retention of 94.64 % at 0.5 C. This work provides valuable methods for regulating the structure of sodium-ion battery (SIBs) anode and enhances the potential for commercialization."

                "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) face challenges in meeting the growing energy demand due to their low abundance and uneven distribution []. Among various alternative secondary battery technologies, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) stand out because of their abundant resources and low cost [, , , , ]. However, the larger radius of Na+ leads to slower ion transport kinetics, resulting in poor sodium storage performance of graphite which is widely used as anode material for LIBs []. Therefore, the key to achieving commercialization of SIBs lies in finding suitable anode materials. Carbon materials have emerged as one of the most promising anodes for SIBs due to their wide variety and low cost [ , , , , , ]. Among them, hard carbon stands out with obvious advantages. It has the capability to surpass the thermodynamic bound, reaching a capacity of 300 mAh g−1 and operating at a low voltage of 0.3 V [ , ]. To accelerate the development of SIBs, selecting appropriate hard carbon precursors and modification methods is crucial for the development of hard carbon.",
                "Recently, coal products have attracted great interest such as lignite [], bituminous coal [], anthracite [], and coal tar pitch [ ]. In 2016, Li et al. [] conducted a pioneering study that demonstrated the feasibility of using high coalification anthracite-based carbon materials in SIBs, it has a reversible capacity of 222 mAh g−1. However, the low interlayer spacing resulting in its specific capacity was far from ideal for commercialization. Constructing porous structures can effectively enhance ion transfer kinetics and increase active sites [,]. However, highly open porous structure has more surface defects and higher BET, which mainly manifests as the adsorption of sodium storage in the slope region. This is not conducive to improving the actual capacity of battery, because the actual specific capacity of hard carbon is mainly determined by the plateau region [, ]. Therefore, introducing closed pores instead of open pores has become an efficient strategy to balance the capacity and electrochemical stability of coal-derived carbon.",
                "Long-flame coal (CY) is a subclass of bituminous coal that is commonly used as power fuel due to its low degree of coal metamorphism and price (400 $ ton−1), which will cause significant pollution and waste. Previous research reports have confirmed the potential of low-rank coals for energy storage. In 2020, Abou-Rjeily et al. [] obtained a low-rank coal-derived carbon material by simple high-temperature carbonization, but it exhibited poor electrochemical performance and only had a storage capacity of 254 mAh g−1. In 2020, Zou et al. [ ] obtained a lignite-derive carbon material with a storage capacity of 256 mAh g−1. Therefore, rationally regulating the microstructure of CY-derived carbon materials also can enable it to be applied in the energy storage applications. Compared with other coal-based derived carbon materials, CY stands out due to its unique porous structure, which exhibits diverse pore structure composition at different temperatures []. This provides prerequisites for engineering the microstructure of CY-derived carbon.",
                "In our work, a novel coal-based derived carbon material (CNA1200) was prepared. Closed pores and carboxyl groups (-COOR) were co-introduced into CNA1200 by NaOH-controlled etching-thermal annealing and surface coating. CNA1200 has a rich “core” of closed nanopores and a dense carbon “shell” of -COOR. Compared with previous studies, we chose NaOH as pore-forming agent and removed it before thermal annealing. This strategy not only improved the electrochemical activity of CY, but also avoided it becoming an active carbon structure, ultimately improving its sodium storage performance in plateau region. At the same time, the abundance of -COOR on the coating layer can increase the number of active sites in slope region and further improve rate performance and cycling stability. Under the synergistic effect of NaOH-controlled etching-thermal annealing and surface coating, the specific capacity of CNA1200 is increased to 335.2 mAh g−1. It also has excellent rate performance and cycling stability (with a capacity retention of 91.8 %). This novel modification strategy increases plateau region performance without sacrificing slope region capacity, demonstrating a new way to develop advanced hard carbon materials for SIBs."

                        "Fig. 1 illustrates the synthetic process of CY-derived carbon anode materials. During the co-heating process of coal and NaOH, the activated carbon atoms will react with NaOH and carbon skeleton will be etched to form an open pore structure (Table S2). In order to avoid the formation of traditional active carbon materials, NaOH should be removed promptly after the reaction is completed. And open pores generated by NaOH activation will be converted into closed pores during the slow heating process, thus achieving a new carbon skeleton (CN1200) with closed pores as main pore structure. In order to improve rate performance and not sacrifice the capacity of the slope region, we conducted ACM coating. ACM was an amphiphilic carbonaceous material and had many -COOH functional groups. And the hydrophobic region of ACM was nonpolar, leading to intermolecular attraction with CN1200. Therefore, it can be evenly coated on the surface of CN1200 and obtain CNA1200 rich in -COOH functional groups and closed pore structure.",
                        "The surface morphology of hard carbon was observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 2(a, b), CY1200 exhibited lumpy particles with a size of 500–650 nm (Fig. S2(a–c)). Its surface was rough with some cracks. CN1200 will shrink due to the collapse of pores and cracks during the annealing process (Fig. 2(c, d)). After surface coating, a dense carbon layer evenly covered the surface of CN1200 (Fig. 2(e)). It can greatly reduce the contact area between electrodes/electrolytes, thereby forming thinner solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film (Fig. S3(a, b)). The elemental mapping supported the successful coating of ACM, and the N elements that originated from ACM were uniformly distributed on the CNA1200.",
                        "To characterize the state of carbon microcrystals, HRTEM and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were conducted (Fig. 2(f–h)). CY1200 showed disordered structure with defects and turbine-like nanostructures. After NaOH-controlled etching-thermal annealing, CN1200 exhibited more nanopore structures. According to the sodium storage mechanism, nanopores were beneficial for providing more active sites []. However, due to the limitations of TEM testing, it was not possible to determine whether these nanopores were closed or open. CNA1200 had more orderly parallel lattice stripes compared to CY1200 and CN1200. The reduction of surface disorder and the minimization of irreversible reactions can be attributed to the presence of more ordered carbon “shell” derived from pyrolyzed ACM []. The thermogravimetry (TGA) test also verified the orderliness of ACM (Fig. S4). Compared to CY, ACM has a higher thermal decomposition temperature at a mass loss of 4 %. This can be attributed to the more amorphous nature of CY, resulting in higher reaction activity under high-temperature conditions. Generally speaking, carbon with lower crystallinity and more defects are more prone to react at lower temperatures than those with higher crystallinity. And SAED results showed that the diffraction rings become increasingly sharp and clear from CY1200, CN1200 to CNA1200, indicating that carbon structure has evolved from disordered to ordered. This result was consistent with SEM and HRTEM. Through employed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) characterization, it was observed that CNA1200 exhibited a greater interlayer spacing of 0.411 nm compared to CY1200 (0.367 nm) and CN1200 (0.385 nm). This is due to the fact that ACM has been treated with strong acids (sulfuric and nitric acids) and strong bases (sodium hydroxide), resulting in a higher N and S content. The presence of these heteroatoms facilitates the formation of C–N and C–S bonds with the carbon skeleton during pyrolytic coating with CN1200. Due to the destroyed conjugated π bonds and distorted 2D layers, thereby weakening the van der Waals forces between the carbon layers, rendering it susceptible to tensile strain and expanding the interlayer spacing [].",
                        "XRD and Raman tests were employed to investigate the crystallization characteristics of hard carbon. The XRD test of CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 revealed two prominent peaks around 24° (002 crystal planes) and 44° (101 crystal planes) (Fig. 3(a)). It represented the characteristic peak of typical amorphous carbon structure []. In comparison to graphitic carbon material (2θ = 26.5°), the (002) diffraction peak of CNA1200 shifted to lower angles and demonstrated a larger interlayer spacing. For carbon anode materials, the larger interlayer spacing can provide greater storage space and faster ion transport channels []. Fig. 3(b) displayed the results of Raman testing, revealing two distinct peaks at 1345 cm−1 (D-band) and 1590 cm−1 (G-band) [ ]. The ID/IG of CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 were 0.89, 1.03, and 0.95, suggesting that the graphitization degree of coal-derived hard carbon decreases first and then increases. It also further confirms a tendency towards ordered carbon structure. The results of HRTEM, XRD, and Raman tests together demonstrated the validity of NaOH-controlled etching-thermal annealing and ACM coating in regulating the carbon structure.",
                        "To investigate the interaction between NaOH and ACM with CY, XPS testing was performed on CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 (Fig. 3(c)). Due to its low degree of coalification, CY1200 had an oxygen content of 14.5 %. After coating, the ACM will interact with CY and result in a loss of oxygen content to 11.1 %. However, due to the high oxygen content of ACM1200 (25.9 %), the change in oxygen content of CNA1200 was relatively small (Fig. S5(d–f)). These oxygen-containing functional groups endowed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with strong activity and can serve as reaction sites to induce uniform coating of ACM. As shown in Fig. 3(d–f), O 1s peak can be resolved into three components, corresponding to C=O (531 eV), C–OH and C–O–C (532 eV), -COOR (533 eV). Among them, the proportion of –COOR in CN1200 and CNA1200 had significantly increased. It can further participate in the redox reaction and chemical process of Na+, thus contributing to the sodium storage capacity in the slope region []. The C 1s of CY1200 can be fitted as C–C (284.6 eV), C–OR (285.2 eV), C–OH (286.5 eV), and -COOR (288.7 eV). The C 1s of CN1200 and CNA1200 can be fitted to three peaks representing different chemical environments. These peaks were assigned to C–C (284.6 eV), C–OR (285.2 eV), and -COOR bonds (288.7 eV) (Fig. S5(a–c)). CNA1200 had the highest –COOR content of 14 % compared to CY1200 (2.68 %). The presence of –COOH functional groups not only enhanced the wettability of the electrode surface, but also provided more active sites for sodium ion storage (Fig. S6(a–c)). It provides a structural basis for achieving high specific capacity hard carbon anodes [].",
                        "Besides ensuring appropriate interlayer spacing, pore structure also plays a crucial part in facilitating the diffusion of Na+ [ ]. The pore structure of hard carbon was investigated by N2 adsorption/desorption tests. CY1200 had a specific surface area (SSA) of 8 m2 g−1. Due to the collapse of the pore structure after thermal annealing, CN1200 showed a decreased SSA of 2.49 m2 g−1. In order to understand the abnormal decrease in SSA after NaOH controlled etching-thermal annealing process, the SSA of CY precursor annealed at lower temperature of 700 °C was examined, which showed a much higher value of 320.34 m2 g−1 (Fig. S7(a–c)). It was presumed that the low SSA of CN1200 was due to the closure of open pores under high-temperature conditions and the N2 adsorption/desorption test can only detect the presence of open pores. The existence of closed pores had a series of advantages, mainly including increased plateau region capacity and thinner SEI. With ACM coating, the SSA of CNA1200 slightly increased to 10.75 m2 g−1 (Fig. 4(a)). In addition, CNA1200 and ACM1200 had similar N2 adsorption/desorption curves and pore size distribution curves (Fig. S8(a, b)), which also indicated that the surface of CNA1200 was uniformly covered by ACM. All carbon materials exhibited a similar trend of wide pore size distribution, indicating the presence of micropores, mesopores, and macropores (Fig. 4(b)). The abundance of micropores in CN1200 and CNA1200 could potentially be attributed to the incomplete formation of closed pores, resulting in an average pore size ranging from 5 to 10 nm.",
                        "To certify the presumption of closed pores creation and understand the total porosity of material, the carbon material was further investigated by SAXS [, , ]. All SAXS curves exhibited initial dip and sharp peaks in the range of 0.1–1 Å−1 (Fig. 4(c)), indicating the existence of nanopores with random size and shape [ ]. CN1200 owned a more pronounced peak near 0.1 Å−1, indicating a larger radius of the closed nanopore. Calculated by Eq. (1) (A value and B value are associated with the overall surface area of large pores and small pores, Q represents the scattering vector, and D denotes the constant background term.

Then majority of pores were restructured through thermal annealing to form closed pores []. Closed pore structures were crucial microstructure for sodium storage, which helped to achieve high plateau region capacity of hard carbon anode.",
                        "True density can also effectively characterize the closed pore structure. Throughout the entire testing process, helium gas (He) can enter almost all open pore structures. Therefore, the true density test can serve as a supplement to SAXS data. Using ideal graphite carbon material as reference value, its true density was 2.26 g cm-3. With the progress of NaOH-controlled etching-thermal annealing, the true density decreased from 1.7169 (CY1200) to 1.564 g cm-3 (CN1200), indicating an increase in the number of closed pores. The results were consistent with SAXS tests. It demonstrated the successful preparation of closed pore structures."

                        "Fig. 5(a–c) presents the results of galvanostatic charge–discharge curves to assess Na+ storage capability. The curves displayed two sections: slope region (over 0.1 V) and plateau region (below 0.1 V). The slope and plateau region depend on the adsorption of Na+ on functional groups and intercalation/de-intercalation in nanopores, respectively []. Since the vast majority of carbon microcrystals existed in the form of graphite-like phases (it has smaller interlayer spacing), CY1200 demonstrated a capacity of 198.34 mAh g−1 with Initial Coulombic Efficiency (ICE) = 43.54 % (Fig. 5(a)). For CN1200, the NaOH-controlled etching-thermal annealing process produced more closed pore structures and expanded interlayer spacing, which can provide more Na+storage locations. Consequently, CN1200 had a higher Na storage capacity (279.35 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1) compared with CY1200 (Fig. 5(b)). And the low-voltage plateau region exhibited a high capacity of 161.35 mAh g−1, which accounts for the majority of the total capacity. It was notably higher than that noted for CY1200 (Fig. S9). After ACM coating, the surface disorder was further reduced, which can effectively limit the irreversible decomposition of electrolytes. Benefiting from this “core-shell” structure, CNA1200 owned Na storage capacity of 335.21 mAh g−1 with ICE = 51.53 % (Fig. 5(c)). CNA1200 demonstrated competitive reversible capacity compared with previously reported carbon materials [ , , , ]. To further improve the ICE of CNA1200, a pre-electrical treatment method was employed [ ]. This method had successfully increased the ICE from 51.53 % to 83.54 % (Fig. S10(a–c)). In addition, optimizing the electrolyte ratio, constructing more stable SEI membranes and pre-sodium strategies can also effectively improve ICE [ , , , ].",
                        "To further evaluate the reliability and performance stability of electrodes, rate performance and cycling performance tests were conducted. When the current density increased from 20 to 500 mA g−1, the capacity of CN1200 showed a significant decay, dropping from 279.35 to 36.55 mAh g−1. This indicated that the defects in the graphene layer were more conducive to the rapid diffusion of Na+ than closed pores under high current density, which was consistent with previous reports []. Compared with CY1200 and CN1200, CNA1200 exhibited capacities of 335.21, 119.49 and 68.36 mAh g−1 at 20, 200 and 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 5(d)). It indicated that ACM coating can significantly improve rate performance. This was mainly attributed to the effective reduction of disorder on the CN1200 surface by ACM, thereby maximizing the diffusion ability of Na+. The cycling stability of CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 is shown in Fig. 5(e). CY1200 exhibited a low-capacity retention (75.3 %). After 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1, its capacity decreased from 168.7 to 127.1 mAh g−1. The capacity retention of CN1200 (78.7 %) was slightly higher than that of CY1200. After 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1, the capacity decayed to 111.15 mAh g−1. In contrast, CNA1200 exhibited exceptional cycling performance, it maintained a reversible capacity of 173.44 mAh g−1 when cycling 200 times. Moreover, it also showed remarkable capacity retention (91.8 %), which was significantly higher than CY1200 and CN1200. This corresponds to carbon microstructures with fewer defects and higher degree of order, which can reduce the rapid decay of capacity during long cycling processes. The improvement of rate and cycling performance indicated the effectiveness of surface coating in improving kinetics.",
                        "Indeed, CNA1200 exhibited outstanding sodium storage capacity and cycling stability, which can be profit from the following aspects: (1) Large interlayer spacing facilitated the intercalation/deintercalation of Na+; (2) Closed pores become the main active site in electrochemical sodium storage process, which further improved the capacity in plateau region; (3) By forming a dense carbon layer, the interaction between the electrodes and electrolyte was significantly minimized. It helped reduce the possibility of side reactions, thereby improving the reversibility. And the presence of -COOH functional groups was beneficial for improving the storage and storage performance of slope areas. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of these advantages, CNA1200 exhibited better sodium storage performance than previously reported carbon anodes (Fig. 5(f)) [ , , , , , , , , , ].",
                        "The EIS analysis was performed to explore the overall charge transfer characteristics of coal-based hard carbon (Fig. S11). And the corresponding equivalent circuit was also depicted. The semicircle and slope line in the Nyquist plots were related to the dynamic characteristics of charge transfer resistance and Na+ diffusion kinetics [, , ]. CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 had charge transfer resistance of 500.3, 196, and 49.15 Ω, indicating the enhanced charge-transfer ability of CNA1200. This was attributed to the ACM coating, which effectively reduced the charge transfer resistance and enhanced the dynamic performance of CNA120. In addition, it's worth noting that CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 exhibited a pronounced steep slope in low-frequency area, which suggested the presence of rapid ion diffusion. Therefore, the surface coating can improve the chemical environment and fully stimulate the diffusion ability of Na+, thus improving the electrochemical performance in general.",
                        "In order to investigate the Na+ storage behavior of CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200, CV tests were conducted. In the first cycle of all electrodes, two reduction peaks were observed at 0.5 and 0.01 V (Fig. 6(a, d, g)). The reduction peak of 0.5 V disappeared during the second and third cycle, corresponding to the appearance of SEI. And the oxidation–reduction peak (0.01 V) corresponded to the intercalation and deintercalation process of Na+, indicating that the potential sodium storage mechanisms of CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 depended on intercalation and deintercalation [ ]. All of them exhibited highly overlapped CV curves, indicating that the coal-based carbon materials had good cycling stability. Compared with CY1200, CNA1200 had a stronger redox peak in CV curve, reflecting a more significant Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process. To further investigate the Na storage mechanism of CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200, CV tests were conducted at 0.2 to 1 mV s−1. In order to certify the quantitative contribution of capacitance and diffusion control, the CV curve was further calculated by the following formula:(2)",
                        "i( V ) = k 1 v+k 2 v 1 / 2where i (V) is the current at a specific voltage, ν represents the scanning rate, and k1ν and k2ν1/2 refer to surface control capacity and diffusion control capacity, respectively []. By calculation, it had been determined that the capacitance contribution of CY1200, CN1200, and CNA1200 was directly proportional to the scanning rate. This result suggested that the kinetics of Na+ adsorption was faster than the kinetics of insertion. The capacitance for sodium storage in CNA1200 ranges from 50 % to 82 % at a scan rate of 0.2 to 1.0 mV s−1 (Figs. 6(h, i) and S12(i–l)). There was a similar trend in CY1200 and CN1200 (Figs. 6(b, c, e, f) and S12(a–h)). The enhanced capacitive storage of CNA1200 can accelerate the diffusion of Na+ and prevent structural damage to the host material during high-rate charging and discharging, resulting in good rate performance.",
                        "To further investigate the sodium storage mechanism of CNA1200, the structure of carbon materials was tested at discharge to 0.2 and 0.001 V, charge to 0.2 and 2.5 V (Fig. 7(a)). Firstly, the position of (002) peak in ex-situ XRD under different voltage conditions was compared (Fig. 7(b)). As the discharge process progressed, the (002) peak shifted to the left, indicating the successful intercalation of Na+ and resulting in an increased carbon interlayer spacing. During the subsequent charging process, the (002) peak returned to its original position. This indicates that CNA1200 exhibited an “intercalation-adsorption” mechanism. The carbon interlayer spacing at full discharge and full charge was determined through ex-situ TEM to be 0.4415 and 0.426 nm, respectively (Fig. 7(c–e)). Considering the comprehensive results of ex-situ XRD and TEM tests, it can be concluded that the sodium storage mode of CNA1200 primarily involves intercalation and adsorption.",
                        "Considering the notable storage capacity, outstanding rate performance and cycling stability observed in coin cells, it was crucial to undertake further investigations into the electrochemical behavior of CNA1200 in full cells. Fig. 8(a) illustrates the assembly of full cell with an NVP cathode and CNA1200 anode. Through charge/discharge tests, it was found that the full cell had a voltage of 2.7–3.3 V, which was an important characteristic for achieving commercialization. The charge/discharge specific capacity at 0.1 C (1 C = 200 mA g−1) was 190.64/109.54 mAh g−1 with ICE = 57.46 % (Fig. 8(b)). At 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, the capacities can reach 109.58, 107.72, 105.42, 102.07, and 95.07 mAh g−1, respectively (Fig. 8(c)). What's more, after cycled at 0.5 C for 200 times, NVP//CNA1200 maintained an impressive capacity retention of 94.64 % (Fig. 8(d)). It showed great potential for practical application and provided a new option for realizing low-cost and long-life SIBs."

                "In this work, a novel carbon skeleton (CNA1200) with a “core-shell” structure was prepared by NaOH-controlled etching-thermal annealing and surface coating, introducing closed pores and -COOH into coal-based hard carbon materials. The open pores produced by NaOH activation were partially closed under high-temperature conditions. It was confirmed by N2 adsorption/desorption, SAXS, and true density test. These closed pores were the main active sites in the electrochemical sodium storage process, which can further improve the proportion of capacity in the plateau region. After ACM surface coating, a dense carbon layer was covered in CNA1200. It can reduce the electrode-electrolyte contact and enhance the electrical conductivity of carbon particles; -COOH groups can provide additional active sites, which are beneficial for reversible sodium adsorption in slope regions. The synergistic effect between the construction of closed pore structure and -COOH endowed CNA1200 with excellent sodium storage performance. CNA1200 had the highest capacity of 335.21 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1 with ICE = 51.53 %. Moreover, it also demonstrated impressive capacity retention (91.8 %) even after undergoing 200 cycles. It implied that CNA1200 had excellent structural resistance and did not undergo structural collapse during long-term cycling. When evaluated in the full cell of NVP//CNA1200, it demonstrated a remarkable capacity of 109.54 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, while maintaining a voltage range of 2.7–3.3 V. This work not only designs a new practical coal-based hard carbon material, but also offers valuable insights for structural regulation of other hard carbon in the future."
