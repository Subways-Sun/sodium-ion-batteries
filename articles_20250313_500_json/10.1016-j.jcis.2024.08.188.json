                "Heterostructure design and integration with conductive materials play a crucial role in enhancing the conversion kinetics of electrode materials for metal-ion batteries. However, integrating nanocrystal heterojunctions into a conductive layer to form a superstructure is a significant challenge, mainly due to the difficulty in maintaining the structural integrity. Here we report a unique glucose-induced heterogeneous nucleation method that enables the independent manipulation of nucleation and growth of Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanocrystals within 2D layers. Our investigations reveal that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO superstructure is formed by a topological transformation induced by subsequent heat treatment of the initial hydrothermally prepared rGO-MoO2-rGO precursor. This novel structure embeds Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanocrystals within a 2D graphene matrix, providing enhanced mechanical stability, accelerated Na+ transport, and improved electron conduction. Ex situ XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses reveal that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO superstructure significantly enhances the stability and reversibility of anodes. Leveraging these unique characteristics, the newly developed superstructural anode exhibits remarkable long-term cycling stability and outstanding rate performance. As a result, superstructure anodes demonstrate superior electrochemical capabilities, delivering a specific capacity of 106 mAh/g after enduring 5000 cycles at 1 A/g. Our study underscores the critical importance of superstructure design in propelling the advancement of battery materials."

                "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as strong contenders for the next generation of energy storage devices, with the potential to rival or even replace current lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources [1]. However, there are differences in the electrochemical properties between Na+ and Li+, such as the electrochemical standard potential of Na+/Na (−2.71 V) higher than that of Li+/Li (−3.04 V), and the larger atomic mass and ionic radius of Na+, which lead to lower energy density and poorer cycle stability of SIBs [2]. Accordingly, the key to technological breakthroughs in SIBs lies in the development of new electrode materials, especially anode materials.",
                "In this context, transition metal carbides (TMCs) can be considered an intriguing group of materials due to their ability to store charge through both non-Faradaically and Faradaically, their highly conductive structures characterized by carbon atoms interspersed within the voids of the transition metal framework, as well as their beneficial properties, including chemical and mechanical stability and a wealth of catalytic active sites [3], [4]. These advantages of TMCs lead to rapid charge response, thereby reinforcing their potential as high-performance electrode materials [5], [6], [7]. In the pursuit of enhancing the kinetic performance of electrodes, contemporary research has implemented several pivotal strategies (Scheme. 1a). For example, the conversion of active materials into nanocrystals has markedly improved their reactivity [8], [9]. To address the inherent poor conductivity of nanocrystals, researchers have typically employed a compounding approach, integrating active materials with conductive ones to fabricate composites possessing superior electrical conductivity [10], [11], [12], [13]. Meticulous control over the morphologies of electrode materials has led to enhanced structural characteristics [14], [15]. Utilizing the physical principles of heterojunction structures, uniquely advantageous heterostructured active materials have been developed [16], [17]. These strategies are of great significance in developing high-performance anode materials.",
                "The design and synthesis of Mo2C materials in recent years has thoroughly embraced these strategies. Across studies focusing on Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) [18], [19], [20], the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) [21], [22], [23], and Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries [24], [25], [26], these design principles have demonstrated broad applicability and efficacy. However, a significant challenge remains: the active regions of the electrode may induce side reactions when in direct contact with the electrolyte during charge and discharge processes [27], [28], [29]. Furthermore, active materials risk detachment from the current collector due to stress alterations throughout the charge and discharge cycles, and Molybdenum-based anode materials are mainly faced with the issues of volume expansion and pulverization during charge and discharge processes [30], [31], [7], [32], [33]. Additionally, the interface between active and conductive substances lacks atomic-level contact, implying that, in theory, electrode designs have not yet achieved maximal utilization efficiency [34], [35]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for future research to focus on further optimizing the structural design of electrode materials, thereby facilitating more efficient energy conversion and storage.",
                "It is well-known that the 2D superlattice structures exhibit significant application advantages in the field of energy storage due to their unique physical and chemical properties, such as high surface area and active sites, short ion diffusion paths, and atomic-level heterointerfaces. Currently, there is limited progress in the study of potential synergistic effects at the Mo2C heterostructure anode interface and superlattice surface.",
                "In this work, we introduce a novel confined Mo2C/MoC nanocrystal heterojunction-graphene superstructure anode (Scheme. 1b). This unique structure encapsulates the Mo2C/MoC nanocrystal heterojunction between graphene layers, enhancing the mechanical strength of the electrode and promoting rapid Na+ transfer, supplemented by enhanced electronic conductivity. This anode design fully utilizes the advantages of heterostructures and 2D conductive materials to enhance transformation kinetics. The experimental results show that this electrode exhibits impressive specific capacity and cycle stability.",
                "This study not only provides a new method for synthesizing Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanocrystal superstructures, but also opens up new avenues for designing advanced anode materials for SIBs with significantly enhanced energy storage capacity."

                "Hydrothermal synthesis is widely used to prepare a variety of high-performance electrode materials due to its simple experimental equipment and clear growth mechanisms. With the increasing demand for high-performance sodium-ion battery anodes, there is a growing focus on fabricating various electrode composite materials on conductive substrates, such as TiO2/graphene [38] and MoS2/graphene [39]. According to crystal growth theory, to achieve uniform growth of oxides or carbides particles on conductive substrates, it is essential to effectively suppress random nucleation on the substrate [40], as this phenomenon often increases the size of the formed particles, which is not conducive to designing high-performance electrodes. Therefore, precise control over nucleation and growth during the hydrothermal preparation process is particularly important. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of comparative studies in this area.",
                "As shown in Fig. 1, we have achieved the uniform growth of carbide nanocrystal heterojunctions on rGO nanosheets. In this case, glucose utilizes its abundant OH– on GO sheets to induce the uniform transformation of the molybdenum source precursor ammonium molybdate into MoO2, which is a key step in preparing the superstructural rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO composite nanosheets. This differs from the traditional structures (mixed, wrapped, or anchored models) formed by conventional crystal-oriented growth methods [41], [42]. Pristine graphene is chemically stable, and metal oxides typically grow only at defects, such as oxygen functional groups, forming discontinuous island-like structures to minimize adverse contact between graphene and oxides [43] (Fig. 1a). Through glucose-induced nucleation, we achieved heterogeneous and uniform nucleation of MoO2 on GO sheets, avoiding the spontaneous formation of independent coarse particles. Subsequent annealing processes facilitated the topological transition of MoO2 between graphene layers to Mo2C/MoC, and the GO was converted into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through thermal treatment, ultimately forming superstructural rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO composite nanosheets (Fig. 1b). Understanding and controlling the role of glucose in the construction of superstructures is the key to optimizing electrode structure and performance. This study will continue to pay attention in the later work.",
                "Fig. 2a illustrates the preparation schematic of the superstructural anodes. To investigate the effect of glucose on the formation of the superstructure, we conducted corresponding control experiments. Compared to the samples without glucose, shown in Fig. 2b and c, the superstructural anodes morphologies prepared by our proposed glucose-induced process exhibit significant differences. The samples without glucose appear in an aggregated form, whereas those with added glucose display a distinct sandwich-like layered structure (Fig. 2d–f).",
                "To elucidate the crystal structure of active materials in the superstructure, we conducted XRD tests on two samples, one with glucose addition and one without. The results showed that the XRD diffraction peaks of both samples were almost identical, containing two crystal phases: Mo2C (PDF: 77–0720) and MoC (PDF: 89–4305), as illustrated in Fig. 2g. To further understand the transformation process of Mo2C and MoC, we also performed XRD analysis on these two samples before heat treatment (as shown in Fig. S1a). The results indicated that both samplesbefore heat treatment contained the MoO2 (PDF: 86–0135) crystal phase. Based on these experimental results, we can reasonably infer that the Mo2C and MoC in the samples after heat treatment were derived from MoO2. This transformation undoubtedly benefited from the presence of graphene in the samples and the heat treatment under N2 atmosphere, which together provided a reducing environment, ultimately promoting the reduction of MoO2 to Mo2C and MoC. Furthermore, we conducted SEM observations on the glucose-added sample before heat treatment (Fig. S1b). The results showed that this sample had a very similar microstructure to the superstructure sample after heat treatment, both exhibiting a typical sandwich structure. This finding indicates that a topological transformation occurred during the heat treatment process, namely from rGO-MoO2-rGO to rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO.",
                "To uncover the intricate architecture of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO, we conducted an in-depth TEM examination (Fig. 3a–e). The observations in Fig. 3a and b revealed that minute nanoparticles, approximately 13 nm in diameter, were evenly dispersed across the entire rGO matrix. The SAED depicted in Fig. 3c confirmed the presence of diffraction rings corresponding to both MoC and Mo2C. The HRTEM image presented in Fig. 3d showcased the crystalline lattices of MoC (006) and Mo2C (211), indicating a distinct interface between the two crystal phases, which were tightly integrated. These findings suggest that the Mo2C and MoC phases, as identified in the XRD analysis, coalesce to form a heterojunction structure, as illustrated in Fig. 3d. Furthermore, elemental mapping, as seen in Fig. 3e, demonstrated the even distribution of molybdenum (Mo), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) throughout the entire composite material.",
                "The Raman spectra presented in Fig. 3f for rGO-Mo2C/MoC and rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO reveal two distinct peaks at 814 and 993 cm−1, which correspond to the A1g and Ag vibrational modes characteristic of MoC and Mo2C, respectively. Furthermore, the peaks observed at 1350 and 1580 cm−1 are indicative of the D and G bands, which are typical of the carbon matrix. Notably, the ID/IG ratio for rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO is marginally lower than that for rGO-Mo2C/MoC, with a ratio of 1.10 compared to 1.24, suggesting a higher degree of graphitic order, which is beneficial for enhanced electrical conductivity. Furthermore, it was observed that the Raman peak intensities for MoC and Mo2C in rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO are considerably higher than those in rGO-Mo2C/MoC, signifying an improved crystallinity of the Mo2C/MoC heterojunction within the highly graphitized graphene framework. Additionally, it is observed that the GO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO composites exhibited a considerably higher specific surface area, reaching up to 197 m2 g−1, which significantly surpassed the specific surface area of rGO-Mo2C/MoC, which is merely 24 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution analysis (Fig. 3g and Table S1) corroborates the presence of a pronounced mesoporous structure within the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO composites. The discrepancy in specific surface area between these two composites is closely tied to their structural differences. In comparison to the rGO-Mo2C/MoC composite, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO, which features a distinctive superstructure, exhibits a distinct advantage in terms of its high specific surface area. This advantage is likely linked to the inherent ion-conducting channels associated with the superstructure's architecture [44], [45].",
                "The chemical environment and valence states of the elements Mo, C, and N within the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO were investigated using XPS. The Mo 3d XPS spectrum for rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO displays three main peaks at binding energies of approximately 232.3, 229.6, and 228.9 eV (Fig. 3j) [46], [47], [48]. These peaks can be assigned to Mo4+ 3d3/2, Mo4+ 3d5/2, and Mo2+ 3d5/2, respectively, while the peak at 236 eV corresponding to Mo6+ 3d3/2 is attributed to the unavoidable oxidation of Mo2C during the XPS measurement under ambient air conditions. The high-resolution C 1 s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3h) can be deconvoluted into three distinct peaks, which are associated with non-oxygenated graphitic carbon in sp2 hybridization at 284.8 eV, CN carbon in sp3 hybridization at 285.8 eV, and carbonyl CO carbon at 288.6 eV. It is noteworthy that the C 1 s spectrum particularly highlights the enhanced intensity of sp2 carbon in CC bonds relative to other chemical bonds, this observation suggests that the carbon material in the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anodes following the post-annealing treatment exhibits a notable graphite—like character. This finding is supported by previous studies [49], [50].",
                "The N within the composite originates from N-doped carbon, which is formed through the carbonization of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at elevated temperatures. The N doping is known to enhance the electrical conductivity of the amorphous carbon component [50]. Fig. 3i presents peaks at 401.5, 398.7, and 394.9 eV, which correspond to pyrrolic-N (N-5), graphitic N (N-Q), and Mo 3p3/2, respectively. XPS peak fitting results of rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO and their binding energies and assignments, as shown in Tab S2. These observations further substantiate the presence of N-doped carbon material in the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO composite.",
                "CV measurements were performed on both the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO and rGO-Mo2C/MoC anodes at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s, as shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S2a. For the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode, the initial cathodic scan featured a peak at 0.22 V, which can be attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer through the insertion of excess Na+ [51], [52]. Compared with rGO-Mo2C/MoC anodes, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO exhibited two distinct cathodic peaks at 0.1 V and 0.37 V during the initial cathodic scan, which are indicative of a reversible Na+ insertion and extraction process, indicating a multistep Na+ uptake process.",
                "The GCD curves for the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode at 0.2 A/g exhibited an initial discharge/charge capacity of 778/388 mAh/g, which corresponds to a low initial Coulombic efficiency of 49.9 %, as shown in Fig. 4b. This reduced efficiency is typically due to the formation of a SEI film during the initial cycle, which results in the irreversible consumption and decomposition of the electrolyte [52]. However, by the second cycle, the Coulombic efficiency improved significantly to 88.5 % with a discharge/charge capacity of 322/285 mAh/g. After ten cycles, the capacities stabilized at 263/259 mAh/g, and the Coulombic efficiency further increased to 98.5 %, indicating excellent cyclic stability.",
                "The rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode also demonstrated superior rate performance at various current densities ranging from 0.1 to 10 A/g, delivering specific capacities of 301, 252, 212, 171, 122, 78, and 41 mAh/g, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4c. Notably, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode showed significantly higher specific capacity when compared to the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode (Fig. S2b and c). Fig. 4d and e presents the long-term cycling performance of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode when discharged-charged at 0.2 and 1 A/g, respectively. Compared with Mo2C/MoC-rGO, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode displays a higher reversible capacity than the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anodes (Fig. S3). It can still deliver a discharge capacity of 106 mAh/g after 5000 cycles at 1 A/g, indicating its excellent cycling stability. The significantly enhanced sodium-ion storage performance of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode may be attributed to the synergistic enhancement of electron and sodium-ion transport kinetics, which could benefit from the internal electric field within the heterojunction interface [53], [54], [55].",
                "Furthermore, the Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanoparticles within the interlayers of rGO are effectively stabilized by the rGO matrix, which minimizes the tendency for Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanocrystals to aggregate and ensures structural integrity. Fig. 4f presents the rate capability of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode, demonstrating that it is capable of delivering specific capacities of 301, 252, 212, 171, 122, 78, and 41mAh/g at various current densities ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 A/g. Moreover, upon reducing the current density back to 0.1 A/g, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode sustains its high specific capacity, regaining a reversible capacity of 230 mAh/g, which is indicative of its efficient ion and electron transport properties. In contrast, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode exhibits considerably lower capacities of 246, 190, 140, 77, 46, 32, and 16 mAh/g at the same series of current densities, which are substantially less than those observed for the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode. A comparison of the rate performance of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode with the state-of-the-art results from the literature on Mo-based systems is provided in Fig. 4g and Table S3. The capacity of rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode and high-rate capabilities are notably superior to most anodes reported for SIBs, and the long cycle performance is better (Table S4). This outstanding performance suggests that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode is a promising candidate for use as an anode in SIBs applications.",
                "To gain a deeper insight into the electrochemical behavior, the kinetic mechanisms of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anodes were further explored. Fig. 5a and d illustrate the CV curves for the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO and rGO-Mo2C/MoC anodes, respectively, at a range of scan rates from 0.2 to 1.0 mV/s. The area enclosed by the CV curves corresponds to the charge storage that arises from both faradaic and nonfaradaic processes [56], [57], [58]. This phenomenon can be described by the power-law relationship i = aνb, where ν represents the scan rate, and a and b are empirical parameters. The exponent b in the plot of log i versus log ν is a pivotal factor in discerning the nature of the redox process; a, b value of 1 is indicative of non-diffusion controlled surface redox reactions, whereas a, b value of 0.5 is characteristic of an ideal diffusion-controlled faradaic process [59]. The kinetic analysis reveals that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode demonstrates a synergistic blend of diffusion-controlled battery-like processes and surface-controlled capacitive behavior [48]. For the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode, the cathodic peak b values were found to be 0.8 and the anodic peak b values were 0.9 within the scan rate range of 0.2 to 1.0 mV/s, as illustrated in Fig. 5g. In contrast, under the same scanning conditions, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode showed marginally reduced cathodic peak b values of 0.64 and anodic peak b values of 0.95, as illustrated in Fig. 5i. These specific b values confirm the superior electrochemical performance of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO composite anode. The overall current response (i) at a particular potential (V) can be decomposed into two components: the pseudocapacitive contribution and the intercalation contribution, as delineated by the following equation. Eq. (3) is a reformulation derived from the underlying Eq. (2).(2)",
                "i v = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 2(3)",
                "log 10 i = log 10 a + b log 10 v",
                "In this context, the coefficients k1ν and k2ν1/2 signify the contributions to the current from capacitive and insertion processes, respectively. These factors enable the differentiation between the current responses attributable to each process at a specified potential [60]. As depicted in Fig. 5b and e, the shaded region delineates the voltage profile that is associated with the current response originating from the capacitive effects. This shaded region is then juxtaposed with the overall measured current within a standard CV curve, which is obtained for both the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO and rGO-Mo2C/MoC anodes at a scanning velocity of 0.4 mV s−1.",
                "At a scan rate of 0.4 mV s−1, the partition of diffusional and capacitive contributions to the electrode's current is illustrated in Fig. 5b, with the red segment signifying the portion attributable to capacitive effects, which amounts to 83 %. Through an analogous evaluation, the capacitive contribution for the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode at this scan rate is determined to be 58 %, as illustrated in Fig. 5e. Upon elevating the scan rate from 0.2 to 1 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 5c, the proportion of capacitive contribution progressively ascends from 69 % to 90 %, surpassing that of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode, as observed in Fig. 5f. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the layered configuration of MoC and Mo2C within the electrode architecture can significantly augment the capacitive behavior, facilitate the transfer of electrons and migration of ions, and subsequently, elevate the kinetics of electrochemical reactions [24].",
                "Upon conducting a comparative analysis of the electrochemical tests, has revealed that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anodes exhibit performance behaviors that are not constrained by diffusion limitations, contrasting with the rGO-Mo2C/MoC electrode. When examining ion storage mechanisms, they can typically be categorized into three types: surface storage, bulk storage, and interface storage, as illustrated in Fig. 5j. The term “diffusion control” implies that the ion storage behavior is predominantly restricted by the rate at which ions diffuse through the electrode material [61]. In such a scenario, the rate of Na+ intercalation and extraction is entirely contingent upon their diffusion coefficient within the Mo2C/MoC anodes.",
                "In contrast, “non-diffusion-limited” suggests that the ion storage process is not exclusively dictated by the diffusion process [58], [62]. Instead, it may also be affected by other factors, such as the rate of charge transfer reactions at the electrode surface, the structural integrity of the electrode, and the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Under non-diffusion-limited conditions, the rate at which ions are intercalated and extracted can potentially surpass the rate.",
                "Under non-diffusion-limited conditions, the rate of ionintercalation and extraction mayexceed that observed under diffusion-controlled conditions. Drawing from these analyses, the characteristics of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO electrode pertaining to non-diffusion limited aspects are presented in Fig. 5h. These include mechanisms of storage at the surface and the interface, which contribute to the electrode's overall performance.",
                "Additionally, the GITT was employed to investigate the diffusion kinetics of Na+ within the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO and rGO-Mo2C/MoC anodes, as depicted in Fig. 6a and b. This suggests a faster diffusion rate of Na+ in the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode. Moreover, to assess the electrochemical polarization and the capability of Na+ diffusion, specific points on the discharge plateaus, around 0.5 V, were selected for further analysis, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. The results demonstrated that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode exhibited lower values of IR drop, ΔEt (overpotential), and ΔEs (difference in entropy) when compared to the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode [63]. This lower IR drop signifies that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode has a reduced internal resistance and can facilitate the rapid transport of Na+ during the discharge process. This is attributed to its stabilized sandwich-structured architecture, which enhances the ionic and electronic conductivity of the electrode material. In summary, the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode demonstrated an improved kinetics of Na+ diffusion, evidenced by an increased diffusion coefficient, and an overall enhanced electrochemical performance. The reduced internal resistance and the ability to expedite Na+ shuttling contribute to its superior performance as SIBs anodes.",
                "The use of EIS enable the elucidation of the kinetic processes involved in the electrochemical reactions. The Nyquist plots for both the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO and rGO-Mo2C/MoC anodes are presented in Fig. S4. These plots typically exhibit a semicircle at high frequencies, indicative of charge transfer resistance and ohmic resistance. At low frequencies, a linear segment is observed, associated with Warburg impedance, reflecting ion diffusion within the anode material. The Nyquist plot for the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode exhibited a smaller semicircle in comparison to that of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode, indicating a lower charge transfer resistance. This is consistent with the sandwich structure of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode, which facilitates electron transfer from Na+ and consequently enhances its conductivity [61]. Tab. S5 details the impedance parameters for both anodes. The Rct for the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode, derived from the EIS data, was approximately 64.3 Ω, which is significantly lower than that of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC anode, which had an Rct of 126.8 Ω, as depicted in the inset of Fig. S4. This lower Rct for the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode implies a higher electrochemical reactivity and faster Na+ diffusion, which can be ascribed to its reduced charge transfer resistance and the improved electronic conductivity of the material.",
                "To gain a deeper understanding of the kinetic mechanisms responsible for the superior electrochemical performance observed in the distinctively structured rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anodes, we selected 12 characteristic voltage points throughout the initial charge–discharge cycle, spanning from a discharge voltage of 1.9 V to a charge voltage of 2.8 V, as illustrated in Fig. 7a. Subsequently, ex situ XRD (Fig. 7b) and Raman spectroscopy analyses on the electrode material. It is crucial to note that when exploring the mechanisms behind the performance enhancement, it is insufficient to consider the initial design of the electrode. Although the 2D planar confinement of graphene within the electrode architecture facilitates electron transfer within the Mo2C/MoC active material and limits excessive interaction with the electrolyte, thus minimizing side reactions [64], as shown in Fig. 7d, the precise transformations occurring within the active Mo2C/MoC material during the charge–discharge cycle remain to be fully understood. Consequently, the ex situ XRD and Raman analyses offer a more granular, microscopic insight into the correlation between the electrode's structural attributes and its electrochemical performance.",
                "During the charge–discharge process of anodes, as shown in Fig. 7b, Ex situ XRD analysis revealed that diffraction peaks cycled rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anodes are similar to those of the two phases, Mo2C (PDF: 77–0720) and MoC (PDF: 894305), in original rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anodes sample (Fig. 2g). It is particularly noteworthy that, compared with the diffraction peaks of Mo2C/MoC in Fig. 2g, the Ex situ XRD in Fig. 7b shows that most of the diffraction peaks of anodes have experienced slight shifts. According to previous first-principles and experimental studies, Mo2C and MoC undergo intercalation reactions during the discharge process, transforming into NaxMo2C and NaxMoC, respectively. The results of our experiment are in accordance with those of previous studies in this field. Based on the XRD test results, it is indicated that the Mo2C/MoC nanocrystal heterojunctions intercalated between graphene layers play an important role in Na+ storage, which is crucial for enhancing the specific capacity of the composite anodes.",
                "The Ex situ Raman spectroscopy analysis results during the charge–discharge process of anode are shown in Fig. 7c. It is evident that the typical D and G bands of graphene at different charge–discharge stages of anode have not changed significantly. However, it is interesting to note that there is a clear boundary in the peak within the wave number range of 813–935 cm−1 before and after the end of discharge. Specifically, before discharge, the positions of the three peaks at 829, 869, and 935 cm−1 of the anode are almost the same; after the end of discharge and the start of charge, the positions of the other three peaks of the electrode, namely 813, 840, and 890 cm−1, are also consistent. Further analysis indicates that these six peaks are all attributed to the stretching vibration peaks of Mo-C in Mo2C and MoC [65], [66], [67]. The shift of the peaks reflects the change in the vibration frequency of the Mo-C bond, and the root cause of this change is the alteration of the local environment of Mo-C, indicating that Na+ participate in the formation of Mo-C-Na bonds during the charge–discharge process. Ex situ Raman spectroscopy further confirms from a local perspective that the Mo2C/MoC nanocrystal heterojunctions intercalated between graphene layers are involved in Na+ storage.",
                "The advantages of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO composite material as a SIBs anode are self-evident. The successful preparation of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode with unique structure demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance, mainly due to: (1) The unique sandwich structure of the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode has significant advantages in Na+ storage. The Mo2C/MoC nanocrystals wrapped by double-layer rGO not only serve as efficient Na+ storage, but also act as a 2D conductive network to enhance electron transfer and Na+ transport; in addition, the ultra-small Mo2C/MoC heterostructure nanocrystals further accelerate the kinetic reaction (Fig. 7d). (2) It is particularly emphasized that when Mo2C/MoC generates NaxMo2C and NaxMoC through intercalation reactions, the slight lattice volume expansion is confined between the two layers of rGO, where rGO plays a role in buffering stress. At the same time, during the Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation process, the volume fluctuation also leads to an increase in the interlayer spacing of rGO, thereby providing more storage space for Na+, which helps to achieve excellent electrochemical performance, especially in terms of rate performance. (3) The layered structure of rGO and its significant specific surface area provide a wealth of active sites for Na+ storage, ensuring excellent storage capacity. This unique structure also confers the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode with excellent rate and cycle performance, thereby substantiating its considerable potential in the domain of electrochemical energy storage.",
                "Because of the good electrochemical performance of rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO in the half-cell, and to explore the practical application prospects of the material, sodium ion full-cell is assembled using rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode. The rate performance of the full cell is shown in Fig. 8a, where when the current density is 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 A g−1, the average discharge specific capacity is 191.6, 175.6, 156.3, 141, 122.5, and 86.7 mAh g−1, respectively. It is worth noting that the specific capacity reaches 180.3 mAh g−1 when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1. Fig. 8b depicts a full cell cycling at 1 A g−1. It can be seen that for the initial charge/discharge, the specific capacity of the battery is 160.4/136.5 mAh g−1, which corresponds to an ICE of 85.09 %. The cycle performances was measured at 1.0 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 8c, where the reversible capacity was maintained at 108.4 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO//Na3V2(PO4)3 cell has promising prospects in future SIB applications. Furthermore, a single coin cell made by this Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO anode was enough to lighten a light-emitting diode (LED), as shown in Fig. 8d. The results unequivocally indicate that the sodium ion full-cell, which utilizes rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO as an anode material, possesses significant and widespread practical applications in daily life."

                "In summary, our work has introduced a novel Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanocrystals-graphene superstructure for SIBs anodes, highlighting the significant potential of heterostructure integration with conductive materials to enhance conversion kinetics. The innovative preparation method using glucose-induced nucleation of molybdenum precursors on GO, coupled with hydrothermal and thermal treatments, has resulted in a superstructure that embeds heterojunction nanocrystals within a graphene matrix. Such superstructure maximizes the utilization of active anodes, alleviates volume variation, and permits complete charge–discharge process. The resultant anode material demonstrates impressive specific capacity and long-term cycling stability, overcoming the usual trade-offs between capacity and durability. This superstructural configuration and superior performance provide a strong incentive for the development of high-performance SIBs."
