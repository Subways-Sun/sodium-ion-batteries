                "The development of high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is crucial to meeting the growing demand for low-cost, sustainable energy storage alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, achieving stable cycling performance in SIBs is challenging, particularly with tin (Sn) foil anodes, which suffer from issues like sodium trapping and structural degradation due to significant volume changes during sodiation and desodiation. In this study, we investigate the electrochemo-mechanical behavior of Sn foil anodes, focusing on the mechanisms of sodium trapping and structural evolution that impair battery performance. We demonstrate that sodiation forms a porous coral-like structure in Sn, which, while increasing surface area, also contributes to severe volume expansion, crack formation, and diffusive sodium trapping. We further explore zinc (Zn)-doped Sn foils, revealing that Zn-rich phases create additional fast sodium diffusion channels, significantly reducing sodium retention and enhancing the anode’s structural integrity. Based on these insights, we propose several improvement strategies, including electrolyte additives, optimized electrode architecture, microstructural defect engineering, and artificial solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) coatings, all aimed at enhancing cycle stability and performance. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of Sn-based anodes and offers practical pathways for advancing SIBs technology."

                "The depletion of fossil fuels and worsening environmental issues are driving the search for clean, renewable, and CO2 emission-free energy solutions [1], [2], [3], [4]. However, as global demand for lithium increases, limitations in lithium resources present a challenge, prompting the exploration of alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [5], [6]. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) stand out due to their cost-effectiveness, sustainability, long cycle life, fast-charging capability, and robust low-temperature performance. Sodium is also more widely available and less costly than lithium, with similar redox potentials [7], [8]. Hard carbon is currently the preferred anode material for SIBs due to its capacity to adsorb sodium atoms in nanoscale pores. However, its energy density remains limited, necessitating further improvements in sodium storage capacity and fast-charging performance. Alloy anode materials such as silicon (Si), tin (Sn), and aluminum (Al) are attractive candidates as they offer higher theoretical and volumetric capacities [9], [10], [11]. Given the similar physical and chemical properties of sodium and lithium, these materials for SIBs can benefit from existing LIBs technology, which supports their development and potential applications [12], [13].",
                "Among alloy anode materials, Sn stands out as an ideal candidate for high-capacity foil anodes due to its high theoretical capacity and low cost. Sn is widely used across various fields due to its softness, ductility, low melting point, ease of smelting, non-toxicity, and chemical stability. Its use supports the advancement of environmentally friendly technologies. In battery applications, Sn enhances eco-friendliness while contributing to the development of safe, reliable, and cost-effective energy storage solutions. Additionally, Sn-based anodes offer excellent cycling stability, giving them significant potential to advance SIBs technology [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, the primary limitation of alloy anodes is their insufficient cycle life, which has hindered their commercialization in SIBs. The rapid capacity decay seen in alloy anodes is commonly attributed to substantial volume changes during sodium alloying and dealloying, leading to mechanical degradation of the active material [14], [19], [20], [21]. Current research, therefore, focuses on understanding the failure mechanisms associated with volume changes and interfacial stability during the sodiation process [22], [23], [24], [25]. Strategies to mitigate these issues include enhancing reaction kinetics and structural stability through modulation of scale defects in metal foils, such as phase boundaries (PBs), grain boundaries (GBs), and dislocations (DLs) [26], [27].",
                "Sn anodes undergo significant volume expansion upon sodiation, which can lead to mechanical fragmentation during cycling. Typically, low Coulombic efficiency (CE) is attributed to irreversible sodium consumption and continuous solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) growth due to electrolyte infiltration. Although the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of Sn-based materials is only about 30 %, mechanisms such as SEI formation are less likely in metal foils due to their low specific surface area, suggesting SEI formation is minimal in the pre-cycle period [28].",
                "Diffusion trapping, a potential failure mechanism commonly observed in Si and Sn anode powders [29], [30], has been extensively studied in LIBs, where it arises from the mismatch in lithium diffusion coefficients between lithium-rich and lithium-poor phases during alloying and dealloying [31]. However, this phenomenon remains largely unexplored in dense metal foil anodes, such as Sn foil, which differ significantly from nanoscale or microscale alloy anodes due to their reduced surface area and fewer diffusion channels [32], [33]. Notably, the occurrence and impact of diffusion trapping in Sn foil anodes, particularly its critical influence on the ICE, have not been systematically examined in the literature. This study could uniquely address this gap by providing the first comprehensive insights into diffusion trapping mechanisms in Sn foil anodes and their implications for SIBs performance [34], [35].",
                "In this work, we present a novel investigation into sodium loss mechanisms in Sn foil anodes during pre-cycling, employing electrochemical tests, morphology observations, and phase transition analyses to uncover the critical role of diffusion trapping in contributing to the low ICE [36], [37], [38]. Unlike previous studies focusing on nanoscale or microscale anodes, we provide unique insights into the charge transfer resistance (RCT) and diffusion coefficient changes specific to dense Sn foil anodes during the first cycle, revealing how the sodium-poor phase inhibits the desodiation of the sodium-rich phase during charging. Furthermore, we propose and demonstrate an innovative strategy to mitigate excessive sodium loss by introducing unalloyed zinc (Zn) into Sn alloy foils, which not only enhances the ICE but also significantly reduces sodium loss during pre-cycling. These findings establish a pathway for improving the performance of Sn foil anodes in SIBs."

For cross-sectional electrode samples, a scalpel blade was used to make precise cuts at the center of the electrode; cleanliness of the blade was ensured to avoid sample contamination. Cross-section morphology and elemental distribution of sodiated Sn foils were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The electrodes were carefully cleaned with DMC to remove any electrolyte residues and were stored in an Ar-filled glove box to prevent oxidation.

                        "Electrochemical tests were conducted using CR2025 button cells with sodium metal as the counter and reference electrode. Each cell consisted of a 10-mm-diameter Sn foil electrode as the working electrode, paired with sodium metal. The electrolyte was 1 M NaPF6 in dimethoxyethane (DME), and a glass fiber (GF) separator was used to prevent short-circuiting. Cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box. All electrochemical tests were performed at 25 °C using a Netware battery cycler (BTS-610, Shenzhen, China), with each test repeated more than five times to ensure reproducibility. Cycling performance was evaluated by setting a capacity cut-off for sodiation and a voltage cut-off (1 V vs. Na/Na+). For the initial cycle, the sodiation capacity cut-off was set to a target areal capacity, and for subsequent cycles, it was adjusted to the discharge capacity from the previous cycle. The standard cycling protocol included an initial sodiation capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 at a current of 1 mA cm−2. Different areal capacities were tested at a constant current of 1 mA cm−2 for both sodiation and desodiation. For tests at varying current densities, the sodiation areal capacity was fixed at 1 mAh cm−2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted using a Princeton electrochemical workstation. EIS data included a single semicircle in the high-frequency region and a slope in the low-frequency region. The semicircle diameter in the high-frequency region represented the RCT, while the slope in the low-frequency region corresponded to sodium-ion diffusion capacity within the electrode."

                "The electrochemical cycling of Sn foils reveals a significant morphological evolution, closely tied to the electrochemical reactions involved. During sodiation, the Sn foil undergoes rapid alloying with sodium, transforming from a dense metallic structure to a three-dimensional porous, coral-like morphology. This structural change is driven by substantial volume expansion as sodium ions embed into the Sn lattice to form the Na-Sn alloying phase. GBs act as preferential pathways for sodium ion diffusion, facilitating their transport within the bulk phase and leading to enhanced alloying at these sites (Fig. S2). In the desodiation phase, dealloying initiates at the electrode surface, particularly in regions directly exposed to the electrolyte. Here, the sodium-rich phase (Nax+Sn) gradually transitions to a sodium-poor phase (Nax-Sn). As desodiation progresses, a newly formed Sn layer begins to cover the underlying sodium-rich regions, hindering deeper dealloying reactions. Consequently, a significant number of sodium ions become trapped within the foil electrode, unable to participate effectively in subsequent cycles, leading to a reduced ICE (Fig. 1a). After ten cycles, cracks appear on the foil electrode surface due to the repeated volume changes associated with sodiation and desodiation. These cracks allow electrolyte infiltration, promoting continued SEI growth. While this growth shortens the path length for sodium ion dislodgement, it also compromises the structural stability of the electrode (Fig. 1b). With prolonged cycling, the electrode experiences further degradation, losing structural integrity and eventually splitting into multiple regions (Fig. S3) [14].",
                "The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) analysis for the first cycle showed significant voltage polarization and an ICE of only 29.28 %, indicating considerable sodium trapped within the Sn foil (Fig. 2a). With continued cycling, the CE gradually increased, reaching 95.77 % by the tenth cycle. During these 10 cycles in a half-cell, the discharge capacity was held constant at a specific areal capacity, while the charge capacity varied due to differences in sodium ion transport capacities across the materials. The sodium loss per cycle was calculated based on CE values, with cumulative sodium loss derived by summing these losses across the 10 cycles. For an example with an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, the sodium loss in the first cycle measured 0.68 mAh cm−2. With each subsequent cycle, the sodium loss decreased, yet the cumulative loss reached a substantial 2.61 mAh cm−2 by the tenth cycle (Fig. 2b). After five cycles, XRD analysis identified peaks for NaSn and Na9Sn4 phases, which persisted through ten cycles, indicating that the low CE observed in early cycles arose not only from SEI formation but also from irreversible sodium alloying (Fig. 2c).",
                "To further investigate the electrochemical performance of Sn foils at different areal capacities, a current density of 1 mA cm−2 was maintained across tests. The ICEs remained low (∼30 %) across all conditions but gradually improved over cycling (Fig. 2d). Higher areal capacities led to faster CE improvements (Fig. S4), likely due to increased volume expansion and earlier crack initiation under these conditions (Fig. S5). Analyzing cumulative sodium loss over 10 cycles at various areal capacities revealed that greater areal capacity intensified sodium trapping, although losses slightly decreased when capacities exceeded 3 mAh cm−2. Interestingly, increasing current density produced an unexpected mitigation of sodium trapping, reducing cumulative losses compared to lower current densities (Fig. S6). The current density and areal capacity parameters used in this study were selected to balance the need for accurate mechanistic analysis and practical relevance. Specifically, the values were chosen to represent realistic operating conditions for SIBs while ensuring that the electrochemical and mechanical behavior of Sn foil anodes could be effectively observed and characterized.",
                "To investigate the mechanism of diffusive sodium trapping in Sn foil anodes for SIBs, this study exhaustively analyzed the phase transitions and morphological evolution during the initial charge/discharge cycle (1C rate at 1 mAh cm−2) using SEM and XRD. Initially, the electrode cross-section exhibited a dense structure (Fig. 3a). Following sodiation, a reaction layer of 1–3 μm formed on the electrode side in contact with the separator (Fig. 3b). With further sodiation, this layer expanded to 15–20 μm and developed a non-uniform, 3D porous coral-like structure with nanoscale pores (Fig. 3c and d), causing substantial volume expansion and an increase in the electrode’s specific surface area. During desodiation, the Sn foil anode began dealloying. At a sodium removal of 0.14 mAh cm−2, the coral-like structure remained largely unchanged, but cracks appeared in the reaction layer due to contraction (Fig. 3e). At 0.24 mAh cm−2 (charged to 1 V), crack widths increased to 1–4 μm, while the reaction layer retained its coral-like morphology. EDS analysis indicated significantly higher sodium content in this layer than in surrounding regions (Fig. 3f–h).",
                "To further confirm that sodium loss was due to sodium alloying in the electrode, sodiated electrodes were immersed in a phenolphthalein-alcohol solution, exploiting the reaction between sodium alloy and ethanol to produce hydrogen and sodium ethoxide. This reaction, with phenolphthalein as an indicator, turned the solution red, signaling sodium presence [39]. Upon desodiation to 0.24 mAh cm−2, the solution remained purple, indicating a considerable amount of residual sodium in the electrode post-cycle. Additionally, pH measurements revealed that solution alkalinity rose with increased sodiation, only slightly decreasing during desodiation, with a pH of 9.3 when the desodiation reached 0.14 mAh cm−2 (Fig. S7).",
                "XRD characterization of Sn foils at different sodiation levels revealed a sequence of phase transitions. Initially, only Sn peaks were visible in the electrode. Upon sodiation to 0.1 mAh cm−2, NaSn peaks emerged. Further sodiation to 0.5 mAh cm−2 showed Na9Sn4 peaks, with Sn peaks disappearing, indicating a thickening reaction layer that fully covered the underlying Sn. At 1 mAh cm−2, both NaSn and Na9Sn4 phases remained evident. During desodiation to 0.14 mAh cm−2, only the NaSn peak remained, as Na9Sn4 disappeared. At 0.24 mAh cm−2 (charged to 1 V), the Sn peak reappeared alongside NaSn, suggesting complex phase transitions in the initial cycle and the retention of a sodium-rich phase in the electrode, which contributes to irreversible sodium trapping and capacity loss in the first cycle (Fig. 3i and j).",
                "These findings confirm that diffusive sodium trapping is the primary contributor to sodium loss in Sn foil anodes during pre-cycling. To further understand this phenomenon, in situ EIS was conducted throughout the initial charge/discharge process (Fig. 3k). During sodiation, the RCT decreased, likely due to the formation of the sodium-rich phase, which lowered the interfacial energy barrier for alloying reactions. During desodiation, RCT initially remained stable but increased significantly at 0.24 mAh cm−2 (charged to 1 V). This increase corresponds to the formation of Sn, which raised the energy barrier. The porous, coral-like structure of the sodium-rich phase facilitates rapid sodium diffusion by providing more pathways. However, after desodiation, the surface’s sodium-poor phase reduces sodium diffusion capacity, hindering further sodium release and leading to passivation that causes diffusive sodium trapping (Fig. 3m).",
                "Structural fragmentation also contributes significantly to capacity degradation in the Sn foil anode due to the large volume changes of the active material during cycling. This includes SEI layer growth and sodium loss caused by loss of electrical contact with the active material. A complex interplay between structural fragmentation and diffusive sodium trapping was observed. Morphological analysis after different cycling stages showed that, after the first cycle at 1 mAh cm−2 and 1 mA cm−2, cracks formed along GBs, and the reaction layer reached ∼ 15 μm thickness (Fig. 4a and d). With continued cycling, crack density and width increased (Fig. 4b and c), and the reaction layer thickness expanded sharply (Fig. 4e and f). This structural fragmentation due to volume changes was substantial, with cracks increasing SEI formation and leading to detachment of some active material from the substrate after 10 cycles. We summarize the quantitative analysis of the average length and width of the cracks, the thickness of the reaction layer, and the crack density, to assess the impact of the cycling process on material performance (Fig. 4g). High-resolution XPS analysis after 10 cycles revealed the formation of an inorganic component within the SEI layer (Fig. S8). In the F 1 s region, the SEI layer was found to contain C-F, P-F, and Na-F species. Among these, the Na-F component plays a crucial role in stabilizing the anode, contributing to the cell's electrochemical stability through effective electronic insulation and excellent ionic conductivity, although its content is relatively low. On the other hand, the higher proportion of the P-F component in the SEI layer may compromise phase stability during cycling, potentially impacting the long-term electrochemical performance of the cell. Notably, as cycling proceeds, the Sn foil anode develops cracks due to volume changes, with the density of these cracks gradually increasing. Interestingly, the formation of these cracks positively influences the battery’s charging and discharging behavior [40]. They facilitate deeper electrolyte penetration into the sodium-rich regions beneath the anode surface, effectively shortening the sodium-ion diffusion path. This accelerates the dealloying reaction and gradually releases the trapped sodium, thereby enhancing battery performance. EIS testing indicated improved ion transport capacity with increased cycling, showing that crack formation substantially enhanced sodium-ion diffusion, thus alleviating diffusive sodium trapping (Fig. 4h and i). During extended half-cell cycling, the CE initially rose, even surpassing 100 % at times, likely due to the gradual release of trapped sodium, peaking around cycle 450 (Fig. 4j).",
                "To minimize sodium loss in Sn-based metal foils during cycling, pre-lithiation is commonly used in the literature to enhance the CE study [41], [42], [43], the incorporation of Zn significantly increased the availability of rapid sodiation sites within the two-dimensional plane, establishing efficient diffusion channels for sodium ions. The cross-sectional morphology of ZnSn alloy foils showed elongated Zn-rich phases distributed in layers along the rolling direction (Fig. S9). After sodiation at an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 and a current density of 1 mA cm−2, a reaction layer of approximately 9 μm formed on the side in contact with the diaphragm—thinner than that observed for pure Sn foils. Notably, the ZnSn alloy’s reactive layer exhibited minimal structural fragmentation after desodiation, unlike the severe fragmentation seen in Sn foils (Fig. 5a–c).",
                "ZnSn alloy foils demonstrated cumulative sodium loss of 1.71 mAh cm−2 over the first 10 cycles, more than one-third less than the sodium loss in Sn foils. This reduction in sodium accumulation was evident across various areal capacities (Fig. 5d, Fig. S10). The additional diffusion channels in ZnSn alloy appear to mitigate sodium loss effectively. EIS was used to analyze ion transport behaviors in ZnSn and Sn anodes, assessing diffusion coefficients at the 1st, 10th, 20th, and 50th cycles (Fig. S11). ZnSn alloy foils consistently displayed higher diffusion rates than Sn foils, underscoring that abundant GBs and PBs distributions in ZnSn facilitate enhanced sodium ion diffusion (Fig. 5e and f). In extended cycling, ZnSn alloy foils maintained a stable voltage profile, whereas Sn foils displayed increased voltage variation. After cycling stabilization, the voltage difference reached 0.81 V for Sn foils, while the ZnSn alloy maintained a lower difference of 0.59 V (Fig. 5g). Thus, optimizing structural morphology through alloying with Zn effectively reduces volume change and sodium trapping in Sn-based foil anodes during cycling, thereby enhancing the stability of the cycling performance (Fig. S12, Fig. S13) [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49]. In addition, during full-cell performance testing, we observed that diffusive sodium trapping significantly impacted cycling stability. The results revealed a similarly low initial ICE of approximately 30 % for the full-cell, consistent with the behavior observed in the half-cell. However, a key difference emerged: in the full-cell configuration, sodium released from the positive electrode was irreversibly trapped in the Sn anode due to the diffusive sodium trapping phenomenon. This led to substantial sodium retention in the Sn foil after the first cycle, causing a progressive decline in reversible capacity during subsequent cycles. In contrast, the half-cell exhibited stable discharge capacity across cycles, as the counter electrode provided an ample and continuous sodium supply, compensating for the losses associated with trapping and ensuring consistent cycling performance. Notably, in full-cell performance tests, the reversible capacity of Sn foils remains consistently low, whereas the reversible capacity of ZnSn alloy foils gradually increases with cycling and eventually stabilizes. This improvement is attributed to the presence of more diffusion channels in ZnSn alloy foils. Furthermore, we demonstrated highly stable full-cell performance after electrochemical pre-sodiation of the ZnSn alloy foil negative electrode (Fig. S14).",
                "To mitigate sodium loss, several potential improvement strategies are proposed in this study (Fig. 6). (1) Electrolyte Additives: The introduction of solvent additives enhances sodium ion diffusion and promotes the formation of a stable solid SEI layer, which reduces the loss of active material and improves cycling stability [19]. (2) Electrode Structure Design: Optimizing the electrode architecture minimizes stress-induced electrochemical failure by shortening the sodiation/desodiation pathways, thereby improving the rate performance and extending the cycling life of the foil anode [50], [51]. (3) Microstructural Defect Modulation: Tailoring the distribution of PBs, GBs, and DLs creates multi-scale diffusion channels. This approach increases the number of sodiation sites, enhances the sodiation/desodiation rates, and reduces localized stress concentrations that could lead to material degradation [26], [27], [32]. (4) Artificial SEI Coating: Applying a controlled artificial SEI coating to the electrode surface improves the wettability and uniformity of contact between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby stabilizing the electrolyte–electrode interface and enhancing cycle stability and efficiency [52], [53]."

                "In this study, we systematically investigated the electrochemo-mechanical behaviors of Sn foil anodes in SIBs, focusing on their structural evolution, sodium diffusion characteristics, and primary sources of sodium loss during cycling. Through comprehensive analyses using SEM, XRD, and EIS techniques, we demonstrated that the Sn anode undergoes significant morphological and phase transformations during sodiation/desodiation, including the formation of a 3D porous, coral-like structure. This structural change, coupled with diffusive sodium trapping and crack formation, contributes to capacity degradation and low ICE. The incorporation of Zn into Sn foils showed considerable improvements in sodium ion diffusion rates, reduced sodium trapping, and enhanced structural stability due to the formation of layered Zn-rich phases, which provided additional fast diffusion pathways. To address the capacity loss associated with Sn-based anodes, we propose several strategies, including electrolyte additives, optimized electrode structures, microstructural defect modulation, and artificial SEI coatings, all aimed at enhancing the anode's cycling stability and overall efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for developing high-performance Sn-based anodes, marking a step forward in the advancement of SIBs technology."
