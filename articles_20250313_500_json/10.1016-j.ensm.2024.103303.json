                "The P’2-type layered oxides attract much attention as viable cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), due to their high specific capacity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics and drastic capacity decay triggered by irreversible phase transition limit their large-scale application. In this study, we employ a synergistic optimization strategy involving cation and anion dopants to successfully restrain intergranular strain and tune local electronic structure, strengthening structural stability and electrochemical performance of the cathode material. Specifically, the Mg2+ dopant suppresses Na+/vacancy rearrangement and Mn-O anisotropic changes, while the F− dopant facilitates Na+ transport and alleviates phase evolution in high-voltage regions. Through this co-doping design, the modified electrodes display more alleviated voltage decay and exceptional capacity retention enhancements ranging from 6.57 % to 81.23 % after 750 cycles at 1000 mA g–1. This work provides novel perspectives on precise design of cathode materials, making layered oxides promising contenders for the next generation energy storage systems."

                "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as alternative supplements for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to the source abundance and cost advantage of sodium compared to lithium , , , . In SIBs, cathode materials primarily dominate the cost and energy density, which is a substantial factor in achieving large-scale commercial applications [,]. Among various cathode materials, manganese-based layered oxide (NaxMnO2, 0 < x ≤ 1) cathodes are appropriate for rechargeable SIBs due to large specific capacity, sustainability, and simple manufacture , , . These NaxMnO2 compounds can be classified into P- and O- types based on the alignment of oxygen coordinated with sodium ions and the stacking sequence of transition metal ions , , . In general, the P2-type NaxMnO2 possesses notable feature with fewer phase transitions, enhanced Na+ mobility, and higher rate capability compared to the O3-type , , . P’2 NaxMnO2, a distorted phase of P2 phase, not only possesses these advantages but also displays larger capacity and no Mn vacancies due to the presence of more Mn3+ ions , , . However, it is still hindered by irreversible structural transformations during Na+ (de)intercalation [ , ]. The phase evolution causes sustained capacity decay and large volume change associated with microcracks, which continuously consumes electrolyte and forms overgrowth cathode-electrolyte interface (CEI), thus leading to sluggish kinetics with obstruction of electron/ion transport and inadequate practical performance [ , ].",
                "Achieving high capacity and prolonged cycle durability are both crucial factors in the development of high-performance P’2 NaxMnO2 cathode materials. Various approaches have been explored, including complex surface or morphology technologies and composite structure designs. However, the simple method of cation doping has proven to be highly effective in extending the stability range and enhancing Na+ diffusion kinetics [ , ]. The inactive Mg2+ dopant in transition metal layer serves to raise the valence of Mn, thereby reducing the Mn3+ Jahn-Teller (J-T) active centers, in turn alleviating the Mn−O bond anisotropic alteration and delaying the phase transition process at the end-of-discharge [ , ]. Additionally, introducing Mg2+ can disrupt the Mn3+/4+ ordering and Na+/vacancy arrangements, resulting in smoother charge-discharge curves and accelerated Na+ conduction [ , , ]. Unfortunately, the doping electrochemical inactive metals will always inevitably result in a decrease in capacity [ , ]. However, the F− anion dopant offers a partial compensation for the capacity losses caused by Mg doping. It also leads to a weaker Na-F interaction, which facilitates easier Na+ diffusion by reducing the negative charge, as discovered in our previous study . In addition, strong TM-F bonds generated help to restrain the shearing of the [MnO6] layer at high voltage region, thanks to the strong electronegativity of F− making for more reversible Na storage behavior and long-term structural stability [,]. Inspired by these considerations, the combination of cationic and anionic dopants allows for fully utilization of their advantages, leading to superior sodium storage performance while maintaining high specific capacity. Although some research has been conducted on cation and anion co-doping, further improvements are still required to enhance sodium storage behavior and a more comprehensive understanding of the relative roles of cations and anions in bulk crystal structure is needed.",
                "Herein, we synthesized a series of P’2-type Mn-based layered cathode materials to explore the synergistic effect of cation and anion co-doping, including Na0.65MnO2 (NMO), Na0.64Mn0.96Mg0.04O1.92F0.08 (NMMOF), Na0.67Mn0.96Mg0.04O2 (NMMO) and Na0.66MnO1.92F0.08 (NMOF). In detail, Mg2+ dopant contributes to suppressing the metastable intermediates caused by Na+/vacancy rearrangement and Mn-O anisotropic changes. Meanwhile, the F− dopant facilitate the acceleration of electrochemical reaction and Na+ diffusion kinetics, thereby reducing electrochemical impedance and alleviated multiphase transformation at deeply charged state due to its lower negative charge than O2−. Benefitting from the synergistic co-doping strategy, the modified materials deliver high specific capacity, extended long cycle life, alleviated voltage decay and impressive rate capability, making them a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage systems."

Finally, all of the prepared products were then promptly transformed into glovebox for storage.

                        "The NMO, NMMOF, NMMO, and NMOF were successfully synthesized as evidenced by the absence of any visible impurity peak in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. In Fig. 1a and b and Fig. S1a and b, all of the diffraction peaks can be accurately assigned to P’2-type structure with a cmcm space group [ ,]. The actual chemical concentrations of all the cathode compounds were determined using ICP-OES for refinement, and the results (Table S1) closely matched the theoretical values. The fluorine distribution within NMMOF was revealed by ssNMR as shown in Fig. S2, and the results demonstrate the successful incorporation of fluorine into the bulk phase rather than its deposition as NaF on the surface. Due to the strong paramagnetic interaction between 19F nuclei and the unpaired d electrons of the Mn ions, no discernible 19F signals are observed in NMMOF material [ , ]. During the transition from NMO to NMMOF, Mn octahedral sites are preferred by Mg whereas F resides in O sites, and the detailed parameters are listed in Tables S2–S5. The distortion degree (δ) is calculated following previous study . Compared with NMO having distortion degree of 7.00 %, NMMOF exhibits lower distortion degree of 5.92 %, while NMMO and NMOF have distortion degrees of 6.38 % and 7.07 % respectively. This improvement is attributed to the decrease in Mn3+, which is responsible for J-T distortion, revealed by the shift to higher binding energy in XPS spectra presented in Fig. S3. Meanwhile, NMMOF has enlarged Na+ layer spacing and contracted [MnO6] layer spacing in sharp contrast to NMO (Fig. 1c). And the distance of Na+ layer and [MnO6] layer in NMMO is confirmed as 3.59 Å and 2.01 Å separately, as well as 3.56 Å and 2.04 Å in NMOF (Fig. S1c and d). It reveals that more Mn4+ with stronger electronegativity and smaller ionic radius in structure leads to the shrinkage of [MnO6] layer and expansion of Na+ layer via more intensive electrostatic attraction with adjacent oxygen. Thus, incorporating Mg and F into the framework enables the generation of a more stable structure with larger Na layer distance, which contributes to better performance.",

HRTEM analysis in Fig. 1f and S5a–c reveals that the distance of adjacent [MnO6] slabs corresponds to (002) planes of P’2-type structure, in accordance with the XRD refinement results. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results presented in Fig. 1g and S5d confirm that as-prepared samples possess the orthorhombic crystal structure, coinciding with the P’2 phase. Moreover, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings in Fig. S6 reveal a homogenous distribution of various elements within the bulk structure."

                        "The GCD tests were tested within 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at 20 mA g–1. From the first three cycles capacity-voltage profiles in Fig. 2a, NMO can deliver a discharge specific capacity of 213.18 mAh g–1 (0.81 Na+ insertion per formula), while the specific capacity decreased rapidly. The multiple voltage plateaus in the NMO capacity-voltage profiles are attributed to the Na+/vacancy ordering and phase transition processes, which will be discussed later. In contrast, NMMOF processes smoother and more reversible capacity-voltage profiles with a discharge specific capacity of 200.88 mAh g–1 (Fig. 2b), indicating that each formula unit incorporates 0.75 Na+ into the framework. The slightly reduced discharge specific capacity in NMMOF is due to the more Mn4+ in the structure caused by inactive Mg2+ dopant as indicated by XPS results. As for the respective influence of Mg and F dopants, Mg dopant clearly smoothens the charge-discharge curves (Fig. S7a and b), whereas no such effect is observed with F dopant exhibiting multiple voltage plateaus. However, it is evident that the charge-discharge curves overlap well in the initial three cycles following Mg or F induction, indicating the enhanced reversibility. Despite causing a slight capacity decline for NMMO, the inactive Mg dopant significantly suppresses the detrimental Na+/vacancy ordering rearrangement.",
                        "The EIS comparison in Fig. 2c shows that synergistically co-doping of Mg and F significantly enhances charge transfer capabilities, resulting in a remarkable reduction in resistance. The cycling performance at 100 mA g–1 in Fig. S8a manifests that the NMMOF exhibits considerable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 79.12 % after 200 cycles, while NMO only offers very limited capacity retention of 35.52 %. The NMMOF electrode, in particular, displays ultra-long stability of 81.23 % over 750 cycles at 1000 mA g–1 while keeping high specific capacity. This performance surpasses that of NMO, which suffers from poor capacity retention of 6.57 % (Fig. 2d). Meanwhile, the Coulombic efficiency of NMO fluctuates greatly after 300 cycles, suggesting the structural deterioration and the onset of undesirable side reactions. In addition, the NMMOF shows higher average voltage and much more restrained voltage decay than NMO (Fig. S8b). Hence, the aforementioned results demonstrate that the co-doping strategy contributes to prolonged cycle life and superior sodium storage properties. As displayed in Fig. 2e, the rate performance at currents ranging from 10 mA g–1 to 1000 mA g–1 provides further insights into the impact of Mg and F co-doping. The NMMOF electrode exhibits an impressive capacity of 120.26 mAh g–1 at 1000 mA g–1, and the recovered capacity at 100 mA g–1 after the rate test reaches approximately 94.69 % (163.44 mAh g–1) of the pristine value obtained (172.61 mAh g–1). Both NMMO and NMOF show acceptable capacity decline with increased rates, whereas NMO displays limited capacity at high rates.",
                        "The charge transfer and Na+ conductivity in the electrodes markedly improve with the Mg and F dopants, leading to enhanced kinetics as evidenced by the EIS and GITT results (Fig. S9). From Fig. 2f, the Na diffusion coefficient (DNa+) evidently increases from a range of 5.35 × 10−15 ∼ 7.00 × 10−11 cm2 S−1 to 1.74 × 10−13 ∼ 1.60 × 10−10 cm2 S−1, indicating that NMMOF has faster Na+ mobility and lower Na diffusion barrier compared to NMO. In the CV measurements of NMMOF and NMO at different scan rates (0.1–0.8 mV s–1) shown in Fig. 2g and S10a, NMMOF also exhibits much smoother curves than that of NMO, congruent with the GCD testing in which the Na+/vacancy ordering gets weaker. The reaction kinetics to the charge storage process is calculated based upon the equation i = avb (log i = log a + blog v). Specifically, the i stands for peak current, and v for scan rate. In Fig. 2h and S10b, the log i vs. log v plots reveal the value of b in Peak 1 and Peak 2 of NMMOF and NMO separately, suggesting that the electrochemical process of NMMOF and NMO is controlled by a combination of diffusion-limited and capacitive behaviors. The specific contribution of pseudocapacitance is calculated based on the equation i= k1v + k2v0.5, where k1v and k2v0.5 represent the capacitive and diffusion-limited currents [ , ], respectively (Fig. S11). There is a larger capacitive contribution of Peak 1 and Peak 2 in NMMOF than that of NMO (Fig. S12), indicating a more stored charge and faster kinetics in NMMOF . As a consequence, NMMOF displays impressive rate performance due to expanded Na+ layer spacing derived fast diffusion capability.",
                        "XRD and HRTEM were applied to investigate the underlying factors contributing to this discrepancy in electrode stability. The comparison of XRD patterns in Fig. S13 proves that NMMOF electrode can preserve structure integrity after cycling for 50 cycles at 100 mA g–1, whereas NMO has two distinct phases, indicating NMO undergoes unrecoverable structural evolution during repeated charging-discharging process. Meanwhile, unlike the NMO with mismatch and disorders depicted in Fig. 3b, the crystal structure of NMMOF maintains more intact (Fig. 3a). Notably, the CEI of NMMOF (Fig. 3c) is uniform and well maintained without apparent change after 50 cycles at 100 mA g–1, which is considered as a crucial factor for the markedly extended cycling performance. Conversely, uneven and overgrowth CEI film is formed on surface of NMO due to large volume change (Fig. 3d), which hinders ion transportation and leads to extra electrolyte consumption [ , ]. The CEI components of NMMOF and NMO are explored utilizing XPS with various Ar+ etching depth. The C-O and CO intensities in O 1 s spectra (Fig. 3e and f) of NMMOF are lower than those of NMO, indicating that the unstable and friable organic species diminish on NMMOF electrode surface [ , ]. The similar phenomenon can be observed in C 1 s spectra (Fig. S14). Specifically, as shown in Fig. 3g and h, the NaF signal in F 1 s spectra of NMMOF is far higher compared to NMO under altered Ar+ etching depth, suggesting a more stable and uniform CEI enriched with NaF. The NaF-enriched CEI on NMMOF facilitates easier Na+ diffusion, reduces parasitic reactions and mitigates electrode cracking [ ,]. The boosted interface stability endows NMMOF electrode with more robust framework, ultimately beneficial to an extended cycling life and improved kinetics. Thus, the combined effects of Mg and F synergistically enhance the electrochemical performance in terms of reversible charge-discharge processes, good electrical conductivity, enhanced rate capability, and outstanding cycling performance."

                        "The structural evolution process of NMMOF and NMO upon Na+ extraction and insertion was revealed by in-situ XRD during the initial cycle and second charge process as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The corresponding refined crystal parameters are concluded in Fig. 4c and S15. During the initial charge process, the (002) and (004) peaks of NMMOF shift to lower angles, whereas the (112) and (114) peaks shift to higher angles. That is attributed to the extraction of Na+ from the structure, which leads to the expansion of c axis owing to stronger electrostatic repulsion between adjacent oxygen layers, while the ab plane shrinks resulting from Mn3+ oxidation to Mn4+. The OP4 phase appears when the voltage reached to 3.5 V and persists until charging is completed, caused by the gliding of [MnO6] layers under the strong repulsive forces. The structural transition process is similar in NMO, however rather than bi-phase coexistence, it entirely transforms to OP4 phase at fully charged state. Following Na ions insertion, the OP4 phase in NMMOF firstly reverts back to P’2 phase and subsequently evolves into P′′2 phase within a quite narrow voltage range due to the restrained J-T effect. Nevertheless, the NMO electrode undergoes more severe phase transition process when the voltage reaches to 2.2 V, resulting in a distinct two-phase region. In the subsequent charge processes of NMMOF and NMO, the bi-phase state gradually transforms into P'2 phase, followed by the OP4 phase, in accordance with the initial cycle. As can be concluded, NMMOF exhibits a reversible phase transformation from P’2 → P’2 + OP4 → P’2 → P’2 + P”2 →P’2 → P’2 + OP4, while NMO displays more serious structural evolution from P’2 → P’2 + OP4 → OP4 → P’2 + OP4→ P’2 → P’2 + P”2 →P’2 → P’2 + OP4 → OP4. The lattice parameter evolution process and unit-cell volume variation in NMMOF (Fig. 4c) fluctuates within a much narrower range compared to NMO (Fig. S15) during the process of Na+ insertion and extraction, indicating structural robustness against intergranular stress and strain after Mg and F modulation.",
                        "From the structure evolution of NMMO in Fig. S16a, the counter mapping is similar to that of NMMOF apart from the complete transition to OP4 phase at fully charged state. The reversible structural change process in NMMO reveals that the Mg dopant effectively restricts the J-T distortion during Mn4+ reduction. Additionally, the removal of Na+ in NMOF results in an obvious two-phase region consisting of P’2 phase and OP4 phase (Fig. S16b). This distinction arises from the decreased electrostatic repulsion between the neighboring oxygen layer due to the introduction of F with a lower negative charge and stronger electronegativity, which effectively suppresses shearing of [MnO6] layer and lattice collapse. As a consequence, the incorporation of Mg and F dopants in NMMOF synergistically enhance the local crystal framework stability and alleviate the adverse structural evolution during the electrochemical process."

The additional peak corresponds to Augers of C-F bond and Na-F bond originated from the NMMOF material, as well as the introduction of FEC and PVDF . Upon charging process, the intensity of Mn4+ becomes stronger, indicating the oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+ with the peak shift toward higher binding energy. Conversely, during discharging progress with the insertion of Na+, the intensity of Mn3+ increases, suggesting the reduction of Mn4+. From the F 1 s spectra (Fig. 5c), the fluctuation in Na-F bond intensity at various states can be attributed to the Na+ transportation. As a result, the charge compensation is facilitated by the redox couple of Mn3+/ Mn4+."

                        "To identify the local chemistry and electronic structures, DFT calculations were carried out . The optimized structural models used for calculations are displayed in Fig. S17. The band gap of NMMOF is obviously lower than that of NMO from the density of states (DOS) comparison in Fig. 6a and b, exhibiting promoted electronic conductivity and faster charge transfer kinetics. After Mg and F co-doping, the simulated average bond length variation trend of Mn-O bonds and Na-O bonds is consistent with the XRD refinement results. In particular, the Mn-O bonds exhibited increased strength due to their shorter average lengths compared to those of NMO (Fig. 6c), which makes them advantageous for preserving structural robustness and integrity. Meanwhile, the weaker interaction between Na and O in NMMOF benefits in expanding the sodium layer and accelerating Na+ diffusion, which is consistent with the experimental results mentioned above. The overlap of electron cloud between Mn and O gets weaker in NMMOF from the discrepancy in partial charge density distribution in Fig. 6d and e, indicating that electron localization occurs among dopants and the neighboring Mn and O with less covalency for the Mn–O bonds compared with NMO (Fig. S18). To further investigate the local electronic structural changes of Mg and F dopants, the electron localization function (ELF) was calculated. The enhanced ionicity between Mn and O resulting from co-doping modulation contributes to a higher redox voltage of NMMOF with increased electronic localization , , , as revealed by local electronic status alteration shown in Fig. 6f and g. Meanwhile, the ELF results are in accordance with the change of electron density, demonstrating that the electronic charge distribution is regulated by the localization of electrons facilitated by Mg and F dopants."

                "In conclusion, Mg and F co-doped P’2-type cathode materials have been successfully synthesized using a convenient solid-phase method. A combination of various characterization techniques, including 19F ssNMR, XPS, and EDS mapping, demonstrate the Mg and F occupied Mn and O sites, respectively. Both experimental and theoretical analysis show that this synergistic co-doping strategy aids to enhance structural stability and sodium storage performance. Specifically, Mg effectively restrains Na+/vacancy rearrangement and J-T effect derived Mn-O bond anisotropic alteration, while F retards structural evolution at high voltage and enhances electrical conductivity with accelerated kinetics. By employing this synergistic co-doping strategy to enhance both structural stability and reversibility simultaneously, the P’2 Na0.64Mn0.96Mg0.04O1.92F0.08 electrode displays high specific capacity along with extended cycling life and rate capability. This design concept enables the fabrication of novel cathode materials with outstanding performance for SIBs."
