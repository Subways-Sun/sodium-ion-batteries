                "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage. Increasing the energy density of SIBs demands anode materials with high gravimetric and volumetric capacity. To overcome the drawback of low density of conventional nanosized or porous electrode materials, compact heterostructured particles are developed in this work with improved Na storage capacity by volume, which are composed of SnO2 nanoparticles loaded into nanoporous TiO2 followed by carbon coating. The resulted TiO2@SnO2@C (denoted as TSC) particles inherit the structural integrity of TiO2 and extra capacity contribution from SnO2, delivering a volumetric capacity of 393 mAh cm−3 notably higher than that of porous TiO2 and commercial hard carbon. The heterogeneous interface between TiO2 and SnO2 is believed to promote the charge transfer and facilitate the redox reactions in the compact heterogeneous particles. This work demonstrates a useful strategy for electrode materials with high volumetric capacity."

                        "Figures 3A and 3B showed the galvanostatic charge and discharge performance of TiO2 and TSC. The discharge and charging-specific capacity of TiO2 in the first cycle were 265 and 156 mAh cm−3, respectively. TSC possessed much higher discharge and charging capacity (667 and 357 mAh cm−3, respectively). The low initial Coulombic efficiency of TSC could be attributed to the formation of SEI and the irreversible conversion of SnO2 into Sn. From the second cycle onward, the charge/discharge curves gradually stabilize. Note that the TSC only shows slightly improved reversible gravimetric capacity compared with TiO2, yet the improvement in volumetric capacity is much pronounced (Figure S5C). As compared in Figure 3C, after incorporating high-capacity component (SnO2) and inactive carbon layer, the gravimetric capacity increases from 208 mAh g−1 of pure nanoporous TiO2 to 279 mAh g−1 of TSC. Given that the SnO2 nanoparticles only occupy the inner cavity of nanoporous TiO2, a significant increase of tap density was observed (1.39 and 0.88 g cm−3 for TSC and TiO2, respectively). Collectively, the volumetric capacity of TSC (393 mAh cm−3) is more than twice that of TiO2 (181 mAh cm−3), and much higher than that of commercial hard carbon (221 mAh cm−3).",
                        "Figures 3D and S5D show the rate performance of TSC and TiO2 at different current densities. When the current density was 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 0.1 A g−1, TSC nanoparticles maintained discharging capacities of 357, 326, 274, and 204 mAh cm−3, respectively, which were much higher than that of TiO2 (153.6, 145.0, 124.8, 107, and 134.6 mAh cm−3, respectively). Though the compact structure of TSC might extend the diffusion path for sodium ion and compromise the utilization of active component at high rates, TSC still delivered and higher volume capacity under a current density of 1 A g−1. When the current density was reduced back to 0.1 A g−1, the discharging capacity of TSC recovered a high value of 343 mAh cm−3, showing good reversibility. The decent high-rate performance of TSC could be attributed to the smaller charge transfer resistance (4.788 Ω) and diffusion resistance compared with TiO2 (215 Ω) as revealed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Figure S5E), suggesting improved electronic/ionic transport in the heterostructured TSC particles as discussed shortly.",

The volumetric capacity of TSC was twice higher than that of TiO2 and maintained a high value of 261 mAh cm−3 after 200 cycles at the current density of 200 mA g−1, which is much higher than that of TS (135 mAh cm−3) and TiO2 (126 mAh cm−3). The rapid capacity decay of TS might be related to the structural degradation of SnO2 moieties upon repeated sodiation and poor stability of the electrode-electrolyte interface (Figure S5F).52",

Then, 25 mg of dopamine hydrochloride (HDA) were added into the above solution and stirred at 30°C for 24 hours. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol alternately, then dried at 80°C. The as-prepared products were annealed at 600°C for 5 hours at a heating rate of 5°C min-1 under Ar atmosphere to obtain TSC."

The morphologies of the composites were examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Phenom LE) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HT770 120 kV). To identify their chemical status, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) with an Al Kα excitation source was employed. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the products were measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyzer (BET) at 575 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2460)."
