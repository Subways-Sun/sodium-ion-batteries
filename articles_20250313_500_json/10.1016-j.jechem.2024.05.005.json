                "The engineering of plant-based precursor for nitrogen doping has become one of the most promising strategies to enhance rate capability of hard carbon materials for sodium-ion batteries; however, the poor rate performance is mainly caused by lack of pyridine nitrogen, which often tends to escape because of high temperature in preparation process of hard carbon. In this paper, a high-rate kapok fiber-derived hard carbon is fabricated by cross-linking carboxyl group in 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid with the exposed hydroxyl group on alkalized kapok with assistance of zinc chloride. Specially, a high nitrogen doping content of 4.24% is achieved, most of which are pyridine nitrogen; this is crucial for improving the defect sites and electronic conductivity of hard carbon. The optimized carbon with feature of high nitrogen content, abundant functional groups, degree of disorder, and large layer spacing exhibits high capacity of 401.7 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1, and more importantly, good rate performance, for example, even at the current density of 2 A g−1, a specific capacity of 159.5 mAh g−1 can be obtained. These findings make plant-based hard carbon a promising candidate for commercial application of sodium-ion batteries, achieving high-rate performance with the enhanced pre-cross-linking interaction between plant precursors and dopants to optimize aromatization process by auxiliary pyrolysis."

                "With the volatility of lithium ore prices and resource constraints, the development of new energy storage systems has emerged as a focal point [1], [2]. Currently, sodium-ion technology has gained prominence because of its cost-effectiveness and superior performance [3], [4], [5]. Due to the large size of sodium ions, anode materials used in sodium-ion batteries need higher requirements, meanwhile, the graphite anode used in lithium-ion batteries is incompatible with sodium-ion batteries [6], [7]. Therefore, non-graphitizable hard carbon materials possess unique structural characteristics such as large interlayer spacing and short-range ordering properties, making them suitable for adsorbing sodium ions and serving as primary anode electrode materials [8].",
                "The precursor of hard carbon has the characteristics of oxygen enrichment, and the conventional materials are plant-based materials [8], [9], [10], organic polymers [11], [12], resins [13] and so on. Among them, resins and organic compounds perform better than biological ones, but considering the cost and sustainability, plant-based materials such as cotton, grass, and leaf are more suitable to be used as precursors derived carbon anode of SIBs. The problem is that for plant-based precursors, the hard carbon materials prepared by pure carbonization have poor rate performance, especially in terms of large current density [14]. In this regard, a lot of work has focused on increasing rate performance through the heteroatoms doping (i.e., nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P) doping). Among them, N is the most reported heteroatom, because the doping of N at the O-position introduces oxygen vacancies, which can increase the “electron-hole” concentration, enhance the electrical conductivity of hard carbon materials, and promote the migration of sodium ions, resulting the increase of their rate performance [15], [16], [17], [18]. Senthil et al. [19] used seaweed as a carbon source to produce hard carbon materials. Although the N content of the seaweed is abundant, the N content of the pyrolyzed samples does not exceed 2.5%. With the increase of KOH treatment concentration, the N content once decreased to 1.67%. At a current density of 1 A g−1, the capacity is only 103 mAh g−1. The main problem is that N elements will inevitably escape in the gaseous state during high temperature pyrolysis, and their functional groups cannot be regulated during pyrolysis.",
                "Noted that it is not only necessary to improve the content of N after carbonization, but also to optimize the existence form of N after doping. A N-doped hard carbon using melamine as N source was prepared, whose content of graphite N accounted for 18% [20]. In the carbonization process N is inevitably cross-linked with C to form graphite-N, but graphite-N has no advantage for increasing capacity. The ratio of pyridine N plays an important role in improving rate performance. In addition, the common method of doping into plant-based materials is acid treatment, whose purpose is to destroy long-chain macromolecules to optimize the cross-linking action between heteroatoms and carbon during pyrolysis. However, acid treatment will consume part of the oxygen source before pyrolysis. Especially for oxygen-rich plant-based materials, it has an irreversible and unfavorable impact on boosting sodium storage sites after carbonization [6]. Besides, proper solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in maintaining capacity with high current density, and it is usually a problem for plant-based carbon materials that SEI can be easily broke at high current lead to capacity decline. It has proved that the C=O has a positive effect on the adjustment of SEI, which is reflected in the impedance [21], [22]. Unfortunately, most of research work focused on the hydroxyl group at the C6 position, no experimental scheme has been proposed to regulate the existence of oxygen functional groups in the form of C=O and the existence of pyridine N in the N doping during pyrolysis. Therefore, how to implement the advantages of biomass materials and improve the efficiency of modification is an important problem in the large-scale application of biomass [23].",
                "Herein, kapok fiber is chosen as the precursor materials to prepare high-efficient N-doped hard carbon anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, combining 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid as N source and zinc chloride as the pyrolysis assistant ligand. The abundant pore structure and unique quasi-3D tubular structure of kapok fiber can be preserved after carbonization, which is beneficial to optimize the diffusion channel of sodium ions. Specially, a high N doping content of 4.24% is achieved, which is crucial for improving the defect sites and electronic conductivity of hard carbon. And the C=O functional group is maximally restored during the aromatization process with the assistance of zinc chloride. The optimized hard carbon shows an ultra-high specific capacity of 401.7 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and a great initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 75.94%. Even at the current density of 2 A g−1, it shows a specific capacity of 159.5 mAh g−1 and maintains a very low-capacity decay rate."

                        "In Scheme 1, low-cost and 3D network structure kapok fibers have been utilized as raw materials to prepare hard carbon anodes. Kapok fibers are firstly treated with alkalizer to remove the surface wax for a glaze surface. Then a cross-linking reaction happens between carboxyl groups on 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups in kapok exposed because of alkalization treatment. At the same time, the free zinc ions in zinc chloride coordinate with the N in 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid to further fix the N source into precursor before carbonization. In addition, zinc chloride is also used as an auxiliary pyrolysis agent to avoid the direct cross-linking of N and C in aromatization, which leads to the increase of graphite N content, and further to optimize the functional groups of oxygen in graphite. The as-prepared kapok precursor is pre-carbonized at 220 °C, and then carbonized at 1200 °C; and finally, N-rich hard carbon is formed with the assistance of zinc chloride noted as N-ZAHC. After pyrolysis, more nitrogen exists in the form of pyridine N as a defect in the carbon layer to increase the local electron cloud density and enhance the attraction of Na+ in the sodium energy storage. The wider carbon layer spacing induced by pyridine N also plays a role in the insertion of Na+. In order to illustrate the role of zinc chloride and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, the structure and performance of four carbon materials including HC (hard carbon derived from kapok), N-HC (hard carbon derived from kapok with the addition of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid), ZAHC (hard carbon derived from kapok with the assistance of zinc chloride), and N-ZAHC will be discussed in next section.",
                        "Kapok fiber has thin wall and a very high hollow degree (Fig. 1a and b). What is interesting is that this hollow structure can still be retained after pyrolysis even at 1200 °C (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1a in Supporting Information). It can be observed in Fig. S2 that the strength of O–H bond of alkalized kapok is greatly improved, and both C–O bond and C=O bond are strengthened along with alkalization treatment. This means that the alkalization treatment can not only remove impurities from the surface wax, but also expose the internal functional groups, increasing the operability of subsequent treatment. After kapok fibers being treated with zinc chloride and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid before carbonization, the morphology of N-ZAHC has a more special adjustment (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1b in Supporting Information). The original layered outer wall of kapok fiber is more clearly, and the surface is exposed with more pores caused by the assistance of ZnCl2. This special structure can improve the invasion with electrolyte, while reducing the path of sodium ion migration; that is an important reason for the rapid migration of sodium ions and the improvement of the rate performance. Through TEM observation, it is found that HC without treatment of ZnCl2 and C7H5NO4 shows relatively abundant graphite-like domains and black carbon stacking (Fig. 1e). These stacked parts can easily cause blockage of sodium ions during migration, resulting in generation of high irreversible capacity. However, the other three samples cannot find this phenomenon. Under the local TEM images, a small amount of graphite-like domain in N-HC (Fig. 1f) is observed, which does not find in samples of both ZAHC and N-ZAHC with the addition of ZnCl2 (Fig. 1g and h). Besides, N-HC and N-ZAHC have some folds at the edge of carbon owing to more defect retention by N doping, which can improve the adsorption site of sodium ions to a certain extent.",
                        "XRD patterns in Fig. 2(a) also show the consistent results with those in TEM. HC has the smallest carbon layer spacing (0.372 nm), which is close to the carbon layer spacing of ZAHC (0.378 nm). The d002 of N-HC and N-ZAHC doped by N greatly increases to 0.392 and 0.387 nm, respectively. In addition to the increase of d002 spacing, the degree of graphitization is compared through the R-value change. To measure the order degree of HC, the empirical parameter R, an indicator of the carbon sheets arranged as single layers, was defined by Prof. J.-R. Dahn in 1996 [26]. The larger the R-value, the higher the degree of graphitization. This may be related to the delayed development of graphite domain due to more abundant defects after N doping and it is in agreement with the characteristics of the non-graphitized carbon [27]. Fig. 2(b) shows that N-ZAHC has suitable values of carbon microcrystal in La, Lc, and d002, which proves the interaction of Zn2+ and N operates an important role for the formation of graphite-like microcrystals. Pyridine N plays a critical role in improvement of defects. Raman spectra (Fig. 2c and d, and Fig. S3 in Supporting Information) are divided into four Lorentz peaks (D1, G, D2, and D4) and one Gaussian peak (D3) [14]. The results of the Raman spectral volume integral peaks are very helpful for the analysis of oxygen-containing defects and structural defects in carbon materials [28], [29]. The G band at about 1580 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration mode with E2g symmetry in the aromatic layers of the graphite crystalline. The band at 1350 cm−1 (D1 band) is a breathing mode of A1g symmetry involving phonons near the K zone boundary, which is ascribed to the disordered graphitic lattices with in-plane imperfections such as defects and heteroatoms. The band at 1620 cm−1 (D2 band) is attributed to the vibration mode of disordered graphitic lattices with E2g symmetry (surface graphene layers). The band at 1530 cm−1 (D3 band) originates from the vibration of the sp2-bond form of amorphous carbon, such as organic molecules, fragments or functional groups, in poorly organized carbonaceous materials [30], [31], [32], [33]. The band at 1200 cm−1 (D4 band) is ascribed to the mixed sp2-sp3 bond form at the periphery of crystallites or to C–C and C=C stretching vibration of polyene-like structure. ZAHC has the lowest ID1/IG value, which also means that it has a higher stretching vibration mode with E2g symmetry in the aromatic layers of the graphite crystalline and a lower vibration of defects and heteroatoms. However, the higher D3 and D4 are interesting, and the reaction is partially defective even in the highly graphitized structure (Fig. 2e). This phenomenon of G-band splitting is observed to a greater extent on some irradiated carbon graphene and carbon nanotubes, and is interpreted as the result of topological defects, that is, caused by non-hexametric ring defects in the bent or twisted cone of the layers [34], [35]. N-ZAHC has the highest defect vibration, which also means it has the lowest graphitization degree and R-value.",
                        "To study pore structure of the obtained carbon materials, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S4) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have been employed. The pores of the four samples are concentrated below 10 nm. N-HC and N-ZAHC have the better concentration, with an average pore size of 4 nm (Fig. 2f). The average aperture of HC reaches 18 nm, and the specific surface area of ZAHC (85.1 m2 g−1) is the lowest according to Fig. S5 in Supporting Information. N-HC has a maximum specific surface area of 349.9 m2 g−1. The specific surface areas of HC and N-ZAHC are 200.5 and 318.7 m2 g−1, respectively. The specific surface area of N-ZAHC makes a special contribution to reducing side reactions and building a complete SEI. Similarly, the more concentrated pore distribution is also conducive to the reduction of the overall side reaction of the material to increase ICE.",
                        "According to the data of SAXS, the microstructural information of all four samples has also been investigated [36]. The scattering at medium q region corresponds to nanometer-sized structures and can be attributed to the nanopores in the hard carbon matrix [37], [38]. It can be observed that in the middle q region, the intensity of the four samples is ordered as follows: N-HC, N-ZAHC, ZAHC, and HC. The SAXS profiles of N-HC at ∼0.01 Å−1 indicate that the nanopore scattering become more intense and the reflections were shifted to the low-q region (Fig. 2g). The brightness and intensity of the 2D SAXS images show that all samples are rich in nanopore, indicating a diverse porosity (Fig. 2h and Fig. S6 in Supporting Information). These results are consistent with the analysis of TEM and N2 adsorption–desorption isothermal curves.",
                        "To further illustrate the controlled modulation of the hard caron structure by Zn2+ and doped N, XPS of four samples has been developed. It is observed C and O elements in the full spectrum of XPS (Fig. S7 in Supporting Information), while N-HC and ZAHC is detected additional N and Zn elements, respectively. N-ZAHC is doped by N and pyrolyzed accessorily by zinc chloride, C, N, O and Zn can be detected. At around 992 eV, zinc element (ZAHC and N-ZAHC) can be observed, which is also proved that zinc ions, as ligands and auxiliary pyrolysis agents, are reduced to metals during pyrolysis, and have not been generated ZnO or formed Zn-Nn bonds. This distribution of elements is also proved in Fig. S8 in Supporting Information.",
                        "In Fig. 3(a), it can be observed that N-ZAHC has the lowest content of element C, which means that it is more abundant in heteroatoms. The positions of graphite nitrogen (400 ± 0.1 eV) and pyridine nitrogen (397.7 ± 0.05 eV) were determined on spectra of N 1s [39], [40]. By comparing N-ZAHC and N-HC, it is found that the content of O element in N-ZAHC is higher than that in N-HC, and the N content in N-ZAHC is 26% higher than that in N-HC. Compared with single doping N or Zn, zinc chloride assisted pyrolysis can improve the retention of heteroatoms. Fig. 3(b and c) show that the peaks of C 1s in HC and N-ZAHC. The sp2 hybrid orbital means that there will be one equivalent p orbitals in a linear arrangement for π bonding. N-ZAHC has the highest ratio of sp2/sp3, which means that its π-π conjugate orbitals are abundant and its electrons are more closely arranged. For ZAHC, sp3 orbitals are more abundant due to the contribution of zinc ions in catalytic graphitization. Compared with HC, the sp2 content of N-HC increases due to the doping of nitrogen atoms, which is related to the defect structure caused by pyridine nitrogen (Fig. 3d). A weak π-π* companion peak is also observed in N-ZAHC, unlike the other three samples (Figs. S9 and S11a in Supporting Information). The presence of this companion peak means a denser electron cloud. Both sp2 and sp3 can form a complete carbon ring structure, but sp2 also leads to defective carbon configurations [41], [42]. This result is consistent with the results of Raman fitting, and also proves the contribution of defects in sodium storage sites.",
                        "C=O bond can improve affinity between electrolyte and electrode, which is manifested in the improvement of ICE and the stability of long cycle [51]. O 1s also matches the results with those in FTIR (Figs. S9b, S10, S11b, and S12 in Supporting Information). In Fig. 3(e), ZAHC has the highest C=O bond ratio, which proves that zinc ions have an inducible effect on the construction of C=O bond. N-ZAHC has a similar ratio of C=O bond with ZAHC and unprocessed HC has the lowest C=O content, which is also the reason for its poor long cycle capacity. According to FTIR in Fig. 3(f), C=O and C≡C bonds are found in all four materials. In addition, through N 1s analysis of N-HC and N-ZAHC (Fig. 3g, h, and Table S1 in Supporting Information), it is found that N in the carbon network constructed by the pre-cross-linking method is mainly in the form of pyridine N, which also proves the superiority of this kind of N doping. Compared with others, this work has an advantage for doping N in plant-based precursors derived carbon materials with a high N content and a low graphite N content (Table 1)."

All four materials show a decrease in diffusion coefficient at voltages below 0.1 V, which is attributed to a change in sodium storage mode. Above 0.1 V, the storage of sodium ions is mainly adsorption, while below 0.1 V, it is mainly interlayering insertion. In addition, it can still be found that the diffusion coefficient of N-ZAHC is much higher than that of the other three types of materials, thanks to the high electron cloud density caused by the more abundant heteroatoms. However, when the potential is lower than 0.1 V, the coefficient partially increases in the lower voltage range. The increase here is explained by the adsorption/filling of more abundant micropores on sodium clusters, which is the source of additional platform capacity [52].",
                        "To verify the reversible capacity of hard carbon, CV tests are performed on four materials. In Fig. 4(e and f), HC shows a poor curve coincidence degree. The area reduced in first circle means the by-product in the first charging and discharging. This includes the SEI generated at around 1.08 V. N-ZAHC also has the generated SEI at around 0.62 V. The entire SEI generation process is a long voltage range, which means a more complete SEI structure, thus protecting the material during the long cycle process. And a more complete SEI structure can have a lower interface impedance, which proved in Fig. 4(g). ZAHC and N-HC also show the SEI generation peak in the CV curve of the first circle (Fig. S13 in Supporting Information), but this process is discontinuous and accompanied by some by-products like HC. Because of N doping, the impedance of N-HC is still lower than that of ZAHC (Fig. 4h). In Fig. 4(i), the ex-situ impedance of discharging-charging process shows that the interface impedance decreases overall, that contribute to the more stable SEI at the electrode/electrolyte interface. At the same time, it can be observed that when the voltage of the first discharging reaches 0.1 V, two semi-circles appear in the Nyquist diagram, the first semicircle can be understood as the charge transfer limited reaction, which is between the electrode and the electrolyte, and the larger radius indicates the slower charge transfer. The second semicircle can reflect the surface diffusion. The smaller charge resistance means fast sodium ions diffusion and small polarization, leading to the better electrochemical performance [53].",
                        "In order to estimate the sodium storage behavior, combined with the special 0.1 V in the GITT image, the entire discharging curve is divided into two parts. One part is a slope region dominated by adsorption, which corresponds to the adsorption of sodium ions in the pores; while the other part is a plateau region dominated by insertion, which corresponds to the insertion of sodium ions in the interlayer and the adsorption of sodium clusters in the micropores. In Fig. 4(j), SoS means “status of sodium”. HC shows a 65.3% slope capacity, which is more than that of N-ZAHC (51.8%). This means that sodium cluster adsorption due to more abundant micropore structure and larger layer spacing bring more abundant plateau capacity to N-ZAHC. In addition, HC shows a plateau at around 1.1 V, a phenomenon not seen in the other three materials (Fig. 4k). This part of the capacity contribution may be related to the HC’s average porosity of up to 18 nm, with larger pores providing an additional platform in adsorption.",
                        "In sodium-ion batteries, the fast surface Faraday reaction is defined as the pseudocapacitance. By fitting the REDOX peaks in CV curves at different scan rate (from 0.2 to 0.5 mV s−1), the pseudocapacitance ratios of the four materials at different scan rate were calculated. It is shown that the ratio of pseudocapacitance increases with the increase of scan rate (Fig. S14 in Supporting Information). To analyze further qualitatively the pseudocapacitive (surface induced pseudocapacitive behavior, k2v) and diffusion (controlled insertion behavior, k1v1/2) effect, the electrochemical reaction process is confirmed as following formula [54], [55].(1)",
                        "i V = k 1 v 1 / 2 + k 2 v(2)",
                        "i V / v 1 / 2 = k 1 + k 2 v 1 / 2where i (mA) illustrates peak current, v (mV s−1) refers to scan rate. K1 and k2 are two fitting constants at each fixed potential. The detailed data of various carbon anodes at 0.2 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 5(a and b), and Fig. S15 in Supporting Information. Both N-ZAHC and ZAHC exhibit high pseudocapacitance ratio, while HC and N-HC have low pseudocapacitance ratio. The pseudocapacitance ratio of N-HC is only 17%. There are many factors affecting pseudocapacitance ratio like specific surface area, O/C ratio, d002 and ID/IG. Low pseudocapacitance ratio of N-HC may be related to its more abundant micropores. In addition, the b value of the four materials are calculated between 0.5–1, which indicates that the combined effect of diffusion control and capacitance control (Fig. 5c).",
                        "In CV curves, HC exhibits poor REDOX peak displacement, and the appearance of a broad peak around 0.5 V means additional side reaction consumption. At the same time, the CV curves show a pair of strong redox peaks near 0 V. The reduction peak near 0 V indicates the sodium-ions intercalate into the graphite layers and closed pores. The oxidation peak at 0.1 V illustrates sodium-ions extracts from graphite layers. It is worth noting that the voltage gap between cathodic and anodic peaks in HC (0.179 V) is higher than that of N-ZAHC (0.054 V), indicating the faster kinetics of N-ZAHC. The voltage gap between cathodic and anodic peaks in N-HC and ZAHC is 0.097 and 0.062 V. However, the ICE of HC is only 38.09%, which proves that the adsorption of large pores is irreversible.",
                        "Through GCD curves at different magnification (Fig. 5d and e, and Fig. S16 in Supporting Information), it can be observed that the capacity attenuation at low current density is mainly in the slope region; that is, the irreversible capacity brought by adsorption accounts for the majority. When the current density is high, the capacity contribution of the slope region occupies more. This may be related to the matching degree between the electron transport rate and sodium ion diffusion rate at large current. At a voltage lower than 0.1 V, the diffusion rate of sodium ions is already very slow, and to achieve a higher insertion capacity, a larger carbon layer spacing and a denser electron cloud arrangement are the most important. In addition, the capacity contribution of the platform can still be improved by modifying the adsorption of sodium ions by micropores. The highest ICE in N-ZAHC demonstrates not only the reduction of side reactions, but also the integrity and structural superiority of SEI generation.",
                        "The electrochemical performance is evaluated by assembling half batteries. Compared with HC (163.7 mAh g−1 at current density of 0.05 A g−1), the capacity of N-ZAHC reaches 401.7 mAh g−1 at current density of 0.05 A g−1 (Fig. 5g). At current density of 3.2 A g−1, N-ZAHC retains a good capacity of 128.2 mAh g−1, and HC just retains a capacity of 34.9 mAh g−1. When the current returns to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity reversibility of N-ZAHC is also very good. Both of ZAHC and N-HC are also tested at the current densities of 0.05 and 2 A g−1 ( Fig. S17 in Supporting Information), and the results showed that N-ZAHC had the better rate capacity. The cycle performance of four carbons is shown in Fig. 5(f and h), and Figs. S18, and S19 in Supporting Information). It is observed that N-ZAHC still has a capacity of 185.7 mAh g−1 at about 500 cycles at 0.4 A g−1, with a capacity decay rate of 0.0946%, while the polarization of HC materials occurs in less than 150 cycles. N-HC and ZAHC exhibit 201.6 and 180.7 mAh g−1 capacities at 0.4 A g−1 current densities. Notably, at the high current density of 2 A g−1, the capacity of each N-ZAHC cycle decreases by about 0.051% after 200 cycles. Compared with other reported plant-based hard carbon materials, the rate performance, ICE and specific capacity of our prepared materials are excellent (Table S2 in Supporting Information).",
                        "To gain further insights into the advantage of N-ZAHC, the proportion of kapok precursor and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid/zinc chloride is discussed. For comparison, the electrochemical performance of N-ZAHC/4, N-ZAHC/2, N-ZAHC/0.5, and N-ZAHC/0.25 are tested, as shown in Figs. S20 and S21 in Supporting Information. When the proportion of kapok is high, the coordination effect of zinc chloride is not complete, the content of N is limited, and the capacity increase is not obvious. When the proportion of kapok reduces, more zinc chloride may interact with the exposed hydroxyl group, thus affecting the cross-linking of carboxyl groups in 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, and ultimately reducing the N content and affecting the capacity. Meanwhile, zinc ion can promote graphitization, and excessive graphitization of carbon layer is not conducive to capacity improvement. With the addition of excessive 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, the final morphology of as-prepared hard carbon may be changed. Therefore, when the mass ratio of kapok, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, and zinc chloride is 1:1:1, N-ZAHC shows good rate performance, especially at low current compared to the other four."

Compared to HC without addition of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and zinc chloride, the capacity increases by about three times. To elucidate the correlation between Na+ ion storage performance and structure characteristic of N-ZAHC anode, the pyrolysis process with the addition of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and zinc chloride are carefully investigated (Fig. 6a).",
                        "In Fig. 6(a–I), carboxyl group on functional group of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid has strong hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group on the cellulose chain in alkalized kapok. If there is no pre-cross-linking process, the beginning pyrolysis processes like plant materials undergo first four processes during pyrolysis [56], [57], are roughly shown in Fig. 6(a–II). First, bigger cellulose macromolecules begin to change from macromolecules to oligosaccharides at around 200 °C. With increase of temperature, oligosaccharides continue to break down and gradually transform into D-glucopyranose. These two processes are not accompanied by the removal of oxygen atoms. However, in the subsequent aromatization process, oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms escape as small molecules (dehydration process). During this process, the carbons at positions 2 and 6 are cross-linked by the removal of oxygen and hydrogen atoms, forming levoglucosan. In step four, the levoglucosan still removes the water molecules and ends up as the levoglucosenone. Finally, levoglucosenone takes shape of biochar network by dehydration, decarboxylation, further aromatization and intramolecular condensation. As a result, a carbon network formed in a non-pre-cross-linked manner will eventually form Fig. 6(a–III), with more heteroatoms escaped.",
                        "It can be seen that dehydration condensation and aromatization are the main reasons for the loss of heteroatoms. When the carboxyl group on the 2,6-pyridine dicarboxylic acid and the hydroxyl group on the cellulose have been cross-linked before carbonization, there are not that large number of bond breaks during the aromatization of monomers condensation (Fig. 6a–IV), and pyridine N can be left in its original form without promoting the formation of graphite N through molecular bond breaks. In addition, zinc ions cooperate with pyridine to play a secondary fixation role, which is also the reason for the large difference in N content between zinc-assisted pyrolysis and non-zinc-assisted pyrolysis. The resulting carbon network is less likely to lose heteroatoms (Fig. 6a–V). The constructed polypyridine N network can greatly increase the defect content and promote the storage site of sodium ions. At the same time, the dense electron cloud can also increase the diffusion rate and reduce the interface impedance.",
                        "Based on above results, the “absorption-insertion/filling” storage mechanism of N-ZAHC has been further investigated, as can be seen in Fig. 6(b). The prominent electrochemical properties of N-ZAHC could be attributed from chemical compatibility between cellulose chain of alkalized kapok and carboxyl group of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid. Firstly, carboxyl group in 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid is pre-cross-linked with the exposed hydroxyl group of alkalized kapok, which is involved in the aromatization process. More heteroatoms can expand the carbon layer spacing, and the catalysis of zinc chloride can optimize the formation of graphite domain size to avoid the insertion behavior evolving into the adsorption of sodium clusters. Secondly, more abundant pyridine N could increase the density of the electron cloud and the concentration of “electron-hole”, benefiting for enhancing the conductivity of N-ZAHC promotes the diffusion of sodium ions during insertion, further improving the rate performance of as-prepared hard material. Finally, zinc ions promote the development of pseudo-graphite domains during the pyrolysis process and optimize the hybrid orbitals of carbon in the material, achieving the uniformly arranged carbon network and the optimized transport path of ions to reduce blocking. Meanwhile, zinc ions also induce the formation of C=O bond and enhance its affinity to electrolyte, further improving the long cycle performance."

                "In conclusion, N-ZAHC has been prepared by the pre-cross-linking, pre-carbonization, and then high-temperature carbonization, combining the compatibility between carboxyl groups of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups of alkalized kapok with assistance of zinc chloride. Additionally, it is found that zinc ion not only promotes the development of graphitization during the pyrolysis process, but also has an induction effect on optimizing the formation of C=O bond in carbon network. Therefore, the optimized kapok derived hard carbon anode material has the feature of a high N content, degree of disorder, and large layer spacing, demonstrating good rate performance and high capacity of 401.7 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1. As being investigated by structure characteristics and electrochemical analysis, the sodium storage capacity of N-ZAHC is attributed to the combination of adsorption-insertion/filling effects. For hard carbon materials derived from plant precursors, the enhanced pre-cross-linking interaction between cellulose chain and dopants to optimize aromatization process by auxiliary pyrolysis provides a new idea for promoting rate performance of plant-based hard carbon materials in sodium-ion batteries."
