                "Sodium has the advantage of being more abundant than lithium. Therefore, sodium-ion batteries (SIB) have attracted attention as next-generation secondary batteries to replace lithium-ion batteries (LIB). NaNixFeyMnzO2 (x + y + z = 1), an O3-type sodium-based layered cathode material, is considered a promising cathode material because sodium can occupy a significant portion of the O3-type structure. However, the rate capability, cycle life, and capacity reduction are obstacles to actual application because of the low Na-ion conductivity caused by the O3-type sodium structure characteristics and inherent moisture vulnerability. In this study, a simple ethanol-based precursor pre-coating process using a fast Na-ion conductive material was designed to effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the cathode material. Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with a NASICON structure, a high-ion-conductivity phosphate-based solid electrolyte, was used as the coating material. In addition, a uniform coating layer was formed on the surface of the cathode using polyacrylic acid, a polymer material with a driving force for the coating precursor."

                "The consumption of fossil fuels has continued to increase owing to increasing global energy demand, resulting in problems caused by the increase in greenhouse gases. Developing green and renewable energy resources is necessary to solve environmental problems such as carbon emissions [1]. Solar, wind, and hydro energy sources can meet most of the energy demands as energy sources that can replace existing fossil fuels; however, there are climate-specific differences in production capacity and geographical limitations when installing facilities. Therefore, practical applications are limited, and energy use in all places cannot be equally applied. Recently, Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) have attracted increasing attention as strategies for solving global warming issues, and Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted much attention because of their high energy density and excellent cycle life [2]. However, it acts as a problem in terms of the supply of LIBs owing to resource limitations and price problems caused by the geopolitical issues of Li.",
                "In this regard, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a powerful alternative to solve the geopolitical resource problems of LIB because of the abundance of sodium on Earth, which is 1000 times greater than that of lithium. In addition, because SIB are similar to the production process of existing LIB, mass production of SIB can be achieved through existing facilities [3,4]. Various materials such as layered oxides and polyanion materials have been proposed as host materials for SIB cathodes. Among the proposed cathode active materials, Na-based layered oxides are highly similar to lithium-based layered oxides, so they have practical applicability in battery industries. Na-layered oxides have O3-type and P2-type, corresponding to octahedral (O) and trigonal prismatic (P) sites, depending on the occupation of Na+ ions. In addition, “2” and “3” mean the repetition of transition metal layers in stacking units [5]. Among them, the O3-type has a structure of NaxTMO2 (0.7 < x ≤ 1), and the theoretical energy density is higher than that of NaxTMO2 (x ≤ 0.7) of the P2-type. In addition, as the O3-type is in a Na-efficient environment, the amount of sodium available is higher than that of the P2-type [6,7]. A representative material exists among the O3-type NaxTMO2, such as NaNixFeyMnzO2 (x + y + z = 1) and NaNixCoyMnzO2 (x + y + z = 1). Although Fe does not participate in the electrochemical reaction in the layered structures of LIB, it does participate in SIB. Therefore, Fe can also play the role of Co in layered structure of LIB [8]. However, in NNFM, like other materials with the O3 structure, Na ions in the octahedral site must overcome the high energy barrier caused by interstitial tetrahedral sites during intercalation/deintercalation reactions. This phenomenon results in a lower Na ion mobility than the P2-type, despite the advantages mentioned above [9]. In addition, O3-type sodium layered oxides, including NNFM, have highly reactive Na within the material that can easily react with moisture. Consequently, when exposed to moisture, the internal Na within the material can migrate to the surface of the active material, inducing surface hydration [10]. Manthiram et al. found that Na2CO3, and Na2CO3",
                "∙H2O, NaOH were formed on the surface of the cathode during the humid air exposure of NaNi0.7Co0.15Mn0.15O2, and thus conducted a study on the degradation of the electrochemical performance [11].",
                "Various strategies such as doping [8,[12], [13], [14]] and surface coating [[15], [16], [17]], have been proposed to solve these problems. Doping strategies can enhance the performance and stability of a material by modifying the interlayer distance via the incorporation of dopant atoms. However, impurities generated at the material surface due to reactions with moisture and the electrode material remain a challenging problem. From this perspective, coating strategies that directly prevent moisture contact on particle surfaces are considered effective solutions for addressing side reactions. Coating materials, such as TiO2 [17], Al2O3 [18], and MgO [19] have been studied. However, these “non‑sodium-containing” coating materials have relatively low Na-ion and electronic conductivities. Furthermore, these “non‑sodium-containing” coating materials increase the charge transfer resistance at the surface/interface between the cathode material and coating layer.",
                "One possible solution to these issues is the use of Na-containing solid electrolytes. Na-containing solid electrolyte candidates are frequently regarded as potential coating layers owing to their high Na-ion conductivity. Oxide-based candidates include Na2O, Na4Zr2(SiO4)3, and Na4SiO4, while polyanion-based candidates include Na3PO4, NaTi2(PO4)3, and Na3Zr2Si2PO12. [[20], [21], [22]]. For coating materials with complex compositions (e.g., Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and NaTi2(PO4)3), precise coating processes are required to form a uniform coating layer. Two methods have been reported for the coating process. The post-coating process involves synthesizing the cathode material as a sodium-containing material and then separately depositing the coating material onto the surface of the cathode material.",
                "In contrast, the Pre-coating process entails adhering the “non‑sodium-containing” coating precursor on the “non‑sodium-containing” cathode precursor and then introducing the sodium source to generate both the coating material and the cathode material together in a single calcination process. Compared to the post-coating process, which requires additional steps for the final product containing sodium, the pre-coating process has advantages in terms of the processing conditions because it forms the desired state of the coating material and core material simultaneously without any risk of damage caused by solvent reactions or atmospheric reactions. However, despite these advantages of the pre-coating process, the uniform arrangement of the coating material on the surface of the active material can be challenging because of the absence of a driving force, resulting in the formation of an island-type coating layer instead of a layered shape. Furthermore, when adopting materials containing multiple ions, such as Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na4Zr2(SiO4)3 as coating layers, it is difficult for the ions to be uniformly positioned on the particle surface, resulting in a low probability of forming a single phase. From this perspective, polymeric surfactants that interact with coating sources have been reported to form a more uniform coating layer than conventional coating methods. Choi et al. utilized polydopamine to pre-coat LNCM [23,24] and conducted a pre-coating of LNMO using PDADMAC [25]. However, the preceding surfactants primarily considered interactions with only one type of coating source, either cationic or anionic, and did not consider interactions that simultaneously attract both cationic and anionic sources.",
                "To enhance these methods, we employed a pre-coating method using polyacrylic acid (PAA), which interacts with cationic and anionic sources. This method involves coating cationic and anionic sources onto NFMC2O4(Ni0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33C2O4) and mixing it with a sodium source to simultaneously form the sodium-containing core and coating material during the one-step calcination process. Our coating method utilized two functions of PAA: first, by utilizing the carboxyl group of PAA for interaction with cationic metal sources, and second, by utilizing the water absorption property of PAA for interaction with anionic sources. [26,27] Notably, during the coating process, “the non‑sodium-containing” NFMC2O4 surface was coated with the “non‑sodium-containing” ZSP material (containing Zr, Si, P), followed by drying to remove all moisture. Then, the precoating method was adopted by mixing the sodium source with the solid state. The moisture-absorbing properties of PAA cause water to adhere to the surface, which is subsequently eliminated through a drying process, preventing any reaction between sodium and water upon dry mixing. Following dry mixing, a single high-temperature calcination process successfully formed the cathode material and sodium-containing coating material.",
                "In summary, a stable and highly Na-ion conductive coating layer, which is moisture stable, was successfully formed on the surface of NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2 (NNFM) without the influence of air and H2O, using the pre-coating method. Additionally, uniform coating layers with complex compositions of coating materials were successfully created through interactions using the PAA coating method. Moreover, after the successful formation of the coating layer, the rate capability and moisture/air stability of the layered sodium cathode material were effectively improved through sodium ion-conductive coating layer."

                "We coated the complex Na-containing materials with PAA. Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) was selected as the coating material because it has the structure of NASICON, a polyanion-based material containing Na and phosphate, making it a representative candidate for the solid electrolyte of SIB owing to its high sodium ion conductivity and structural stability. In addition, NASICON materials have excellent structural and moisture stability according to reports. [28] Furthermore, a coating layer containing phosphate can protect the cathode from humid air on the surface, as reported in previous studies. [10] The left side of the illustration in Fig. 1 shows the precoating process of the NNFM precursor using PAA. It has been reported that PAA can be uniformly coated on the surface of the particle in an ethanol solution [[29], [30], [31]]. The principle of PAA coating on the particle surface is the existence of active oxygen that can bind to the carboxyl group of PAA among the oxygen on the surface of the particle to be coated in the ethanol solution [[29], [30], [31]]. Active oxygen appeared mainly on the surfaces of the oxygen-containing particles. Using this property, PAA was uniformly coated on the surface of the NNFM precursor. In addition, it has been reported that the carboxylic acid of PAA can bind metal alkoxides [32]. The right side of Fig. 1 shows the deterioration process of NNFM, which is vulnerable to moisture. Also, it was also shown that the water stability of the NZSP-coated NNFM improved. As mentioned above, O3-type layered oxide has a problem in that performance deterioration occurs in a humid environment or an environment exposed to H2O because it has a property that is vulnerable to air and moisture [33]. We minimized the possibility of material deterioration during the coating process by the precoating process before calcination. After calcination, the NZSP coating layer was successfully formed on the surface of the material at the same time as the formation of NNFM, resulting in a moisture-stable and fast ionic conductive sodium cathode material. Subsequently, the coated NFM precursor and Na2CO3 were dry-mixed to execute a one-step calcination process in which the core material and coating material were simultaneously formed during calcination. Notably, the water vulnerability problem of sodium did not appear in the coating process because the Na source was added after the pre-coating process was executed on the precursor without Na. When the 900 °C calcination process is performed, the NFM precursor was changed to NNFM, and the ZSP coating precursor was changed to the NZSP coating layer. In addition, because the PAA coating layer is completely thermally decomposed during high-temperature calcination in an air atmosphere, no PAA residue remains after calcination [34]. Therefore, the final product obtained through calcination consists of a core material of NNFM and a uniform NZSP coating layer.",
                "A simple experiment added Zirconium isopropoxide and TEOS (Tetraethyl orthosilicate) were added to an ethanol anhydrous solution, and PAA was added. Consequently, the transparent solution became cloudy. It was confirmed that a reaction between PAA and the metal source occurred. (Fig. S1(a)) Also several studies have reported that PAA has water absorption properties [26,27]. All these principles were combined to design the coating process. First, PAA was attached to the surface of the NFM precursor via a carboxyl group. Second, PAA attached to the surface of the NFM precursor reacted with the metal alkoxide. Finally, because ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, used as a phosphate source, was dissolved in H2O, the phosphate source could be attached close to the surface of the NFM precursor based on the water absorption properties of PAA. To confirm the reaction between PAA and Zr/Si alkoxides, FT-IR analysis was conducted. (Fig. 2) PAA was dissolved in ethanol for measurement, and a peak related to carboxylic acid was observed at 1710 cm −1 [35]. Additionally, peaks related to ethanol, which was used as the solvent, were also observed [36]. Additional experiments were conducted by adding Zr and Si alkoxides to an ethanol-based solution of dissolved PAA. As a result, it was confirmed that the Zr-O-Si peak near 900 cm −1 [37] appeared and the peak corresponding to Si-O-Si at 1093 cm −1 increased [37]. And the peak intensity at 1720 cm −1, corresponding to the carboxylic acid peak, was decreased. This indicates the reaction between the carboxylic acid groups of PAA and Zr/Si alkoxides, leading to a reduction in the peak intensity of carboxylic acid [38]. Based on these results, it directly confirms that the carboxylic acid of PAA and Si, Zr alkoxides successfully react in an ethanol environment. Fig. S1(b) shows a picture of the gelation process using the water absorption properties of the PAA. Subsequently, the coated NFM precursor and Na2CO3 were dry-mixed to execute a one-step calcination process in which the core material and coating material were simultaneously formed during calcination. Notably, the water vulnerability problem of sodium did not appear in the coating process because the Na source was added after the pre-coating process was executed on the precursor without Na.

                "3 ¯m space group (PDF#25–0819) having the structure of α-NaFeO2 [40]. In addition, no diffraction peaks were found for any other impurities in the XRD data, indicating that the coating process of NZSP through PAA did not affect the NNFM structure. In an additional experiment, a coating process using PAA was used to synthesize NASICON-structured NZSP materials. The NZSP single phase material was synthesized through the same experiment using PAA without the NFM precursor, and it was confirmed that the monoclinic structure of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (PDF# 01–084-1200) was well formed. Moreover, because the impurity phase of ZrO2 did not appear at 28.3 and 31.5°, it means that the NZSP single material with high purity was well formed during the formation process of the NZSP material using PAA [39]. To confirm that the NZSP coating layer was well formed on the surface of the NNFM cathode material, XRD measurements were conducted on the sample calcined at 2, 5 and 20 wt% NZSP coating using PAA was performed on the surface of the NFM precursor. In the 2 wt% coating sample (NZSP-2) and 5 wt% coating sample (NZSP-5), a characteristic peak for NZSP did not appear, but when the coating content was increased to 20 wt% (NZSP-20), an XRD peak for NZSP of the NASICON structure appeared. This is because, in the case of a relatively low coating content of NZSP-2 and NZSP-5 sample, the intensity of the XRD peak for the coating layer was low, so the NZSP peak did not appear, and when the coating content was increased to 20 wt%, the XRD peak intensity of the coating layer increased. Therefore, it was assumed that an NZSP peak appeared [23]. As a result, it was confirmed that the NZSP coating could be effectively carried out without damaging the crystalline phase of the NNFM core material, even when 20 wt% excess coating process, and it also could be inferred that the wet coating process using PAA did not affect the crystal structure of the core material.",
                "SEM and TEM analyses were performed to confirm the morphology of the Pristine NNFM and NZSP-x and the physical properties of the coating layer on the surface. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The results of the SEM images are shown in Fig. 4(a)-(c), showing pristine NNFM, NZSP-2 and NZSP-5. The primary particle size of each sample was submicron (500 nm ∼ 1um). Because there was no difference in morphology between the two samples, it was judged that the NNFM was not affected by the coating process [23]. TEM images are shown in Fig. 4(d)-(g) to demonstrate the presence of coating materials on the surface of NNFM. Fig. 4(d) shows an HR-TEM image of the NZSP-2 sample with 2 wt% NZSP coating. The thickness of the NZSP coating layer attached to the NNFM surface was 2–3 nm, despite the small amount of coating, it was visually confirmed that a thin and uniform coating layer was formed in a good condition to the NNFM surface by the PAA coating process. Additional HR-TEM analysis of the NZSP-x sample in Fig. 4(d)-(e) confirmed the lattice structure of the coating layer. Analysis of the d-spacing on the coating surface revealed that the lattice spacing was 0.195 nm, corresponding to the (620) plane, which means that the NASICON-structured NZSP was well formed. Additionally, the FFT of the TEM image for the NZSP-5 coating layer is shown in Fig. 4(f), and it was confirmed that the (−331), (111), and (620) planes exist in the coating layer. Furthermore, the comparative interplanar spacing data from the XRD peaks of the NZSP and FFT of TEM images are presented in Table S3. This corresponds to the main plane of the monoclinic NZSP. (PDF# 01–084-1200) The PAA layer was not found separately because thermal decomposition occurred during the calcination process in an air atmosphere, and because no other layer or space existed at the interface between the coating layer and the NFM it was confirmed that the NZSP layer was successfully formed during the coating process using PAA. Fig. 4(g) shows the elemental mapping image of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for the NZSP-5 sample. The EDS mapping image confirms that Ni, Fe, and Mn, which are NFM elements, are uniformly distributed in the particles (Fig. S3). In addition, Zr, Si, and P were uniformly distributed on the particle surface (Fig. 4g), indicating that the NZSP coating elements were uniformly distributed on the surface. XPS analysis of Fig. S4 was performed to confirm that the NZSP coating layer was effectively formed on the NNFM surface. Ni 2p3/2 at 854.5 eV, which is the peak of the material corresponding to the core, corresponds to Ni2+ [41], and Fe 2p3/2 at 710.8 eV represents Fe3+ [41] and, Mn 2p3/2 at 642.1 eV represents Mn4+ [41]. The binding energy signal at ∼102.45 eV, which is a signal corresponding to the coating material, corresponds to the oxidation state of 4+ of Si and indicates the presence of SiO44− [39,42]. Binding energies at ∼185 eV and ∼ 182.5 eV indicate the presence of Zr4+ ions [42], The binding energy appears at ∼133.5 eV, which indicates the presence of PO43− [42]. Furthermore, the surface atomic concentration (%) of pristine NNFM and NZSP-x, determined from XPS survey scans, is presented in Table S4. By analyzing the binding energy of each element, it was confirmed that the NASICON-type NZSP coating layer was well formed through a synthesis method using PAA [20,41]. The results of the XPS survey of the coating samples are shown in Fig. S4(g). Consequently, the analysis of XRD and TEM confirmed the presence of the main plane of NZSP on the surface of NNFM. Also, based on XPS analyses data concerning chemical bonding, oxidation states, and surface atomic concentration of elements within the NZSP coating layer, it can be concluded that the NZSP coating layer is present on the surface of NNFM.",
                "To confirm the effect of the coating material on the electrochemical performance and the difference in the electrochemical performance, electrochemical tests for the NZSP-2,5 sample were conducted through a coin-type Na half-cell. Fig. 5(a) shows the first charge-discharge voltage profile for pristine NNFM and NZSP-x samples at 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) and 0.1C rate room temperature (25 °C). The capacities of the pristine sample and each coating sample in the 0.1C first cycle are as follows: (charge/discharge capacity of pristine NNFM: 136.03 / 130.52 mAhg−1, NZSP-2: 134.83 / 128.09 mAhg−1, NZSP-5: 130.21 / 125.02 mAhg−1) The discharge capacity in the first cycle decreased as the coating content increased. This is because the ratio of the total NNFM decreases as the coating layer increases, and the NZSP coating layer does not participate in the electrochemical reaction, similar to solid electrolyte candidates with Li-ion conductivity [23]. In general, the diffusion path is expected to increase as the coating layer becomes thicker, similar to the coating material in the LIB cathode [24]. The Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the NNFM cathode was expressed as a percentage of the discharge capacity/charge capacity. The initial CEs for pristine NNFM, NZSP-2, and NZSP-5 were 92.27, 94.57, and 93.75%, respectively. The low CE of the first cycle is caused by the formation of an irreversible solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the NNFM surface [43]. Interestingly, the CE slightly increased compared with that of the pristine material when the coating material was included. Because the coating layer is already formed in the initial cycle, NZSP-2, 5 samples are expected to increase the structural stability of the cathode NNFM surface, and because Na-ion consumption is reduced, the initial CE of NZSP-x is expected to increase compared to pristine NNFM. Fig. 5(b) shows the cycle data of pristine NNFM and NZSP-2,5 at 1C rate and 150 cycles. Pristine NNFM showed a retention value of only 37.95% with an initial discharge capacity of 112.75 mAhg−1, a discharge capacity of 42.79 mAhg−1 after 150 cycles at 1C. On the other hand, NZSP-2 has a retention value of 71.32% with an initial discharge capacity of 121.94 mAhg−1, a discharge capacity of 86.97 mAhg−1 after 150 cycles, and NZSP-5 has a retention value of 71.92% with an initial discharge capacity of 114.13 mAhg−1, and a discharge capacity of 80.95 mAhg−1 after 150 cycles, which is better than pristine NNFM. In addition, comparative data between previous studies involving surface coating on the same core material, NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2, was included in Table S5. To examine the morphology of pristine NNFM and NZSP-x before and after 150 cycles, SEM analysis was conducted and presented in Fig. S5. The analysis did not reveal significant differences between pristine NNFM and NZSP-x. Both electrodes exhibited similar feature and morphology, indicating that NZSP coating layer did not experience any negative or side effect during the electrochemical evaluation. Both NZSP-2 and NZSP-5 showed superior retention values compared to pristine NNFM. In addition, the retention values in NZSP-2 and NZSP-5 were nearly identical (NZSP-2: 71.32%, NZSP-5: 71.92%), but NZSP-2 exhibited superior initial capacity compared to NZSP-5. The reason for the improved cycling performance by coating is that the NZSP coating layer acts as an artificial SEI layer, which can suppress the surface degradation mechanism at the material surface through stable interfacial reactions [24].",
                "Fig. 6(a)-(f) were obtained to confirm the performance of each sample on the capacity and voltage fading over the cycle and the corresponding decrease in energy density. Fig. 6(a) shows the cycle graph of the energy density of the Pristine NNFM and NZSP-2 samples at 1C. NZSP-2 showed better retention than pristine NNFM in terms of energy density related to voltage decay and discharge capacity. (Pristine NNFM 100th retention: 46.6%, NZSP-2100th retention: 75.5%) Average charge, discharge voltage, and dQ/dV were measured for additional analysis of the correlation between energy density and voltage decay during the cycle. Fig. 6(b) shows the average charge and discharge voltages for 100 cycles at 1C-rate for the pristine NNFM and NZSP-2 cathodes. In pristine NNFM, the average charge voltage increased by 0.44 V from 1st cycle 3.25 V to 100th cycle 3.69 V, and the average discharge voltage decreased by 0.33 V from 1st cycle 3.08 V to 100th cycle 2.75 V.(100th average charge-discharge voltage of Pristine NNFM:0.94 V) The reason why the difference between the average charging voltage and the discharging voltage increases as the cycle continues is that the resistance inside the cathode increases as the cycle continues [44]. On the other hand, in NZSP-2, the average charge voltage increased by 0.09 V from 1st cycle 3.37 V to 100th cycle 3.46 V, and the average discharge voltage decreased by 0.08 V from 1st cycle 3.11 V to 100th cycle 3.03 V. (100th average charge-discharge voltage of NZSP-2:0.43 V) This means that the NZSP-2 sample has higher stability in terms of voltage decay over cycles than pristine NNFM. The charge-discharge graph, which can check the voltage decay according to the cycle of each sample in more detail, is shown in Fig. 6(c), (d). Each graph represents the 1st, 10th, 50th, and 100th charge and discharge graphs at 1C for the Pristine NNFM and NZSP-2. In each 1st cycle of Fig. 6(c)-(d), a small plateau appeared at 2.6 V, and this small plateau gradually disappeared within 10 cycles. The occurrence of this phenomenon is possibly due to the extraction of Na+ ion from the layered structure during the initial charging process, which induces the temporary gliding of the oxygen planes during initial charge process [45,46]. In Pristine NNFM, the voltage decay increased as the cycle progressed, whereas in NZSP-2, the voltage decay was relatively smaller than that of Pristine NNFM. The cause of the voltage decay is the structural collapse caused by the phase change of the NNFM during the charging and discharging process [47]. Fig. 6(e), (f) show the dQ/dV plots for the 1st, 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th cycles for Pristine NNFM and NZSP-2. The potential shift and area reduction were more severe in pristine NNFM than in NZSP-2. The causes of the potential shift and area reduction are the occurrence of overpotential and increase in capacity fading, respectively [48]. As a result, it was confirmed that the increase in resistance inside the cathode could be effectively suppressed owing to the coating of NZSP, and the core material NNFM could be effectively protected from side reactions with the electrolyte and structural collapse.",
                "Fig. 7(a) shows the 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, 5 10C rate test results at 2.0–4.0 V for a pristine sample and NZSP-x. As the C-rate increased, Na-ion intercalation-deintercalation occurred in a shorter time. If the Na-ion de-intercalation reaction occurs quickly, the polarization phenomenon appears in the cathode material; therefore, the discharge capacity decrease in the Pristine NNFM and NZSP-x samples. Comparing the rate capabilities of Pristine NNFM and NZSP-x, the difference in discharge capacity between Pristine NNFM and NZSP-x increased as the C-rate increased. In detail, the discharge capacity of pristine NNFM at 10C was maintained at 62.11% compared to the discharge capacity at 0.1C, while NZSP-2 maintained 71.72% and NZSP-5 maintained 70.20%. As a result, it can be confirmed that the rate capability is improved compared to that of Pristine NNFM in the sample coated with NZSP. This is because Na-ion diffusivity can be improved by the presence of an NZSP coating layer [20]. Based on the cycle and rate performance results, it was concluded that the NZSP-2 sample was the most suitable coating sample. Additionally, changes in the electrochemical resistance due to cathode surface modification using NZSP were confirmed through EIS data. Fig. 7(b)-(c) shows the Nyquist plots for pristine NNFM and NZSP-2 before and after the 100th cycle. The EIS results were fitted with the model proposed in the graphs of Fig. 7(b)-(c). At high frequencies, the starting point of the first semicircle on the x-axis is related to Rs, which represents the ohmic resistance of the system, that is, the resistance between the electrode and electrolyte. The first semicircle is related to RSEI, which represents the resistance of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The second semicircle is related to Rct, representing the charge-transfer resistance. Finally, the oblique line in the low-frequency region is related to Zw, which represents the Warburg resistance corresponding to the mass transfer resistance related to Na ion diffusion. Before the cycle, both the Pristine NNFM and the NZSP-2 samples showed similar values; however, after the cycle, the increase in resistance in the NZSP-2 sample was less than that of the pristine NNFM. (Table. S6) Additionally, unlike the coating layer that does not contain Na, the NZSP coating layer has a pathway with Na ion conductivity. To confirm that the NZSP coating layer can substantially improve the Na-ion diffusivity of the cathode material, GITT tests were conducted on pristine NNFM and NZSP-2. The counter and reference electrodes were composed of metallic sodium, and the working electrodes were composed of pristine NNFM and NZSP-2, respectively, to conduct the test. Through this measurement, information regarding the thermodynamics of the cathode material can be obtained. More details of the GITT measurements are presented in Fig. S6 ∼ 7. The results of measuring the",

                "D Na + value of NZSP-2 was higher than that of Pristine NNFM. This indicates that the NZSP coating layer improved the Na-ion conductivity on the surface of the NNFM. Consequently, it was confirmed that the uniform NZSP coating layer played a significant role in the fast Na-ion diffusion pathway.",
                "The layered sodium cathode material has hygroscopic properties in the air- and moisture-exposed conditions, so it is vulnerable to air and moisture and causes storage instability. NZSP materials are highly stable in air and moist environments [49,50]. In a humid atmosphere, the hydrophilic surface of sodium layered oxide exhibits a strong tendency to absorb H2O molecules. The chemical reaction between sodium layered oxide and water molecules generates a hydration phase, which can be represented by the following reaction. [51]:(1)",
                "z H 2 O + Na x TM O 2 = Na x − z H z TM O 2 + zNaOHwithoutCO 2",
                "If CO2 is present in the environment, impurities such as NaOH, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3 appear on the material surface through the following reactions. [51]:(2)",
                "z CO 2 + z H 2 O + 2 Na x TM O 2 = 2 Na x − z H z TM O 2 + z Na 2 CO 3(3)",
                "z CO 2 + z H 2 O + Na x TM O 2 = Na x − z H z TM O 2 + zNaH CO 3",
                "The impurities of NaOH, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3 increase the resistance component of the cell due to their insulating nature. Furthermore, if sodium in the cathode material layer leaks out, it can cause the structural collapse of the cathode material and lead to a decrease in capacity due to the loss of sodium and structural instability. Coating the surface with NZSP, a polyanionic phosphate material with high structural stability, can decrease the contact area between H2O and the cathode surface, leading to improved moisture stability of the material. Another benefit of coating the cathode surface with NZSP, a sodium-ion conducting material, is that it can contribute to the improvement of the electrochemical performance of the material at the interface. (see Fig. 7.) To confirm that the NZSP-2 sample is resistant to air and moisture, a cycle test was conducted after exposing the pristine NNFM and NZSP-2 samples to water for 1 h. (Fig. 8(c)) The first discharge capacity of pristine NNFM at 1C-rate before water storage is 113.75 mAhg−1, and the first discharge capacity after water storage is 39.20 mAhg−1, showing 34.4% of capacity retention. On the other hand, the NZSP-2 sample, shows higher capacity retention (69.7%) than the pristine sample, from 122.56 mAhg−1 before water storage to 84.18 mAhg−1 after water storage. The casting results for each sample exposed to water are also shown in Fig. 8(a)-(b). The NZSP-2 sample was well cast even after exposure to water; however, in the case of Pristine NNFM, the electrode material was separated from the current collector after the casting process. (The drying time for each sample was the same.) This phenomenon can be attributed to the migration of Na ions from the interior of the NNFM layer to the surface of the material after moisture storage, which leads to the formation of alkaline products upon reaction with H2O and CO2, such as NaOH and Na2CO3, inducing slurry gelation [52]. Therefore, after additional drying of the pristine NNFM, electrochemical data were obtained by casting. The results of the 1C cycle test after 14 days of exposure to confirm the air stability are shown in Fig. S8, and it was confirmed that the NZSP-2 sample exhibited better performance than the pristine NNFM before and after air exposure. (NZSP-2: 74.06%, Pristine NNFM: 41.21%).",
                "To confirm how moisture affects NNFM, additional XRD analysis using each sample was performed and shown in Fig. 9(a). After moisture exposure, a new peak appeared in the XRD pattern of the pristine NNFM. The new peak at 14.5° represents a water insertion peak in the layered material, indicating c lattice expansion [11]. In contrast, no additional XRD peaks appeared in the NZSP-2 sample. As mentioned above (see Fig. 4), it can be inferred that the insertion of water into the cathode NNFM is partially protected by the uniform NZSP coating layer. The XPS data for each sample tested under moisture exposure are shown in Fig. 9(b). After exposure to water, Na2CO3 (289 eV) and NaHCO3 (286 eV) peaks were observed for each sample. This is because NNFM reacts with water to form NaOH on the surface of NNFM after sodium in the bulk of NNFM is extracted to the outside and then reacts with CO2 in the air to exist as NaHCO3 and Na2CO3. [50] Pristine NNFM exhibited a large Na2CO3 peak (288.58 eV) after the moisture exposure test (40.13%), whereas NZSP-2 exhibited a relatively small Na2CO3 peak (13.68%) after the moisture exposure test. Summarizing the results, it can be said that the NZSP coating effectively improved the moisture stability of NNFM. We also performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements to compare the thermal stabilities of the NZSP coating samples and pristine NNFM before and after moisture exposure. Fig. 9(c) shows the DSC results for Pristine NNFM and NZSP-2, in which a certain amount of electrolyte was injected after charging each sample to 4.0 V before and after water storage. Components such as carbon black and PVDF do not show a peak before 300 °C in the presence of electrolytes. On the other hand, electrolyte and cathode materials do not have relatively high thermal stability, and additional peaks may appear in environments where they exist together. [53]. The heat emitted by pristine NNFM before water storage was 424.78 J/g with an exothermic peak at 280.33 °C, whereas the heat emitted by NZSP-2 was 298.63 J/g with an exothermic peak at 300.11 °C. After water storage, the heat emitted by Pristine NNFM was 795.16 J/g with an exothermic peak at 252.31 °C, whereas the heat emitted by NZSP-2 was 510.21 J/g with an exothermic peak at 275.2 °C. Thus, NZSP-2 has higher thermal stability than the pristine sample, even after water storage. The DSC results indicate that NZSP-2 has a more stable structure than pristine NNFM both before and after moisture storage, and that thermal and moisture stability are improved by the NZSP coating."

                "We successfully formed a NZSP coating layer on a Na-layered oxide surface using PAA. Zr and Si, cationic metal sources, were placed on the surface of the NNFM using the carboxylic acid group of PAA. In addition, phosphate was successfully placed on the surface of NNFM through gelation using the H2O absorption property of PAA, and the coating precursor was successfully coated on the surface of the NFM precursor. Subsequently, after adding the sodium source to the NNFM, the core and shell materials were successfully formed simultaneously through a one-step high-temperature calcination process without any additional calcination process. Through SEM, TEM, and XRD analyses, it was confirmed that a thin and uniform coating layer with a thickness of 2–5 nm was effectively formed without interfering with the formation of the Na-layered oxide, and the rate capability of the cathode could be improved through the uniform NZSP coating layer. Specifically, it was confirmed that the NZSP coating layer effectively suppresses voltage polarization, and as a result, it was also confirmed that the cyclability of the cathode was improved. In addition, the Na-ion diffusivity was successfully improved through the NZSP coating strategy and as a result rate capability could be improved. Through cycle tests and XRD, XPS, and DSC analyses in a moisture- and air-exposed environment, it was confirmed that the moisture and air stability of NZSP-coated NNFM effectively increased compared to pristine NNFM. An air- and moisture-stable NZSP protective layer was successfully formed on the surface of the NNFM cathode with low moisture and air stability using a simple coating method with PAA. Thus, it was possible to effectively protect NNFM from air and moisture. Additionally, as a future plan, we pursuit the further development of cathode materials which is suitable for the full cell in SIB."
