                "Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are regarded as one of the ideal anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacity and strong electrochemical activity; nonetheless, it still faces challenges such as large volume variation and low conductivity during chemical reactions for applications. Herein, the nanocubes of carbon-encapsulated NiS2/CoS2 embedded porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrixes (NiS2/CoS2@NC@C) are synthesized as a high-performance anode by in-situ carbonizing and subsequently sulphurating the resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF)-coated Ni-Co-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The RF-derived carbon shell acts as a rigid skeleton to effectively relieve the bulk stress during charging and discharging for ensuring the structure integrity, while the porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix improves the electronic conductivity, presents rich channels for ion/electron transfer and inhibits the agglomeration of active material during chemical reaction. In addition, the lattice distortion at the heterogeneous interface of the NiS2/CoS2 allows the redistribution of electrons, promoting the chemical reaction kinetics. Consequently, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocubes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties: a high discharge capacity of 489.9 mA h g−1 after 170 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 (920.6/807.9 mA h g−1 for the initial discharge/charge capacity with the initial coulomb efficiency of 87.7%) and a discharge capacity of 349.7 mA h g−1 with the CE close to 100.0% at 5.0 A g−1 even after 2000 cycles. This study proposes a viable approach for the effective construction of advanced anodes with unique micromorphology and chemical composition based on bimetallic PBAs for SIBs.",

                "In recent years, the high energy density and long cycle life of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have made them a popular choice for commercial energy storage devices , , , . However, the scarcity and geographically uneven dispersion of lithium resources hinder the further sustainable development of LIBs for large-scale energy storage , , , . Hence, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged with the times as the most promising alternative to LIBs owing to the advantages of abundant sodium resources, low cost and high redox potential (-2.70 V vs SHE) . Unfortunately, most of the anodes for SIBs generally exhibit slow reaction kinetics and severe volume changes during charging and discharging due to much larger ionic radius (1.02 vs 0.76 Å) and molar mass (22.99 vs 6.94 g mol−1) of sodium than lithium , , , leading to weak electrochemical activity and poor structural stability. Obviously, designing anodes with large capacity and extended cycle life is crucial to the successful development of SIBs.",
                "Among various anodes for SIBs, conversion-type transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have received extensive attention due to their high theoretical capacities . Specially, cobalt sulfide (CoS2) has been perceived as a promising anode owing to its much higher theoretical capacity (872 mA h g−1) than other sulfides . However, the CoS2-based anodes still face challenges of poor conductivity, slow ion diffusion kinetics and poor structure stability, inevitably leading to large discrepancies between actual capacity and theoretical value . Several effective strategies such as compounding with carbon materials , , and micro-nanostructure construction [ , ] have been adopted to solve the above problems. For example, Li et al. developed a low-cost and simple method to prepare NC@CoS2@CNTs, exhibiting distinguished sodium storage performance (discharging capacity of 349.0 mA h g−1 for 1000 cycles at 3.0 A g−1) , while Zhao et al. generated CoS2@C hollow nanocubes by carbon coating and sulfuration process, exhibiting exceptional cycling performance as the anode for SIBs (discharge capacity of 367.6 mA h g−1 for 200 cycles at 5 A g−1) . On the flip side, it has been known that the formation of heterogeneous interfaces among active materials can induce charge redistribution, thereby facilitating ion/electron transport , , . For example, Sui et al. synthesized the heterojunction of OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO composite with sandwich structure, delivering 161 mA h g−1 after 3500 cycles at 1 A g−1 . However, achieving high-redox activity and long-life anodes using a single metal sulfide is a challenging task.",
                "Herein, we have developed carbon-coated NiS2/CoS2 embedded porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanocubes (NiS2/CoS2@NC@C) using Ni-Co Prussian blue analogues (Ni-Co PBAs) as the precursor. The NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocubes synthesized in the present work possess several advantages as the high-performance anode for SIBs: (1) the distortion of the lattices and redistribution of charges at the heterogeneous interface between NiS2 and CoS2 promote the chemical reaction kinetics , , ; (2) the RF-derived rigid carbon skeleton can effectively buffer the volume stress during high-temperature synthesis and prevent the material from structural collapse; (3) the doping of N into carbon materials can provide more free electrons and improve the conductivity of the material; (4) and the highly porous carbon ensures the complete contact between the active material and the electrolyte and offers space for accommodating the volume change during charging/discharging. Building upon the aforementioned advantages, the as-synthesized NiS2/CoS2@NC@C exhibits a high discharge capacity of 489.9 mA h g−1 after 170 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 and provides extraordinary long-cycle performance with a reversible capacity of 349.7 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles, with the CE close to 100.0%."

                "Fig. 1 depicts the fabrication process of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocubes. First of all, the Ni-Co-PBA is prepared by the well-organized complexation of Co[(CN)6]3- anion and Ni2+ cation with the aid of an aqueous solution of trisodium citrate dihydrate. From Fig. S1, the Ni-Co-PBA has been successfully synthesized with good crystallinity, exhibiting a regular cube topography with a particle size of approximately 300 nm (Fig. S2). Then, in situ polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) is performed to realize a homogeneous coating on the surface of the nanocubes. In this case, the Ni-Co-PBA@RF possesses a relatively rough surface (Fig. S3). Through the sequential annealing of carbonization and sulfuration, the Co and Ni atoms of the Ni-Co-PBA are well dispersed in the nanocubes and then vulcanized to obtain the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C.",
                "Fig. 2 displays the morphology and microstructure of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C. From Figs. 2a and S4, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocomposite exhibits a regular cubic morphology with an edge length of approximately 300 nm and a rougher surface compared to the Ni-Co-PBA precursor. In contrast, the NiS2/CoS2@NC composite without the coating of carbon derived from RF undergoes severe aggregation and clear structural collapse due to the lack of protection by the rigid carbon skeleton (Fig. S5). The EDX clearly verifies the existence of Co, Ni, C, N and S elements (Fig. 2b). In addition, the elemental contents of Ni, Co, and S in the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C composites can be obtained by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, which are 12.5%, 8.5%, and 23.7%, respectively (Table S1). From Figs. 2c and 2d, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocubes present as a core-shell structure with the carbon layer as the shell with thickness of about 10 nm and the porous carbon cube derived from Ni-Co-PBA as the core in which NiS2/CoS2 nanoparticles are homogeneously embedded. This unique core-shell microstructure generally plays an momentous part in preserving the structure integrity of nanocomposites and facilitating the transport of electrons, favoring the sodium storage performance . From Fig. 2e, the HRTEM image reveals the lattice fringes with the spacings of 0.283, 0.254, 0.318 and 0.278 nm, corresponding to the (200) and (210) crystal faces of NiS2 and the (111) and (200) crystal faces of CoS2, respectively. Furthermore, the NiS2 phase on the top and the CoS2 phase on the bottom form a well-defined interface (indicated by the red line), confirming a mass of lattice mismatches and indicating the successful construction of the heterojunction between NiS2 of CoS2. Moreover, the SAED pattern of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C is shown in Fig. 2f. The white ring patterns are ascribed to the (220) and (222) crystal planes of NiS2, while the yellow ring patterns correspond to the (231), (321), and (221) crystal planes of CoS2, indicating the successful synthesis of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C. From Fig. 2g, Co, Ni, C, N and S elementals are uniformly distributed throughout the composite material, indicating that sulfide nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in N-doped porous carbon.",
                "Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C for characterizing the crystal structure. The diffraction peaks of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C correspond to cubic-phase CoS2 (JCPDS Card No. 89-1492) and the cubic-phase NiS2 (JCPDS Card No. 11-0099), and no other obvious impurity phases are detected, indicating that the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C has been successfully synthesized with high purity and good crystallinity. It is important to noted that CoS2 and NiS2 cannot be effectively distinguished by the resolution limits of XRD analysis because of their similar structures and lattice constants. From Figs. S6, the diffraction peaks of the NiS2/CoS2@NC conform to the standard cards of the cubic-phase CoS2 and NiS2, indicating the successful synthesis of the NiS2/CoS2@NC. Raman spectra has been used to characterize the carbonaceous components. From Fig. 3b, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C and NiS2/CoS2@NC samples have two significant peaks, belonging to the characteristic D band and G band of carbon materials, respectively. Obviously, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C (ID/IG=1.07) possesses a significantly greater degree of graphitization than NiS2/CoS2@NC (ID/IG=1.19), indicating that the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C has better electron transport capacity , , , . Figs. 3c and 3d illustrate the isotherms of adsorption/desorption and the distributions of pore size. From Fig. 3c, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C is 106.42 m2 g−1, much greater than that of the NiS2/CoS2@NC (43.87 m2 g−1) owing to the existence of a large number of internal void spaces in the core-shell structure. From Fig. 3d, both NiS2/CoS2@NC@C and NiS2/CoS2@NC exhibit a mesoporous structure. The high specific area and abundant mesopores promote the full penetration of electrolyte into the material and thus effectively improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The TG curves of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C and NiS2/CoS2@NC are shown in Fig. S7. The initial weight loss at a temperature lower than 200 °C can be ascribed to the evaporation of adsorbed water, and the weight loss between 200 °C and 550 °C is contributed to the combustion of carbon, corresponding to a carbon content of about 51.0%. When the temperature exceeds 550°C, the NiS2/CoS2 can be converted to NiCoO2, and the volatilisation of Ni3O4 is inevitable during the heating process . In addition, the theoretical capacity of NiS2/CoS2@NC@C can be calculated as 617.68% according to eqs. 1 and 2.",
                "The surface electronic states and chemical composition of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C are analyzed by XPS. From Fig. 3e, the Co, N, C, S, Ni and O elements can be detected in NiS2/CoS2@NC@C. Among them, the inevitable exposure of the materials to air before measurement may lead to the presence of O element in final sample, and since the peaks of Co and Ni in the full XPS spectra are too weak, Co and Ni are locally amplified and their relative contents calculated are shown in Fig. S8. The Co 2p spectrum is displayed in Fig. 3f, which can be divided into two spin-orbit double peaks and two distinct satellite peaks. The satellite peaks of the Co 2p are located at 803.20 and 787.04 eV, which are associated with Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively, while the two spin-orbit double peaks are located at 799.33 eV/796.18 eV and 783.17 eV/779.18 eV, matching with the Co2+/Co3+ of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. From Fig. 3g, the double peak located at 857.22 eV/853.96 eV matches the Ni3+/Ni2+ of Ni 2p3/2, and the other bimodal peaks located at 876.13 eV/871.30 eV belongs to Ni3+/Ni2+ of Ni 2p1/2. In addition, the satellite peaks of Ni appear at 862.55 eV and 881.26 eV, respectively . Clearly, the Co and Ni elements in the sample have two valence states of Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+, which provides extremely abundant redox reaction capacity for sodium storage. From Fig. 3h, the peaks at 164.02, 165.62 and 169.26 eV in the S 2p spectrum match with S 2p1/2, S 2p3/2 and satellite peaks, respectively . From Fig. 3i, the C-C, C-N and C-O bands can be assigned to three peaks situated at 284.82, 285.9 and 287.1 eV, respectively . Among them, the formation of C-N bond indicates the successful doping of N element. From Fig. S9, the N elements in the sample are pyridine nitrogen (397.99 eV), pyrrole nitrogen (399.76 eV) and graphite nitrogen (402.37 eV) . The N-doping improves the electrical conductivity of the carbon matrix and provides a multitude of active sites, being beneficial to improve the reaction kinetics of the anode materials .",
                "The CV curves of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocomposite at 0.1 mV s−1 are displayed in Fig. 4a. The initial scanning process exhibits cathodic peaks at 1.12 V and 0.62 V, which can be ascribed to the transformation of NiS2 to metallic Ni and Na2S (NiS2+Na→Ni+Na2S) and CoS2 to metallic Co and Na2S (CoS2+Na→Co+Na2S) with the creation of a solid electrolyte interfacial (SEI) film. In the initial anodic scan, two strong oxidation peaks located at 1.78 V and 1.98 V indicate the conversion of metal Ni and Na2S to NiS2 (Ni+Na2S→NiS2) and metal Co and Na2S to CoS2 (Co+Na2S→CoS2), respectively. Besides, the positions of the reduction and oxidation peaks are almost the same during the subsequent cycles, indicating good reversibility of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C. To further investigate the detailed sodium storage mechanism during the discharge/charge process, the crystalline structures of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C composite at different stages are examined by the ex-situ XRD analysis. From Fig. S10, in the initial state, the characteristic peaks of NiS2 and CoS2 can be detected at 31.9° and 39.4°. As the voltage continues to discharge from 0.8 V to lower voltages, the peaks of NiS2 and CoS2 gradually diminish until disappear. Three new peaks appear during charging of the battery to 2.0 V, which are induced by the conversion reaction of CoS2/NiS2 with sodium ions to Na2S and metallic Co and Ni, respectively. The characteristic peaks of NiS2 and CoS2 reappear when charging is continued to 2.3 V. Fig. 4b displays the constant current charge-discharge curves of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C for the first five cycles at 1.0 A g−1. The initial charge and discharge capacities of the material are 807.9 mA h g−1 and 920.6 mA h g−1, respectively, giving the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 87.7%. Besides, in subsequent cycles, the reduction in capacity may be ascribed to the irreversible creation of the SEI film and disintegration of the electrolyte , , . Fig. 4c shows the cycling performance of the electrodes at 1.0 A g−1. Compared to the NiS2/CoS2@NC anode (99.7 mA h g−1), the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C provides a larger capacity of 489.9 mA h g−1 after 170 cycles. To further explore the reasons for the excellent performance of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C, the microstructural changes of the electrode after 100 cycles as well as 170 cycles are observed by SEM (Fig. S11), and it can be seen that the electrode still basically maintains its nanocube morphology after a long period of cycling, which suggests that the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C has an excellent cycling stability. Fig. 4d displays the rate performance of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C. Obviously, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C demonstrates better rate performance than the NiS2/CoS2@NC, delivering the discharge capacities of 501.9, 481.3, 456.0, 438.7, 418.7 and 387.7 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1, respectively, and the discharge capacity of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C can be recovered to 500.2 mA h g−1 when recovering from 5 A g−1 to 0.1 A g−1. From Fig. 4e, distinct charging and discharging plateaus can still be observed even at 5.0 A g−1, manifesting a weak polarization for the material. Moreover, the rate performance of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C is comparable/superior to that of formerly reported sulfide anodes (Fig. 4f) [ , , , , , , , , ]. From Figs. S12 and S13, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C electrode maintains prominent capacity of 545.9 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, much larger than the NiS2/CoS2@NC (337.9 mA h g−1) and single-component CoS2@NC@C (220.4 mA h g−1), and the SEM and TEM tests of the electrode after cycling show that the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C has outstanding structural stability (Fig. S14). Fig. 4g displays the cycling performance of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C and NiS2/CoS2@NC at 5.0 A g−1 after activation for 2 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Remarkably, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C exhibits a high specific capacity of 349.7 mA h g−1 with extremely good cycling stability even after 2000 cycles, with a CE close to 100.0%. From Table S2, the extraordinary cycling life of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C is achieved in this investigation. The exceptional sodium storage performance of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C is put down to its distinctive core-shell structure and the interfacial effect between NiS2 and CoS2, which can availably quicken the diffusion rate of sodium ions within the host materials.",
                "In order to investigate the reaction kinetics of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C, a kinetic analysis is performed based on CV curves at diverse sweep speeds. From Fig. 5a, the CV curves of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C are basically similar without significant changes with sweep speed increasing from 0.2 mV s−1 to 1.2 mV s−1, indicating that the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C electrode has excellent reversibility. Generally, the scan rate (v) and peak current (i) of the CV curves obey the following rules [ , ]:(1)",

                "log ( i )= b l o g( v )+l o g( a )",
                "Where b-value denotes the sodium storage behavior. If the b-value approaches 1, the electrochemical reaction is primarily governed by the pseudocapacitance behavior, whereas the b-value in proximity to 0.5 indicates that the electrochemical reaction is mainly controlled by ion diffusion [ , ]. From Fig. 5b, the b values of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C are 0.77, 0.86, 0.76, 0.45 and 0.94, respectively, reflecting that the electrochemical reactions of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C are primarily dominated by the pseudocapacitive behavior. Furthermore, the capacitance contribution in the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C electrode is analyzed based on the following equation :(3)",
                "i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2",
                "The contributions from pseudocapacitance and ion diffusion-controlled storage behavior are represented by k1v and k2v1/2, respectively [ , ]. Fig. 5c shows that the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C electrode has large pseudocapacitance contributions, giving the capacitance contributions of 73.2%, 77.4%, 81.9%, 84.4% and 88.1% at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.2 mV s−1, respectively (Figs. 5d and S15), being beneficial for enhancing charge storage and cycle life of the material.",
                "In order to further reveal the chemical reaction kinetics, the diffusion coefficient of Na+ for the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C at 0.1 V-3 V is determined by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). The calculation of DNa+ can be derived from the following equation :(4)",
                "D N a + = 4 τ π ( n m V m S ) 2 ( Δ E s Δ E t ) 2",
                "Where nm and Vm denote the number of moles and molar volume of the active material, respectively, τ is the relaxation time (min), and ΔEs and ΔEt are the voltage changes due to pulsed current and constant current, respectively . From Fig. 5e, the DNa+ values of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C electrode (8.04 × 10−12—1.04 × 10−9) are larger than those of the NiS2/CoS2@NC (6.46 × 10−12—7.77 × 10−10) during discharging, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance for the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C anodes. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the electrodes are shown in Fig. 5f. The Nyquist plots consist of a linear section at the low frequencies and semicircular at the high frequencies. Evidently, the charge transfer resistance of the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C (33.3 Ω) is smaller compared to the NiS2/CoS2@NC (56.6 Ω), exhibiting good electrochemical reaction kinetics."
