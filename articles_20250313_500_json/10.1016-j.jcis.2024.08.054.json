                "The off-stoichiometric compound Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 (NFPO) is a highly promising, cost-effective, and structurally robust cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the slowing Na-ion migration kinetics and poor interface stability have seriously limited its rate capability and air stability. In this work, we successfully synthesis a sodium titanium pyrophosphate (NaTiP2O7 donated as NTPO) coating NFPO (denoted as NFPO-NTPO) cathode material via a liquid phase coating method for SIBs. After optimizing NTPO content, at 0.1C, NFPO-NTPO-4 % cathode achieves a reversible specific capacity of 108.4 mAh g−1. Remarkably, it maintains 88.39 % capacity at 10C comparing to 0.1C and stabilizes over 3000 cycles with 92.66 % retention rate. Moreover, it retains 88.89 % capacity after 5000 cycles at 20C, even after 28 days of air exposure. The NFPO-Ti cathode, alongside the complete battery system, exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance across a broad temperature range spanning from −40 to 60 ℃."

                "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have great potential for large-scale energy storage due to their low cost and abundant resources. However, the larger ionic radius of sodium ions (Na+: 1.02 Å) compared to lithium ions (Li+: 0.76 Å) significantly limits their rate capabilities and structural stability.[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Therefore, the work to develop high structural stability, long lifespan, and high rate capability electrode materials has become the key to achieve the practical application of SIBs. Thus far, carbon-based materials have emerged as the predominant choice for anodes in SIBs, due to great cycle stability and rate capability[11], [12], [13], [14]. Cathode materials exhibiting promising prospects for application in SIBs can be categorized into three main groups: transition metal oxides[15], [16], [17], [18], polyanionic materials[19], [20], [21], and Prussian analogues[22], [23], [24]. Both them have their own advantages in energy density, cost, safety, and cycle life. et.al",
                ". Polyanionic iron-based phosphates, featuring a three-dimensional (3D) framework, stand out as promising cathode materials for SIBs. Recognized cost-effectiveness, structural resilience, and extended cycling life, they are deemed ideal for enhancing the performance of SIBs. Recently, many of iron-based phosphate cathode materials such as NaFePO4[25], [26], [27], NaFePO4F[28], [29], Na3Fe2(PO4)3[30], [31], [32], Na2FeP2O7[33], [34], Na4-xFe2+x/2(P2O7)2(0 < x < 4)[35] and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7[2], [36] have been reported in SIBs. From them, NFPO cathode material shows a lager theoretical specific capacity (117.4 mAh g−1), high thermal stability temperature (700 ℃) and a suitable working potential (3.0 V vs.Na/Na+), which was considered to be the most similar cathode material with lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) for the large-scale energy storage. However, the NFPO cathode material demonstrated limitations in its electronic and ionic conductivity, as well as interface instability. This resulted in a slowing of Na-ion migration kinetics and poor interface stability. There are already many precedents in material synthesis and application[37], [38], [39], [40]. Liu et al.[41] synthesized air-stable NFPO/rGO aerogels using sodium alginate (SA) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). These aerogels demonstrated a reversible capacity of 85 mAh g−1 at 10C and retained 88.73 % after 100 cycles. Zhang et al.[42] employed AlF3 as a modification agent to enhance the NFPO interface, effectively mitigating surface oxidation and corrosion. This modification strategy yielded a capacity of 100.4 mAh g−1 at 10C and an impressive retention rate of 96.3 % over 400 cycles. We list the relevant works reported in the last five years in Supporting Information Table 1. As shown in that the current rate capability of NFPO is improved mainly via elemental doping method, while simultaneously improving the rate capability and air stability via interface modify method has not been reported yet.",
                "The sodium-rich structure of NFPO easily reacts with oxygen and moisture in the air, leading to surface oxidation and corrosion, forming unfavorable by-products on the material's surface. In contrast, the three-dimensional structure of NTPO exhibits excellent anti-oxidation properties and large ion diffusion channels, making it a highly stable electrode material. In this study, by coating a thin layer of NTPO, the occurrence of side reactions is effectively prevented, resulting in the synthesis of NFPO cathode materials with high air stability. In this work, we construct a heterostructure to accelerate the Na-ion migration rate and effectively avoid oxygen oxidation of NFPO in the air via an in-situ coating method to uniformly coat a high ion conductivity titanium sodium pyrophosphate (NaTiP2O7 denoted as NTPO) on its surface. The NFPO@x%NTPO (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, denoted as NFPO@0Ti, NFPO@1Ti, NFPO@2Ti, NFPO@3Ti, NFPO@4Ti, NFPO@5Ti, NFPO@7Ti) cathode materials were prepared by spray drying method. Electrochemical characterization shows that the NFPO@4Ti cathode delivers superior performance, with a reversible specific capacity of 108.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1C. Remarkably, even at a high rate of 10C, a substantial capacity retention of 92.66 % is sustained under harsh cycling conditions. Furthermore, after exposure to air for 28 days and 5000 cycles at 20C, the capacity retention remains at 88.89 %. Impressively, it maintains good cycling performance over a wide temperature range. The Na-ion migration kinetics of NFPO@4Ti were characterized using constant current intermittent titration (GITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The sodium ion storage mechanism was analyzed with operando X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ex-situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Utilizing first-principles calculations to determine band structures (DOS), diffusion barriers, and lattice interface adsorption energy. Electrochemical evaluation of the full cell suggests promising prospects for the modified NFPO cathode material in large-scale SIB energy storage. This underscores its potential contribution to addressing the demand for efficient energy storage solutions, positioning it as a candidate for advancing energy storage technology."

                "The XRD pattern of NFPO@0Ti, NFPO@1Ti, NFPO@2Ti, NFPO@3Ti, NFPO@4Ti, NFPO@5Ti and NFPO@7Ti were presented in Fig. 1 (a). In Fig. 1 (a), the diffraction peaks observed in NFPO@0Ti align with those of pure phase NFPO (JCPDS: 083–0225), confirming the structural integrity of the NFPO@0Ti sample, and all these diffraction peaks in NFPO@4Ti, NFPO@5Ti and NFPO@7Ti could be indexed to both pure phase NFPO (JCPDS: 083–0225) and NTPO (JCPDS: 084–1737). Distinct diffraction peaks of NTPO corresponding to the (0 1 1), ( −1 1 1), (2 0 0), and ( −3 2 3) crystal planes are discernible at 18.67°, 19.14°, 25.64°, and 49.92°, respectively, in the partial enlarged view. Fig. 1(b) showed the schematic structure of NFPO and NTPO, which exhibited a three-dimensional (3D) open framework[35]. The crystal structure consists of two symmetrically arranged [FeO6] ([TiO6]) octahedra and two [P2O7] units forming a crown unit. Each [P2O7] group has two corner-sharing [PO4] units, creating a 3D network of [Fe2P4O22]∞ and [Fe2P4O20]∞ layers parallel to the b c plane. This network facilitates reversible Na-ion de/intercalation, providing a robust three-dimensional framework for ion transport. The refined X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of NFPO@0Ti and NFPO@4Ti are depicted in Fig. 1(c,d), respectively, illustrating the structural characteristics of the samples. The refined results indicated NFPO@4Ti material exhibited an orthorhombic (P1) crystal structure, and the lattice parameters were a = 6.433 Å, b = 9.432 Å, c = 11.120 Å, and V=583.6 Å3. The refinement results showed errors of less than 10 % (4.64 % for Rwp and 3.52 % for Rp), indicating the reliability of the refinement. Similarly, the pure phase NFPO@0Ti displayed an orthorhombic (P1) structure (a = 6.424 Å, b = 9.440 Å, c = 10.981 Å, and V=575.2 Å3). The errors for Rwp and Rp were 5.32 % and 4.96 %, respectively, demonstrating the accuracy of the refinement process. The detailed refined XRD results were shown in Tables S (2,3). The schematic of NTPO coating acting on NFPO electrode material was shown in Fig. 1 (e), which indicated that the NTPO was distributed between the NFPO body and carbon layer, which could effectively block the oxidation of oxygen and avoided the exchange of Na-ion with water molecules in the air. As shown in Fig. 1 (f, g), SEM images indicated that the primary particle size of NFPO@4Ti was ranged from 100 to 300 nm. Fig. 1 (h) displayed the HR-TEM image of NFPO@4Ti. As shown, NFPO@4Ti had a 2–4 nm carbon layer on its surface. This resulted from the melting of citric acid and its attachment to the precursor particles as the temperature increased during synthesis. A distinct NTPO coating layer, approximately 2–3 nm thick, was observed within the carbon layer. The lattice spacing of 3.1 Å closely matched the ( −2 1 2) crystal plane of NTPO, while the lattice spacing of 2.9 Å closely matched the (1––1 2) crystal plane of NFPO. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of NFPO@4Ti, as shown in Fig. 1 (i), supported this observation. It revealed multiple lattice planes such as (1 3 1) and (0 2 2). Moreover, the EDS mapping of NFPO@4Ti (Fig. 1 (j)) displayed a uniform distribution of elements throughout the material, including Na, Fe, P, O, and Ti. Additionally, the Raman spectra for NFPO@4Ti are presented in Fig. S1. The location of peaks indicated that this was corresponded to disordered defective carbon (at 1345 cm−1) and graphitized carbon (at 1560 cm−1) for NFPO@4Ti. The fitted ID/IG NFPO@4Ti was 1.22, which indicated that the carbon-coated layers in all samples possessed a good degree of graphitization. The TG analysis was used to calculate carbon content (Fig. S2), which indicated that the NFPO@4Ti contained 4.2 wt% carbon.",
                "Fig. 2(a) depicts the initial charging and discharging curves for the cathode specimens NFPO@0Ti, NFPO@1Ti, NFPO@2Ti, NFPO@3Ti, NFPO@4Ti, NFPO@5Ti, and NFPO@7Ti. NFPO@4Ti showed the highest initial reversible specific capacity of 108.4 mAh g−1 (after deduction of carbon content, the capacity could reach 113 mAh g−1), with a corresponding coulombic efficiency of 99 % in SIBs. Fig. 2(b) illustrates the rate capabilities of NFPO@0Ti, NFPO@1Ti, NFPO@4Ti, and NFPO@7Ti cathode materials. NFPO@4Ti exhibited reversible specific capacities of 108.4, 104.9, 101.6, 98.4, 95.6, 92.3, 89.1, 84.7, 79.2, and 66.2 mAh g−1 in SIBs at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100C, respectively. For cycle stability tests, the 100th cycles of NFPO@0Ti, NFPO@1Ti, NFPO@4Ti, and NFPO@7Ti cathode materials at 0.1C are shown in Fig. 2(c), demonstrating reversible specific capacity retention ratios of 99.5 %, 99.7 %, 99.8 %, and 99.8 %, respectively. Even at 10C, NFPO@4Ti maintained a reversible specific capacity of 83.8 mAh g−1, with a capacity retention of 92.66 % after 3,000 cycles, surpassing NFPO@0Ti, which retained only 84.67 % of its capacity under similar conditions (Fig. 2(d)). The charge–discharge curves of NFPO@4Ti cathode after exposure to air for different durations are shown in Fig. S3 (a, b). NFPO@4Ti maintained a reversible specific capacity of 108.4 mAh g−1 (virtually unchanged) after 28 days of exposure to air at 0.1C in SIBs, while NFPO@0Ti showed gradual capacity decay (66.2 mAh g−1, decaying to 81.98 % of the original) during air exposure after 28 days, attributed to reactions with moisture and O2 in the air. Fig. 2(e) illustrates that NFPO@4Ti maintained a reversible capacity of 82.3 mAh g−1, with a retention of 88.89 %, after 5,000 cycles, significantly higher than NFPO@0Ti (71.12 %) at 20C. NFPO@4Ti showed favorable air stability, ensuring reliable long-term performance. Additionally, NFPO@4Ti maintained a capacity retention rate of over 90 % during the 300th cycle at 0.2C within the temperature range of −40 to 60 ℃ (Fig. 2(f), Fig. S4 (a, b)). NTPO demonstrated promising potential in mitigating the adverse effects of extreme temperatures on phosphate electrode materials, improving battery performance and cyclic stability. GITT was used to determine Na-ion diffusion coefficients of NFPO@4Ti and NFPO@0Ti samples (Fig. 2 (g, h)). NFPO@4Ti exhibited higher values ranging from 6.13 × 10-11 to 1.99 × 10-9 cm2 s−1, indicating improved kinetics compared with NFPO@0Ti (2 × 10-12 to 7.94 × 10-10cm2 s−1). This enhancement was further validated by EIS (Fig. S5). NFPO@4Ti showed smaller semicircles than NFPO@0Ti, indicating smaller charge transfer resistance. The equivalent circuit fitting results showed Rct values of 107 Ω, 77 Ω, 66 Ω, and 115 Ω for NFPO@0Ti, NFPO@1Ti, NFPO@4Ti, and NFPO@7Ti, respectively. NFPO@0Ti and NFPO@4Ti conductivity was assessed using the four-probe method (Fig. S6), showing an increase in electrical conductivity for NFPO@4Ti (1.74 × 10-5 S cm−1) compared to NFPO@0Ti (1.03 × 10-5 S cm−1), contributing to its superior electrochemical properties. Fig. 2(i) compares the cycling performance with recently reported NFPO in SIBs, showing NFPO@4Ti exhibiting optimal cycle stability.[41], [42], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49].",
                "Fig. 3(a) depicts the predicted structural evolution during Na+ deintercalation, revealing that approximately 2.44Na+ ions can be extracted per formula unit at full charging stages. To explore the crystal structure changes of the NFPO@4Ti cathode, operando XRD tests were conducted during the charge/discharge process in SIBs. Fig. 3(b) presents the XRD patterns and charge/discharge curves, segmented into two distinct sections denoted by black and orange colors, representing the initial charge and discharge processes, respectively. During charge process, these diffraction peaks located at 20.4°, 22.4°, 25°, 32.2°, and 34.3° correspond to the ( −1 1 0), ( −1 0 2), (0––1 2), (2 1 2), and (−1––1 3) lattice planes of the pristine NFPO. During the charge/discharge processes, these diffraction peaks undergone reversible shifts. In order to accurately determine the shift value, the corresponding 2 D contour plots of XRD pattern were shown in Fig. 3 (c). The amplified 2 D contour plots of XRD indicated that the corresponding lattice plane of (1––1 2), (0––2 2) and (−1––1 3) changed obviously. During the initial charge process, the location of lattice planes ((1––1 2), (0––2 2) and (−1––1 3)) shifted to 31.03°, 34.23°, and 35.16°. During the discharge process, these lattice planes ((1––1 2), (0––2 2) and (−1––1 3)) were reversibly shifted back, and the shift value of the corresponding diffraction peak position during the entire charge and discharge process was 0.26°, 0.58° and 0.88°. According to the Bragg Formula, the calculated crystal cell parameters of NFPO@4Ti cathode were shown in Fig. S7. In Fig. 3 (d), the charge/discharge process of the NFPO@4Ti cathode displays reversible expansion with a volume change of 3.97 %.",
                "To elucidate the charge compensation mechanism, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of NFPO@4Ti was investigated through in-situ XAFS analysis (Fig. 4 (a-c)). In the pristine electrode, iron (Fe) mainly exists in the divalent state, as indicated by the Fe-O edge. This characterization provides insights into the redox behavior of NFPO@4Ti during electrochemical cycling, which is essential for understanding its performance in SIBs. During the charge and discharge processes, the Fe K-edge shifts to higher energies and then returns to its original level of 7112 eV, indicating a fully reversible redox process for Fe. Fourier-transformed EXAFS analysis in R-space (Fig. 4(d)) reveals structural changes in the NFPO@4Ti electrode at different states of charge (SOC). Wavelet transform patterns (Fig. 4(e)) show that the Fe-O bond shifts during charging (from 0.7 Å to 1.45 Å) and returns during discharging (from 1.45 to 0.7 Å)[50]. Additionally, the Fe-O-Na bond weakens during charging and reappears during discharging, indicating reversible changes in the Fe-O bond during Na-ion extraction/insertion. Ex-situ XPS characterization of Fe and Ti valence states during charge/discharge cycles of the NFPO@4Ti cathode in SIBs shows that in the pristine state, Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies are at 709.6 eV and 723.0 eV, indicating Fe2+. During charging, these energies increase to 710.8 eV and 724.4 eV, returning to their original positions upon discharging to 1.5 V, demonstrating the reversibility of Fe valence changes. This reversible Na-ion storage behavior is attributed to an incomplete solid solution reaction involving Fe2+ and Fe3+ transitions. The Ti 2p spectra (Fig. S10) show binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 454.9 eV and 459.8 eV in the pristine state, corresponding to Ti4+. During charging, these energies increase to 457.5 eV and 465.6 eV, indicating oxidation to Ti4+. This suggests that Ti participates in the redox reaction, contributing additional capacity[51].",
                "The DFT calculations were employed to investigate the Na-ion storage mechanism in NFPO@4Ti and NFPO@0Ti. The detailed calculation procedures can be found in the supplementary information. As shown in Fig. S11, the methodologies employed for computing the Na-ion adsorption energy, and evaluating the Na-ion adsorption capacity of NFPO, NTPO, and NFPO@NTPO were delineated. The Na-ion adsorption energies were determined as −2.73 eV, −2.35 eV, and −3.08 eV for NFPO, NTPO, and NFPO@NTPO (Fig. 5 (a)), respectively. Sodium-rich NFPO was sensitive to moisture and O2, and sodium detachment made the structure prone to collapse. In contrast, NFPO@NTPO had lower adsorption energy and effectively immobilized Na-ion in NFPO@4Ti. To clarify the beneficial impact of titanium (Ti) coating on the electrochemical properties of NFPO, the nudged elastic band (NEB) method was used to calculate the migration barriers for Na-ions in both materials. The sodium ion migration path, shown in Fig. 5(b), was specifically selected for this analysis. In Fig. 5 (c, d), the density of states (DOS) for both specimens is depicted. The DOS of NFPO@4Ti revealed a projected band gap of approximately 1.8 eV, smaller than that of NFPO@0Ti (2.9 eV). Moreover, due to Ti coating, the spin electrons on the Fe 3d orbitals in NFPO@4Ti shifted to lower energy levels, suggesting a potential contribution to facilitating the valence-to-conduction band transition in NFPO@4Ti. In Fig. 5 (f), the calculated peaks for NFPO@0Ti and NFPO@4Ti were 1.68 eV and 1.09 eV, respectively, indicating Ti coating was advantageous for increasing the Na+ diffusion rate, aligning with the GITT analysis results. NTPO coating method could effectively improve the instability of NFPO in air, inhibit the generation of side reactions, and prevent the side effects of Na. To confirm the air stability, we tested NFPO@4Ti and NFPO@0Ti powder samples exposed to air for 28 days using XPS, as shown in Fig. S12 (a, b). The peak at 1074.1 eV in the Na 1 s spectrum originates from the surface-oxidized NaHCO3 product. The side reaction equation is as follows:(1)xH2O+Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 + x/2O2 + xCO2 = xNaHCO3 + Na3.12-2xFe(Ⅱ)2.44-2xFe(Ⅲ)2x(P2O7)2",
                "Fig. S13 (a, b) shows binding energies near 710.8 eV and 724.4 eV, attributed to Fe3+. The Fe3+ percentages in NFPO@4Ti and NFPO@0Ti were 6.8 % and 29.3 %, respectively, based on peak area integrals, indicating the NTPO coating effectively inhibits surface oxidation. Electrochemical properties are unstable at extreme temperatures, high temperatures cause severe electrolyte erosion, and low temperatures lead to poorer de-solvation reactions, both resulting in lower specific capacities.",
                "To evaluate the practical application potential of the NFPO@4Ti cathode material in SIBs, we combined NFPO@4Ti with commercial hard carbon (HC, Kuraray, Japan) to form a full cell. The working principle of the HC||NFPO@4Ti full cell is shown in Fig. 6(a), where Na-ions can reversibly insert into and extract from the NFPO@4Ti cathode to the HC anode. The detailed negative-to-positive mass ratio (N/P) of 1:3.0 (Fig. 6(b)) revealed that the HC anode demonstrated an initial reversible specific capacity of 310 mAh g−1, with a coulombic efficiency of 90 % at 0.1C in SIBs, underscoring its promising electrochemical performance and potential for practical application in energy storage systems. Fig. 6(c) illustrates the performance of the HC||NFPO@4Ti full cell, showing an initial reversible discharge specific capacity of 70.3 mAh g−1 (based on the mass of NFPO@4Ti and HC) with an average working potential of 2.9 V. The NFPO@4Ti||HC full cell also demonstrates robust cycle stability. The charge/discharge curves of NFPO@4Ti at various temperatures are depicted in Fig. 6(d), with capacities of 50.4, 60.3, 70.3, and 74.2 mAh g−1 at −40℃, 0℃, 25℃, and 60℃, respectively. Fig. 6(e) compares specific energy/power density with recent reports on sodium-ion full cells, indicating that our HC||NFPO@4Ti full cell demonstrates competitive energy density[52], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Fig. 6(f) shows that after 300 cycles at 0.2C, the capacity retention was 96.14 % at 25 ℃, 92.07 % at 60 ℃, 93.34 % at 0℃, and 89.58 % at −40 ℃. The rate performance of NFPO@4Ti at different temperatures is shown in Fig. S14, highlighting its excellent cycle stability.The NTPO coating effectively addresses the unstable electrochemical performance of NFPO across a wide temperature range. This heterogeneous interface promotes electron transport, enhances ion transport channels, improves interfacial stability, and increases the available capacity and energy density of the battery. This cladding strategy notably enhances battery performance and extends cycle life, showcasing its clear superiority."

                "A NaTiP2O7-coated off-stoichiometric Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 was synthesized for SIBs, exhibiting a high reversible specific capacity of 108.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, excellent rate capability of 79.2 mAh g−1 at 50C, long cycle life of 5,000 cycles at 20C, and high air stability for 28 days. Operando XRD, ex-situ XPS, and ex-situ EXAFS spectra revealed that the NFPO@4Ti cathode operates via a reversible Na-ion storage mechanism based on Fe2+/Fe2+ redox, with a small volume change rate of 3.94 %. DFT calculations, GITT, and EIS tests showed that the NTPO coating forms a heterogeneous interface on the NFPO surface, facilitating charge rearrangement, reducing Na-ion precipitation, and minimizing moisture and oxygen effects, thus enhancing air and high-temperature stability. The HC||NFPO@4Ti full cell demonstrated a maximum specific energy density of 203 Wh kg−1 with an average working potential of 2.9 V. High/low-temperature tests confirmed its effectiveness across a wide temperature range, from −40 to 60 ℃, suitable for various environmental conditions. These findings suggest that the developed iron-based SIBs system offers high energy density, excellent rate capability, long cycle life, air stability, and wide operating temperature range, making it a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage applications. The cost-effectiveness of producing NTPO-coated NFPO on an industrial scale still needs to be evaluated and continues to be explored in the future."
