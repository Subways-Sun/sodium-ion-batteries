                "An ultrafine tin dioxide/N, P-doped porous carbon (SnO2/NPPC) nanocomposite is prepared through in-situ growth of tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles in N, P-doped porous carbon (NPPC). Owing to the in-situ growth method, the size of SnO2 nanoparticles in SnO2/NPPC is quite small and uniform (generally less than 5.0 nm). NPPC provides a support and a conductive carbon skeleton for the SnO2 nanoparticles. The small SnO2 nanoparticles are less likely to aggregate during the discharge–charge process due to the presence of Sn–O–C bonding and nanoconfinement effect of SnO2 nanoparticles in carbon matrix. The N and P doping can provide abundant defects to facilitate the penetration of Li+ or Na+ into the interior of the electrode. In addition, the presence of Sn–N bonding can further improve the electrochemical properties of the electrodes. Thus, as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, SnO2/NPPC possesses an enhanced rate performance, an excellent cycling stability, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency. The structure of the ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles is well maintained in cycled SnO2/NPPC. Meanwhile, SnO2/NPPC also possesses good electrochemical performance as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. The good electrochemical properties for SnO2/NPPC materials can be ascribed to the synergetic effect between small SnO2 nanoparticles and NPPC."

                "The continually increasing consumption of fossil fuels will cause a severe energy crisis in the future. Therefore, developing renewable power sources is critical. Rechargeable batteries as important power sources have aroused wide interests. Until now, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in electric vehicles and electronic devices [1], [2], [3]. Nevertheless, seeking for electrode materials with good stability, low price, and high capacity is a continuous work. On the other hand, owing to the increasing global demand, it is necessary to develop other alternative rechargeable batteries. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be a promising rechargeable battery owing to the abundant elements and low costs [4]. LIBs and SIBs are conceptually very similar. Seeking for electrode materials with higher storage capacity as compared to state-of-the art is highly desirable [5], [6].",
                "Tin (Sn) and Sn-based materials with environmentally friendly properties exhibit excellent electrochemical performances as the anode materials in LIBs [7], [8]. Among the Sn-based materials, tin dioxide (SnO2) possesses a theoretical capacity of 1494 mAh g−1 in LIBs, which is considered to be one of the most promising materials for replacing graphite anodes in commercial applications [9], [10]. To date, very limited studies have reported that SnO2 can act as an anode material in SIBs. SnO2 can provide a theoretical capacity of 1398 mAh g−1 as an anode in SIBs [11], [12], [13]. Therefore, considering the low working potential and environmentally friendly properties, SnO2 can also be used as a promising anode material in SIBs. The electrochemical reaction of SnO2 with lithium (Li)/sodium (Na) can be divided into two steps, the conversion from SnO2 to Sn and the alloying/dealloying of LixSn or NaxSn [14]. Notably, when Li or Na is inserted in SnO2 during the conversion reaction process, volume expansion will inevitably occur. This phenomenon can result in particle contact losses and hence poor cycle life [15], [16]. In addition, the low electrical conductivity of SnO2 is detrimental to its electrochemical activity [17]. Therefore, the methods of reducing particle size of SnO2 (using SnO2 nanoparticles) and compounding with a carbon matrix are often employed to improve the electrical conductivity of electrodes and to minimize the strain within electrodes during Li/Na insertion and extraction process [18], [19], [20]. Heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials with high electrical conductivity and porosity are the suitable carbon matrix for metal oxide nanoparticles [21], [22]. Therefore, it is important to develop a low-cost method for preparing a heteroatom-doped porous carbon loaded with SnO2 nanoparticles used as a potential anode material for LIBs or SIBs.",
                "Herein, an ultrafine SnO2/N, P-doped porous carbon (SnO2/NPPC) nanocomposite is prepared by the in-situ growth of SnO2 nanoparticles in NPPC. Owing to the in-situ growth method, the size of SnO2 nanoparticles in SnO2/NPPC composite is small and uniform (generally less than 5 nm). Meanwhile, there is a very strong chemical bonding (Sn–O–C) between NPPC and SnO2 nanoparticles. According to the existence of Sn–O–C and nanoconfinement effect, SnO2 nanoparticles are less likely to aggregate and fall off during the discharge–charge process. Furthermore, NPPC with N and P doping can provide a good support and conductive carbon skeleton for SnO2 nanoparticles. Performed as anodes for LIBs and SIBs, the SnO2/NPPC nanocomposites exhibit good electrochemical performances."

                        "Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the synthesis route for the preparation of the SnO2/NPPC composite. The carbon matrix NPPC is prepared by a hydrothermal reaction and a subsequent CO2 activation process. In the hydrothermal reaction, pyrrole polymerizes in the aqueous phosphoric acid solution through the protonation reaction [23], [24]. An N, P-doped hydrogel are then formed through the hydrogen bond interaction. Fig. S1 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of NPPC. As calculated based on the isotherm, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of NPPC is 1940 m2 g−1 (as displayed in Table 1), illustrating the high porosity of NPPC. The high porosity in NPPC can provide an accessible channel for aqueous SnCl2 solution to enter the material. Adequate surface area is also provided for the in-situ growth of SnO2 nanoparticles in NPPC. Before the in-situ growth of SnO2 on NPPC, the inner surface of the pores in NPPC is firstly decorated with oxygenated groups by using aqueous H2O2 solution. In a typical procedure, the carbon atoms on the surface of NPPC are oxidized by H2O2, thereby, the oxygen-containing functional groups are formed on the inner surface of the pores in NPPC [25], [26]. After SnCl2 enter the pores in NPPC, a subsequent heat treatment is conducted at 280 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. During the thermal treatment, a redox reaction occurs between the Sn2+ in the pores and the oxygenated groups on the inner surface of the pores in NPPC, thus the SnO2/NPPC composite is finally prepared [27]. Different amounts of aqueous SnCl2 solution are used for the reaction to tune the loading of SnO2 nanoparticles in the material. Samples with different SnO2 loading are named as SnO2/NPPC-1, SnO2/NPPC-2, and SnO2/NPPC-3, respectively. Owing to the in-situ growth method, on one hand, the size of SnO2 nanoparticles in obtained SnO2/NPPC composite is quite small (generally less than 5.0 nm) and uniform. On the other hand, the Sn–O–C bonding between SnO2 nanoparticles and NPPC is strong, providing nanoconfinement of SnO2 nanoparticles in NPPC. These properties can actuate the SnO2/NPPC composite to be a potential anode material in LIBs and SIBs [8], [13].",
                        "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images display the structure of NPPC (Fig. 2a) and SnO2/NPPC-2 (Fig. 2b and c), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a, NPPC exhibits highly porous structure. After SnO2 nanoparticles are loaded on the surface of NPPC, the uniform nanoparticles can be clearly observed in Fig. 2b. The size distribution of SnO2 nanoparticles in SnO2/NPPC-2 is shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the distribution of particle size is narrow. The size of the SnO2 nanoparticles is about 3.0 nm. The inset image in Fig. 2b shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of SnO2/NPPC-2. The diffraction rings, such as (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 1 1), and (3 0 1), are assigned to the polycrystalline structure of SnO2 [28], [29]. A high-resolution TEM image is also provided in Fig. 2c to show the lattice structure of SnO2. The crystal lattice fringes of SnO2 nanoparticles are 0.26 and 0.33 nm, corresponding to the (1 0 1) and (1 1 0) planes of the rutile phase of SnO2, respectively [30], [31]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is also employed to investigate the crystallinity information of SnO2/NPPC materials. As shown in Fig. 2d, all SnO2/NPPC samples are indexed to the rutile phase of SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445). The main diffraction peaks centered at 2θ = 26.6°, 33.9°, 51.8°, and 65.9° are assigned to (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 1 1), and (3 0 1) planes of rutile SnO2 phase, respectively [32], [33]. The wide diffraction peaks can be ascribed to the small size of SnO2 nanoparticles [34]. There is only a board peak in NPPC (2θ = 24°), indicating the existence of partially ordered carbon structure [35]. Fig. 2e–j show the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping of C, N, O, P, and Sn in SnO2/NPPC-2. N, O, P, and Sn elements are well distributed in SnO2/NPPC-2, indicating the successful combination of N, P-doped carbon and SnO2 nanoparticles."

                        "Chemical composition and porous structure of the obtained materials were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen sorption tests. Fig. 3a shows the element species existed in NPPC and SnO2/NPPC materials measured by XPS survey spectra. C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and P 2p peaks are existent in both NPPC and SnO2/NPPC samples. As compared with NPPC, SnO2/NPPC materials possess the characteristic Sn 3d and Sn 4d peaks. The relative contents of N element obtained from XPS in SnO2/NPPC-1, SnO2/NPPC-2, and SnO2/NPPC-3 are 3.1, 2.4, and 1.9 at%, respectively. Fig. 3b shows the N 1s spectra for NPPC and SnO2/NPPC materials. For NPPC, three peaks centered at 398.5, 399.9, and 401.1 eV are corresponded to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively [36], [37]. After the SnO2 nanoparticles loaded on the surface of NPPC, a new peak centered at 400.7 eV appears in all SnO2/NPPC materials, indicating the presence of Sn–N bonding [14]. Notably, the existence of Sn–N bonding can improve the electrochemical performances for LIBs and SIBs [14]. Fig. 3c shows the Sn 3d spectra of SnO2/NPPC materials. Two peaks centered at 496.0 and 487.6 eV are observed in all the three samples, which are ascribed to the existence of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively. The presence of Sn 3d5/2 is related to the Sn4+ in SnO2 nanoparticles [38]. Moreover, the 8.4 eV difference between two peaks is also consistent with the energy splitting of SnO2 as reported in the literatures, illustrating the presence of SnO2 [39]. The O 1s spectra of SnO2/NPPC materials shown in Fig. 3d are deconvoluted into four peaks, which are assigned to C=O (530.7 eV), Sn–O (531.6 eV), Sn–O–C (532.6 eV), and C–OH/C–O–C (533.3 eV), respectively [13], [40]. The existence of Sn–O–C bonding can make the SnO2 nanoparticles less likely to aggregate during the discharge–charge process in LIBs and SIBs [13]. TGA is employed to calculate the contents of SnO2 nanoparticles in SnO2/NPPC materials. As shown in Fig. 3e, NPPC is totally consumed when the temperature increases above 650 °C. The residual masses of SnO2/NPPC samples indicate that the loading of SnO2 nanoparticles are 42, 61, and 70 wt% in SnO2/NPPC-1, SnO2/NPPC-2, and SnO2/NPPC-3, respectively.",
                        "The porosities of NPPC and SnO2/NPPC materials are investigated by the nitrogen sorption experiments. Fig. 3f shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for the obtained materials. There is an obvious increase in the adsorbed volume at P/P0 = 0–0.10 in NPPC, which can be attributed to the Type I isotherm, indicating the presence of micropores [41]. After the SnO2 nanoparticles loaded on the surface of NPPC, an obvious decrease in the adsorbed volume is observed at P/P0 = 0–0.10 for all of the SnO2/NPPC materials. Moreover, with the increase of SnO2 loading, the SnO2/NPPC materials exhibit lower adsorbed volume in whole relative pressure range, illustrating the high SnO2 loading would result in the decline of the pores in SnO2/NPPC. Table 1 shows the BET specific surface area and total pore volume obtained from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for NPPC and SnO2/NPPC materials. NPPC possesses a BET specific surface area of 1940 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 1.19 cm3 g−1. When the SnO2 nanoparticles are loaded in NPPC, the BET specific surface area values of SnO2/NPPC materials decrease to 290–510 m2 g−1, while the total pore volumes are 0.19–0.32 cm3 g−1, which can be ascribed to the SnO2 loading. Higher loading of SnO2 nanoparticles results in lower porosity. Fig. 3g shows the pore size distribution profiles calculated from the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method. The adsorption experiment is conducted through equilibrating the adsorbent (solid) and adsorbate (fluid) system at different pressures [42]. Different from the local theory model of adsorption, the nonlocal theory has considered the short-ranged correlations in the fluid density of the adsorbate [43]. Therefore, the nonlocal mean field theory provides a quantitatively accurate model to describe the structure of the fluid confined in pores, which can further describe the sorption isotherms as a function of the pressure and pore size [43]. Thus, based on this theory model, the pore size distribution can be calculated through the adsorption integral equation [44]. SnO2/NPPC materials exhibit the similar pore size distribution profiles to NPPC. There are four main peaks located at 0.53, 1.30, 1.69, and 2.40 nm in both NPPC and SnO2/NPPC materials, indicating the micropores and mesopores are existent in all the materials."

                        "As discussed in the Introduction part, SnO2 is a potential anode material with high capacity for LIBs. Nevertheless, its low electrical conductivity and large volume expansion during the discharge–charge process result in low reversible capacity and poor cycle life. On the basis of the small size of SnO2 nanoparticles and the combination of the NPPC and SnO2 nanoparticles, SnO2/NPPC may mitigate these issues. Here we studied the lithium storage behavior in coin cells (half cells). All the capacities are calculated on the basis of the total mass of the active materials in the electrodes. CV curves scanned in a potential range of 0.001–3.0 V (scan speed: 0.1 mV s−1) are firstly employed to investigate the Li insertion–extraction process of the electrode materials. As shown in Fig. 4a, for SnO2 electrode, in the first cathodic scan, the peak at 0.73 V is ascribed to the reduction of SnO2 to Sn [45]. The broad peak at about 0.20 V is attributed to the formation of LixSn [46]. Correspondingly, in the first anodic scan, the peak at 0.52 V is associated with the dealloying reaction of LixSn [47]. The peak at a higher voltage at about 1.20 V is ascribed to the deformation of Li2O [48]. The related reactions can be described as follows.(1)SnO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ Sn + 2Li2O(2)Sn + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixSn (0 ≤ x ≤ 4.4)",
                        "However, in the subsequent cycles, the cathodic peak at 0.73 V shifts to a broad peak from 0.80 to 1.20 V, indicating the partial reversibility between SnO2 and Sn [49]. Fig. 4b and c display the first three cycles of CV curves of NPPC and SnO2/NPPC-2, respectively. In the first cathodic scan of NPPC, the peak at 0.56 and 0.002 V is ascribed to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and the Li insertion in carbon [50]. In the first cathodic scan of SnO2/NPPC-2, the peaks at 0.85 and 0.30 V are corresponded to the reduction of SnO2 to Sn companied by the formation of SEI layer and the formation of LixSn, respectively [51]. Accordingly, the anodic peaks at 0.56 and 1.24 V are related to the dealloying reaction of LixSn and deformation of Li2O, respectively [51].",
                        "Galvanostatic cycling was used to further investigate the electrochemical behaviors of the obtained electrodes. Fig. 4d–f display the voltage profiles of SnO2, NPPC, and SnO2/NPPC-2 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4d, in consistence with the CV curves, there are also two voltage plateaus in the first discharge process in SnO2. The plateau at about 0.80 V is related to the conversion from SnO2 to Sn as displayed in Reaction (1) [45], while the slope plateau between 0.20 and 0.40 V is attributed to the alloying of LixSn as described in Reaction (2) [46]. Correspondingly, in the first charge process in SnO2, the slope plateau between 0.40 and 0.70 V is ascribed to the dealloying of LixSn, while the slope plateau between 1.10 and 1.80 V is attributed to the reversible conversion between Sn and SnO2 [47], [48]. The initial discharge capacity for SnO2 is 1500 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, whereas the initial charge capacity is 844 mAh g−1. However, in the subsequent discharge–charge profiles, even though the plateaus can also be observed, there is a capacity decrease for the SnO2 electrode. From the second to tenth discharge–charge cycles, the discharge capacities decrease from 848 to 444 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, indicating the sharp drop of the capacity in SnO2 electrode. The sharp drop of the capacity is probably ascribed to the low electrical conductivity and volume expansion during the conversion reaction process [15], [16]. As shown in Fig. 4e, the discharge–charge behaviors of NPPC are consistent with the typical carbon-based materials [27]. Although there is no sharp drop of the capacity in NPPC electrode from the second to tenth cycles, the discharge capacities are only around 600 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Meanwhile, the initial Coulombic efficiency of NPPC is quite low (46.3%), which can be attributed to excessive SEI formation due to the high surface area [52], [53]. From a practical point of view, it will be important to minimize the initial irreversible charge losses.",
                        "Fig. 4f shows the galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles of SnO2/NPPC-2 at 0.2 A g−1. The discharge and charge plateaus related to Reactions (1), (2) are obviously observed. At 0.2 A g−1, the initial discharge capacity of SnO2/NPPC-2 is 1413 mAh g−1, while the initial charge capacity is 1017 mAh g−1, corresponding to an initial Coulombic efficiency of 72.0%. Although this requires further improvement, the value is notably higher as compared to the pure SnO2 and NPPC. In the second cycle, the discharge capacity of SnO2/NPPC-2 is 911 mAh g−1, whereas the charge capacity is 913 mAh g−1, corresponding to a Coulombic efficiency of about 100%. After cycling for 10 cycles, the discharge capacity is still 835 mAh g−1, illustrating the good stability of SnO2/NPPC-2 electrode. Therefore, as compared with the bare SnO2 and NPPC, SnO2/NPPC-2 possesses much better electrochemical performance in LIBs.",
                        "In order to further reveal the electrochemical properties of the obtained electrodes, rate capability and cycling tests are also carried out. As shown in Fig. 5a, rate dependent capacities of SnO2, NPPC, and SnO2/NPPC are measured at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g−1 in a potential range of 0.001–3.0 V. The discharge capacities of SnO2/NPPC-1, SnO2/NPPC-2, and SnO2/NPPC-3 are 782, 911, and 1118 mAh g−1 at the current density of 0.2 A g−1, respectively. When the current density increases to 1 A g−1, the discharge capacities of SnO2/NPPC-1, SnO2/NPPC-2, and SnO2/NPPC-3 are 445, 632, and 594 mAh g−1, respectively, which are much higher than the bare SnO2 (59 mAh g−1) and NPPC (317 mAh g−1). At current densities of 10 A g−1, the discharge capacity of SnO2/NPPC-2 is still 240 mAh g−1, which is higher than NPPC, SnO2, and other two SnO2/NPPC electrodes. After the current density returns to 0.2 A g−1, SnO2/NPPC-1, SnO2/NPPC-2, and SnO2/NPPC-3 exhibit the capacities of 680, 770, and 716 mAh g−1, which are again higher than SnO2 (252 mAh g−1) and NPPC (631 mAh g−1). Therefore, as compared with bare SnO2 and NPPC, the SnO2/NPPC materials possess enhanced rate performance. Furthermore, SnO2/NPPC-2 shows a better rate performance than SnO2/NPPC-1 and SnO2/NPPC-3. This difference can be ascribed to the more optimized content of SnO2 nanoparticles in SnO2/NPPC materials. The SnO2 content of 70 wt% in SnO2/NPPC-3 may be too high to enable efficient stabilization by the porous carbon [22].",
                        "Fig. 5b shows the cycle life of SnO2, NPPC, and SnO2/NPPC-2 and the Coulombic efficiency of SnO2/NPPC-2 in LIBs measured at 0.5 A g−1 for 450 cycles. After running for 450 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, SnO2/NPPC-2 exhibits a reversible capacity of 613 mAh g−1, which is much higher than NPPC (399 mAh g−1) and SnO2 (3 mAh g−1). The cycling behavior of SnO2/NPPC-1 and SnO2/NPPC-3 are also provided in Fig. S3b. Among these three SnO2/NPPC materials, SnO2/NPPC-2 possesses the best cycle life behavior. For SnO2/NPPC-2, the Coulombic efficiency increases to above 98% from the fourth cycle, while it needs several more cycles for SnO2, NPPC, and other two SnO2/NPPC electrodes (as shown in Fig. S3). Therefore, SnO2/NPPC-2 exhibits the best electrochemical performance in LIBs in terms of the high rate capacity and excellent cycle life. The good performance of SnO2/NPPC-2 can be ascribed to the synergetic effect between SnO2 nanoparticles with optimized loading and the conductive NPPC. Fig. 5c–e display the TEM images of cycled SnO2/NPPC-2 after 450 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. After cycling for 450 cycles, SnO2 nanoparticles with small size (<5.0 nm) are still well distributed in NPPC. The SnO2 lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.26 nm can be clearly observed in Fig. 5d and e, corresponding to the (1 0 1) plane of rutile SnO2 phase [30], [31]. The well-maintained SnO2 nanoparticles in cycled SnO2/NPPC-2 well explain the good electrochemical properties. Fig. 5f shows the Nyquist plots of SnO2, NPPC, and SnO2/NPPC-2 after 20 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 in LIBs. In high frequency region, all the three electrodes exhibit a semicircle, indicating the presence of the charge transfer resistance between the electrode interface and the electrolyte [54]. The diameter of the semicircle in SnO2/NPPC-2 is smaller than those in SnO2 and NPPC, indicating a comparably low charge transfer resistance for SnO2/NPPC-2. Therefore, the active SnO2 nanoparticles combined with NPPC can obviously enhance the electrochemical properties of the electrodes in LIBs."

                        "The Na storage properties of SnO2/NPPC in half cells are also investigated. Since the electrochemical properties in SIBs can be significantly improved with the increasing mass loading of SnO2 [28], SnO2/NPPC-3 with a higher SnO2 content is first employed to study the CV curves and galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles in SIBs. Fig. 6a and b show the CV curves of NPPC and SnO2/NPPC-3 in SIBs scanned at 0.1 mV s−1 in range of 0.001–3.0 V, respectively. In NPPC, the peaks at the first cathodic scan are at around 1.3 and 0.001 V, corresponding to the SEI layer formation and the insertion of Na into the carbon matrix, respectively [4]. From the second cycle, the anodic peak at around 0.1 V is attributed to the extraction of Na from the carbon matrix [13]. For SnO2/NPPC-3, in the first cathodic scan, the irreversible peak at 0.99 V is related to the formation of SEI layer and the conversion reaction of SnO2 to Sn and Na2O as described in Reaction (3) [13]. The cathodic peaks from 0.6 to 0.001 V are ascribed to the formation of NaxSn, as displayed in Reaction (4) [11]. In the anodic scan, the peaks at 0.2 and 1.2 V are ascribed to the reversible dealloying of NaxSn as shown in the Reaction (4) [4]. In the subsequent cycles, the CV curves show the similar profiles, indicating the reversibility of SnO2/NPPC-3 electrode during Na insertion and extraction process.(3)SnO2 + 4Na+ + 4e− → Sn + 2Na2O(4)Sn + xNa+ + xe− ↔ NaxSn (0 ≤ x ≤ 3.75)",
                        "Galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles are further used to reveal the electrochemical behaviors of obtained materials. Fig. 6c, d, and S4 show the first three discharge–charge cycles of NPPC, SnO2/NPPC-3, and SnO2 at 50 mA g−1 in a potential range of 0.001–3.0 V, respectively. For SnO2/NPPC-3, a plateau between 1.3 and 1.0 V is related to the irreversible reaction of SnO2 (Reaction (3)) and the formation of SEI layer [5]. In the following charge process, the slope plateau between 1.2 and 1.5 V is corresponded to the dealloying reaction of NaxSn as displayed in Reaction (4) [13]. These results are well consistent with the results obtained from the CV curves. The initial discharge capacity of SnO2/NPPC-3 is 928 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, while the initial charge capacity is 393 mAh g−1. For the second cycle, SnO2/NPPC-3 possesses the discharge capacities of 423 mAh g−1, which is much higher than NPPC (344 mAh g−1) and SnO2 (42 mAh g−1). In the third cycle, SnO2/NPPC-3 exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 92.4%, which is higher than NPPC (85.9%) and SnO2 (84.3%). Therefore, SnO2/NPPC-3 possesses a better electrochemical performance as compared with NPPC and SnO2.",
                        "Rate performances and long-life cycling measurements are further studied to evaluate the electrochemical properties of SnO2/NPPC materials. Fig. 7a shows the rate capacities of SnO2, NPPC, and SnO2/NPPC materials measured at the various current densities with a potential window of 0.001–3.0 V in SIBs. At the current density of 50 mA g−1, SnO2/NPPC-3 possesses a discharge capacity of 423 mAh g−1, which is higher than SnO2 (42 mAh g−1), NPPC (344 mAh g−1), and other two SnO2/NPPC materials (320 mAh g−1 for SnO2/NPPC-1 and 378 mAh g−1 for SnO2/NPPC-2, respectively). When the current density increases to 0.1 A g−1, the discharge capacity of SnO2/NPPC-1, SnO2/NPPC-2, and SnO2/NPPC-3 are 258, 302, and 367 mAh g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of SnO2 (21 mAh g−1) and NPPC (241 mAh g−1). At a high current density of 5 A g−1, SnO2/NPPC-3 still possesses a discharge capacity of 100 mAh g−1, which is higher than other four electrodes. Table S1 displays the comparison of reversible capacities for different SnO2-based anodes in SIBs. It can be seen that SnO2/NPPC-3 obtained in this work possesses the competitive reversible capacities as compared with other SnO2-based materials published in literatures.",
                        "Figs. 7b and S5 show the Coulombic efficiencies and cycle life of SnO2, NPPC, and SnO2/NPPC materials measured at 0.2 A g−1 with a potential range of 0.001–3.0 V in SIBs. After running for 80 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, SnO2/NPPC-3 still possesses a reversible capacity of 278 mAh g−1, which is much higher than SnO2 (18 mAh g−1), NPPC (122 mAh g−1), SnO2/NPPC-1 (212 mAh g−1), and SnO2/NPPC-2 (211 mAh g−1). The Coulombic efficiencies of SnO2/NPPC materials increase above 90% from the third cycle. However, it needs 20 or 30 more cycles for the bare SnO2 and NPPC to arrive above 90% for the Coulombic efficiencies. Therefore, the composite of SnO2 nanoparticles and NPPC can obviously enhance the electrochemical performance for electrodes in SIBs. Nyquist plots of SnO2, NPPC, and SnO2/NPPC-3 after 10 cycles at 0.05 A g−1 in SIBs are shown in Fig. 7c. As compared with NPPC and SnO2, in high frequency region, SnO2/NPPC-3 possesses a smaller diameter of semicircle, indicating the lower charge transfer resistance of SnO2/NPPC-3. This phenomenon can explain the reason why SnO2/NPPC-3 possesses better electrochemical performance as compared with NPPC and SnO2. The good Na storage capacity of SnO2/NPPC-3 is ascribed to the synergetic effect between SnO2 nanoparticles and NPPC.",
                        "The enhanced rate performance, high reversible capacity, and good cycling stability of SnO2/NPPC materials in LIBs and SIBs can be attributed to the small size of SnO2 nanoparticles, the conductive NPPC, the doping of the heteroatoms, and the Sn–O–C bonding between carbon matrix and SnO2 nanoparticles. (1) Owing to the small size of SnO2 nanoparticles (<5.0 nm), the Li+/Na+ transport path is shortened and the charge transfer resistance is reduced [55]. Meanwhile, the fine dispersion of the SnO2 nanoparticles in the carbon matrix reduces the strain during cycling. (2) The Sn–O–C bonding between carbon matrix and SnO2 nanoparticles makes SnO2 nanoparticles less likely to aggregate or fall off during the discharge and charge process [56]. The nanoconfinement of SnO2 nanoparticles in porous carbon matrix also facilitates the electrochemical properties of the electrodes in LIBs and SIBs [8]. (3) The presence of porous structure in SnO2/NPPC can also provide an available access to let the electrolyte enter the material. (4) The presence of Sn–N bonding can improve the electrochemical performance for SIBs and LIBs [14]. (5) The doping of N and P can further provide abundant voids for the penetration of Li+/Na+ into the interior of the electrode during the insertion process [54]. Therefore, the good electrochemical properties for SnO2/NPPC materials can be ascribed to the synergetic effect between NPPC and SnO2 nanoparticles."

During Li/Na insertion and desertion process, the Sn–O–C bonding and nanoconfinement effect between carbon matrix NPPC and SnO2 nanoparticles can prevent the aggregation and contact losses of SnO2 nanoparticles in SnO2/NPPC. The doping of N and P can provide abundant voids for the penetration of Li+/Na+ into the interior of the electrode. In addition, the presence of Sn–N bonding can further improve the electrochemical properties. Thus, as an anode material for SIBs and LIBs, SnO2/NPPC exhibits a competitive electrochemical performance as compared with many other materials in the previously reported researches. This work can not only provide an approach to prepare a composite that ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles anchored on NPPC, but also supply an inspiration for the preparation of anode materials in LIBs and SIBs."
