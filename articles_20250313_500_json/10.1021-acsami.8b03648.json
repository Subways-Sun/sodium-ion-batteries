                "Rechargeable batteries, which could promote the shift from petrol (gasoline)-powered vehicles to electrically powered vehicles, have attracted extensive attention for decades.  However, the further application of traditional lithium-ion batteries for large-scale electric energy storage systems (EESs) is hindered by the high cost and limited lithium resources.  Therefore, more and more researchers are working on alternative rechargeable batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),  potassium-ion batteries,  metal–sulfur batteries,  and dual-ion batteries (DIBs).  Among the various rechargeable batteries, DIBs are considered to be the effective, low cost, and eco-friendly EESs for energy storage.  As we know, the energy density of the whole battery could be improved by improving the voltage of the cathode or lowering the voltage of the anode. Therefore, it is important to develop advanced cathode/anode materials to meet the need of the high-energy SIBs.  It is known that the anions could insert/desert into/from graphite cathodes at high voltage in DIBs, which could improve the voltage of the full cell, further leading to enhanced energy density. Moreover, the abundant and low cost graphite resources will further reduce the cost of the batteries. In addition, these merits have made the graphite a promising cathode for DIBs. In contrast to the traditional rocking-chair batteries, cations together with anions are contributing to the specific capacities of DIBs during charge/discharge processes.  Typically, the anions/cations in the electrolyte intercalate into cathode/anode materials during the charge process and deintercalate from cathode/anode back to the electrolyte during the discharge process.  In the past, extensive investigation of electrolytes in DIBs focused on lithium-based salts and other ionic liquids.  Until recently, the sodium-based DIBs (NDIBs) have been developed and attracted much attention because of the abundance and low cost of sodium resources. ",
                "It is known that the anodes of SIBs usually suffer from a large amount of sodium loss because of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation during the initial cycle, and the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of SIBs mostly is lower than 70%.  In the sodium half cells, the influence of this trouble is unconspicuous because of the far in excess of sodium in the sodium electrode. As this problem will result in severe issues in the full cells, including low capacity, inferior cycle stability, and limited lifespan, it should be treated with caution. The NDIBs suffer from, not surprisingly, low Coulombic efficiency and inferior cycle stability as well.  In addition, the low capacity of carbonaceous anode and the sodium depletion in the electrolyte would significantly reduce the capacity and energy density of NDIBs. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new anode materials with high capacity and new methods to offset the initial irreversible loss of sodium ions. ",
                "In this contribution, we synthesized a high capacity phosphorus-doped soft carbon (P-SC) anode and demonstrated a valid approach to offset the initial sodium loss via anode presodiation. As a consequence, the NDIBs with the P-SC anode after presodiation exhibited improved Coulombic efficiency (>90%), high discharge capacity (118 mA h g–1 at 500 mA g–1), excellent rate performance, and long cycle stability (81 mA h g–1 after 900 cycles at 1000 mA g–1 with capacity retention of 81.8%), much superior to the unsodiated NDIBs (u-NDIBs), which delivers poor Coulombic efficiency of 75% and inferior cycle stability (44 mA h g–1 after 400 cycles at 1000 mA g–1 with a capacity retention of 47.8%)."

                        "The P-SC or SC/acetylene black/carboxyl methylated cellulose (7:2:1, w/w/w) was dissolved into the solution of C2H5OH/H2O (1:2.5, w/w) and stirred for 8 h. The mixture was pasted onto a thin copper foil and then dried at 65 °C in a vacuum oven. The weight of the active material was about 0.8–1.2 mg cm–2. The graphite cathode was prepared with a weight ratio of graphite/acetylene black/carboxyl methylated cellulose (8:1:1, w/w/w) and casted onto an aluminum foil. Sodium-ion half cells (SIBs) were assembled with 2032-type coin cell in a glovebox under Ar (H2O <0.5 ppm, O2 <0.5 ppm) using sodium metal as the counter electrode. The sodium-based dual-ion full cells (NDIBs) were assembled with graphite as the cathode; the weight ratio of graphite/P-SC in NDIBs is around 3:1, which is the optimized cathode/anode capacity ratio. The electrolyte used for NDIBs was 1 M NaPF6 in EC/DMC (6:4, v/v). The separator membrane used for both SIBs and NDIBs was Whatman G/A. The amount of the electrolyte for each cell was around 60 μL for SIBs and 120 μL for NDIBs. The galvanostatic charge/discharge process was investigated via Arbin Instrument BT 2000 model. For SIBs, the charge/discharge voltage range was 3.0–0.01 V (vs Na+/Na). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were performed in the electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 with a voltage range from 3.0 to 0.01 V (vs Na+/Na). For the NDIBs and the graphite cathode in the SIB, the galvanostatic charge/discharge processes were all investigated with the voltage range of 2.0–4.7 V. All the capacities were calculated from the weight of the anode materials. The anode presodiation process was as the following. The P-SC was assembled for SIBs and cycled for one cycle to allow the formation of SEI in the anode, and then, the P-SC electrode was taken out from the SIBs and assembled for NDIBs for the subsequent measurements."

                "It is reported that SC synthesized at a high temperature of 900 °C exhibits high ICE around 80% for SIBs recently, and when the SC was used as an anode for NDIBs, the battery could deliver excellent cycle stability and Coulombic efficiency.  Therefore, in order to acquire high capacity anode with low ICE (<70%) for sodium storage, SC and P-SC were facilely synthesized at a relative low temperature of 600 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted to investigate the morphology of the as prepared P-SC and SC. The SEM image of P-SC () clearly revealed that the structure of P-SC was composed of many microrods, with the diameter of a single microrod about 1 μm. It was clear that the surface of the single microrod was quite smooth, which was confirmed via the SEM and TEM images in a,b. Furthermore, the transversal striations were observed in both SEM and TEM images (), which could be interpreted as the oriented crystallite growth of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) during the pyrolysis process.  High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was performed to investigate some selected micro area of the P-SC. As shown in , lattice fringes with a specific orientation were observed, consistent with the oriented crystallite growth of PTCDA, indicating the existence of the localized microcrystalline structure in P-SC. In order to investigate the element distribution of P-SC, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (c) was performed. The EDS elemental mapping showed the uniform distribution of carbon, oxygen, and phosphorus, indicating that the phosphorus atoms had been homogeneously doped into the carbonaceous substrate. The atomic contents of C, O and P were 93.68, 5.22 and 1.09%, respectively.",
                "As a comparison, the SEM image of SC () revealed that the SC also had a microrod structure with a diameter of a single microrod about 3–5 μm, which was much bigger than that of P-SC. The transversal striations could also be observed in SEM () and TEM images (). In addition, unconspicuous lattice fringes were observed in the HRTEM image (), indicating the disordered structure of SC. The different morphologies between P-SC and SC (as observed from the SEM and TEM images) were probably because of the phosphorus doping in P-SC. For the nature of the sp2-bond of carbon, the electron-rich P-SC lattices could easily lead to “out of plane” bonding configurations, which may induce curvature and closure of the system during growth. Hence, the microrod size of P-SC became smaller. ",
                "To further characterize P-SC and SC, XRD and XPS measurements were performed. The XRD patterns () of P-SC and SC exhibit two major humpy peaks at around 24.8° and 43.2°, corresponding to the (002) and (100) planes of SC, respectively.  Moreover, XPS measurements were carried out to further investigate the chemical structures of P-SC and SC.  shows the full survey XPS of P-SC. Five peaks at around 18, 135, 192, 285, and 533 eV were assigned to the O 2s, P 2p, P 2s, C 1s, and O 2s, respectively. In addition, the amount of C, O, and P in P-SC calculated via XPS was 93.15, 5.77, and 1.08% by atomic content, respectively, close to the values determined by EDS. The high-resolution P 2p XPS spectrum of P-SC in  showed two main peaks at 134.2 and 135.0 eV, corresponding to the bond of P–O and P–C, respectively.  The XPS results indicated that the phosphorus atoms had been successfully and uniformly incorporated into the P-SC. In contrast, the full survey XPS curve of SC () revealed only three peaks at 18, 285, and 533 eV, attributed to O 2s, C 1s, and O 1s, respectively. The amount of C and O in SC was 98.36 and 1.64% by the atomic content, respectively. Besides, Raman spectra () were used to evaluate the degree of structural formation of P-SC and SC. There are two distinct peaks located at around 1340 and 1485 cm–1, corresponding to the D band and G band, respectively. Generally, the intensity ratio (ID/IG) of D band and G band could be used for gauge for the amount of structure defects.  It is obvious that the ID/IG increased from 0.971 for SC to 1.098 for P-SC, and this phenomenon might be due to the increased content of phosphorus and oxygen functional groups in P-SC encouraging it to be more disordered. In addition, the increased functional groups in P-SC are beneficial for the electrode to obtain high capacity.",
                "To evaluate the total specific surface area (SSA) of P-SC and SC, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms measurements were conducted. As shown in , the SSA of P-SC was only 1.15 m2 g–1, with the pore diameters () of P-SC around 5–14 nm. As a comparison, the SSA of SC is 9.81 m2 g–1, with the pore diameters around 20–60 nm (). The low surface area of P-SC and SC indicated the close packing of P-SC and SC, which was beneficial for obtaining high volumetric energy density.",
                "In order to explore the effect of the phosphorus doping, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were implemented with pristine carbon and different phosphorus-doped carbon chemical structures (d). The bonding between atoms was analyzed from electronic density states. It could be found that the DOS of the SC (named as C) and P-SC with possible structures (including C–P, P–O–C, and P–O C) (e) elucidates that both the SC and P-SC were metallic, which is similar to the reported results.  Besides, remarkable new peaks nearby the Fermi energy level in the conduction band were brought by the incorporation of phosphorus and oxygen atoms into the carbon and forming bonds of C–P, C–P–O–C, or C–P–O. In other words, the phosphorus atom or phosphorus–oxygen bonds incorporated into SC would improve the metallic behavior and interrupt the polarized transport degeneracy of the SC, resulting in a transformation of SC from the intrinsic semiconductor to n-type semiconductor, which is conducive to the fast sodium storage performance.  We also performed the electronic conductivity of P-SC and SC to meet the DOS result. The electronic conductivity of P-SC was 9.79 × 10–3 S/cm, which was an order of magnitude larger than that of SC (7.46 × 10–4 S/cm). Finally, the peaks at the Fermi energy of sodium overlapped with other elements for P-SC with C–P and C–P–O–C bonds (), indicating interaction between them, while, no peaks at the Fermi energy of sodium for SC and P-SC with C–P–O bonds appeared (). Furthermore, the Na-adsorption energies of P-SC with C–P were more negative than that of SC, which was consistent with the recent findings.  Above all, the DFT calculation further indicated that the phosphorus-doping could enhance the sodium storage properties.",
                "In order to investigate the Na+ storage capacity of P-SC and SC, half cells were assembled in a glovebox using sodium metal as the counter electrode. CV curves were performed to investigate the Na+ storage mechanism of P-SC and SC. As shown in , the CV curves of P-SC exhibited a broad peak at 1.0–0.3 V in the initial discharge process, which disappeared in the subsequent cycles. The broad peak was believed to be mainly due to the formation of the SEI.  Nonetheless, in the subsequent discharge cycles, a sloping region located at 0.25–1.0 V was observed, which was attributed to the Na+ reacted with the functional groups in the P-SC. In addition, the cathode peak at around 0.01 V was mainly due to the Na+ insert into the SC.  During the charge processes, only a humpy peak located at 0.1–1.0 V was observed, which could be interpreted as the deintercalation of Na+ from the SC and the functional groups. As a comparison, the discharge processes of SC () only revealed one peak at around 0.01 V. This could be due to the lack of P atoms in the SC, leading to less functional group. In addition, this reason could be used to explain the disappearance of the humpy sloping region of 0.5–1.0 V during discharge of SC when compared with P-SC.",
                "Different electrochemical properties between P-SC and SC could be further confirmed via the charge/discharge profiles (). According to the initial discharge/charge curves of P-SC and SC, the discharge/charge capacity of P-SC and SC were 478/283 mA h g–1 and 323/180 mA h g–1, corresponding to an ICE of 59.2 and 55.7%, respectively. Again, the large irreversible sodium loss during the initial cycle was attributed to the formation of the SEI. Besides, the discharge profiles of P-SC and SC could be divided into two regions. The high voltage region of P-SC and SC at 1.0–0.25 V could be interpreted as the Na+ reacted with the functional groups in the carbonaceous substrate and the low voltage platform below 0.25 V was due to the insertion of Na+ into the SC. It was clear that the discharge capacity of P-SC (312 mA h g–1) was higher than that of SC (196 mA h g–1) at the high voltage region (over 0.25 V vs Na+/Na), which again could be accounted for more functional groups of P-SC than that of SC. The superior electrochemical property of P-SC could be further demonstrated by rate performance (a). Apparently, P-SC showed higher capacity at various current densities than that of SC. The P-SC (vs SC) delivered a capacity of 256 (vs 195), 245 (vs 162), 220 (vs 140), 204 (vs 126), 193 (vs 115), 180 (vs 108), and 131 (vs 41) mA h g–1 at various current densities of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 2000 mA g–1, respectively. The corresponding discharge/charge curves of P-SC and SC at various current densities are shown in , respectively. Notably, when the current density returned back to 100 mA g–1 after 80 cycles at various current densities, the P-SC (vs SC) could still recover a reversible capacity of 252 (vs 171) mA h g–1, indicating the excellent rate recyclability of both P-SC and SC.",
                "In addition to the outstanding rate performance, P-SC also exhibited preeminent long cycle stability (b,c). b shows the cycle stability of P-SC at a current density of 100 mA g–1. A reversible capacity of 242 mA h g–1 was obtained even after 500 times of repeated discharge/charge processes (with capacity retention of 89.7% or capacity decay of 0.0206% per cycle, based on the capacity of the second discharge). It was worth mentioning that when the environment temperature decreased to 15 °C, a capacity of 220 mA h g–1 could still be retained (91.6% capacity maintained with respect to the capacity at 25 °C) at 100 mA g–1. When the environment temperature rose back to 25 °C, the capacity still could recover to 240 mA h g–1. For convenience, the discharge/charge curves of P-SC at different cycles and different temperatures are shown in . There was no obvious difference in the charge/discharge platform of P-SC after 500 cycles, indicating the superior cyclability of P-SC. Furthermore, the cycle stability of SC () and P-SC (c) was further investigated at a high current density of 2000 mA g–1. Notably, a reversible capacity of 89 mA h g–1 of P-SC still retained even after 3000 cycles, with capacity retention of 68.5% (or capacity decay of 0.010% per cycle) based on the capacity of the second discharge. However, the capacity of SC is relatively low and decayed rapidly. The comparison of the P-SC anode with other carbonaceous anodes reported in previously literatures are presented in .",
                "Besides, the rod structure of the P-SC was maintained even after sequential discharge/charge processes.  shows the SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images of the P-SC after 500 cycles at the current density of 100 mA g–1, respectively. It was obvious that the similar rod structure is still retained. As the rod shape morphology could provide the stable framework and electron transportation channels, which was responsible for the superior long cycle stability.  On the other hand, the phosphorus doping could significantly reduce the impendence of the SIBs (agrees well with the DFT calculations), which was crucial for the P-SC to achieve superior electrochemical properties ().",
                "In view of the superior rate performance and low ICE (59.2%) of the P-SC, the sodium-based dual-ion full batteries (NDIBs) were assembled to investigate the importance of offset the initial sodium loss in NDIBs. The typical charge/discharge profile of graphite cathode in Na half-cells is presented in . The NDIBs were assembled with the configuration of unsodiated P-SC (anode)|NaPF6 (electrolyte)|graphite (cathode), named u-NDIBs. It could be seen that the u-NDIBs delivers an initial charge/discharge capacity of 2673/125 mA g–1, corresponding to an ICE of 4.69% (a). The extremely low ICE of the u-NDIBs was possibly caused by the large amount of sodium loss in the initial cycle (due to the formation of SEI in the anode) and was detrimental for any practical applications. The rate performance of the u-NDIBs (b) showed discharge capacity of 95, 85, 79, 75, 72, and 69 mA h g–1 at the current density of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 mA g–1, respectively. In addition, the corresponding charge/discharge profiles of the u-NDIBs at various current densities are shown in . Furthermore, the cycling of the u-NDIBs (c) exhibited a reversible capacity of 79 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 73.1% based on the second discharge. However, the Coulombic efficiency of the u-NDIBs at 500 mA g–1 is below 80%. Moreover, when the current density increased to 1000 mA g–1 (d), a poor cycling stability was obtained with a reversible capacity of 44 mA h g–1 after 400 cycles, with a capacity retention of only 47.8% based on the second discharge. The large amount SEI formation in the anode during the initial charge process can be the one utmost reason for the inferior electrochemical properties of the u-NDIBs, further resulting in a poor Coulombic efficiency and inferior cycling stability of the u-NDIBs.",
                "To resolve the above problem, we proposed an anode presodiation method prior to assembling the NDIBs. The detailed anode presodiation process was as the following: the P-SC anode was assembled into SIBs first and was cycled only once to allow the formation of the SEI in the P-SC; then, the P-SC electrode was taken out from the SIBs and assembled the NDIBs for the subsequent measurements, named p-NDIBs. The initial charge/discharge profile of the p-NDIBs (a) exhibited a charge/discharge capacity of 309/112 mA h g–1, corresponding to an ICE of 36.2%, which was around 8 times higher than that of u-NDIBs. The typical CV curve at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s–1 is shown in . Moreover, the cycle stability of the NDIBs after presodiation was also improved significantly. It could deliver a reversible capacity over 110 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles without obvious capacity decay (b). The Coulombic efficiency increased to 95% after a few cycles, much higher than that of u-NDIBs (beneath 80%). Furthermore, when a high current density of 1000 mA g–1 was applied (c), a reversible capacity of 81 mA h g–1 was obtained after 900 cycles with capacity retention of 81.8%, corresponding to a capacity decay of 0.02% per cycle. It was worth mentioning that the Coulombic efficiency was up to 98%, except for the initial several cycles.",
                "The p-NDIBs not only presented excellent cycle stability and high Coulombic efficiency but also exhibited superior rate performance. The p-NDIBs delivered a discharge capacity of 108, 98, 89, 83, 78, and 73 mA h g–1 at the current density of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 mA g–1, respectively (d). Furthermore, when the p-NDIBs was stored for 24 h after various cycles, it still delivered excellent cycling stability and rate performance, with a reversible capacity of 118 mA h g–1 at 500 mA g–1 even after 200 cycles at various current densities. In particular, the p-NDIBs exhibited Coulombic efficiency over 90% after several cycles, which was much higher than that of u-NDIBs. In addition, when the current density is increased from 1000 to 3000 mA g–1, the Coulombic efficiency is also improved to 95–99.99%. Again, when the current density returned back to 500 mA g–1, a relative high Coulombic efficiency of 95% still could be obtained. The corresponding charge/discharge profiles of the p-NDIBs at various current densities are shown in . It should be noted that the superior electrochemical properties of p-NDIBs are comparable to the previous work (). Besides, the cycle performance of the NDIBs with the SC anode before and after anode presodiation was also performed. As shown in , the NDIB after presodiation exhibits more stable cycle performance than that without presodiation, which also further demonstrated the favorable influence of the anode presodiation process on the cycle stability of NDIBs.",
                "To investigate the mechanism of the significant improvement in electrochemical performance for NDIBs after presodiation, SEM and XPS measurements of the P-SC electrode of NDIBs and SIBs after the initial cycle were conducted (). The SEM images of the P-SC electrode (a–c) after the initial cycle revealed the formation of the SEI. In addition, the XPS measurements (d,e) were conducted to confirm the SEI on the surface of the P-SC electrode. The distinct peaks of F 1s and Na 1s were observed for the both P-SC electrodes in the full survey XPS curves, and the atomic ratio of the F/Na is 20.87%:23.03% and 21.81%:21.31% for the P-SC electrode after presodiation and after the initial cycle of NDIBs, respectively. Moreover, the high-resolution F 1s XPS of the P-SC reflected that the F element for P-SC was from NaF although there was little PF6– in the P-SC electrode of NDIBs after the initial cycles. In other words, the formation of NaF during the SEI formation consumed the Na+ in the electrolyte, which might break the balance of the Na+ and PF6– in the electrolyte.",
                "In addition, the XRD measurements for graphite cathode were conducted after one cycle for the u-NDIBs and p-NDIBs (a) to investigate the influence of the initial sodium loss which was offset by anode presodiation. It was obvious that the graphite was almost fully recovered for the p-NDIBs, while there was still a humpy peak around 26° for the u-NDIBs. The XRD humpy peak around 26° for the u-NDIBs was probably due to the PF6– residues in the graphite cathode. This was attributed to the SEI formation during the initial charge process of the u-NDIBs, resulting in large amount of sodium loss and thus the PF6– residues left in the graphite (b). On the other hand, for the p-NDIBs, the SEI had formed during the presodiation process (c), which could avoid the large amount sodium loss during cycling. Consequently, most of the PF6– in p-NDIBs could be deserted from the graphite cathode during discharge process, and the graphite would recover more readily (d)."
