                "The undesirable phase transformation of Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes is a tremendous challenge in commercializing Mn-based oxide cathodes for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, Na0.67MnO2 cathode with stable P2-type structure was successfully synthesized by modulating its coordination numbers to suppress the preferred orientation growth of (0 0 1) crystal plane, which was realized to maintain a stable P2-type structure in the whole state of charging and discharging. Specifically, designing Mn2+ six coordination sites to lower the high surface energy of (0 0 1) crystal plane is an effective way to reduce nucleation rates, which leads to the production of few grain boundaries and the suppression of layer-to-layer stacking in the crystal growth stage. Due to their fewer grain boundaries and skeleton structure with layer-to-layer stacking, the interlaminar stress and intragranular fatigue cracks can be alleviated in the long-life cycling performance of Na0.67MnO2 cathode. Na0.67MnO2 cathodes derived from the precursor of Mn2+ six coordination sites (C-Na0.67MnO2) have more exposed {0 1 0} crystal face and enlarged sodium-ion diffusion channels and structure integrity compared to Na0.67MnO2 cathode prepared by the precursor of Mn2+ four coordination sites (O-Na0.67MnO2). Therefore, C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode delivers an initial capacity of 106.8 mAh/g and has excellent capacity retention of 94.8 % after 150 cycles at 80 mAh/g. The rational design strategy endows Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes with stable sodium-ion diffusion channels and lamellar structure."

                "The ever-growing demand for portable electronics and electric vehicles has strongly led to the development of low-cost energy storage techniques, which compensate for the depletion of lithium resources and reduce the cost of electric vehicles [1], [2], [3]. The sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology has shown to be a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries, with the merit of wide geographical distribution, rich natural abundance and inexpensive cost in comparison to Li. P2-layered oxide cathodes have attracted a great deal of attention due to their low-cost, desirable sodium-ion diffusion channels and relatively high structural stability [4], [5]. In contrast to other layered oxide cathodes, such as Na0.66Li0.22Ru0.78O2[6], Na0.78Co1/2Mn1/3Ni1/6O2[7], there is high competition for Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes due to their low cost, low toxicity, environmental friendliness, and abundance in nature. However, P2-type Na0.67MnO2 cathode is hampered by the following issues: (1) irreversible phase transitions stemming from P2-OP4 and P2- P2 structure transition during cycling,[8] (2) loss of active materials on the electrode resulting from cracked particles reacting with electrolyte, (3) poor air-stability.",
                "Extensive efforts have been devoted to enhancing the structural stability of Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes, which makes them to have long-life cycling performance. The structure modulation technology has been classified into morphology design, doping-integrated coating technology and engineering of biphasic hybridization, such as uniform P2-Na0.7MnO2 microspheres cathode [9], Al2O3@P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2[10] and (Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2)@ P2-Na0.66Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 cathodes[11], P2/O3 biphasic Na0.67Mn0.55Ni0.25Ti0.2–xLixO2 [12] and P2(76 %)/P3(23 %)-Na0.66Mn0.5Co0.5O2[13] cathodes. A novel Al2O3@Na0.67Zn0.1Mn0.9O2 oxide cathode was successfully synthesized to suppress P2- P2 structure transition by Yang’s group [14]. The coating layer of Al2O3 prevented organic electrolytes from decomposing, which made the cathode to have a high capacity retention of up to 83 %. Philipp Adelhelm et al reported a facile strategy for preparing a Co– and Ni-Free P2/O3 biphasic Na0.8Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode, which realized the initial reversible capacity of 174 mAh/g, and capacity retention of 82 % after 100 cycles [15]. However, the design of morphology may cause the particles of the materials to crack, which is due to the constrained release of interlaminar stresses on specific morphology, and it is required to precisely control experimental parameters. The doping-integrated coating technique is known to increase the diffusion resistance of sodium-ion in the solid materials and it is difficult to control the thickness of coating layer and obtain uniform coating layer on the whole cathodes. Furthermore, with the doping technique, it is not easy to determine the position of the dopant elements, and it even requires advanced precision instruments for measuring the site occupancy and location of atoms. Engineering of biphasic hybridization is an important factor in increasing the degree of cation mixing and boosting of O redox activity inevitably, leading to irreversible structural changes. Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes have poor structural stability and cycling performance.[35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40] Hence, we report that controlling coordination numbers to suppress the preferred orientation growth of precursors with {0 0 1} active facet plays a critical role in determining electrochemically active planes for Na+ migration. Also, it reduces the number of layers stacked along the [0 0 1] crystallographic direction, which provides stable sodium-ion diffusion channels and alleviates interlaminar stresses. It is well-known that inhibiting the growth of lattice planes with high surface energy can reduce the rate of nucleation, leading to the realization of few grain boundaries in the whole electrode. So, the bulk Na0.67MnO2 with multiple grain boundaries can suffer from tremendous stress in long-life cycling. Meanwhile, inhibiting {0 0 1} active facet favors the faster growth of {0 1 0} active facet, enabling the electrode with large sodium-ion diffusion channels. By mitigating interlaminar stresses, the lamellar structure of C-Na0.67MnO2 appears to only crack, whereas the lamellar structure of O-Na0.67MnO2 seems to be completely separated, compared to the pristine structure in the high-rate or long-life cycling. Furthermore, the exposed active surfaces of O-Na0.67MnO2 lead to the loss of active materials and capacity decay. Therefore, C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode can have outstanding capacity retention of 94.8 % (109.8 mAh/g) after 150 cycles at 0.5C (80 mAh/g)."

                "As shown in Fig. 1a and1b, the unit of MnC6H4O7 has six carboxyl coordination sites while the unit of MnC2O4 possesses four carboxyl coordination sites [16], [17]. These can lead to the production of two exposed crystal faces with high surface energy for MnC2O4 in the high-temperature pyrolysis. As the exposed crystal faces have high surface energy, Fig. S3c shows that the precursor of O-Na0.67MnO2 has distinctive (0 0 1) preferred orientation compared to the other samples, and the intensity of the diffraction peaks is twice that of the other samples (Fig. S3f). The crystalline structures and phase purity of A-Na0.67MnO2, O-Na0.67MnO2 and C-Na0.67MnO2 were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the Rietveld refinement analysis of C-Na0.67MnO2 XRD pattern is presented in Figure S1. It can be seen from Figure S1 that all the characteristic peaks can be well indexed to a typical P2 phase with the P63/mmc space group (Na0.7MnO2.05-type, JCPDS 27–0751), and C-Na0.67MnO2 and O-Na0.67MnO2 have distinctly preferred orientation compared to A-Na0.67MnO2. This shows that coordination design can lead to the realization of the preferred orientation and high degree of crystallinity. Meanwhile, the grain size of C-Na0.67MnO2 is 949 nm, which is larger than that of O-Na0.67MnO2 (706 nm). Regarding O-Na0.67MnO2, the smaller the grain size, the more the grain boundaries are exposed, which can make it very difficult to alleviate interlaminar stresses. The particles of O-Na0.67MnO2 gave rise to larger interlaminar cracks in the long-life cycling. Finally, the newly exposed active facets underwent a side reaction to produce new cathode-electrolyte interphase, which resulted in capacity decay. In contrast to O-Na0.67MnO2, C-Na0.67MnO2 has the larger lattice parameter c (11.24 Å) in Figure S2 than O-Na0.67MnO2 (11.12 Å), so C-Na0.67MnO2 electrode has greater lattice parameter c. This shows it has a more exposed {0 1 0} active facet, and large sodium-ion diffusion channels.",
                "The morphology of the as-prepared cathode particles was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Fig. 2a-c shows that all the as-prepared cathode particles consist of micrometer sized particles with approximately 1–2 μm in diameter and C-Na0.67MnO2 particles have smoother surfaces and less agglomeration than the other particles. As depicted in Fig. 2a-c, O-Na0.67MnO2 particles have very distinctive streaks on the transverse sides; whereas there are no streaks in the C-Na0.67MnO2 particles. From the result of XRD pattern in Fig. S3a and 3d, it can be inferred that the primary particles were accumulated into lines along (0 0 1) crystal facet; the lines were combined with each other to form faces, and finally, the faces grew along the [0 0 1] crystallographic direction to produce skeleton structure with distinctive streaks. In comparison to O-Na0.67MnO2 and C-Na0.67MnO2 particles, the interlaminar structure of A-Na0.67MnO2 has notable cracks, macropores and graininess, indicating poor lamellar structure. In addition, the elemental mappings demonstrated the uniform distribution of Na, Mn and O in C-Na0.67MnO2(Fig. 2i). Fig. 2d and 2 h present the interplanar spacings of 5.49 and 5.51 Å, ascribed to (0 0 2) planes of O-Na0.67MnO2 and C-Na0.67MnO2, respectively. The results are in agreement with the analysis of XRD.",
                "To clearly investigate the correlations between the electrochemical property and coordination design of C-Na0.67MnO2 and O-Na0.67MnO2 cathodes, their electrochemical performance was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3a, C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 106.8 mAh/g, and still retains 100.5 mAh/g after 150 cycles, realizing superior capacity retention of 94.8 %. However, the capacity retention of O-Na0.67MnO2 cathode is merely 66.1 %, and the reversible capacity of C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode exceeds 80.2 mAh/g compared to that of O-Na0.67MnO2 cathode. Fig. 3e displays that the charge/discharge profiles of C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode have no capacity decay and fail to undergo a severe voltage fade during cycling; whereas O-Na0.67MnO2 cathode undergoes a severe voltage fade and capacity decay in the 50th, 100th and 150th cycles (Fig. 3b), indicating it has stable sodium-ion diffusion channels and structural integrity.[18], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34] As shown in Fig. 3c and 3f, when the current density increases to 5C, O-Na0.67MnO2 cathode suffers from a severe specific capacity decay (8 mAh/g), while C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode still retains its capacity of 48 mAh/g, revealing it has poor sodium-ion diffusion channels and unstable lamellar structure. Fig. 3d shows that the current density increases by 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 50-folds, C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode has the capacity retention of 95 %, 87 %, 74 % and 48 % of discharge capacity (100 mAh/g), respectively. C-Na0.67MnO2 electrode still delivers the initial specific capacity of 80 mAh/g at the high current densities of 320 mAh/g, realizing high capacity retention of 75 % after 300 cycles (Fig. 3g).",
                "In order to probe the sodium-ion diffusion kinetics of C-Na0.67MnO2 and O-Na0.67MnO2 cathodes, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry were applied to reveal the kinetic characteristics of Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes.[19], [20] It can be seen from Fig. 4a and 4b that the sodium-ion diffusion coefficient (DNa+) of C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode is 2.87 × 10−8 cm2 s−1, which exceeds that of O-Na0.67MnO2 cathode (2.46 × 10−8 cm2 s−1). The corresponding CV curves are displayed in Figure S4 and Figure S5.[21], [22] The results once again prove the existence of large sodium-ion diffusion channels for C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode, which are in accordance with the analysis of electrochemical performance. As shown in Fig. 4c and 4d, the corresponding average DNa+ of C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode is around 4.74 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 in the rectangular area (Fig. 4d); while the average DNa+ of O-Na0.67MnO2 cathode is around 2.65 × 10−9 cm2 s−1. When the potential decreases from 4.2 to 3.8 V corresponding rectangular area (Fig. 4d), the DNa+ of C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode still goes back to around 10−8 cm2 s−1, which is ∼ 10 times higher than that of O-Na0.67MnO2 cathode. Compared with O-Na0.67MnO2 cathodes, the improving DNa+ suggests C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode has superior structural integrity and stable lamellar structure. O-Na0.67MnO2 cathodes undergo severe DNa+ decay at the end of the discharge. It corresponds to circular marquee area, which can be ascribed to the destruction of the lamellar structure stemming from Jahn-Teller transitions [23], [24], [25], [26].",
                "SEM and XRD were used to investigate the characteristics of the morphological, microstructural and crystal structure evolution of C-Na0.67MnO2 and O-Na0.67MnO2cathodes after cycling. It was done to unravel the effect of coordination design. It can be observed from Fig. 5a and 5d that there are obvious cracks in O-Na0.67MnO2 electrodes, which stemmed from the accumulated interlaminar stress caused by the resistance of crystal boundaries of the lamellar structure to crack propagation. Compared with O-Na0.67MnO2 electrodes, C-Na0.67MnO2 electrodes still maintain their electrode integrity, and they have residual porous glass fibers as membrane on their surface (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b and 5e, there are multiple fracturings in O-Na0.67MnO2 particle, while C-Na0.67MnO2 particle has only one mini open crack. The illustration of microstructural structure evolution was used to describe the destruction of lamellar structure integrity, which stemmed from the stripes that evolved from multiple grain boundaries in O-Na0.67MnO2 particle (Fig. 5c). However, C-Na0.67MnO2 still maintains its particle integrity; it has mini crack after 150 cycles (Fig. 5f). It can be observed from Fig. 5g that the (0 0 2) diffraction peak at 2θ = 15.95°shifts to a lower angle after charging from 2.15 to 2.6 V at 0.2C. It was caused by enhancing the repulsive electrostatic interaction between adjacent MO2 sheets and the irreversible redox reactions. [19], [20], [25] When it charged further from 3.8 up to 4.2 V, the whole diffraction peaks matched well with P2-type structure and the new diffraction peaks at 12.16°corresponded to hydrated peak rather than OP4, O2, or Z phase[27], [28], [29]. This indicates C-Na0.67MnO2 has outstanding structural reversibility. The wide diffraction peaks at 22.55°corresponded to adhesive tape, caused by sticking the electrode material on the adhesive tape in the process of measurement. C-Na0.67MnO2cathode discharged from 4.2 to 3.4 V until it got to 2.8 V, in which the XRD patterns of C-Na0.67MnO2cathode still fit well with P2-type structure. The results of ex-situ XRD patterns suggest that the reaction fails to undergo consecutive phase transitions (P P P) in the overall state of charging and discharging. This demonstrates that inhibiting the preferred orientation growth of {0 0 1} planes, with coordination design of Mn2+ and six carbonyls can help C-Na0.67MnO2cathode to have stable P2-type structure, sodium-ion diffusion channels and structural integrity."

                "In summary, we have successfully synthesized C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode with stable P2-type structure by regulating the preferred orientation of crystal plane. Its excellent cycling performance was due to the mitigation of interlaminar stress and intragranular fatigue cracks, its enlarged sodium-ion diffusion channels and structural integrity. Notably, C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode displays superior capacity retention of 94.8 % after 150 cycles at 80 mAh/g. It is a simple but efficient method to rationally design stable P2-type structure. It introduces new design guidelines that can help to stabilize the structure of layered transition metal cathodes."
