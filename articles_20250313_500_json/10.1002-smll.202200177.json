                "The need for society to transition to a green and sustainable energy economy is pressing with a clear imperative to decarbonize many sectors including electricity generation, transport, and industry. Next‐generation battery technologies are receiving increasing attention, with the promise of decarbonizing transportation systems by providing power sources for electric vehicles, as well as decarbonizing electricity generation by providing integrated grid storage for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.[] Lithium (Li)‐ion batteries (LIBs), which offer high energy and power energy densities with a reasonably long lifetime, are the ideal battery technologies for electric vehicles and mobile devices. For integrated grid‐based storage, sodium (Na)‐ion batteries (NIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative and complement to LIBs, thanks to the abundance, wide availability, and low cost of Na‐based compounds.[]",
                "Unlike conventional LIBs which use graphite for the anode, NIBs have adopted hard carbon (HC) anodes, as Na ions cannot be intercalated into graphite at high concentrations.[] HC has been widely studied as a suitable anode for NIBs and is a disordered material containing regions of planar graphitic stacks, nanopores, curved motifs, edges (with varying terminations), and basal plane (BP) surfaces.[] These carbons can be synthesized from a variety of precursors, including biomass, opening the possibility for these anode materials to play an important part in the circular economy.[] The atomic scale structure of HC is highly complex and dependent on the precursors employed.[] Previous studies have shown that carbon structural motifs, defects, and composition play a major role in the reversible (de)sodiation of HCs.[]",
                "During battery cycling, a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer forms on these HC anodes, the composition of which is dependent on the HC surface structure and the composition of the electrolyte.[] NIB electrolytes usually employ an organic solvent, typically carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC), with a thinning agent such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), or ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) added to overcome the high viscosity and melting point (36 °C) of EC.[] These organic solvents react with the anode surface, leading to the formation of a surface film that can affect the device performance (i.e., the starting points of the SEI).[] The ultimate composition of NIB electrolyte is still under discussion and it is possible that the electrolyte composition will be variable for different NIB chemistries and applications to maximize performance. Most NIBs (and indeed also LIBs) do, however, contain EC, which makes the understanding of the EC‐HC interaction at the atomic scale imperative. Previously, we investigated the effect of the electrolyte salt (NaClO4 and NaPF6) on the SEI formation in HC anodes.[] Here we extend the study to probe the effect of carbon surface structure and defects on EC organic solvent and fragment immobilization. In general, the organic solvent should have a low viscosity, high dielectric constant, good electrochemical stability, thermal stability, and high conductivity of Na‐ions.[] It has been shown that a significant concentration of EC in the electrolyte is beneficial to forming a stable SEI.[] Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of HC anodes in EC: propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte showed that there was no significant further decomposition of electrolyte at the electrode surface after cycling even at 75 °C, indicating that the initial contact between the liquid electrolyte and the solid anode is crucial for the cycling behavior and SEI formation.[] Atomic‐scale understanding of the anode electrolyte interphase is a key step toward more efficient and longer lifetime NIBs. Previous studies have identified SEI constituents due to EC breakdown, with computational studies exploring the reaction pathways and associated transition state barrier heights for EC dissociation in a vacuum, on graphene and metal surfaces.[] Density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) studies provide important insights into the initial stages of electrolyte breakdown and the associated SEI formation. To study the interaction of EC with HC surfaces, previous studies have focused on smooth surfaces, graphene (and graphite) basal planes, and graphite edges.[] It is worth noting that in a realistic battery employing HC as an anode, the EC solvent may also come into contact with heteroatom defects (such as O‐containing defects) and curved motifs commonly found in HC. HC surfaces not only consist of atomically smooth basal plane surfaces but also a degree of curvature, herein forthwith referred to as roughness.[] Employing DFT, we can assess the initial interaction between the EC and these HC surface motifs at the atomic scale.",
                "This paper explores the atomic‐scale initial HC | EC interphase formation, using an array of HC model systems constructed based upon experimental X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization of an HC sample in EC, as well as insights from our previous work.[] The HC models consider surface roughness (as defined in Section ), vacancies, and oxygen from the experimental characterization. We include a series of defects: OC (oxygen substitutional defect), 2OC (double substitutional oxygen defect), VC (carbon vacancy), and OCVC (oxygen substitutional defect with carbon vacancy) at distinct positions in the carbon model. These defects have also been previously identified as playing a significant role in Na storage behavior.[] Herein, we extend to examine the effect of these defects on EC interaction. The interactions of EC with various HC surface morphologies (Section ) and defects (Section ) are then characterized to illustrate the binding and breakdown of EC at the HC surfaces. Finally, AIMD is employed to capture EC breakdown at the disordered surface (Section ). The SEI formation on two HC samples in EC electrolyte is also probed experimentally to validate the computational results in Section ."

                        "In our previous work, we have employed a range of carbon models to represent different motifs in HC anodes.[] These include pristine and defective graphene sheets to model the flat surface using a basal plane (BP) model (see Figure , Supporting Information), and sinusoidal and oval reconstructed surfaces to capture the abrupt surface (see Figure , Supporting Information).[] Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the two hard carbon materials prepared in this work (Figure ), however, suggest that the HC surfaces are not atomically smooth, but that there is a degree of roughness, with a peak to trough distance of 1 nm. Similar observations have also been made previously.[] To approximate this computationally, we have created a rough model containing curved carbon surfaces with a trough of 7.5 Å depth in between the two elevated carbon sheets to represent this roughness (Figure , with the full periodic model shown in Figure , Supporting Information). Whilst this is a significant simplification, it allows the lattice, defects, and their interactions with the EC molecule to be considered in isolation. As H‐terminated graphitic surfaces have previously been shown to be unstable in EC, these surfaces are not included in the current study (previously calculated in ref. [,]."

                        "To assess the interaction of the carbon surfaces with the EC electrolyte, we performed DFT simulations to describe the EC‐surface binding interaction (Figure ). From the adsorption energies (Eads) calculated according to Equation () in Section , no strong interaction between an EC molecule and the model in Figure  could be found. For the rough models, a similar situation is observed. The strongest EC adsorption energy (−0.60 eV) is obtained when the EC carbonyl oxygen sits 2.92 Å from the carbon lattice with the EC molecule aligned toward positions 5–7, that is, the less curved part of the model (Figure ). When the EC molecule sits with the carbonyl oxygen toward one of the carbon planes, and the hydrogen tails toward the other, the adsorption is weaker (Figure ). This indicates that the configuration of the EC molecule in relation to the carbon lattice influences the EC‐carbon interaction. The interaction of EC with a pristine basal plane is very weak, as shown by the low adsorption energy (−0.46 eV, see Supporting Information for more details) obtained when the carbonyl oxygen is closest to the graphene surface. In the case of the rough model (Figure ), the calculated adsorption energies (between −0.42 and −0.6 eV) suggest slightly stronger interactions between the EC molecules and the carbon planes, yet they remain weak. Such a low level of EC adsorption should not lead to EC immobilization at these sites, nor hinder sodium from entering the HC anode, however, it is suggested that the curvature leads to reduced EC mobility, as compared to EC on the basal plane surface.",
                        "To assess the effect of surface roughness on EC mobility, a series of AIMD simulations of the EC‐carbon interface was conducted, whilst varying the trough depth (1–7.5 Å) of the rough model (Figure , Supporting Information). Interestingly, similar EC diffusion coefficients were obtained for all the rough model systems of different trough depths (6.41 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 1 Å, 9.49 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 2 Å, 9.62 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 5 Å, and 7.72 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 7.5 Å), suggesting a degree of model independence when the EC adsorption and diffusion is concerned for the roughness. For comparison, AIMD simulations are also performed for EC molecules on the basal plane interface. The same weakly interacting picture was observed although a slight rumpling of the graphene sheets was seen (Figure , Supporting Information). The calculations confirmed an EC diffusion coefficient of 1.98 × 10−8 m2 s−1 for the basal plane model, higher than those calculated with the rough model of different roughness (indicated by trough depth values). This agrees with the trend in adsorption energy in Figure , with the stronger interaction between EC and the rough models leading to more sluggish EC diffusion than on the basal plane. This observation further confirms that the SEI is expected to be thinner at the basal plane than on edge sites (assuming the higher mobility and lower adsorption energy of EC leads to less trapping and degradation of EC at the basal plane as compared to the rough models), which has previously been observed experimentally in graphite anodes for LIBs.[] In real HC anodes, significant defect and heteroatom concentrations have been identified. To understand the binding and vectors for breakdown, further consideration of the defect‐EC interaction is required."

                        "In our previous work,[] defects have a marked impact on the adsorption characteristics and hence mobility of metal ions in HC. In this work, the effect of the previously considered defects on EC–HC interactions is characterized. A range of defects is considered, including an oxygen substitutional defect (OC), double substitutional oxygen defect (2OC), carbon vacancy (VC), and oxygen substitutional defect with carbon vacancy (OCVC). These defects are placed at different positions in the rough model, according to the seven lattice positions (P1–P7) labeled in Figure . In each case, P1 is at the offset surface and then at each lattice position until the other surface (trough) is reached (P7). Figure  shows the formation energy of each defect at each position.",
                        "As shown in Figure , the defect formation energy generally decreases as the surface top is approached, with either the defect at the surface top (P1) or directly below (P2) being the lowest energy configuration. This is in common with our previous results for HC defects at the curved surface models,[] indicating that the defects would be more likely at the surface top. Some small variations of the defect formation energy are observed with different lattice positions from P1 to P7. This is because the strain increases as the interface (i.e., surface top) is approached, and the interaction between adjacent graphene sheets is also largely absent with the layers being at a maximum separation of 10 Å.[] The same effect was observed for the models with a shallower trough (Figure , Supporting Information). The variations observed from the smooth trend for the OCVC and VC defects can be understood by considering the local strain environment as a function of defect position. This local strain reaches a maximum at P4 where a deviation from the ideal planar structure is at a maximum with a single CC aligned perpendicular to the surface. The introduction of the OCVC and VC defects at this position releases a significant portion of the strain via the relaxation of a 5‐membered ring (and a C‐dangling bond for the VC), resulting in two near planar rings.",
                        "To understand EC interaction with the defective models, the adsorption energy of an EC molecule in the defective rough models (with each defect at different lattice positions P1–P7) was calculated (as shown in Figure  and Figure , Supporting Information), in comparison to the EC adsorption energy on the basal plane (Figure , Supporting Information) and the curved surface (Figure , Supporting Information) with the same defects. Three distinct adsorption regimes are observed in Figure . In P1 and P2, the EC shows surface adsorption interaction with the edge of a single C‐sheet (giving similar adsorption energies and configurations seen for the abrupt surface, in Figure , Supporting Information). P3–P5 shows an intermediate binding behavior as the EC moves from single sheet surface adsorption toward intercalation‐like behavior, where the EC sits between two carbon sheets (just above the trough in Figure ). Finally, the strongest interaction between the EC molecule and the defect is seen for defect sites P5–P7, which represents the intercalation of the EC molecule. There is a clear trend of EC‐carbon lattice interactions strengthening at sites away from the surface top. Interestingly, the EC interaction with the carbon lattice seems unaffected by the nature of the defect in most cases, where similar adsorption energies are shown for different defects. One clear difference is seen at P2 and P5, where EC shows stronger adsorption energy at OC and VC sites than on the 2OC and OCVC sites. The EC molecule on the abrupt surface shows a similar trend (Figure  and Figure , Supporting Information), with only the OC and 2OC defects showing any significant interaction with the EC molecule, but at very low adsorption energies (−0.38 and −0.33 eV, respectively). For the OCVC and VC defect, a clear repulsive interaction is seen (1.02 and 0.77 eV, respectively). For the defective basal plane surfaces, the EC is most strongly bonded to the 2OC defect (Eads = −1.39 eV), and shows similar adsorption energy for the other defects (Eads,Oc = −0.61 eV, Eads,OcVc = −0.54 eV, and Eads,Vc = −0.52 eV). Comparing these adsorption energies to those previously calculated for Na at the same defective basal planes,[] it is clear that Na adsorption is more energetically favorable than EC adsorption, apart from the 2OC defect. Therefore, one can speculate that no competition between Na and EC would be expected due to the much stronger affinity for Na storage at these defect sites. In the case of 2OC, the higher EC binding energy would lead to the potential blocking of Na adsorption sites, proportional to the 2OC defect concentration."

                        "Breakdown mechanisms of EC have been investigated in previous computational work,[] which identified the lowest energy pathway as the dissociative EC → CO32– + C2H4 (for convenience CO32− will henceforth be referred to as CO3).[] At the surface, the EC shows the most favorable binding at the 2Oc defect at the basal plane (Figure ), although does not lead to breakdown (Figure , Supporting Information). In the absence of a clearly identified EC breakdown site involving the individual defects considered, it is reasonable to surmise that the binding followed by breakdown most likely occurs at extended O‐defect clusters. To explore the stability and binding of the most favorable breakdown products (CO3 and C2H4), the adsorption energy in the defective rough models (with each defect at different lattice positions P1–P7) is calculated (as shown in Figure , with optimized geometries shown in Figures  and , Supporting Information), in comparison to the adsorption energy on the basal plane and the curved surface with the same defects.",
                        "As shown in Figure , the EC breakdown product C2H4 shows very weak interaction with most of the defects, aside from the positional variations of the defects in the rough model moving from surface adsorption to intercalation. For CO3 on the basal plane, the magnitude of the binding at the 2OC site is similar to that of Na adsorption (−0.67 eV),[] resulting in competition between Na and the fragments thereby reducing the effective Na capacity.",
                        "The CO3 fragment proves to be more reactive, showing much stronger adsorption energies (Figure ) when compared to those of EC and C2H4 (Figures  and ). This stronger interaction was observed to lead to the breakdown of CO3 to CO2 and an oxygen functional group at the defect site (a variety of breakdown sites and positions are possible as shown in Figure , Supporting Information), functionalizing the surface. Figure  shows the variation in adsorption energy, where on the P1 site (surface top) OC shows the same behavior as described for the abrupt surface (Figure , Supporting Information), with CO added to the unsaturated C, opposite the two‐fold O (Figure ). This oxygen functional group is similar to the CO motif identified to be energetically favorable at the abrupt surface in our previous work,[] indicating that this might be one of the origins of these functional groups in HC anodes. VC by contrast shows an intermediate behavior, with the CO3 bound to the VC via the unsaturated C and the OCO2 (Figure ). As can be seen from Figure , this leads to distortion in the intramolecular CO bonds in the CO3 fragment, with elongation of the CO bonds at the O bonded to the surface carbon of 0.1 Å, and a contraction of the CO bond that is oriented away from the surface of 0.07 Å. The CO bonds to the carbon surface are noticeably longer than the carbon‐oxygen bond lengths obtained for Figure , which is also reflected in the weaker adsorption energy of CO3 at VC site P1 as compared to OC site P1 (Figure ). In the intercalation regime, both the OC and VC show the addition of CO to the unsaturated lattice C in positions P5–P7, coupled with the liberation of CO2 (Figure  (showing the position of the CO2 within the trough region), and Figure , Supporting Information). CO2 liberation was also observed for CO3 at VC on the basal plane (see Figure , Supporting Information), where the optimized structure showed a CO added to the unsaturated vacancy‐C and CO2 moving away from the surface (>4 Å). A schematic representation of the different mechanisms is provided in Figure . OC and OCVC adsorption are significantly less favored with OCVC showing a repulsive interaction. Whilst the 2OC shows enhanced adsorption, the CO3 remains intact although moving toward the C‐surface. For the same defect and fragment on the abrupt surface, however, in the absence of a perpendicular C‐dangling bond, the O is added to an adjacent C, initially as CO, which can then undergo relaxation to give the COC. Hence, the O‐functionalization is added to both planar, and curved surfaces as previously described.[]"

                        "From the above analysis, it is clear that in the majority of cases, these carbon surfaces would not trap EC or its fragments, but oxygen functionalization and occupation of possible Na sites are expected at the OC and VC defect sites. To validate these results, we studied experimentally two HC materials[] with different microstructures that were discharged in an EC‐based electrolyte, ST1000 and ST1500. ST1000 consists of graphitic pores with larger average spacing between the graphitic planes (3.76 Å from small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS)/wide‐angle X‐ray scattering (WAXS) measurements for ST1000 and 3.68 Å for ST1500), has a larger concentration of defects, and smaller average micropore diameter (1.75 nm for ST1000 and 2.2 nm for ST1500) than the ST1500 HC material. ST1500 furthermore has a more graphitic structure with larger basal plane (which are graphene‐like) domains and a larger graphitic layer stack thickness than ST1000.[] To obtain information on the depth profile of the SEI composition, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure ) were acquired for the unsputtered sodiated samples, and then after sequential removal (30 s intervals) of thin surface layers, to generate a composition depth profile shown in Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information.",
                        "After sodiation of the electrodes (x = 0), the sp2 carbon peak in the C 1s spectra (Figure , Supporting Information) arising from the graphitic features of HC almost disappeared for both electrodes. This is an indication of a layer covering the surface of the HC, which could be linked to the decoration of HC surfaces at defect sites as observed from the computational results. As the etching time increases, the concentration of CO decreases more rapidly in the ST1500 material (Figure ). The ST1000 material is more defective than the ST1500[] (Figure ). As seen from the C1s peak contributions (Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information), ST1000 has a higher degree of CO and CO‐containing organic compound on the surface, therefore, it is expected to have a thicker SEI layer, confirming the simulation results presented here and also previously.[] It should be also considered that argon and oxygen form a strong donor–acceptor chemical bond, therefore, Ar+ sputtering might be causing the reduction of CO bonds and change the surface chemistry. Combining the computational and experimental insights into the EC‐carbon surface interaction, it could be shown that the presence of defects and curved motifs influence electrolyte breakdown and immobilization. Coupling these results to those of the sodiation of HC anodes, a series of materials considerations for the design of HC anodes could be made. HC materials, as stated in Section , are complex materials with a tunable structure, making them excellent for targeted materials design. The main structural motifs of HCs are graphene basal planes, graphitic pores with variable interlayer distance, and curved nanopores and surfaces. The results presented in this work show that the shape of the carbon motifs (basal plane vs rough surface) has a direct impact not only on the sodiation[] but also on the EC interaction. In general, the basal planes have higher defect formation energy than the curved motifs, indicating that the defect concentration under equilibrium conditions in the basal plane motifs would be lower.[] Oxygen defects and the formation of CO and CO bonds were shown to lead to thicker SEIs and have previously been shown to give a significant contribution to the NIB I–V curve sloping regions.[] As noted previously for the sodiation of HC materials, oxygen heteroatoms are beneficial for the initial sodium storage but could contribute to irreversible capacity if present in significant concentrations due to their strong Na adsorption energies.[] The effect of these defects on EC adsorption is not as pronounced. Their interaction with the breakdown fragments of carbonates (especially CO3) can be significant as observed in Figure , which could lead to an increase in oxygen functional groups and CO2 outgassing.[] This could also explain why HC with a higher CO and CO concentration have thicker SEIs and should be considered when designing future HC anode materials. It is also clear from the work here that any undercoordinated HC site (i.e., that leads to an unsaturated carbon site) is a possible EC breakdown site, leading to increased defect concentration and the possibility of crosslinking (which has previously been observed for carbon vacancies in similar systems).[] Future studies will also show how other electrolyte molecules interact with these HC motifs, adding further materials design considerations. The challenge remains in linking the computationally optimized HC material to a synthetic route."

We have proposed a new rough model for HC and compared it with the commonly used basal plane and abrupt models. Practical NIBs are more complex than the model presented in this paper, and future studies could also take into account the effect of Na (and also other cations as HC is employed as an anode material in a variety of battery technologies), other electrolyte solvents and the counter anion of the electrolyte salt. The interaction of other carbonate solvents with similar breakdown products to EC would be expected to act similarly, but the longer carbon chains and different chemistries of non‐carbonate electrolyte solvents may lead to different HC interactions. It would further also be instructive to elucidate the effect of binder on the electrolyte–anode interface and the overall battery performance.",

EC would only be expected to impact the Na storage capacity and compete with Na for carbon surface storage sites at 2OC defects. Probing the adsorption of EC fragments C2H4 and CO3 on the HC model, it was shown that CO3 has the strongest interaction with the HC surface. For sites with carbon‐dangling bonds, a breakdown of the CO3 was observed. This breakdown leads to the formation of a CO2 molecule and functionalization of the surface with CO groups, which could lead to increased oxygen concentration at HC anodes during cycling. From XPS analysis of the EC–HC interface in a cycled NIB cell, the computational findings were further verified with the more defective and oxygen‐containing HC material (ST1000) having thicker SEI layers than the HC material (ST1500) with a lower heteroatom concentration."

After the cell optimizations of the HC models, the lattice vectors were kept fixed for geometry optimizations (also performed using BFGS) of the defect systems and the molecule adsorption. The defects were considered in the dilute limit, with a single defect of each type per 800 atom HC surface model. This choice was to allow the individual defect–molecule (fragment) interaction to be understood in the absence of any defect–defect interaction.
