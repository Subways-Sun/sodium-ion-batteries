                "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) gradually become ideal substitutes to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as a result of higher applicability in new-generation energy storage system. However, the controlled preparation of superior electrode materials for obtaining high-performance SIBs remains a challenge. In this study, a composite structure comprising three-dimensional nanoflower Sb2S3 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was successfully manufactured by applying a hydrothermal method as an emerging anode material for SIBs. Nanoflower Sb2S3@rGO exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, yielding 544.8 mAh/g at a rate of 100 mA/g, and sustained stability in the later 200 cycles, which was 75.4% of the initial value for the specific capacity. Even the current density is 2000 mA/g, a specific energy capacity of 433.4 mAh/g was obtained. The sodium storage mechanism was explored using cyclic voltammetry at different sweep speeds to clearly point out the electrochemical process of forming nanoflower Sb2S3@rGO. The results indicate that the high performance is ascribed to the particular flower-like three-dimensional structure, which provides cache space for Sb2S3 volume expansion during charge/discharge, while the addition of rGO effectively improves the overall electrical conductivity of the electrode. This work furnishes a new insight into the construction of specially structured anode materials to promote the development of SIBs."

                "As the primary power supply device, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in portable communication equipment and new energy vehicles as secondary rechargeable batteries thanks to their high energy density and exceptional cycling stability [, , , ]. Nevertheless, LIBs are not suitable for long-term energy storage solution restricted to the resource scarcity and uneven distribution of lithium element. Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a significant research hotspot that is given to the abundant sodium and low price compared to LIBs [, , , , ]. Although SIBs and LIBs have similar intercalation chemistry, compared to Li+, the ionic radius of Na+ is relatively large which makes the choice of the anode material particularly crucial [, ]. Antimony-based materials have received inclusive interest from researchers because of their outstanding performance in SIBs [ , , , ]. Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3), which can accommodate 12 sodium ions, possesses a relatively high theoretical capacity (946 mAh/g); therefore, it is considered a suitable anode material [, , , ]. Regrettably, when used as a SIB anode material, Sb2S3 undergoes significant volume expansion (364%) in the time of the battery charging/discharging cycles, which is a key issue in practical applications, that not only disrupts the electrode structure but also negatively affects the cycle stability of the batteries [ , , , ].",
                "It has been demonstrated that the electrochemical performance of Sb2S3 materials can be effectively improved by constructing heterojunctions, compositing with carbon-based materials, and modulating morphologies [, ]. Combining with FeS2 or MoS2, the Sb2S3 heterojunctions can be formed, which enhances the charge transfer and accelerates the ionic diffusion. Besides, compositing with carbon-based materials can alleviate the volume expansion of Sb2S3 during long cycles [ , , ]. Furthermore, modulating morphologies of anode materials with multi-dimensional micro- and nano-structures also has the advantages of improving ionic diffusion and inhibiting volume expansion [ , , , , , ]. In previous studies, Sb2S3 anodes with 3D structure were usually constructed by embedding Sb2S3 into materials with the framework [ , ]. However, there are few reports on directly synthesizing Sb2S3 with 3D structures for SIB anode material.",
                "In this study, we synthesized nanoflower Sb2S3 (NF–Sb2S3) through a hydrothermal method employing potassium antimony tartrate and thioacetamide as raw materials in the presence of a surfactant (didodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide，DDAB), and further composited it with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to produce nanoflower Sb2S3@rGO (NF–Sb2S3@rGO) to enhance its electrochemical performance. The unique 3D structure improved the Na+ storage ability of Sb2S3 as expected. SIBs with the material delivered a reversible capacity of 544.8 mAh/g and maintained excellent stability within 200 cycles at a rate of 100 mA/g. The as-prepared NF–Sb2S3@rGO composite material may become highly potential for achieving high-performance SIBs in the future."

Graphite powder was manufactured into graphite oxide based on a modified Hummers’ method []. Hydrothermal method was utilized for the preparation of the NF–Sb2S3@rGO composite. Deionized water was employed to dilute aqueous suspension of graphite oxide, then sonicated it for 1 h for purpose of obtaining a graphene oxide suspension (0.73 mg/mL). After that, 0.1 g of DDAB was dissolved in 30 mL of the graphene oxide suspension.

                        "Typically, the working electrode was manufactured by slurry coating method, which was formed from the homogenized mixtures of NF–Sb2S3@rGO/NF–Sb2S3/commercial Sb2S3 (active material), acetylene black (conducting additive) and carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC, binder) in an 80:10:10 wt ratio and deionized water; then a copper foil (current collector) was applied to the slurry and vacuum-dried for 12 h at 60 °C. The average mass loading of the active material for each electrode (14 mm in diameter) was typically 1.0–1.4 mg/cm2. For SIBs, the electrochemical tests were performed making use of two-electrode coin cells (CR2032), and the working electrodes served as anode and pure Na plate acted as both the counter electrodes using glass fiber as the separator in the batteries. Half-cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, in which the concentrations of moisture and oxygen were maintained below 0.1 ppm. The electrolyte was a mixed solution composed of 1.0 M NaClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) (1:1 in volume) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an additive. Each coin cell was filled with 120 μL of the electrolyte using a pipette. Using a programmed battery testing system (Land, CT3001A), galvanostatic discharge/charge and rate capability were measured in the voltage window of 0.01–2.50 V (vs. Na/Na+).

                        "Analysis of XRD data revealed the composition and crystalline structure of the synthesized substances. Fig. 1a displays that the characteristics of the NF–Sb2S3@rGO complex are equivalent to those of Sb2S3 with an orthorhombic structure (JCPDS standard No.42-1393). The diffraction peak intensity of NF–Sb2S3@rGO is slightly lower than that of Sb2S3 because the surface amorphous graphene blocks some amount of X-rays []. For further characterization of NF–Sb2S3@rGO, Fig. S1 and Fig. 1b present Raman spectra of as-prepared electrodes of NF–Sb2S3@GO and NF–Sb2S3@rGO. The characteristic peaks located at 100–400 cm−1 exhibit the Raman shifts of Sb2S3 [ ], and the peak at 252 cm−1, which is assigned to the Sb–Sb bond stretching vibration in the S2Sb–SbS2 group, is the strongest [ ]. The two broad peaks centered at 1350 and 1580 cm−1 associate with the characteristic D- and G-band of rGo separately [ , ], and the intensity ratio ID/IG reflects the defect density in the graphene planes. The ID/IG of NF–Sb2S3@rGO was calculated to be 1.18, suggesting that the reduction of graphene oxide introduced more defects into NF–Sb2S3@rGO [ ].",
                        "According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the rGO content in the composite was approximately 12.2% (Fig. 1c). A XPS analysis of the as-prepared products was subjected to determine the chemical states of the elements and compositions, and valence state changes for Sb, S, O, and C are exhibited in Fig. S2. High-resolution spectrum (Fig. 1d) displays two peaks at 529.48 and 538.87 eV relation with Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2 that verify the emergence of Sb3+ in the sample [ , ]. In addition, from Fig. 1e and Fig. S3, the high-resolution spectrum of C is classified as three peaks, which relate to vibrations CC, C–C, and C–O. Clearly, after thermal reduction, a large proportion of the oxygen-containing groups are removed, which explains that why is the peak intensity of C–O considerably lower compared to those of C–C and CC [ , , ]. Overall, antimony sulfide and rGO were successfully compounded according to the given analysis results. Then, the surface areas of NF–Sb2S3 and NF–Sb2S3@rGO were investigated based on the N2 isothermal adsorption-desorption curves. The results are shown in Fig. 1f. The N2 adsorption-desorption equilibrium curves of NF–Sb2S3 and NF–Sb2S3@rGO are Brunauer-Emmett-Teller isotherms. The specific surface area of NF–Sb2S3@rGO (4.06 m2/g) is higher than that of NF–Sb2S3 (2.71 m2/g). The contribution of the specific surface area mainly comes from the size of 21 nm mesopores. The larger specific surface area is beneficial to provide more reactive sites for electrode reactions and enhance the sodium storage capacity of the material [].",
                        "The main synthesis steps for NF–Sb2S3 are illustrated in Fig. 2a, and a relevant elaboration of the growth-progress investigation is revealed in the supporting information. The morphologies and microstructures of NF–Sb2S3 and rGO (different content) composite were studied systematically via SEM (Figs. S4 and 5). From Fig. 2b and c of the typical SEM images, NF–Sb2S3 has a uniform nanoflower structure with a diameter of 5 μm and is accumulated from sheets with a thickness of 50 nm. Meanwhile, Fig. 2d of the TEM image also displays the sheet-like framework of the nanoflowers. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of NF–Sb2S3 in Fig. 2e reveal a lattice fringe pattern with a d-spacing of 0.3044 nm, corresponding with the (121) plane of orthorhombic Sb2S3 crystals, which is in accord with the XRD results. The SAED patterns (Fig. 2f) of NF–Sb2S3 exhibit the diffraction pattern of Sb2S3, suggesting that the Sb2S3 nanoparticles were well crystallized. It was also shown via TEM that the NF–Sb2S3@rGO composite possessed a unique structure. As shown in Fig. 2g, Sb2S3 was well encapsulated within rGO (the corresponding EDS test shown in Fig. S6). The rGO has high electrical conductivity, which could enhance the ion migration ability. More importantly, the excellent flexibility of the rGO can slow down the volume change of Sb2S3 during electrochemical cycling as the outer coating layer. Consequently, the structural integrity is maintained, and battery performance is improved [ , ]."

                        "Assembling a half-cell with a pure sodium plate as counter electrode and the electrodes composed of active materials, electrochemical performance was assessed for NF–Sb2S3@rGO as an anode material for SIBs. Firstly, typical CV curve of NF–Sb2S3@rGO was measured, and Fig. 3a exhibited the redox behavior, which performed for the initial three cycles between the operating voltage range of 0.01–2.5 V at 0.1 mV/s. At 0.76, 0.40, and 0.24 V, three reduction peaks were noticed in the first cathodic scan of the discharge process. The production of solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) film is correlated with the reduction peak at 0.76 V [ ]. Meanwhile, the cathodic peak at 0.40 V is related with the conversion reaction of Sb2S3 (Eq. (1)), in addition, the obvious reduction peak appears at 0.20 V corresponding to the alloying reaction between Na+ and Sb (Eq. (2)) [ ]. Then the following anodic scan implies the occurrence of dealloying reaction and recovery behavior during the first charge, which includes the extraction of Na+ from alloy products (inverse process of Eq. (2)) at 0.77 V and the generation of Sb2S3 (inverse process of Eq. (1)) at 1.49 V. Owing to the activation process during the first discharge, the first curve profile is significantly different from those of the following cycles [ ]. In addition, CV measurement of NF–Sb2S3 (Fig. S7a) was also implemented, indicating that the main electrochemical process was controlled by Sb2S3.Eqs. 1Sb2S3 + 6 Na+ + 6 e− → 2Sb + 3Na2SEqs. 22Sb + 6 Na+ + 6 e− → 2Na3Sb",
                        "The electrochemical performance of NF–Sb2S3@rGO was evaluated as an anode material using the initial three-cycle galvanic charge/discharge cycling curves at a rate of 100 mA/g from 0.01 V to 2.5 V, which are exhibited in Fig. 3b. The profile graph can be observed that the platform voltage was in highly consistent with the results of the CV tests. Moreover, the initial discharge and charge specific capacities of NF–Sb2S3@rGO were 838.5 and 609.0 mAh/g, respectively, yielding a high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 72.6%. Compared to the NF–Sb2S3 anode, with initial discharge and charge capacities of 826.4 and 400.1 mAh/g and ICE of 48.4% (Fig. S7b), NF–Sb2S3@rGO showed significantly improved electrochemical performance. Based on the above results, the high reversible capacity depends mainly on the reaction between the sodium ions and the residual oxygen-containing functional groups in rGO, that is the formation of a well-performing SEI film [, ].",
                        "Furthermore, the rate capabilities of the NF–Sb2S3 and NF–Sb2S3@rGO electrodes in various current densities from the operating voltage of 0.01 V–2.5 V are displayed in Fig. 3c. Every five cycles, the current density was increased by degrees at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA/g. By comparison, NF–Sb2S3@rGO displayed a better rate performance, which delivered the specific capacity of 433.4 mAh/g even at a high current rate of 2000 mA/g and the capacity retention was 71.6% (605.2 mAh/g, 50 mA/g). Moreover, while the current density is recovered to 50 mA/g, NF–Sb2S3@rGO could still maintain a capacity of 559.4 mAh/g, demonstrating excellent rate performance compared to that of NF–Sb2S3, which may be due to provide fast transport channels for sodium ions to improve the high-rate performance of the material [ , ].",
                        "Except for the rate performance, the long-cycle performance was measured at 100 mA/g to examine the advantages of NF–Sb2S3@rGO. Batteries with NF–Sb2S3 and commercial Sb2S3 were assembled and tested in the same situation. From the second cycle, the commercial Sb2S3 of Fig. 3d showed a significant capacity fade to only 50% of its initial capacity following 20 cycles due to volume expansion in the process of discharging, which brings out the powdering of the active material and gives rise to the active material falling from the current collector [ ]. In contrast, under the same test conditions, NF–Sb2S3 prepared in this study showed a clear capacity decline at approximately 70 cycles, which was also caused by the inevitable volume expansion of the Sb2S3 electrode material. Notably, NF–Sb2S3 did not experience a significant capacity degradation during the first 40 cycles owing to its unique microstructure. Specifically, the NF–Sb2S3 has a three-dimensional (3D) layered structure, which can disperse stress and slow down the material pulverization caused by the volume expansion of the Sb2S3 material [ ]. Therefore, the electrode structure is prevented from being destroyed, resulting in good device stability. Additionally, the 3D structure provides much larger specific surface areas, which increases the contact area with the electrolyte, and shortens the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better cycling performance [ ]. In comparison with the capacity of the second cycle, the capacity retention of NF–Sb2S3@rGO was 75.4% after 200 cycles. Another NF–Sb2S3@rGO battery with the same preparation parameters was assembled and tested for electrochemical performance to demonstrate the reproducibility of the device fabrication (Fig. S8). Besides, long cycle performance at high current densities of 500 mA g−1 was also tested in Fig. S9. Excellent performance is due to the result of the incorporation of rGO, NF–Sb2S3@rGO was not pulverized during the sodiation/desodiation process; instead, it had a more stable electrode structure [ ].",
                        "EIS measurements were implemented to study the electrochemical behavior of NF–Sb2S3@rGO. The tested data (dots) and the fitted curves (lines) of the EIS measurement are shown in Fig. 3e. There is a good agreement between the tested data and the fitted curves. Furthermore, each Nyquist plot consisted of one semicircle and a straight line. The former is in connection with the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrode material and the electrolyte at the high frequency, the latter corresponds to diffusion resistance of sodium ions in the electrode at the low frequency. Obviously, the Rct of NF–Sb2S3@rGO (49.74 Ω) is significantly smaller than those of NF–Sb2S3 (139.23 Ω) and commercial Sb2S3 (155.22 Ω), confirming that the addition of rGO reduces the electronic resistivity of the electrode and suppresses side reactions.",
                        "Next, the diffusion process in the NF–Sb2S3@rGO electrode was investigated by CV measurements to evaluate the sodium storage mechanism of NF–Sb2S3@rGO in the various scanning rates range of 0.1–5 mV/s (Fig. 4a). CV profiles at the various scanning rates can further quantitate the diffusion-controlled vs. surface-controlled ratio. The peak currents and scan rates tended to follow a power-law pattern according to the CV curves [ ].Eqs. 3i = av bHere, i is the peak current; a and b are adjustable constants; v is the scanning rate. The value of b can change between 0.5 and 1, which determines the sodiation/desodiation type. The surface-capacitance dominates electrochemical process if the value of b is close to 1, whereas the value of b approaching 0.5 means a representative diffusion-controlled faradaic process. This implies that for SIBs, the transfer of Na+ occurs only in the outer layer the active material, proving a dynamic advantage over diffusion inside the active material [ ]. Fig. 4b shows a logarithmic plot of the peak currents versus scan rates (log(i) vs. log(v)). After fitting, the b-values for the anodic (0.41 V) and cathodic peaks (1.25 V) of NF–Sb2S3@rGO are obtained of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively, which means that the electrochemical processes corresponding to the two peaks are jointly controlled by diffusion-controlled faradaic and capacitance-dominated processes.",
                        "In addition, there is another equation that describes the relations between the peak current (i) and the potential (V) for further quantitative analysis of the pseudocapacitive contribution [ ];Eqs. 4i(V) = k1v + k2v1/2where k1 and k2 are the variable parameters in the equation; k1v and k2v1/2 are on behalf of the surface-capacitance-dominated and the diffusion-controlled faradaic process each on its own. Therefore, calculating both k1 and k2 allows one to quantify the contribution of capacitance from the surface-capacitance-dominated process at increasing scanning rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mV/s [ ]. Fig. 4c shows that the contribution of surface-capacitance-dominated process was 36% at 1.0 mV/s. Fig. 4d illustrates the contribution to the charge at various scan rates. With increasing scan rate, the contribution of the surface-capacitance-dominated process gradually improves, indicating that the storage of sodium ions results from rapid interface reactions or double-layer charge at high scan rates. This also demonstrates that the charge storage of NF–Sb2S3@rGO composites at high currents is dominated by interfacial charge storage. Generally, Fig. 4 shows that the Sb2S3@rGO composite has a relatively high contribution of pseudocapacitance, which further proves that the rGO composite can accelerate the kinetic process of the reaction. Thus the Sb2S3@rGO composite can be able to cycle 200 cycles stably without significant capacity decay.",
                        "Furthermore, galvanostatic current intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement was performed to examine the kinetics of Na storage in the composite NF–Sb2S3@rGO (Fig. 5). The battery was discharged/charged for 30 min at 550 mA/g served as a pulse period, then staying quiet for 60 min as an interval time was achieved to allow complete relaxation to the quasi-equilibrium potential. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the potential can quickly recover from the relaxation potential to the resting potential at the end of resting, which proves that the electrode has a fast response. During the charging process, the difference between the resting and relaxation voltages becomes larger, indicating that the polarization of the anode material is more serious, probably due to the gradual conversion of Sb to Sb2S3. It is not difficult to find that the GITT curve has a similar shape to that of the aforementioned galvanostatic charge-discharge curve, even under continuous charge and discharge conditions, potentially because of the good ionic and electronic conductivities of NF–Sb2S3@rGO [ ]. The polarization phenomena are nearly the same, demonstrating that the chemical reactions of NF–Sb2S3@rGO anode material are highly reversible. In addition, the overpotential of the desodiation and sodiation processes was relatively small, indicating that Na+ could diffuse rapidly in the NF–Sb2S3@rGO composites. These results strongly demonstrated that the sodiation/desodiation kinetics of the NF–Sb2S3@rGO composite are rapid and reversible [ , ]."

The as-prepared NF–Sb2S3@rGO provided a high reversible specific capacity of 544.8 mAh/g at 100 mA/g, superior cycle stability that achieved 75.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles, and outstanding rate capability at the current rate from 50 to 2000 mA/g. The essential factor ascribing to the outstanding electrochemical properties may be the unique 3D nanoflower structure, which alleviates the volume expansion of Sb2S3, while the rGO ensures close contact between Sb2S3 and the carbon material, reducing the impedance value of electron and ion in the process of transfer during redox processes. Meanwhile, combined with relevant dynamic process research, the sodium storage mechanism was described. This research demonstrated that NF–Sb2S3@rGO could become a prospective anode material for SIBs, simultaneously providing guidance for the material design of 3D structures."
