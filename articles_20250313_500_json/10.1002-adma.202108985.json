                "Nowadays, sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered to be a very promising candidate for the next generation large‐scale electrochemical energy storage devices by virtue of the abundance of sodium resources and attractive cost‐effectiveness compared with the mature lithium‐ion batteries.[] However, the sluggish diffusion kinetics and larger radius of sodium ions tend to cause structure collapse of electrode materials during charge/discharge.[] Design and development on high‐performance anode materials is hence highly desirable to promote the practical application of SIBs. Among the numerous anode candidates, cobalt‐based phosphides including CoP, Co2P, and CoP2 have received considerable attention because of their diverse morphology, controllable preparation, and high theoretical capacity of 894 mAh g−1.[] Nevertheless, the intrinsic low conductivity and poor charge transfer kinetics bring about inferior rate capability, and moreover active materials were usually physically mixed with adhesives, which would be easily peeled off from the current collectors in the absence of strong chemical bonding if suffering drastic volume variation and structure collapse after repeated sodiation/desodiation processes, inevitably resulting in rapid capacity decay and thus poor cycling life.[] The exfoliation of electroactive materials from current collectors should be mainly responsible for their heavy loss of electrochemical activity and capacity as well as electrochemical instability during cycling.[]",
                "To overcome these hurdles, a common strategy is to downsize cobalt‐based phosphides and to integrate them with a highly conductive carbon matrix like graphene, carbon nanotube, and carbon fiber.[] For instance, a hierarchical CoP nanostructures embedded into N/S‐codoped porous carbon sheets has shown a rate capacity of 162 mAh g−1 at 5.0 mA g−1.[] It also reports a kind of hollow CoP@C composites as anode for SIBs exhibiting excellent cycling stability, retaining 121 mAh g−1 after 7000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1.[] In spite of great efforts on improving the sodium‐storage performance of cobalt‐based phosphides, it cannot be considered as satisfactory after evaluating their capacity and long‐term cycling life at a high‐rate current until now. This is mainly caused by the lack of effective and reasonable fabrication of electrode structures and further integration of different functions and synergistic effects between components. Therefore, rational structure design seems indispensible for high electrochemical performance and cycling ability of electrode materials. In general, the traditional fabrication of electrodes cannot work without adhesives to help load electroactive materials onto current collector, however, the inevitable adhesive failure will surely cause serious exfoliation of electroactive materials, resulting in the rapid capacity and stability attenuation, and even the death of a battery.[]",
                "The construction of “all in one” 3D hierarchical electrode can effectively solve these aforementioned issues via in situ growth of electroactive materials on flexible carbon substrates.[] This strategy could help eliminate the utilization of insulated adhesives and provide a good 3D conductive network for transport of electrons, and more importantly avoid the attenuation of electrochemical performance due to the failure of adhesive.[] Moreover, well‐tailored hierarchical nanostructures including nanosheets, nanoneedles, nanofibers, and nanotubes would be more favorable for integral structural stability during the electrochemical process.[] For example, the hierarchical poly(ethylene oxide)‐coated diatomite‐derived Li4.4Si‐Li electrode provided a 3D porous framework with rich transport pathways for electrons/ions and exhibited a rigid mechanical characteristic that could support the entire electrode with a negligible volume change while charging/discharging.[] Besides, the presence of mixed‐valence states is favorable for the electrochemical performance of electroactive materials. A large number of studies have reported that the existence of stable redox couples such as Co3+/Co2+,[] V5+/V4+,[] Fe3+/Fe2+,[] Ce4+/Ce3+,[] Ti4+/Ti3+,[] and Cu2+/Cu+[] in electrode materials could improve electrical conductivity and ability of metal‐ion intercalation/deintercalation. For example, when V5+ in V2O5 nanobelts was partially reduced into V4+, the in situ formation of V5+/V4+ redox couples resulted in faster ion diffusion, higher electrochemical activity, and electrical conductivity compared to the pristine V2O5. Specifically, the electrical conductivity of V4+–V2O5 (2.86 × 10−5 S cm−1) was at least ten times higher than that of pristine V2O5 (2.33 × 10−6 S cm−1), and the lithium‐ion diffusion coefficient of V4+–V2O5 (1.53 × 10−10 cm2 S−1) was two orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine V2O5 (1.71 × 10−12 cm2 S−1).[] Similarily, the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples produced by hydrogenation of TiO2 brought about a very high electrical conductivity of 8 × 10−2 S cm−1 (much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 for 2.2 × 10−7 S cm−1) and an ultrafast exchange rates of lithium ions.[]",
                "Herein, we have tried to address the abovementioned issues commonly occurring in cobalt phosphides by aid of the mixed‐valence strategy and construction of the “all in one” electrode, hoping to synchronously improve the structure stability and sodium storage performance. The synthetic process of CoxP@CFC has been described in Scheme  and Figure , Supporting Information, which includes three steps, that is, an initial hydrothermal treatment to obtain the Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O@CFC (Co‐CO@CFC) precursor, the following calcination to realize in situ fabrication of Co3O4@CFC, and the final phosphorization of Co3O4@CFC into Cox"
