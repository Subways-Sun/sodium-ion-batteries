                "The currently prevailing single complexing agent-dominated sol-gel technologies for Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) always result in limited modification effects, especially in regards to the particle size of NVP and the quality of carbon coatings. Herein, we report a citric acid and glycine co-complexed strategy for fabricating carbon-coated NVP. It creates a favorable synergy for optimizing the microstructure and electrochemical performance of the NVP cathode. The introduction of glycine in citric acid not only decreases the solution viscosity for facilitated metal-ion diffusion, but also induces the self-construction of a 3D network through heteromolecular hydrogen bonds. The optimized carbon-coated NVP by co-complexing of citric acid and glycine (named as NVP/CG-5.0) presents distinctly decreased particle size, improved dispersity and moderate carbon coating thickness of ∼2 nm. It also features a large specific surface area of 44.4 m2 g−1 with rich mesopores. Impressively, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode exhibits substantially improved electrochemical performance, such as the elevated specific capacity of 108.3 mAh g−1 with high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.2%), high capacity retention of 81.3% after 2000 cycles at 2 C and excellent rate performance (88.2 mAh g−1 at 20.0 C). Furthermore, the assembled NVP/CG-5.0║hard carbon full battery also exhibits superior electrochemical performance, suggesting the great potential of the co-complexed strategy for developing high-performance NVP cathodes in SIBs.",

                "The excessive consumption of traditional fossil fuels in industries leads to a series of environmental pollution problems and greenhouse effect. In this context, renewable energies usher in a thriving development opportunity. However, their unstable energy supply promotes large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) becoming increasingly indispensable , , , , . Benefitting from the abundant reserves and low price of sodium salts, rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with similar operation principles to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for EES applications , , , , . However, the practical application of SIBs remains challenging due to some unresolved issues. Typically, the larger atomic radius of sodium (0.098 nm) than that of lithium (0.069 nm) makes the currently prevailing electrode materials of LIBs inapplicable for Na+ insertion/extraction. Moreover, the electrode structure is prone to collapse in repeated charge/discharge processes , . Meanwhile, the larger ionic radius also results in the slow diffusion of Na+ in the bulk of active matter. Thus, it is urgently necessary to explore suitable electrode materials for high-performance SIBs.",
                "Cathode materials are vital components in SIBs, accounting for ∼26% of the total bill of material cost. The preoccupant cathode materials that have commercialization application potentials are layered oxides, polyanionic compounds and Prussian blue analogs , . Among them, sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3, NVP), as a typical representative of polyanionic compounds, has drawn intensive attention due to its unique NASICON structure featuring with a three-dimensional skeleton , . The open channels facilitate fast ion conductivity, making NVP a competitive candidate for high-rate cathode materials. Nevertheless, NVP has similar problem to other polyanionic compounds. Because VO6 is isolated by PO4 groups, electrons cannot conduct along V-O-V, resulting in low intrinsic conductivity and inferior electrochemical redox reversibility , .",
                "Intensive researches have been focused on the improvement of electrical conductivity by means of various strategies, such as the substitution of V sites through heterogeneous cation doping , , , , , , surface modification by carbon coatings , , , , incorporation with carbon matrices and morphology engineering , . Among them, carbon coating technologies have received much attention because they can generate conductive components in-situ on the grain surface and restrain the sintering of NVP particles. Sol-gel methods, which have been widely considered as one of the most effective routes to tune the microstructure of functional materials by complexing with metal ions, are usually employed to synthesize carbon-coated NVP composites. For example, Zhou et al. used citric acid as both the carbon source and complexing agent to form a conductive layer of 7.3 nm on the surface of NVP. By improving the electrical conductivity and agglomeration behavior of NVP particles, a long cycling life of 2000 cycles at 10 C with capacity retention of 78.3% was achieved . C. Park et al. synthesized a 3D porous NVP hybrid structure with a carbon layer of ∼5 nm using a modified oxalic acid sol-gel method, which contributed to a high specific capacity of 116.9 mAh g−1 at 1 C and superior long-term cycling stability over 6000 cycles (77% capacity retention) . When researchers focus their attention on the elevation of electrical conductivity, the quality control of the microstructure of carbon coatings (e.g. uniformity and layer thickness) and the effect of particle dimension diminution are critical for achieving excellent electrochemical performance , . After browsing the related literatures that fabricated carbon-coated NVP by sol-gel methods, it is found that the researchers always employ a single complexing agent to tune the microstructure of NVP, which has been proven to achieve limited improvement in electrochemical performance, especially in the rate capability , , , . The reason for these unsatisfactory modification effects could be the quite limited adjustment ability of a single organic acid for the formation of moderate interactions between organic molecules and V3+ ions. Moreover, when the carbon species from a single carbon source are in the nucleation stage, they have a large surface Gibbs free energy. This state inevitably leads to thermodynamic agglomeration at high temperatures, thereafter making the regulation of carbon layer uniformity and thickness difficult . In addition, according to the literatures, the enhancement of cyclic stability and rate performance of NVP by carbon coatings seems thermodynamically incompatible , . A dilemma usually exists that a too thin carbon coating with friable structure cannot provide structural support for repeated extraction/insertion of Na+ and makes the electrode difficult to maintain structural and cycling stability. While too thick carbon layers severely hinder convenient electrolyte penetration and fast ion migration, as well as the realization of high specific capacity , , . Based on these analyses, the search for suitable multicomplexing agent-involved sol-gel systems to create a satisfactory synergy in microstructure optimization of NVP may be significant for prominently enhanced comprehensive electrochemical performance. To our knowledge, there are still few explorations on this aspect to date.",
                "In this work, we proposed a co-complexing sol-gel strategy by combining citric acid and glycine to develop nitrogen-doped carbon-coated NVP (NVP/CG) composites. Very different from the commonly adopted single complexing agent-dominated process, the well-designed dual-complexing agent system has distinctive advantages to improve the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NVP. When glycine is added to citric acid system, with the help of the hydrophilic bonds between the two complexing agents in aqueous solution, the free anions and cations can be trapped by the end groups to control the grain size growth. And the hetero three-dimensional network structure formed by their bonding will facilitate more uniform conductive carbon layer with controllable thickness on the NVP’s surface after calcination. By tuning the feed ratio of citric acid and glycine, the optimized NVP/CG composite (named as NVP/CG-5.0) exhibits substantially enhanced reversible specific capacity, long-term cycling stability and rate performance compared to the control materials prepared with the single complexing agent of citric acid and glycine separately. Remarkably, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode retains high capacity retention of 81.3% after 2000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 2 C. Even at a high current density of 20 C, the electrode still releases an attractive reversible capacity of 88.2 mAh g−1 with high rate capacity retention of 81.0%. The superior performance demonstrates the fantastic modification effect by dual-complexing agents for optimizing the microstructure and elevating the sodium-storage performance of NVP cathode materials."

                        "As schematically depicted in Fig. 1, the NVP/CG composites were prepared by a sol-gel method with citric acid and glycine as cocomplexing agents. First, 4 mmol NH4VO3 and 6 mmol NaH2PO4·2 H2O were weighed (molar ratio of 2:3), and NH4VO3 was then added to a beaker containing 60 ml deionized water and continuously stirred at 70 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, 11.0 mmol of glycine and 2.2 mmol of citric acid (a mole ratio of 5:1) and NaH2PO4·2 H2O were added in turn to the above solution, and continuously heated and stirred. In this step, V5+ was reduced to V3+. When heated until the precursor solution became gelatinous, the beaker was transferred to a vacuum oven at 80 °C and further baked for 12 h. The ground sample was then transferred to a tubular furnace, preheated at 350 °C for 3 h and calcined at 800 °C for 5 h under Ar atmosphere (heating rate: 5 °C min−1). After natural cooling, the NVP/CG-5.0 composite was obtained. For comparison, the single citric acid or glycine was employed as the complexing agent to synthesize NVP composites by using the same experimental method above, which were denoted as NVP/C composite and NVP/G composite, respectively. Additionally, to further investigate the effect of the additive amount of glycine, two control samples with glycine/citric acid ratios of 2.5:1 and 10:1 were synthesized, which were recorded as NVP/CG-2.5 and NVP/CG-10, respectively."

The carbon content of the samples was obtained using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, NetzschSTA449C) under an air atmosphere at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1.

                        "The electrochemical behaviors of the samples were evaluated by assembling coin-type half cells (CR2025) with sodium metal foils as the counter/reference electrodes. The active material, Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were uniformly mixed in N-methyl pyrrolidone at a mass ratio of 7.0:1.5:1.5, and then coated on aluminum foil, which was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the foil was cut into electrode disks with a diameter of 14 mm, and the loading amount of active material was 1.8–2.0 mg·cm−2. A glass fiber felt (Whatman GF/D) and 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (volume ratio of 1:1:1) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate were used as the separator and electrolyte, respectively. The galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were carried out using a battery testing system (LAND CT 2001A, Wuhan), and the voltage window ranged from 2.2 to 4.0 V (vs. Na+/Na). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (scan rate: 0.1 mV s−1) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests (frequency range: 100 kHz∼0.01 Hz, amplitude: 5 mV) were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, Shanghai). The full cell was assembled by coupling the NVP/CG-5.0 composite and a commercial hard carbon (YHC-1, BAISIGE Co., Ltd.) as the cathode and anode materials, respectively. The anode disks were prepared by casting the mixture of 80 wt% hard carbon, 10 wt% super P and 10 wt% PVDF on a Cu foil. The cathode/anode mass loading ratio was approximate 1.9."

                        "TGA curves of the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites tested in an air atmosphere are shown in Fig. 2a. The mass loss of the three samples at 50–200 °C is mainly due to the removal of crystalline water inside the materials. Above 200 °C, the weight of the samples continuously decreases with the rising temperature, and the mass loss reaches the highest level at ∼470 °C. The distinct weight loss is attributed to carbon consumption by oxygen and the escape of gaseous products , . Basing on the mass variation in this stage, the carbon content in the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites is approximately estimated to be 2.6%, 3.0% and 6.9%, respectively. It is noted that the carbon content in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite is obviously higher than that of the other two counterpart samples. The behavior reflects the existence of a strong interaction between citric acid and glycine during the complexation process, which creates a beneficial effect for maintaining high carbon yield after thermal annealing. The detailed synergistic mechanism of citric acid and glycine will be elucidated later. As the temperature exceeded ∼470 °C, the weight of all samples slightly increases and then remains stable ascribing to the oxidation of the NVP components .",
                        "The phase compositions of the three NVP composites were determined by XRD analyses. As shown in Fig. 2b, the diffraction peaks of all samples are analogous in shape with high intensity. The indexed peaks of (012), (104), (113), (024), (211), (116) and other planes are in good agreement with the standard structure of rhombohedral NVP (JCPDS No. 053–0018) without additional impurity peaks, suggesting the high purity of the as-synthesized samples . Notably, the peak intensity of the NVP/CG-5.0 composite is significantly lower and broader than that of the NVP/C and NVP/G composites. The distinctive diffraction behavior would be mainly rooted from the particle size difference of NVP in the three composites, a fact of which can be further verified by the morphology observation later. In detail, the particle size of NVP is influenced by the distinct complexation effects of different complexing agents. The high diffraction peak intensity and narrow peak width of the NVP/C and NVP/G composites signify that the single complexing agent of citric acid or glycine has a weak regulating function for grain nucleation and growth, while the combination of the two complexing agents creates a positive synergy for achieving the smaller particle size of NVPs. The crystallite size of NVP in the composites was estimated by the Scherrer equation. As shown in Table S1, the smallest crystalline size for the NVP/CG-5.0 composite also resulted in the weaker diffraction peaks. The crystalline structure of the as-obtained NVPs was further investigated by the Rietveld-refinement of the XRD patterns. The results depicted in Fig. 2c and Fig. S1 show that the NVP crystals in the composites have a rhomb-shaped structure assigning to a hexagonal crystal system with the space group of R-3c. The fitted cell parameters for the NVP/CG-5.0 composite are listed in Table S2, and the results are consistent with the reported data . The corresponding NVP crystal consists of six NVP single cells. Each [V2(PO4)3]3 unit is formed by two VO6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahedra connected by oxygen atoms on a common angle in the Z-axis direction (Fig. 2d) , , .",
                        "To investigate the morphology difference of the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites, SEM observation was performed. Fig. S2a and Fig. 3a show that the NVP/C composite presents an agglomerated bulk morphology where uneven NVP particles with large dimension (>1 μm in most of cases) are randomly embedded in the carbon matrix. The embedded structure of NVP particles suggests a poor regulation effect of citric acid on the morphology control of NVP, including the large particle size, low dispersion uniformity and the weak interaction with carbon . Very differently, the NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites manifest a grainy morphology (Fig. 3b and c). For the NVP/G composite, the submicron-scale secondary NVP particles aggregate together to form porous and irregular structures with the dimension of several micrometers (Fig. S2b). The morphology difference between NVP/C and NVP/G signify the divergent complexation mechanisms of citric acid and glycine for the evolution of the NVP microstructures. It is noted that the agglomeration of NVP secondary particles in the NVP/G composite is serious, which is detrimental to the cycling stability and rate performance of the electrode materials. The agglomeration phenomenon is greatly suppressed after employing the dual complexing agents of citric acid and glycine, as revealed in Fig. S2c and Fig. 3c. The prominently improved dispersity and the emergence of many smaller particles with much reduced size suggest a favorable couple effect between the two complexing agents. The analogous microstructure characteristics and more critical information can be further disclosed by TEM and HRTEM (Figs. 3d-3i). In particular, the solid texture of NVP particles and the amorphous nature of the carbon matrix (Fig. S3) in the NVP/C composite is clearly observed. In contrast, for the NVP/CG-5.0 composite, it is demonstrated that the microscale NVP blocks displayed in the SEM images are in fact consisted of many tiny particles. The selected-area electron diffraction pattern (inset of Fig. 3i) presents discrete diffraction spots, revealing the single-crystal nature of NVP in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite. In general, according to the thermodynamics theory of ionic crystals, the anions and cations of NVP are prone to gather by strong electrostatic interactions, and then grow into microscale solid particles at the crystallization temperatures higher than 700 °C . In this regard, the much decreased NVP size in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite reflects a favorable effect on the suppression of the aggregation of vanadium-involved species and the formation of smaller NVP crystals. Moreover, after careful HRTEM observation, one can discover that the particles in the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites are enveloped by carbon coatings of varying thickness. The thicker carbon coating (∼4 nm) for the NVP/C composite could be due to the much larger dimension of the NVP particles than that in the NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites. And the distinctly uneven carbon coating in the NVP/G composite could be rooted from the relatively weak complexing effect of glycine. The remarkably different microstructures of the three NVP samples would generate a profound influence on electrochemical performance. The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image and the corresponding element mapping were conducted to evaluate the uniformity of the as-prepared NVP material. As displayed in Fig. 3j, the elements of Na, V, P, O, C and N are evenly dispersed in the whole bulk of the NVP/CG-5.0 composite, confirming the homogeneous composition of this hybrid material. The existence of N signals is inherited from the feedstock of glycine, and the N-doping is beneficial to elevating conductivity of the carbon coating .",
                        "The pore information of the NVP composites was determined by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. As shown in Fig. 4a, all three composites present type-IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of mesopores . The much larger adsorption amount in high P/P0 region (>0.7 above) for the NVP/CG-5.0 composite signifies the richer mesoporous structures. The pore size distribution curves (inset of Fig. 4a) reveal that most of the mesopores in the NVP/C composite are concentrated at 2–4 nm. In contrast, an additional pore distribution region focused around ∼16 nm is observed in the NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites, with the pore distribution in this range being more pronounced in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite. The obvious discrepancy in pore distribution behaviors is consistent with the morphology difference of the three NVP composites as discussed above. Specifically, very different from the NVP particle-embedded carbon matrix structure for the NVP/C composite, the carbon-coated NVP particles tend to assemble together to some extent in the NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites, leading to the formation of numerous stacking pore. Basing on the BET method, the specific surface areas (SSAs) of the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites are calculated to be 7.7, 17.8 and 44.4 m2 g−1, respectively. The prominently increased SSA of the NVP/CG-5.0 composite suggests the better dispersibility of the NVP particles than that in the NVP/G composite and a favorable synergistic effect between the complexing agents of citric acid and glycine. The rich mesopores and larger SSA can facilitate electrolyte penetration and meanwhile buffer the volume strain during sodiation/desodiation, thereby improving the cycle stability and rate capability , .",
                        "Raman spectroscopy was carried out to study the texture of the carbon species in the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites. As shown in Fig. 4b, the characteristic D band (disordered carbon or defective graphitic structures) and G band (ordered graphitic carbon) can be observed at ∼1336 cm−1 and ∼1590 cm−1, respectively. The intensity ratio of the D band and G band (ID/IG) is usually used to evaluate the graphitization degree of carbon materials , . The ID/IG ratios of the three NVP samples are roughly equivalent. Their high value of ∼0.8 signifies the amorphous nature of the citric acid and/or glycine derived carbon residuals, indicating that the category and coupling of the complexing agents do not generate influence on the texture of the resulting carbon materials. In addition, a weak shoulder peak emerges at ∼ 1000 cm−1, which is caused by the stretching vibration of PO4 groups in the NVP framework .",
                        "The elemental compositions and chemical bonding states on the surface of the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites were characterized by XPS. Fig. 4c shows the survey spectra of the samples. The peaks at binding energies of 132.9, 284.3, 530.4, 530.5, and 1070.0 eV are attributed to the responses from P 2p, C 1 s, V 2p, O 1 s and Na 1 s, respectively . Apart from the NVP/C composite, the characteristic signal of N 1 s at 399.9 eV can be observed in the samples, which is resulted from the introduction of glycine. After quantitative analysis by integral area, the nitrogen contents in the NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites are 1.44% and 3.85%, respectively. The higher nitrogen content in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite means the existence of an obvious couple effect between citric acid and glycine during the sol-gel reaction process. It is probably that the ionic hydrophilic groups (-NH3+) of glycine bond with the hydroxyl groups of citric acid to form a strong interaction, and therefore more N elements are fixed during the subsequent pyrolysis treatment. The high-resolution spectra of the elements in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite are displayed in Fig. 4d-i. In the deconvoluted spectrum of V 2p, only two characteristic peaks at 516.4 eV and 523.5 eV assigning to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of V3+ can be discovered, indicating the complete reduction from V5+ to V3+ during solution reactions . For the spectrum of P 2p (Fig. 4e), the peaks at 133.0 eV and 133.9 eV are attributed to the two spin splitting peaks of P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2, respectively . There are three peaks at 284.8 eV, 286.4 eV and 288.8 eV in the deconvoluted high-resolution spectrum of C 1 s (Fig. 4f), which are attributed to C-C/C-N, CN and CO bonds, respectively . The presence of C-N and CN confirms that the N atoms are fixed in the carbon layers. The further analysis of the N 1 s fine spectrum (Fig. 5h) manifests the coexistence of pyridine N, pyrrole N and graphitic N, which are located at 398.5 eV, 400.8 eV and 401.5 eV, respectively . In the precalcination stage, the –NH2 in glycine reacts with the -COOH in citric acid, and the structure is rearranged to form pyrrole N and pyridine N. With increasing annealing temperature, parts of the C-N bonding gradually transform into graphitic N in the carbon framework . Both pyrrole and pyridine are aromatic compounds that are rich in π electrons. Pyrrole has two π electrons in the P orbital and pyridine has one π electron in the P orbital , . Fig. 4h shows that pyrrole N accounts for the largest proportion in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite. The graphitic N structure is formed when N atoms replace sp2 carbon atoms in the framework. This “N-type semiconductor” doping can enhance the electrical conductivity of the carbon layer by increasing the Fermi energy level and boosting the concentration of electron carriers , . As listed in Table S3, the proportion of graphitic nitrogen in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite reaches 29.4%, much higher than that in the NVP/G composite. The higher content of graphitic nitrogen is beneficial to faster charge transfer during sodium intercalation/de-intercalation processes. In addition, the peaks at 531.1 eV, 532.9 eV and 535.8 eV in the high-resolution spectra of O 1 s are associated with CO, P-O/V-O and C-O bonds, confirming the existence of PO4 and VO6 units in NVP crystal cells (Fig. 4i) . The high-resolution XPS spectra of the NVP/C and NVP/G composites (Fig. S4 and Fig. S5) reveal similar bonding information to that of the NVP/CG composite.",
                        "The significant difference in microstructure of the NVP composites can be explained from the perspective of the change in complexation ability caused by the ion-hydrophilic interaction between citric acid and glycine in aqueous solution, as depicted in Fig. 4j. In the present reaction system, citric acid and glycine not only act as reducing agents to achieve the reduction of V5+→V3+, but also act as complexing agents to control the size of reactant particles and finally transform into carbon matrices or carbon coatings on the surface of NVP particles , . There are three carboxyl groups (-COOH) and one hydroxyl group (-OH) in citric acid molecules, which easily form hydrogen bonds with H2O. At the same time, due to the large molecular weight of citric acid, the viscosity of the mixed solution increases. Thus, the diffusion of the reactant precursor is frustrated in solution, and the agglomerates are easy to occur. Due to the limitation in diffusion rate, the initially generated vanadium-involved species tend to form large grains. Meanwhile, the sticky citric acid is more likely transformed into carbon matrices as well after pyrolysis , . In contrast, since a glycine molecule has only one -COOH and one -NH2, the hydrophilicity is much weaker than that of citric acid, and its molecular weight is lower. These two factors lead to the smaller viscosity of the as-formed solution, lower diffusion resistance of reactants and thus smaller grain size. Nevertheless, due to the weak intermolecular force, glycine has a poor complexation ability to positive metal ions (V3+), so the resulting NVPs still present an agglomerated morphology. When glycine and citric acid are employed simultaneously as co-complexing agents, the amphoteric terminal groups (-COO-, -NH3+) after the hydrolysis of amino acid interact with the hydroxyl groups in citric acid , . Four glycine molecules combine with a citric acid molecule to form a coupled binding structure. The binding replaces part of the homomeric molecular hydrogen bond from citric acid, which reduces the viscosity of the solution. More importantly, the self-constructed three-dimensional network formed by the heteromolecular hydrogen bonds between citric acid and glycine has strong stability, significantly improving the complexation ability. As a result, the dimension and dispersibility of the as-obtained NVP particles are well controlled.",
                        "In order to investigate the influence of the dosage of glycine on the microstructures of the NVP/CG composites, another two glycine/citric acid ratios of 2.5:1 and 10.0:1 were chosen in the sol-gel system, and the corresponding samples were denoted as NVP/CG-2.5 and NVP/CG-10.0, respectively. Fig. S6 shows the morphologies of the two NVP/CG composites. The NVP/CG-2.5 composite still presents a bulk morphology where some carbon-coated NVP particles are mingled in the carbon matrix (Fig. S6a and S6b). The incomplete transformation into the carbon-coated NVP configuration suggests an insufficient supply of glycine for the construction of an effective hydrogen bond network, therefore resulting in limited structure modification and regulation of the NVP particles. For the NVP/CG-10.0 composite, a uniform morphology of carbon-coated NVP particles with an average size of ∼400 nm is observed (Fig. S6c and S6d). The modification result further demonstrates the very positive effect of glycine on the dimension and surface condition control of NVP particles, and also highlights the synergistic effect between citric acid and glycine. Even though a beneficial effect is generated, the excessive introduction of glycine in this condition still leads to obvious agglomeration at the tip of these spindle-like NVP particles. In addition, a partial sintering phenomenon can be discovered. A comparison of the XRD patterns of the three NVP/CG composites is displayed in Fig. S7. The NVP/CG-5.0 composite manifests the lowest peak intensity and the most significant peak widening, which signifies the diminished particle dimension and less agglomeration of the NVP particles in the NVP/CG-5.0 composite. The behaviors are consistent with the SEM observation. These results further reflect the critical role of the ratio between glycine and citric acid, which needs to be carefully tuned for achieving the optimized hybrid structure of NVP/CG."

                        "The electrochemical behaviors of the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 composites were investigated by assembling 2025-type coin half cells. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of the electrodes at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The three electrodes all manifest a pair of anodic/cathodic peaks at around 3.50 V/3.29 V, which is corresponded to the Na+ extraction/insertion from/into the NVP crystal cells and the accompanying conversion of the V4+/V3+ redox couple. A two-phase transition occurs in this process , :(1)",

                        "For the NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 electrodes, an additional reduction peak at approximately 3.21 V can be discovered. An analogous phenomenon has been reported in previous literatures , , , . It has been considered that the local thermal effect which occurs during the charge/discharge process leads to the migration of Na+ from the Na(1) site to the Na(2) site, and then causes crystal structure rearrangement. Moreover, compared with that in the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode, the anodic and cathodic peaks of the NVP/G electrode shift to the right and the left, respectively. The reason could be the more serious polarization occurred in NVP/G due to the uneven carbon coating and the more serious agglomeration of NVP. One can note that a pair of weak redox peaks near 3.80 V is perceptible for the NVP/C electrode. This behavior is attributed to the V5+/V4+ redox reactions corresponding to the phase transition between NaV2(PO4)3 and V2(PO4)3, while no additional peaks can be observed in the NVP/G and NVP/CG electrodes , , . The formation of the metastable V2(PO4)3 with a high oxidation state is detrimental for maintaining the structural and electrochemical stability of NVP during charge/discharge processes . In addition, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode has the strongest redox peak signals (Fig. 6a), implying it has the highest reaction activity between NVP and Na+. Moreover, it can be determined from the CV curves that the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode has the smallest reversible voltage difference (△V=0.18 V), further reflecting its low polarization and fast reaction kinetics.",
                        "Fig. 5b shows the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the three NVP electrodes at 0.5 C. The characteristic voltage plateau at ∼3.40 V can be observed in all profiles, ascribing to the V4+/V3+ transition of NVP. Notably, an additional plateau at 3.80 V appears in the charge curves of the NVP/C electrode. This behavior is consistent with the observation in the corresponding CV curves. The polarization voltage difference (PVD) between charge and discharge platforms is a key indicator for the energy efficiency of electrodes . As shown in Fig. 5c, the PVD values for the NVP/C, NVP/G and NVP/CG-5.0 electrodes are 98 mV, 52 mV and 42 mV respectively in the first cycle. Among them, the smallest PVD value of the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode implies its fastest electrochemical redox reaction dynamics, which is benefited from the advantages in microstructure, including the favorable dispersity of NVP particles with small particle size, high SSA and rich mesopores. After 400 charge/discharge cycles, the PVD values of the NVP/C and NVP/G electrodes drastically increase to 1150 mV and 253 mV respectively due to serious structural degradation of NVP. In contrast, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode only manifests a slightly increscent value of 62 mV, suggesting superior electrochemical and structural stability. From Fig. 5b, it can be seen that the NVP/CG-5.0, NVP/C and NVP/G electrodes exhibit charge/discharge capacities of 113.8/108.3, 60.2/47.0 and 109.4/98.1 mAh g−1 in the first cycle, respectively. Correspondingly, the initial Coulombic efficiencies (ICEs) of the electrodes are calculated to be 95.2%, 78.1% and 89.7%, respectively. The prominently elevated reversible capacity and ICE of the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode further confirm the favorable synergistic effect between the complexing agents of citric acid and glycine.",
                        "The electrochemical performances of the electrodes are more intuitively compared by cycling ability tests. As shown in Fig. 6a, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode exhibits the best cycling stability at 0.5 C. A discharge capacity of 95.5 mAh g−1 is still maintained after 400 cycles with high capacity retention of 88.2%. In contrast, the NVP/C and NVP/G electrodes present obvious capacity decay with cycling, which release poor reversible capacities of 10.8 mAh g−1 and 52.9 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles with much inferior capacity retentions of 23.0% and 53.9%, respectively. The long-term cycling ability tests further reflect the distance in electrochemical stability of the electrode materials (Fig. 6b). Remarkably, even after 2000 cycles at the large current density of 2 C, a high reversible capacity of 83.9 mAh g−1 can still be retained for the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode with a very low capacity loss rate of 0.009% per cycle. The superior cycling stability should be attributed to the robust NVP/CG-5.0 configuration. Fig. S8 shows the morphologies of the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode and the two counterpart electrodes after suffering 400 cycles at 0.5 C. From the SEM images, obvious microcracks are discovered on the surface of the cycled NVP/C and NVP/G electrode disks, while no evident structure degradation for the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode can be observed. Moreover, from the further observation by TEM, it is found that the intact NVP particles still maintain a relative even dispersion in the electrode. In contrast, serious pulverization and agglomeration of the NVP particles occur in the NVP/C and NVP/G structures, respectively. These results reveal the much better structural stability of the NVP/CG-5.0 composite. Besides, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode also manifests a substantially enhanced rate capability compared to the NVP/C and NVP/G electrodes. As displayed in Fig. 6c, with the given current density stepwise increase from 0.1 to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 C, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode delivers reversible capacities of 109.0, 105.1, 102.4, 99.8, 96.8, 93.6, 91.3 and 88.2 mAh g−1, respectively. More importantly, when the current density is reset back to 0.1 C, a high reversible capacity of 103.2 mAh g−1 can be restored immediately. As for the counterpart electrodes, the NVP/G electrode presents a much faster capacity decline, while the NVP/C electrode even does not work at increasing current densities since 5.0 C, reflecting their poor capacity response ability upon large current density. The significant advantage in rate performance for the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode can be further demonstrated by rate capacity retention at different current densities (Fig. 6d), where the great distance between the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode and the counterpart electrodes (especially the NVP/C electrode) is intuitively reflected. The cycling and rate performances of the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode are also compared with that of the recently reported NVP electrode materials in literatures , , , , , , , , . These representative data listed in Fig. 6e and Table S4 show that the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode exhibits some advantage in electrochemical performance, especially for the reversible capacity at high current densities, signifying its promising application potential in high-power SIBs. The electrochemical performances of the NVP/CG electrodes with different citric acid/glycine feeding ratios were also investigated. As shown in Fig. S9, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode demonstrates the highest reversible capacity, the best cycling stability and a much enhanced rate performance compared to those of the NVP/CG-2.5 and NVP/CG-10.0 electrodes. These electrochemical test results have high relativity with the different structure characteristics of the NVP/CG electrodes discussed above. The large size of the NVP particles in the NVP/CG-2.5 electrode and the obvious sintering and agglomeration behaviors in the NVP/CG-10.0 electrode are all responsible for the inferior electrochemical performance.",
                        "The greatly elevated electrochemical performance of the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode is not only ascribed to the robust electrode structure, but also results from the prominent improvement in sodiation/desodiation reaction kinetics.

With the increase of scan rate, the anodic and cathodic peaks shift to the higher and the lower voltage respectively, which are associated with the irreversible kinetic and redox reactions due to ohmic polarization. Generally, the sodiation/desodiation process is mainly composed of capacitive behaviors and diffusion-controlled reactions.

                        "Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the coupling between citric acid and glycine creates a favorable synergistic effect for the microstructure adjustment of NVP hybrid structures and electrochemical performance. The superior electrochemical performance of the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode would be resulted from the following factors. First, by tuning the viscosity of the sol-gel system and the complexing condition of V3+ through the proper introduction of glycine, the size of the resulting NVP particles is effectively diminished, and their dispersity is improved as well. These beneficial effects facilitate the increase in specific surface area and mesopores, contributing to the increased active sites for Na+ association and shortened ion diffusion pathways. Second, the uniform carbon coating with a moderate thickness on the surface of NVP not only accelerates the interfacial charge transfer and maintains the structural integrity of the electrode material, but also has a small influence on the migration of Na+ from/into NVP particles. In addition, nitrogen doping with a relatively high content in the carbon coating further elevates electrical conductivity and increases Na+ association sites, therefore contributing to the high electrochemical reversibility and excellent rate performance.",
                        "To evaluate the practical application potential of the NVP/CG electrodes, the sodium-ion full battery performance was investigated by using commercial hard carbon (HC) as the anode. As shown in Fig. 7g, the NVP/CG-5.0║HC full battery exhibits a superior rate performance. With the stepwise increased current densities from 0.1 C to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 C, high discharge capacities of 78.4, 73.3, 64.7, 55.5, 49.8 and 45.6 mAh g−1 can be well retained, respectively. After the cycling at 2 C and reset the current density to 0.1 C, no capacity degradation appears when comparing the values before and after the rate tests, indicating the high structural and electrochemical stability of the electrode materials in full cells. The cycling performance is displayed in Fig. 7h. After 50 charge/discharge cycles at 0.1 C, a high capacity retention of 89.1% can be achieved. Based on the typical charge-discharge profiles of the NVP/CG-5.0║CHC electrode (Fig. 7i), the energy density is estimated to be ∼227 Wh kg−1. These results further demonstrate the promising application prospects of the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode material for high-performance SIBs."

The results show that the proper proportion of citric acid and glycine (mole ratio of 1:5) creates a favorable synergy. By adjusting the solution viscosity and forming heteromolecular hydrogen bonds during the sol-gel process, the optimized microstructure and enhanced electrochemical performance are realized. The dual complexing agent-dominated synthesis process contributes to much smaller NVP particles that are covered by a relatively uniform carbon coating of ∼2 nm.
