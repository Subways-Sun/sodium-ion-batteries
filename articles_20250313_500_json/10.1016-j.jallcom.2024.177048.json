                "Alloy anodes are widely recognized for their high theoretical specific capacity and have garnered significant attention among the anode materials studied for sodium-ion batteries. In this study, we synthesize Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anodes using a double-pulse electrodeposition method. This binder-free alloy anode, comprising five high-capacity elements, significantly enhances specific capacity and improves cycling stability, while also demonstrating excellent sodium storage capability. Specifically, the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode achieves an initial charge capacity of 368.8 mAh∙g−1 and remains highly stable over 100 cycles, with a capacity decay of only 0.1 %. In addition, the anode delivers 290.3 mAh∙g−1 even at a current density of 3200 mA∙g−1. The outstanding electrochemical performance can be attributed to improved electronic transfer efficiency due to the introduction of Cu into Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 alloy via reverse potential, as well as the porous structure that facilitates electrolyte penetration and sodium ion transport. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique reveals a high sodium ion diffusion coefficient, further highlighting the potential of this alloy anode in advancing sodium-ion batteries."

                "Lithium-ion (LIBs) batteries have been considered the next-generation high-energy-density battery systems , . Yet, the escalating demand and soaring costs of lithium have led researchers to explore alternative materials. Sodium, in the same column as lithium on the periodic table, has shown promise as a viable alternative due to its abundance and cost-effectiveness , . Moreover, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and LIBs operate on similar energy storage principles. Nevertheless, the radius of Na+ (0.102 nm) in comparison to Li+ (0.076 nm) limits the electrochemical reaction rate, resulting in lower specific capacity and poorer cycling performance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore high-specific capacity, cycle-stable, and promising anode for SIBs.",
                "Antimony-based, tin-based alloys, and phosphorus/phosphide-based are extensively utilized as anode materials in SIBs due to their high theoretical capacities , , . Numerous studies have documented the superior cycling performance and efficiency of binary and ternary alloy anodes, making them strong candidates for SIB applications. For instance, Ren et al. produced SnPSe3@graphene nanocomposites through ball milling, achieving a capacity of 823 mAh∙g−1 at 100 mA∙g−1, with an initial coulombic efficiency of 95 % and 79 % capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 10 A∙g−1 . Similarly, Orzech et al. developed Bi0.25Sb1.75Te3, which retained 91 % of its capacity after 100 cycles at 200 mA∙g−1 . Despite progress in developing multicomponent alloys, these materials are typically prepared using time-consuming and expensive methods such as high-temperature melting or ball milling of various pure metals.",
                "Compared to conventional synthetic methods, double-pulse electrodeposition offers several unique advantages for preparing SIB materials , , . Firstly, this electrochemical technique deposits metals on electrodes using pulsed currents, enhancing conductivity without binders or conductive agents, making it simple and cost-effective. Secondly, the deposition rate of metal ions can be enhanced, resulting in high efficiency due to the instant high current density provided by the pulsed current. Thirdly, to achieve more uniform and denser metal deposition and reduce defects and impurities, the quality of deposition can be controlled by adjusting pulse parameters such as width, frequency, and amplitude. Fourthly, double-pulse electrodeposition can form uniform, dense metal layers on the surface of the electrode, exhibiting energy-saving and environmentally friendly characteristics by effectively utilizing electrical energy, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing the generation of waste liquid and gas. Reports on the application of dual-pulse electrodeposition in high-performance sodium-ion battery materials are limited, yet it is a promising and scalable method , , .",
                "This study demonstrates the use of dual-pulse electrodeposition to prepare a copper-based multielement Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 alloy as a binder-free anode, enhancing sodium storage performance. In the double-pulse electrodeposition process, the application of a reverse potential enables the partial dissolution of Cu (the current collector used in this study), which is subsequently re-deposited to form an alloy with active metals. This approach not only strengthens the adhesion between the collector and the deposited materials, thereby promoting charge transport throughout the electrode materials but also facilitates rapid ion replenishment in the electrolyte (plating solution). Three anodes varying the positive potential during deposition were synthesized and integrated into coin cells for electrochemical testing. Preparation of Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode with clusters of pore structure can improve the circulation in the process of volume expansion, penetration of electrolyte, and the transport of sodium ions. Moreover, the addition of copper creates a conductive network that enhances charge transfer and reinforces the stability of the structure. As anticipated, the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode showed stable cycling and strong Na+ storage performance. The optimized Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode exhibited an initial charge/discharge capacity of 368.8/442.2 mAh∙g−1, an initial coulombic efficiency of 83.4 %, and maintained the capacity for 99.9 % after 100 cycles at 300 mA∙g−1. This study leverages a double-pulse electrodeposition strategy, offering novel insights into developing binder-free multicomponent alloy anodes and improving the electrochemical performance of SIBs."

For this, a copper sheet was employed as the working electrode, and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode, as depicted in Fig. 1a. The solution comprises 0.65 M H3BO3 as a buffering agent, 0.78 M CH3COONH4 as a conductive agent, and 0.45 M NaH2PO2 to supply phosphorus. Additionally, 0.05 M C8H4K2O12Sb2 was used as a source of antimony, 0.09 M ZnCl2 as a source of zinc, and 0.02 M SnCl2·2H2O as a source of tin. The plating solution is prepared under normal room temperature conditions, adjusting the pH to 0.5 with 0.3 M HCl. Before electroplating, rinse the copper foil sequentially with 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M HCl solutions to remove surface impurities. The potential-time profile of the deposition process is illustrated in Fig. 1b, with V1 set at - 2.5 V. The electrodeposition was carried out using the following steps programmed into the IviumStat potentiostat:",

                        "The multicomponent Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy was synthesized over 12 duty cycles, each duty cycle consists of two steps (Step 1 + Step 2). Three anodes with different compositions were fabricated at various positive potentials (V2 = 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 V), as depicted in Fig. 1c. Initially, applying a negative potential (V1), Sb, Sn, Zn, and P were deposited and alloyed on the Cu foil. Subsequent application of a positive potential (V2) led to the oxidation of the deposited metals (Sb, Sn, Zn, and P) with copper into the plating solution. When V1 was reapplied, these elements were redeposited and re-alloyed on the copper collector. The Cu foil continued participating in the dissolution/deposition processes even after extending the duty cycles, Ultimately, this process led to the formation of a uniform and compact Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy. This repetitive processing facilitated the formation of a homogeneous and dense Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy. After preparing the electrode material, place it in a vacuum-drying oven and dry it at 80 degrees Celsius for 10 h. Each electrode was then cut into wafers measuring 12 mm in diameter, to be used as anodes for SIBs. The mass of the active material equals the total mass of the copper foil after deposition minus the initial mass of the copper foil."

                "Three Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P anodes with different components were prepared at various positive potentials (V1 = ﹣2.5 V, V2 = 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 V). ICP-MS determined the atomic ratios in the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloys, as detailed in Table S1. The ICP-MS results show atomic ratios for Cu, Sb, Sn, Zn, and P as follows: 59.7:29.8:5.3:0.3:4.9, 68.6:23.0:3.2:0.3:4.9 and 72.9:19.4:2.6:0.3:4.8, they were labeled as Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9, Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 and Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8, corresponding to increasing V2 potentials from 0.8 V to 1.2 V. This trend indicates that a higher V2 leads to more Cu oxidation into Cu2+, thus increasing Cu deposition. The proportions of Zn and P remained consistent, suggesting their deposition was unaffected by changes in V2.",
                "To study the nucleation process of the alloy particles, thus a series of electrodes were prepared and analyzed using SEM. Fig. 2 displays SEM images of the electrode surface under different deposition conditions. When V1 = ﹣2.5 V (step 1) was applied, the Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy was uniformly deposited on the rough Cu foil. Once V2= 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 V were applied (step 2), the morphology of deposits on the Cu foil varied depending on the positive potential. When the positive potential was 0.8 V, the surface morphology of the coating in Fig. 2b is almost similar to that in Fig. 2a. When the positive potentials are set at 1.0 V and 1.2 V (Fig. 2c–d), the sedimentary surface exhibits irregular bulk (shown in the red box), which is identified as Cu by mapping tests in the red selection area (Fig. S1). It illustrates that the Sb, Sn, Zn, and P deposited on the surface of Cu at ﹣2.5 V are oxidized into ions in the solution, and accompanied by the oxidation of Cu to Cu2+, thus exposing the bare Cu. By comparing the exposed Cu surface (Fig. S1a–b), the surface of Cu is rougher when V2 = 1.2 V than the surface of Cu with a positive potential of 1.0 V. It shows that the more positive potential, the greater the degree of Cu oxidation. So the higher concentration of Cu in the solution, and the greater content of its deposition at negative potential (V1 = ﹣2.5 V). This aligns with the ICP-MS test results mentioned earlier. The irregular bulks on the electrode surface fade when ﹣2.5 V is continued to be applied. The surface of the Cu substrate is uniformly loaded with a Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy layer (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2f–h depict the SEM images of the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P electrodes prepared with different duty cycles at a positive potential of 1.0 V.",
                "The Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloys gathered in the bulges on the surface of copper foil, resulting in the void formation in the Cu foil depression, and Cu was evenly distributed (in the blue selection in Fig. 2f–h). The Cu in the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy is derived from the base Cu foil, which is redox with other ions such as Sb, Sn, Zn, and P, and finally forms a quinary alloy through an in-situ growth process. Through the synergistic action of each element (Cu, Sb, Sn, Zn, P) and surface morphology, it is expected to show excellent sodium storage performance.",
                "XRD was used for phase composition analysis of the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloys. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the diffraction peaks are 26.7°, 31.6°, 37.1°, 45.4°, 54.9° and 66.1° for Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9 anode correspond to (101), (110), (102), (200), (202) and (220) crystal plane of Cu2Sb (No. 03-065-2815). SnO (No. 01-077-2296) with the respective crystal plane index of (112) and (114) produced peaks at 28.8° and 40.1°, and the diffraction peak at 53.4° belongs to the (141) crystal plane of ZnP2 (No. 00-023-0748). The Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode has the same Cu2Sb diffraction peak and crystal plane as the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9, the diffraction peak at 29.4° accords with the (101) crystal plane of SbSn (No. 00-033-0118) and the diffraction peak at 53.4° matches up with the (141) crystal plane of ZnP2.

                "1 ̅30) crystal plane of ZnP2, and the diffraction peak at 29.4° is referred to as the (101) crystal plane of SbSn. All of the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9, Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9, and Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anodes contain Sb2O3 and Cu0.6Zn0.39 phase. The three diffraction peaks at 35.1°, 38.9°, and 64.7° are assigned to (331), (422), and (731) crystal planes of Sb2O3 (No. 01-071-0383), respectively. One diffraction peak at 77.7° correlates with Cu0.6Zn0.39 (No. 00-019-0179) of the (112) crystal plane. In short, the discrepancies in the phases and crystal plane indices of the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloys deposited at the three positive potentials are related to the existence of preferential crystal phase orientation during deposition. According to the definition of crystallinity, which is the ratio of the intensity of the diffraction peaks to the total intensity, the calculated crystallinity value is 75 %. Additionally, the grain size was calculated to be 102 nm using the Scherrer equation, derived from the broadening of the XRD peaks  , . XPS was utilized to ascertain the surface composition of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 alloy. The full XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 3b reveals the presence of Cu, Sb, Sn, Zn, and P. XPS peaks for Cu observed at 952.8 eV and 933.0 eV in Fig. 3c equivalent to Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2, respectively, associated with Cu2Sb and Cu0.61Zn0.39 . Additional satellite peaks of Cu were noted . The XPS spectrum of Sb 3d in Fig. 3d displays four peaks at 540.0 eV, 537.4 eV, 530.8 eV, and 528.0 eV. The 540.0 eV and 530.8 eV peaks indicate Sb2O3, while those at 537.4 eV and 528.0 eV originate from metallic Sb . Test results for Sn elements, the XPS results in Fig. 3e show two peaks at 495.2 eV and 486.8 eV, assigned to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 of SbSn and SnO , respectively. The XPS peaks at 139.3 eV and 133.4 eV, as shown in Fig. 3f, correspond to Zn 3s and ZnP2 , . These findings confirm the presence of multiple phases as identified in the XRD analysis, highlighting the complex interplay of elements within the deposited alloys. Theoretically, the electrodeposition process involves the reduction of metal ions, and the formation of oxides should be absent. However, the presence of oxides is an expected outcome of the alloy’s exposure to atmospheric condition . The accompanying EDX data confirmed the oxygen stoichiometry of the prepared composite samples, indicating that oxygen constitutes 1.55 % of the total stoichiometry (Fig. S3d).",
                "The surface morphology of the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloys was analyzed by SEM and measured for particle size. As illustrated in Fig. 4, all of Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9, Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9, and Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anodes are consist of spherical particles of different sizes protruding from the surface of the copper foil. The accumulation occurs in the bulged areas of the Cu foil, which will generate many voids to alleviate volume expansion throughout the cycling process. The selected areas (shown in the red box) in Fig. 4a–c were enlarged to obtain Fig. 4d–f, and their particle sizes were calculated. The results are shown in the insets of Fig. 4a–c, the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9 anode has a maximum particle size of 285.3 nm, a minimum particle size of 62.6 nm, and an average of 151.3 nm. In comparison to the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9 anode, the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode has a lower average particle size of 103.0 nm (maximum particle size: 175.6 nm, minimum particle size: 23.6 nm). Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anode possesses the smallest particle size: maximum particle size is 147.1 nm, minimum particle size is 12.4 nm, and average particle size is 69.7 nm. The Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode has a variety of voids and a less agglomerated appearance, which enables the electrolyte to penetrate and reduces volume expansion during cycling. With the increase of positive potentials (0.8 V, 1.0 V, 1.2 V), the particle size decreases (151.3 nm, 103.0 nm, and 69.7 nm. This is mainly due to the increase of positive potential to accelerate the reduction of metal ions, and eventually lead to the rapid formation of Cu-based alloys. Fig. S2 shows the SEM images and mappings of the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9, Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9, and Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anodes, which explain that Cu, Sb, Sn, Zn, and P are uniformly distributed within the selection area. The annealing process can significantly influence both the morphology and average grain size of the material . Fig. S3a–c present the SEM images obtained after annealing for 2 h at temperatures of 100, 200, and 300 ℃, alongside the corresponding measured grain sizes. Post-annealing, the morphology transitioned from uniformly clustered structures to stacked formations resembling wheat. However, the average grain size exhibited minimal variation, as indicated in Table S2. The electrochemical performance of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode after annealing at 100, 200, and 300 ℃ was further tested, as shown in Fig. S3e. The initial charge capacities achieved were 358, 354, and 350 mAh∙g−1, respectively, and there was a noticeable capacity decay during the cycling process. It was found that the annealing temperature had no significant effect on the enhancement of electrochemical performance.",
                "The Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 electrode has an appropriate ratio of Sb, Cu, and Sn, a moderate particle size (103.0 nm), and a uniform distribution of components, so it is expected to show the best electrochemical performance among the three electrodes. It has been reported that electrochemical stability is related to particle size.",
                "To evaluate the sodium storage capabilities of the material, sodium ion half-cells were assembled using Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloys as the anode. This setup was subjected to a series of electrochemical tests to assess performance, as depicted in Fig. 5a–b, with a potential range of 0.02–1.50 V. Fig. 5a illustrates the cycling performances of Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P cells under a current density of 300 mA∙g−1. The initial charge and discharge capacities of the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9 anode are 263.1 mAh∙g−1 for charge and 319.8 mAh∙g−1 for discharge, respectively, achieving a first coulombic efficiency of 82.3 %. However, these capacities begin to diminish after 60 cycles, with a capacity retention of only 41.8 % after 100 cycles. In contrast, the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode demonstrates superior initial specific capacities of 368.8 mAh∙g−1 for charge and 422.2 mAh∙g−1 for discharge, with a coulombic efficiency of 83.4 %. The initial capacity loss is mainly attributed to the formation of the SEI film, followed by the decomposition of the electrolyte, which produces by-products that block the electrode voids and impede the migration of sodium ions, which ultimately leads to a decrease in capacity, and partial dissociation leading to the deposition of sodium metal on the anode surface as well as the decomposition of some of the active substances in the electrode , . Despite these problems, the discharge-specific capacity of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode remains at 376.2 mAh∙g−1 after 100 cycles, indicative of a remarkable capacity retention rate of 99.9 %, which underscores its outstanding cycling stability. Moreover, the initial specific capacities of the Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anode are 212.3 mAh∙g−1 for charge and 327.9 mAh∙g−1 for discharge, with a first coulombic efficiency of 64.7 % and a capacity retention rate of 94.2 % after 100 cycles. The Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode exhibits the most robust cycling performance among the tested electrodes. Fig. 5b details the rate performances of the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy anodes across a potential spectrum of 0.02–1.5 V (vs. Na/Na+). The Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode displays reversible capacities that remain stable over various current densities, demonstrating capacities of 357.2, 342.5, 334.2, 323.8, 312.2, and 290.3 mAh∙g−1 at increasing rates at 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 mA∙g−1, and maintaining stability when returning to lower rates. Conversely, the other anodes show higher rates of capacity degradation under similar conditions. The superior rate reversibility of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode can be largely owing to the synergistic effects of Cu within the alloy, optimizing electron conductivity and mass-specific capacity, as well as to clusters of appropriate particle size (103.0 nm as shown in Fig. 4b), which facilitate electrolyte penetration and sodium ion transport, enhancing overall electrochemical performance .",
                "The cyclic voltammetry technique was utilized to elucidate the sodium storage mechanism of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode. Initial findings are presented in Fig. 5c, which displays the first five CV curves at a scan rate of 0.25 mV/s, within the range of potentials from 0.02 to 1.50 V. Notably, the CV profile from the first cycle distinctly differs from later cycles, indicating an activation process during the initial discharge . The prominent broad peak at 0.2 V during the first reduction is linked to several concurrent processes: the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI), the reduction of metal oxides (SnO and Sb2O3) to their respective metals in the presence of Na (yielding Na2O, Sn and Sb), and the complex multi-step alloying of Na with active metals to form Na15Sn4, Na3Sb, NaZn13 and Na3P , . Subsequent cycles between 0.6 V and 0.3 V reveal multiple peaks attributed to the formation of various sodium-metal compounds (NaxMy, where M includes O, Sb, Sn, Zn, and P). Additionally, a decrease in the cathodic peak current at 0.3 V across cycles suggests crystal structure alterations due to sodium accumulation within the active material . During the oxidation phase, a single peak at 0.9 V on behalf of the dissociation of these compounds. The reactions involved are described as follows , , , , :(1)",

                "Charge and discharge profiles of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode at 300 mA·g−1 for the 1st, 5th, 20th, 50th, and 100th cycle within a potential range from 0.02 V to 1.50 V are displayed in Fig. 5d. The initial discharge curve drops rapidly from 1.50 V to 0.45 V, followed by a flat potential plateau at 0.3 V, indicative of the alloying of Na with the multi-element Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy. The initial charge curve includes a sloped segment ranging from 0.02 to 0.75 V followed by a flat plateau extending from 0.75 to 1.10 V, followed by a gradual ascent to 1.50 V. Subsequent cycles show overlapping charge/discharge curves, reflecting excellent reversibility and stability of the anode, as evidenced in Fig. 5a. EIS curves of Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9, Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9, and Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anodes are depicted in Fig. 5e. The equivalent circuit diagram (Fig. S4) includes the charge transfer resistance (Rct), SEI film resistance (Rf), and electrolyte resistance (Rs) . For the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode, Rf decreased from 95.4 Ω at open circuit potential (OCV, 2.5 V) to 89.7 Ω after 100 cycles. The Rct also reduced significantly from 71 Ω to 4.2 Ω, suggesting enhanced reaction kinetics and reduced interfacial and charge transfer impedances, reflecting the structural stability improved by dynamic supramolecular interactions . The specifically analyzed data are listed in Table S3. This uniform distribution of Cu within the alloy facilitates enhanced conductivity and contributes to the stability of the SEI film. In contrast, increased Rf values in other anode formulations suggest less stable SEI films, correlating with poorer cycling performance, aligning with observations from Fig. 5a .",
                "The surface morphology and elemental distribution of the Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P anode which was fully sodiated after 100 cycles, were revealed by SEM, EDS. The EDS results of the red dotted box in Fig. 6a are shown in Fig. 6b. Results from EDS (Fig. 6b) demonstrate that the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode has a homogeneous distribution of the elements Cu, Sb, Sn, Zn, P, Na, C and O. As illustrated in Fig. 6c–d, the results show a compact SEI film on the superficiality of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode, which efficiently prevents the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode from cracking. After 100 cycles, there are obvious variations in the surface morphology of the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9, Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9, and Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anodes (Fig. 6e–g). The surface of the Cu59.7Sb29.8Sn5.3Zn0.3P4.9 anode exhibits a lack of distinct particles, suggesting that the structure of the anode is unstable and easy to damage during cycling, which will eventually lead to poor cycling performance. It is in agreement with the results of Fig. 5a. The microstructure of Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 is still congregated because of the stable SEI film of Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode after 100 cycles (Fig. 6f) which further confirms that Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode shows superior electrochemical sodium storage properties. The surface of the particles has more pieces on the Cu72.9Sb19.4Sn2.6Zn0.3P4.8 anode after 100 cycles (as shown in Fig. 6g). The presence of noticeable agglomerates on the electrode surface may be caused by particle fragmentation, which blocks the gaps between particles, impeding the infiltration of the electrolyte and consequently affecting the sodium storage performance of the electrode. Comparing the surface morphology of the electrode after 100 cycles, further confirms the stability of the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode structure, thereby exhibiting improved electrochemical performance.",

Fig. 7e–f respectively illustrate the trends of DNa+ values with potential during the discharge and charging processes. Tests showed that the Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 electrode exhibited excellent Na+ diffusion performance during battery cycling. The superior performance can be credited to the existence of “Cu”, which not only improves the electrical conductivity, but also effectively reduces the volume expansion caused by the cycling process, and enables the electrode to remain stable during the extended cycling process."

                "In conclusion, we successfully prepared a multicomponent Cu-Sb-Sn-Zn-P alloy as a binder-free alloy anode using a novel double-pulse electrodeposition method. The microscopic morphology and chemical composition of the multicomponent alloy anode were well controlled by adjusting the positive potential. The binder-free Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anode has high charge/discharge specific capacities, capacity retention, and excellent rate performance. Notably, the optimized anode demonstrates an initial discharge capacity of 368.8 mAh∙g−1 while maintaining an exceptional capacity retention of 99.9 % after 100 cycles at 300 mA∙g−1. Moreover, this anode retains a capacity of 290.3 mAh∙g−1, even under a high current density of 3200 mA∙g−1. This excellent performance is mainly attributed to the fact that Cu enhances the electronic conductivity of the alloy, and secondly, the suitable particle-size clusters with voids are favorable for electrolyte infiltration and sodium ion transport, which improves its electrochemical performance. The double-pulse electrodeposition proposed in this paper opens a new way to prepare SIBs alloy anode materials."
