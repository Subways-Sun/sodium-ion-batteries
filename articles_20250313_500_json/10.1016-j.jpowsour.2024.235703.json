                "Amorphous alumina (a-Al2O3)-coated Na3VAl(PO4)3 samples are prepared by a low-cost, easily scalable, and environmentally friendly sol-gel process. X-ray diffraction reveals no significant structural changes after deposition. The presence of the amorphous carbon conductive and a-Al2O3 phases will be respectively confirmed in the light of Raman and NMR spectroscopies. Electron microscopy evidences the presence of alumina particles deposited on the substrate. Ex-situ XRD shows the reversible structural changes while sodium is inserted. Ex-situ XPS reveals the effective participation of V5+/V4+/V3+ species during the electrochemical reaction, while the formation of aluminum oxyfluorides justifies the efficient HF removal that prevents electrode degradation.",
                "Electrochemical tests will validate this proposal. Thus, rate capability essays indicate that 1–3 % a-Al2O3 coating enhances capacity at high rates, with coated samples exhibiting a fast sodium migration and lower cell resistance at both the beginning and conclusion of cycling tests. It is supported by evaluating the kinetic response showing their high capacitive contributions and diffusion coefficients, especially in the 2 % a-Al2O3 coated sample. Eventually, these findings are corroborated by the good capacity retention of the 2 % coated sample during prolonged cycling at both room and low temperatures."

                "As the world strives for a clean and sustainable future, renewable sources are gaining momentum. Notwithstanding, their intermittent energy harvest becomes a challenge. The excess must be somehow stored to be further delivered on demand. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a potential game-changer for implementing efficient electricity storage devices and accelerating the integration of renewables into the grid [ , , , , ]. Unlike lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), SIBs rely on sodium, a widely available and much cheaper element. This translates to potentially lower production costs, making them an attractive option for large-scale energy storage installations, which ensures abundance and affordability. Otherwise, safety and stability are improved because of their superior thermal and chemical stability compared to LIBs, which minimizes the risk of fires and explosions, making them safer for grid applications and home energy storage [ , ].",
                "One of the key challenges in the development of SIBs is the identification of high-performance cathode materials including Prussian blue analogues, O3 and P2-type layered oxides, organic compounds, metal-organic frameworks, and polyanionic compounds among others [ , , , , , , , , ]. Due to its low cost, high energy density, and good cycling stability, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a promising cathode material for SIBs. This polyanionic compound features a NASICON-type structure characterized by a three-dimensional framework of PO4 tetrahedra that encapsulates Na+ and V3+ ions. During sodium extraction, V3+ ions are oxidized to V4+. Further reversible intercalation of the alkaline ions allows the generation of an electrochemical current [ , , , ]. Although NVP has a lower theoretical capacity than LiCoO2 as a LIB cathode, it is still higher than that of NaFePO4 as a cathode for SIB. Despite its good cycling stability, the elevated cost and probed toxicity of vanadium will undoubtedly limit the applicability of NVP in large-scale energy storage devices.",
                "A strategy to limit the presence of vanadium is the partial substitution by less concerning electroactive metals such as Mn [ , ] and Fe [ , ], allowing a fine-tuning of the cell output voltage. Due to their affordability and high inertness, Al³⁺ ions are commonly chosen as substituting elements in lithium cathode materials to stabilize the phase structure [ , , ]. Therefore, it is understandable that this same strategy would be pursued in cathode materials for SIBS [ , , ]. Surprisingly, the replacement of V3+ by electrochemically inactive Al3+ has direct consequences on the cell capacity. The presence of aluminum activates the V5+/V4+ redox couple which is evidenced by a new plateau at ca. 4 V [ , ]. Unfortunately, this plateau features poor reversibility. Surface modification of metal oxide to build a protective barrier limiting electrode degradation could be an interesting approach. Up to now, only a few reports have checked this possibility in related NASICON phosphates. Huang et al. proved the synergistic effect when cerium is simultaneously doping and surface coating as CeO2 in a NASICON-type cathode [ ]. Otherwise, Klee et al. reported the benefits of Al2O3 coating onto Na3V2(PO4)3, to scavenge corrosive HF traces from the electrolyte to provide a resilient material against electrode degradation [ ]. Liu et al. showed that the Al2O3 coating onto P2-type Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 particles effectively suppresses the undesired side reaction at high voltage along with the exfoliation of the metal-oxygen slabs [ ].",
                "We have synthesized coated Al2O3@Na3VAl(PO4)3/C by a single and low-cost procedure to unveil the effect of the coating agent on the electrochemical performance of this NASICON-type material as a positive electrode in sodium-ion batteries. The freshly prepared materials were structurally and morphologically characterized by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, while their elemental composition and chemical state were respectively determined by fluorescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The reversibility of the sodium insertion and kinetic response of the studied electrodes was tested by galvanostatic and potentiometric techniques to unveil the potential applicability as a positive electrode for sodium-ion batteries."

                        "Na3VAl(PO4)3/C, as a substrate, was prepared by a citric-based sol-gel route. For this purpose, citric acid (Aldrich, 99 %), ammonium vanadate (Panreac, 98 %), and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Panreac, 98 %) in a 3:1:1 M ratio were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water (solution A). An appropriate molar amount of sodium phosphate monobasic (Aldrich, 98–102 %) was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water (solution B). Then, solution B was dropwise poured on solution A under continuous stirring. The solvent was further removed in a rotary evaporator (70 °C; 200 mbar) and the resulting homogeneous gel was dried overnight at 120 °C. This solid precursor was ball milled for 10 min and subjected to calcination at 750 °C for 8 h (heating ramp: 3 °C min−1) under an Ar stream (80 mL min−1). Citric acid is a metal-chelating agent that ensures a uniform distribution of metal in the departing precursor. Also, its thermal decomposition under the Ar atmosphere leaves a carbon phase that ensures proper electronic conductivity. This sample will be labeled as NVAlP@Al0.",

Next, 0.5 g of the Na3VAl(PO4)3/C substrate was added to the latter solution. To ensure a uniform impregnation of the coating agent and the substrate, the suspension was gently blended for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the suspension was gradually heated to 70 °C to remove the solvent. The impregnated samples were further dried at 120 °C overnight, pestled in an agate mortar, and annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in an argon atmosphere (Ar flow: 80 mL min−1). The samples were labeled as NVAlP@AlX, X being the percentage of Al2O3 added. Similar coating procedures based on the impregnation of the solid substrate with a solution of coating agent have demonstrated their validity in preparing electrode materials with a stabilized surface ensuring long-term cycling stability [ , ]."

Working electrodes were fabricated by mixing 70 % active material, 20 % carbon black, and 10 % PVDF binder. This mixture was dispersed in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) until complete PVDF dissolution. The resulting paste was coated onto 9 mm aluminum current collectors and further subjected to vacuum drying at 120 °C for 2 h. The target loading was approximately 4 mg/cm2. Attempts to increase the mass loading were not successful, involving a slight decrease of capacity and an enhanced increase of the cell impedance (Fig. S1). Sodium metal served as the counter electrode (9 mm diameter (Panreac, 99.8 %)).

The electrochemical response at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte was investigated using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). A Biologic SP-150 potentiostat was employed to apply an AC signal of 5 mV, perturbing the open circuit voltage. The resulting spectrum was recorded across a frequency range from 100 kHz to 2 mHz.

                "The calcination of the citrate precursor in an inert atmosphere is anticipated to yield an amorphous carbon-based conductive phase alongside the primary product, Na3VAl(PO4)3. Unfortunately, X-ray diffraction could not conclusively detect this carbon conductive phase. It features a broadened (002) reflection at ca. 25° 2θ, masked by the intense reflections of the crystalline phosphate at this low calcination temperature. To definitively identify this carbonaceous residues Raman spectra were recorded. The spectra span the range between 950 and 1900 cm⁻1 (Fig. 1a and Fig. S3), These profiles can be deconstructed into two main Gaussian-Lorentzian components at ca. 1348 ± 1 cm⁻1 (D1), attributed to disordered domains and ca. 1591 ± 2 cm⁻1 (G), corresponding to ‘in-plane’ displacement of carbon atoms within crystalline graphene domains [ ]. Additional components indicative of amorphous carbon appear at ca. 1510 ± 2 cm⁻1 (D3), ca. 1153 ± 2 cm⁻1 (D4), ca. 1685 ± 2 cm⁻1 (D2). Minor peaks slightly over 1000 cm⁻1 are commonly attributed to vibrational modes of PO4 tetrahedra. The ratio between the integrated areas of the G and D1 bands offers a measure of graphitization. Consistently, a ratio of 0.35 was observed across all samples tested, indicating a uniform level of graphitization. This value points to a relatively low graphitization level, which aligns with expectations based on the calcination process conducted at 800 °C. Additionally, the subsequent calcination step, aimed at decomposing the aluminum precursor at 500 °C, appears to have had no significant impact on the carbon structure. Elemental analysis was employed to quantify the carbonaceous phase, revealing a composition that varied from 11 to 14 percent.",
                "Concerning the aluminum coating agent, the amorphous character of the product (a-Al2O3) resulting from the thermal decomposition of aluminum isopropoxide at the conditions of the synthesis (500 °C) was revealed by XRD (Fig. S4), in good agreement with previous reports [ ]. Also, a featureless background was observed from a-Al2O3, Raman spectrum, as early reported [ ]. In addition, 27Al NMR spectra were recorded to obtain direct proof of the presence of the coating agent deposited on the surface of Na3VAl(PO4)3 particles. The spectrum of a-Al2O3 reveals three broadened overlapped bands at 5, 35, and 66 ppm which have been assigned to different local environments of Al in the amorphous oxide [ , ]. Fig. 1b also shows the spectra recorded on bare NVAlP@Al0 and NVAlP@Al4. Two main bands at −17 and 39 ppm can be ascribed to Al in octahedral and tetrahedral environments [ ], the former being broadened by quadrupolar interactions and representative of the Al3+ ions replacing V3+ in the NASICON structure. The tetrahedral aluminum is not consistent with the structure of the bare solid but could be representative of surface Al ions in a lower coordination number, as found in other forms of alumina [ ], as well as the AlPO4 impurities. A close inspection of the spectrum of NVAlP@Al4 reveals the presence of small shoulders in the main bands that can be explained by the occurrence of a-Al2O3, as remarked by the superposition of spectra of a-Al2O3 in red color.",
                "The determination of compositional data for the Na3VAl(PO4)3 substrate revealed an actual composition of Na3.08V1.04Al1.00(P1.02O4.67)3, which is quite close to the theoretical stoichiometry except for the significantly high oxygen content which could be associated to oxygen adsorption at the particle surface or even oxygenated groups at the carbon phase. Further determination of aluminum content in the a-Al2O3 coated samples was quite challenging due to their extremely low content as compared to the Al present in the Na3VAl(PO4)3 substrate. However, an appreciable linearity compared to the theoretically expected values was evidenced (Fig. S5). Additional proofs of the effective a-Al2O3 deposition arose from the FE-SEM images and EDX maps included in Figs. S6–S8. The EDX maps for the constituting elements evidencing their homogeneous distribution on the particle surface. This fact confirms the goodness of the sol-gel route-based synthesis method, in which homogeneous precipitation yields a homogeneous distribution of the elements in the final product, in contrast with classical direct calcination of reactants. A typical particle of NVAlP@Al4 showed large agglomerations of aluminum prominently standing out on the substrate surface. Likely, the amount of Al2O3 that can be uniformly coated onto the substrate has been overcome. It will have detrimental consequences on the electrochemical performance, as will be mentioned. The FFT of the HRTEM images (Fig. 1c) revealed both ordered (from the NVAlP) structure and disordered regions. Although the assignation of the latter ones to either carbon or a-Al2O3 was not possible, EDX maps taken near the surface (Fig. 1d) exposed small nanoparticles in which Al and O are present, while those elements as Na, P, and V belonging to the substrate are absent.",
                "Cyclic voltammograms were recorded on sodium half-cells previously activated for one cycle at C/10 (Fig. 2). For bare NVAlP@Al0, two broadened anodic peaks appear at ca. 3.7 V and 4 V versus Na+/Na. Their reversibility is evidenced by cathodic features respectively at 3.2 V and 3.9 V, which are respectively assigned to the V4+/V3+ and V5+/V4+ [ ]. These peaks have been labeled in Fig. 2. The difficulty of the latter oxidation to pentavalent vanadium is evidenced by the smaller contribution of the high-voltage bands. The cathodic band at ca. 3.2 V appears split resulting in an extremely broadened band. Sun et al. assumed this effect could be associated with kinetic limitations of sodium diffusion through the active material sites [ ]. Notwithstanding, the lack of the corresponding anodic band may through some doubts about sodium reversibility. An alternative explanation has been provided by Rudola et al. [ ]. According to these authors, this voltage step is produced by an increase in polarization of the counter electrode rather than a change in the potential of the working electrode. The origin of this effect is attributed to the formation of a passivation layer on the sodium counter electrode which is not observed in the oxidation profile because the surface layer dissolves during each cycle. The authors state that the choice of the solvent for the electrolyte is critical, not being observed when PC is used. This assessment disagrees with our experiments in which this solvent was used, indicating that a plausible explanation for this phenomenon must be more complicated, though out of the goals of this work. Anyway, it is evident the influence of the surface on it, because the deposition of 1–3% of a-Al2O3 in our samples involved a drastic diminution of the splitting of this signal, mainly at high sweep rates.",
                "From these CV curves recorded at increasing rates, some interesting kinetic properties can be inferred for the studied samples. The relative faradaic to capacitive contributions can be determined from the slope of the linear relationship between the current values at the selected peak maxima (Ip) versus the sweep rate ν according to equation [1] (Fig. S9) [ ]:[1]",
                "logI p = loga + blogv",
                "The faradaic contribution resides in the Na+ insertion and the electron transfer at the redox active sites, while the capacitive one comes from the electrostatic interactions with charged defects existing in the lattice [ ]. The calculated b-values were in all cases between 0.5 and 1. A b-value equivalent to 0.5 is ascribed to a faradaic diffusion-limited reaction, while b = 1.0 refers to a capacitive response. The electrostatic interactions related to the capacitive process exert low activation barriers as compared to the sodium diffusion inside the particle and hence may positively contribute to a fast Na+ reaction. Fig. 5a displays the b-values determined at the main peaks, labeled in Fig. 4, recorded in a cell activated by one cycle at C/10. As a general trend, a high capacitive contribution (b > 0.75) was observed for the high voltage peaks (Peaks 2 and 3), involving that the participation of the V5+/V4+ redox couple induced by Al substitution in NVP favors a fast Na+ exchange at high voltage. A clear influence of the Al coating during the anodic profile could not be elucidated, though further discharge revealed that the capacitive contribution is more relevant for these samples during discharge.",

These values ranged from the lowest value of 1.55.10−12 cm2 s−1 for NVAlP@Al4 at Peak 3 to 1.9.10−10 cm2 s−1 for NVAlP@Al2 and NVAlP@Al3. The U-shape curve reveals that the predominantly faradaic processes at Peaks 1 and 4 performed the highest coefficients, while the lowest values corresponded to Na+ insertion at the high voltage plateau. Concerning the effect of a-Al2O3 coating, it is clear that a low level of coating (1–3%) involved an increase in the coefficients, while the lowest values were determined for NVAlP@Al4.",
                "Besides the peak current, the peak voltage may also show valuable information. Particularly, the increase of voltage between peaks 1 and 4 (ΔV1-4) and peaks 2 and 3 (ΔV2-3) reveals the charge-discharge hysteresis at a given sweep rate. Fig. 5c plots these values to show a clear tendency which may explain the performance of these electrodes at high rates. On the one hand, we observe that the overall hysteresis is higher for the V4+/V3+ redox reaction at ca. 3.5 V than for the oxidation to V5+ at 4 V. This observation would indicate that the presence of Al replacing V is favorable for the kinetic behavior of this material despite the low capacity delivered by this small plateau. The positive effect of a-Al2O3 coating on the charge and discharge hysteresis is evidenced in both plateaus at least for percentage values not higher than 3 %. It could be foreseen that behavior will be reflected in the rate capability test as will be further evidenced.",
                "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a helpful technique to unveil the cell's internal resistance as a sum of the contributions of the electrode/electrolyte interphases and the cell's internal components. Fig. 5d depicts the Nyquist plots recorded after the first cycle at C/10. Their fitting to the equivalent circuit (Fig. S11) allowed us to determine the ohmic drop (Rel) due to the sum of electrolyte and cell components, resulting in negligible values. Also, surface layer (Rsl) and charge-transfer reaction (Rct) resistances can be elucidated (Table 2). Although Rsl values were comparatively higher than Rct ones, the a-Al2O3 coating exerted a notorious diminution of their values reaching a minimum for NVAlP@Al2 (0.972 Ohm g) to be further increased for larger amounts of deposited alumina. Concerning the charge transfer resistance, their values also found a minimum value for the coated samples.",
                "The rate capability was tested in sodium-half-cells subjected to increasing rates from C/10 to 5C for five cycles (Fig. 4a). The first discharge capacity of bare NVAlP@Al0 took values of ca. 85 mA h g−1, which are close to those reported in the literature for the same composition [ , , ] (Table S2; Supplementary Materials file). This value decreased to 79 mA h g−1 after the fifth cycle. Coating with 2 and 3 % of Al2O3 respectively increased the initial capacity to 86 and 88 mA h g−1, while a moderate diminution to 82 and 84 mA h g−1, was recorded in the same range. This appreciable improvement in the capacity retention for these samples was extended until the 30th cycle at 5C, for which 63.6 and 63.8 mA h g−1 were retained, while only 59.4 mA h g−1 were recorded for the bare sample. Otherwise, the deposition of 4 % a-Al2O3 onto the Na3VAl(PO4)3 substrate led to a detrimental loss of capacity. This evidenced that the optimum level of coating to provide electrochemical benefits was surpassed. Charge and discharge curves at each rate were plotted in Fig. 4b. As can be seen, the cell capacity is delivered by two reversible plateaus, whose average charge and discharge voltages agree to Peaks 1 to 4 in CV curves. On increasing the C rate, the length of the discharge plateaus shortens evidencing the loss of capacity. This effect is comparatively more abrupt for the high voltage plateau, being disappeared for NVAlP@Al0 and NVAlP@Al4 samples at 5C. Otherwise, the hysteresis of the large plateaus at ca. 3.5 V was slightly higher for these latter samples in good agreement with the data in Fig. 3c.",
                "Ex-situ XRD patterns were recorded for NVAlP@Al2 electrodes at selected points of the first cycle revealing the high reversibility of the sodium insertion into the NASICON framework (Fig. S12). These patterns reveal a progressive shift to higher diffraction angles during charge, as would be expected from a cell contraction when Na+ is extracted from the NASICON structure. It was corroborated by the calculation of cell parameters (Table 1). Further discharge led to XRD patterns in which the original parameters were retrieved due to the cell expansion upon sodium insertion.",
                "The participation of vanadium in the electrochemical reaction was evidenced by the XPS spectra recorded at both the initial state and fully charged electrodes in bare NVAlP@Al0 and coated NVAlP@Al2 (Fig. 5).

Also, a small satellite of the neighbor O1s level appears at ca. 520.7 ± 0.3 eV. Upon charging, these bands can be decomposed into two components at 517.4 ± 0.3 and 518.3 ± 0.2 eV, respectively ascribable to the oxidation to V4+ and V5+ [ ]. The Al2p subspectra recorded for both bare and coated samples feature a unique band at 74.7 ± 0.1 eV ascribable to Al-O bonds. Unfortunately, the contribution of Al-O bonds in a−Al2O3 could not be discerned from that of Al-O in the NASICON structure in the spectrum of raw NVAlP@Al2 [ , ]. Upon charging, this band remained unvaried as expected from the absence of any accessible oxidized state for aluminum. Otherwise, a new band appeared at higher binding energies (75.9 eV) for NVAlP@Al2 after charging. Other researchers have reported alterations in the chemical state of aluminum within Al2O3-coated cathode materials by XPS, revealing the fluorination in Al2O3 [ , ].",
                "Notwithstanding, the binding energy reported for AlF3 is well above that value (ca. 77 eV) [ ], involving the occurrence of a mixed oxide–fluoride according to the next reaction:[3]Al2O3 + 2 HF → Al2O2F2 + H2O",
                "It exerts a sequestering effect of the HF, produced by water traces in the electrolyte, preventing electrode degradation due to the dissolution in the acidic media. In fact, the presence of several aluminum-oxyfluorides, along with the removal of HF from the electrolyte, has been determined in Al2O3 coated Li[Li0.05Ni0.4Co0.15Mn0.4]O2 using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy [ ]. Moreover, Waller et al. pointed out that the excess of water produced along with AlF3 after full fluorination of aluminum would be counterproductive and would yield more HF leading to the eventual electrode degradation [ ].",
                "The rate capability tests were extended to a subsequent stage in which the sodium half-cells were allowed to cycle for 70 more cycles to determine their ability to retain the capacity at 1C. In this way, NVAlP@Al2 was the cathode sample exhibiting better capacity retention after the 100th cycle (Fig. 4a), evidencing the beneficial effect of the a-Al2O3 coating. To gather information about how cycling may alter the kinetic response due to electrode degradation, the cycled sodium half-cells were subjected to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at the 100th cycle. The CV curves, displayed in Fig. 6, were plotted at the same vertical scale as in Fig. 2 to unveil a slight decrease in intensity in the current peaks. This effect was less pronounced for NVAlP@Al2 in good agreement with its better capacity retention. Also, the CV curves recorded for NVAlP@Al1 and NVAlP@Al3 suffered an enhanced broadening after cycling, while those of NVAlP@Al2 preserved their linewidth despite the long cycling. All these facts are in coincidence to the better cycling performance exerted by the latter sample.",
                "Similarly to the procedure performed after one cycle, the information provided by the CV curves was quantified by determining the b-values, charge-discharge hysteresis, and apparent diffusion coefficients (Fig. 7a–c). The analysis of linear plots of log Ip versus log ν allowed us to deduce the b-values from the slopes (Fig. S13). The values displayed in Fig. 7a show that a more capacitive behavior is preserved for Peaks 2 and 3, though now the highest b-values belong preferentially to NVAlP@Al2, which may favor the fast Na+ exchange through the electrode-electrolyte interphase to eventually provide a good cycling performance. Concerning the apparent diffusion coefficient of sodium ions, the overall tendency yielded higher values for the large peaks 1 and 4 remained unvaried (Fig. 7b and Fig. S14). Only a slight decrease in values was observed. Even so, samples coated with 2 and 3 % a-Al2O3 remained at the highest values irrespective of the peak. The analysis of the peak hysteresis in Fig. 7c evidenced the benefits of a-Al2O3 coating irrespective of the voltage region (ΔV1-4 and ΔV2-3), observing a large hysteresis in bare NVAlP@Al0 as compared to coated samples. Among the latter, a close relationship can be established between better capacity retention and low hysteresis in NVAlP@Al2. The impedance spectra were also recorded in the 100th cycle 1C to unveil the effect of the galvanostatic cycling on the cell's internal resistance. Nyquist plot displayed in Fig. 7d shows only one semicircle ascribable to the surface layer. Otherwise, the fitting of the spectra did not allow to discern any additional semicircle that could be assigned to the charge transfer reaction (Table 2). The effect of coating on the Rsl value was a diminution to reach a minimum value of 1.074 Ohm g for NVAlP@Al2.",
                "To highlight the applicability of the best-performing electrode material, extended cycling experiments were carried out at both room and low temperature. Fig. 8a shows the capacity delivered by coated and bare samples at 2C and 25 °C. The agreement between these average cell capacity values and those displayed in the rate capability tests (Fig. 4) was favorable. As compared to coated samples, the bare one exhibited a poorer coulombic efficiency reflected by a discharge capacity slightly lower than the discharge one. This detrimental effect is circumvented by the coated samples for which efficiency values close to 100 % were recorded. The challenges of operating batteries at low temperatures hinder the practical use of electrode materials in cold regions. The sluggish migration of Na+ ions contributes to slower electrochemical reactions and leads to poor capacity retention under these severe conditions [ , ]. Fig. S15 shows selected cycles and the capacity delivered by sodium half-cells assembled with the studied samples at −15 °C. Among them, NVAlP@Al2 performed the lowest charge-discharge hysteresis and highest reversible capacity. The initial discharge capacity of 55.9 mA h g−1 was 78 % of the values recorded at 25 °C. Due to its best performance, this cell was allowed to cycle until 500 cycles revealing an excellent capacity retention (Fig. 8b)."

                "X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of Na3VAl(PO4)3 revealed a trigonal system with a rhombohedral structure, whose unit cell parameters are slightly smaller than Na3V2(PO4)3 due to the small aluminum size. No significant changes in the crystal structure were observed after the deposition process. Additionally, the carbon-based conductive phase, not detectable by XRD, showed two intense Raman G and D1 bands, whose low ratio was an indicator of a low level of graphitization. The presence of a-Al2O3 was evidenced by 27Al NMR while the XRF measurements showed an increase in the Al content in correlation to the deposition of alumina. Electron microscopy images and EDX maps confirmed small particles deposited onto the phosphate substrate, which Al and O contents evidence the presence of alumina. The reversibility of sodium insertion in the NASICON structure was evidenced by ex-situ XRD. XPS spectroscopy revealed the effective oxidation of vanadium and the sequestering effect of aluminum by yielding oxy-fluoride compounds that efficiently remove HF from the electrolyte.",
                "The rate capability test demonstrated a notable enhancement in capacity delivery at 5C for samples coated with 1–3% Al2O3, compared to the uncoated sample. The kinetic properties of the coated samples were assessed using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy at the start and conclusion of these tests. The peak current analysis revealed unveiled a more capacitive contribution of the 4 V band, assigned to the V5+/V4+ redox couple However, their apparent diffusion coefficients were lower than the more faradaic bands situated around 3.5 V. Regardless, a-Al2O3 coated samples (1–3 %) showed more promising results for rapid sodium migration, aligning with the low cell resistances determined by impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical evaluation of the cycled electrodes evidenced a direct correlation between the superior capacity retention in NVAlP@Al2 and its more capacitive contribution, higher diffusion coefficients, and lower cell resistance compared to the other studied samples. The findings were validated by the outstanding capacity retention of the 2 % coated sample during prolonged cycling at both room (25 °C) and low (−15 °C) temperatures."
