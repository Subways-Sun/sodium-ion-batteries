Figure a shows an example of stress induced rippling in layered Fe0.25TM0.75O2 with empty Na layer from DFT simulation (TM = Mn). The Fe and Mn ordering in this particular supercell is shown in Figure S1a (Supporting Information). The interlayer stacking of interest here is O3 type, which was shown previously to be exhibited by Nax[FeyTM1−y]O2 at high voltage (x < 0.4). Full relaxation of the lattice parameters gives an ordinary flat structure with all TM ions staying in the TMO2 planes (Figure a left) with the in‐plane lattice parameter a of 3.0 Å. However, when the a lattice parameter is fixed to, for example, 2.85 Å, which is very close to the experimental value of O3‐Nax[Mn0.25Fe0.25Co0.25Ni0.25]O2 at x < 0.4, O3‐Nax[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2 at x < 0.4 and our in situ XRD measured value of various O3 stacking Fe containing materials at high voltage (shown later), the structure is relaxed to an unusual phase with rippled TM layers (Figure a right). Note that fixing a lattice parameter at other smaller values also gives the rippling states. The examination of each TMO6 octahedron reveals that the FeO6 octahedrons show much stronger distortions than the MnO6 ones, as quantified by the distortion index (Figure b), which describes the degree of distortion of the TMO6 octahedrons and the TM\uf8ffO bond angle variance. The comparison in Figure b suggests that the rippling phenomenon is closely related to the higher structural flexibility and softening effect of the FeO6 octahedrons at high voltage. In comparison, without Fe the rippling of TMO2 layer (TM = Mn, Co, Ni and their mixtures) is never observed by fixing the lattice parameter at different values, suggesting the unique property of FeO6 octahedron in making the structural distortion and softening in response to the environmental perturbation.\nWe also calculated the structures with different Fe to TM (TM = Mn, Co, Ni) ratios of Fe0.25TM0.75, Fe1/3TM2/3, and Fe0.5TM0.5 with various TM orderings and interlayer distances, along with the pure Fe case (Figures S1–S5, Supporting Information). Due to the length scale of rippling, a high throughput DFT calculation of all TM orderings in such a large supercell is beyond the computational limit. We thus randomly generated several TM orderings at any given Fe composition for further DFT relaxations. In most cases they either show unstable flat structures, from which rippled structures are spontaneously obtained by relaxation as the case of Figure a, or show around 10 meV energy benefit per Fe ion in the rippled structures by manually distorting and DFT relaxing the metastable flat structures. This indicates the rippling phenomenon is not caused by any specific TM ordering, composition or interlayer distance but is rather general when Fe exists. The irrelevance of TM ordering is further supported by our neutron diffraction measurement to be discussed later. However, we note that in some occasional cases with low Fe composition of 0.25 or 1/3, the rippled structures cannot be formed, while all the structures with 50% Fe composition prefer the rippling phase, suggesting the importance of collective contribution from enough FeO6 to such preference. The hypothetical layered structure without the Na ions thus demonstrates the intrinsic rippling nature of the metal oxide layers mixed with Fe.\n\nSoftening and Distortion of FeO6 for Rippling Phase\nSince we have not put the Na ions to these TMO2 layers yet, all the TM ions are oxidized to 4+ valence state in our DFT simulation based on the magnetization on each TM ion. In our simulation the Fe4+ ions are Jahn‐Teller active due to the single occupancy of eg orbitals, while Mn4+, Co4+, Ni4+ ions are not. The existence of Jahn‐Teller active Fe4+O6 is supported by previous experimental conclusions from Mossbauer and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of O3‐NaxFeO2 at x < 0.5, O3‐Nax[Fe0.5Ni0.5]O2 at x < 0.4 and P2‐ Na2/3[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 at fully charged state, and also consistent with previous computational studies. However, it was also shown by experiment that for Nax(FeyNi1−y)O2 at high voltage (x < 0.4) a non‐negligible fraction of Fe3+ is not oxidized to Fe4+ as expected, showing a discrepancy to the simple ionic model of Fe3+/4+ redox. This leads to the discussion of other processes such as partially oxidized Fe due to oxygen redox and ligand to metal charge transfer, which softens the Fe\uf8ffO bonding. The rippling phase of interest here should be contributed by the collective effects of the softened Fe\uf8ffO bonding in general and the Jahn‐Teller distortion of oxidized Fe4+O6.\nThe importance of FeO6 distortion and softening is further supported by comparing the flat structure with the corresponding rippled one, where the distortions of FeO6 octahedrons are strongly enhanced with rippling (Figure S4e,f, Supporting Information). Note that several Van der Waals correction methods suggested for the calculation of Na deficit structures were also applied in all our calculations with qualitatively similar results (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Interestingly, we find that these FexTM1−xO2 structures can actually be DFT relaxed to all sorts of variants with different local bending geometries, as illustrated in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), with very small energy variance that is much smaller than the energy difference from the flat structure (Figure S5d, Supporting Information). Thus, the rippling phase can be considered as a type of glass phase with many local energy minima. Note again that although the computation of this ideal Na‐empty model requires external stress by fixing the lattice parameter, stressing non‐Fe containing TMO2 will not change the TM layers from flat to rippled.\n\nRippling Phase Coupled with Na Clusters\nIn the following calculation of the realistic case with Na ions, we will show that Fe containing rippling structure can be obtained through the special interaction with Na ions, where stress is not needed anymore in the simulation. Consider a realistic high‐voltage state for NaxTMO2, where Na ions are present in these rippled structures, our DFT result shows that they prefer to fit into the wider interlayer regions to further enforce the original rippling feature (Figure c left), rather than forming the homogeneous Na distribution that forces the relaxation into the flat TM layers (Figure c right). The total energy differences between such rippled and flat states are shown in Figure d for various Na1/9TMO2 layered structures with different Fe compositions. For all the Fe‐based compounds, our DFT simulation shows that the rippling phase is always energetically preferred, while for the non‐Fe cases of NaNiO2 and NaCoO2, there is no such energy preference. Since Na ions experience stronger Na+‐Na+ electrostatic repulsion in the TM rippling phase than the flat phase at a given Na composition due to smaller Na+‐Na+ distance, the rippling of the TM layers dominates the energy benefit. We also calculated five different TM orderings for Na1/9[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 case (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which all show at least around 10 meV energy benefit per Fe ion in the rippling phase. Note that different correction methods for Van der Waals interaction (D2, D3BJ, without correction) give very close energy benefit (Figure S6b, Supporting Information). Furthermore, different from the previous case with empty Na layer, here we performed full relaxation of lattice parameters for all structures with Na ions. The fact that they did not prefer the flat TM layers under zero external stress indicates that the rippled structure coupled with Na clustering is the global energy minimum above a certain Na composition, where the strain in the rippling phase will not be released due to this energy preference. On the other hand, when the Na layer is fully occupied, the flat structure is energetically preferred than the rippling one, suggesting that there is a rippling to flat phase transition with Na intercalation toward full sodiation. Determining such critical transition Na composition is beyond the computational limit, and we leave this question to be answered by our in situ XRD measurements.\n\nXRD and STEM Evidence of Rippling Phase\nThe above prediction from the DFT simulation is consistent with our experimental observations. First, Figure a shows the full‐width‐half‐maximum (FWHM) evolution of the (003) peak at different Na compositions obtained from our in situ XRD measurement of layered Na[Mn0.25Fe0.25Co0.25Ni0.25]O2 (MFCN). It clearly shows a reversible evolution of the XRD peaks between sharp and broad shapes during charge and discharge at high voltage, a region with low Na composition between 14% and 25%. Such reversible broadening was also seen in the Fe‐mixed ternary and binary systems (see Figures  and , and Figure S7 in the Supporting Information) and in previous experiments, but the underlying mechanism was not understood before. The angle‐dependence of the broadening (change of FWHM) of (003) and (006) peaks of these in situ XRD patterns fits well with the strain broadening model that is consistent with the strain in our rippling phase picture, while it significantly deviates away from the size broadening model (Figure b). This indicates that the broadening effect is not consistent with any model that relies on the domain separation at high voltage, such as many small domains with flat TM layers but different interlayer distances in a particle. Furthermore, the (011) peak, which corresponds to (hkl) planes almost parallel to c direction (Figure c), is much less broadened than (003) peak, consistent with the much smaller strain in the a and b directions inside TM planes than the interlayer strain in the rippling phase. Thus, the reversible broadening of XRD peaks observed by our in situ XRD is actually a strain broadening of Bragg peaks caused by the rippled TM layers at lower Na compositions, and the relief of such strain in the flat structure at higher Na compositions.\nThe rippling of the TM layers is directly visualized by STEM. Figure d shows the Cs‐corrected high‐angle annular dark‐field (HAADF)‐STEM image of pristine MFCN with flat TM layers (100% Na). Upon charging to 4.35 V (18% Na), the TM layers ripple on the spatial range around 10 sites (25–30 Å) (Figure e). The STEM image in a 15 nm × 15 nm range containing Figure e is shown in Figure S8a (Supporting Information) with the rippled TM layers in the entire image. Apart from this representative particle, we also observed similar rippling features in every particle we found that can be tilted to the b direction under both STEM and high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Figure S8, Supporting Information). After one cycle, STEM image of MFCN in Figure f shows the ordinary flat TM layers with full Na intercalation. The STEM analysis here supports our argument that the in situ XRD measured reversible transition between sharp and broad Bragg peaks corresponds to the transition between the flat, homogeneously spaced and the rippled, inhomogeneously spaced TM layers. The interlayer distance distribution of the STEM images in Figure d–f is analyzed in Figure , which agreed well with the calculated rippling structures.\n\nDecoupled Rippling Phase and Transition Metal Migration\nThe observed XRD broadening and TM layer rippling at high voltage match well with our model about FeO6 softening induced rippling phase as discussed in the DFT part earlier. Although computational evidence suggests that the Fe migration is more possible than other TM (Ni, Co, Mn) at high voltage in these O3 layered materials, our results show that Fe migration is not compatible with TM layer rippling, as TM migration to the Na layer actually tends to stabilize the flat layer instead of rippling it (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Also, note again that here the sharp‐broad‐sharp evolution of the (003) peaks of MFCN is totally reversible in one cycle of battery charge and discharge, i.e., the FWHM is the same before the charge and after the complete discharge. Thus, the mechanism of such broadening is intrinsically different from the irreversible broadening caused by stacking faults or TM migration, where the peaks cannot become sharp again in discharge once broadened in charge, as observed in NaCrO2, NaTiO2 and NaFeO2.\nIt is worth noting that reversible migration has been discussed in some P2 type NaTMO2 such as P2‐Nax[LiyNizMn1−y−z]O2 and P2‐Na2/3−z[Mn0.5Fe0.5]O2. However, in addition to the issue of flattening the TMO2 layer by Fe migration suggested by our DFT above, the incompatibility of such model with the rippling behavior in the O3‐NaTMO2 is also suggested by our in situ XRD and DFT analysis. The peak broadening in charge starts at high interlayer distance around 5.5 Å for MFCN, Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2 (discussed later), and other binary and ternary systems (Figure S7, Supporting Information), where the Fe migration barrier is as high as 0.89 eV at single Fe embed in other TM environment, 0.75 eV at 2Fe cluster and 0.58 eV at 3Fe cluster (rare case for less than 50% Fe composition), respectively (Figure S10, Supporting Information), based on our DFT simulation. Thus, with such high migration barriers the Fe migration events will not have enough probability at the interlayer distance of initial peak broadening during charge to cause such abrupt entry into the collective structural rippling, which suggests that the reversible migration model discussed in the P2 compounds may not be applied to the O3 case. However, TM migration may still exist in our systems, as will be discussed in the Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2 case at 4.5 V voltage cutoff.\n\nNeutron Diffraction Shows No Transition Metal Ordering\nAs already argued by our DFT simulations, the rippling phase observed in these Fe containing layered compounds is not a result of any specific TM ordering. This conclusion is further supported by our neutron diffraction measurements of Na[Mn1/4Fe1/4Co1/4Ni1/4]O2, Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2, and Na[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 at both room temperature and 5 K (Figure S11, Supporting Information), where neither additional Bragg diffraction peaks due to the distinct neutron diffraction cross sections between different TM ions, nor magnetic Bragg diffraction peaks down to 5K were observed, indicating no long range magnetic ordering. We also fit the broad peak in neutron diffraction of Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2 at low temperatures (Figure S11c, Supporting Information), which suggests no short range magnetic ordering beyond the first nearest neighbor. Furthermore, no short range magnetic ordering was observed in Na[Mn1/4Fe1/4Co1/4Ni1/4]O2 and Na[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 at all. The lack of long‐range magnetic ordering is consistent with the lack of TM ordering in the mixed transition metal systems. Combining computation with experiment, we conclude that unlike Li cathode materials where TM orderings often exist or materials consisting of 3d TM doped with heavy elements such as Bi, in these sodium cathode compounds containing just 3d TM, neither long range nor short range orderings between TM ions could be the reasons for the general rippling phenomenon in all the Fe containing layered compounds.\n\nReversible Asymmetric Structural Evolution at High Fe Composition\nSince our DFT calculations predict that the rippling effect strengthens with Fe composition, we further study more details of the rippling phase from a binary system of Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2 (FC), where a new macroscopic effect of hysteresis voltage loop perfectly reflects the underlying mechanism of asymmetric microstructure evolution related to the rippling phase at high Fe composition. Figure a shows the evolution of (003) peak FWHM from the in situ XRD measurement (Figure a) of FC for the first charge and discharge with 4.5 V cutoff (FC4.5). The evolution of peak broadening is highly asymmetric between charge and discharge for FC4.5, where the peaks upon discharge are much broader than charge (Figures a and a). Note that the peak broadening in the biphasic O3‐P3 region is a result of two overlapping diffraction peaks of O3 and P3 phase with slightly different diffraction angles. Figure b shows the corresponding charge‐discharge voltage profiles for FC4.5, where many characteristic shape features (plateaus, change of slope) in the first charge curve related to multiple phase transitions are much blurred in the first discharge and the following charge and discharge processes. This irreversibility of voltage profile between first and second charges indicates possible structural damages including TM migration, or electrolyte decomposition for FC cycled above 4.0 V.\nWhile the FWHM evolution of (003) peak is still asymmetric between charge and discharge for FC4.0 with 4.0 V cutoff (Figures c and b), the broadening in discharge is much less compared with FC4.5. Furthermore, different from FC4.5, we observed a novel reversible hysteresis voltage loop formed by charge discharge curves in FC4.0 (Figure d and Figure S12, Supporting Information). The shape features in the first charge voltage curve disappeared during the first discharge, similar to the case of FC4.5. However, differently, these features reappear during the second charge for FC4.0. Such reversible hysteresis between charge and discharge preserves to the 10th cycle (Figure S12, Supporting Information) and beyond, suggesting that when the cutoff voltage is lowered from 4.5 to 4.0 V, the irreversible structural damages at high voltage in FC4.5 is well controlled. Note that although the electrochemical profile was presented before for FC4.0, this hysteresis phenomena was never articulated, and the mechanism was not understood.\nUpon charging of FC, significant peak broadening happens below 40% Na composition or above 3.7 V, suggesting the entry into the rippling phase. In previous study of Na[Fe0.5Ni0.5]O2, Fe4+ was found in Na0.4(Fe0.5Ni0.5)O2 at 3.8 V. Here for FC, Fe4+ has to form below 50% Na composition, even if we assume all the Co3+ ions are oxidized first, corresponding well with the Na composition for XRD peak broadening. In comparison with MFCN (25% Fe), where XRD peaks broaden at 24% Na composition, we observed a direct correspondence between Fe composition and the starting Na composition of XRD broadening, i.e., x ≈ y, in Nax(FeyTM1−y)O2.\nIn contrast, Figure e shows FC cycled to 3.6 V (FC3.6), where the FWHM of (003) peak evolves symmetrically between charge and discharge without any additional broadening, suggesting no rippling phase below 3.6 V. This is consistent with the voltage profile (Figure e inset) that evolves symmetrically between charge and discharge for FC3.6. Thus, the hysteresis voltage loop of FC4.0 is a unique property closely related to the rippling phase, which evolves asymmetrically with hysteresis between charge and discharge within each cycle, while reversibly for charges or discharges between different cycles. Although previous work on Li ion battery layered structures discussed hysteresis due to TM ion migration, the corresponding electrochemical curve has a large shape difference in the first and second charge, indicating significant component of irreversible structural change, which is different from the phenomenon we discussed here.\nFurther detailed analysis of the in situ XRD curves (Figure ) clearly shows the asymmetric phase evolution. While there are clear O3‐P3‐O3 phase transitions in the charge process of FC4.0, the phase stays in O3 during discharge without other phase transitions. The entry of rippling phase is at 0.4 Na in charge (Figures c and b), which stays up to 0.6 Na in discharge, i.e., it takes an extra 0.2 Na intercalation to go back to the flat phase in discharge. Interestingly, the extra rippling O3 phase region in discharge corresponds exactly to the Na composition range of the entire P3 phase region in charge. Note that the P3 and high voltage O3 phase transition in charge takes place at 5.55 Å, while the measured interlayer distances are generally lower in discharge (<5.45 Å) once the rippling phase is entered in charge (Figure f). This suggests that the lower interlayer distance of the rippling phase can help the system bypass the P3 phase with higher interlayer distance, leading to different structural evolution pathways between charge and discharge. Note that for FC4.0 the peak position, FWHM and peak shape of (003) are the same for pristine state and after one cycle, indicating that the flat to rippling phase transition, although induces local strains, has no obvious influence on the structural stability. In addition, monoclinic distortion happens when Na composition is around 0.5 in charge, as marked by P'3 phase in Figures  and , which should be triggered by the Na0.5(Fe0.5Co0.5)O2 sodium stripe ordering reported previously. However, since this Na ordering is limited in a narrow Na composition range around 0.5 in charge, it cannot be the reason for the rippling phase happened below Na composition of 0.4 in charge.\n\nNa Diffusion in Rippling Phase, Percolation, and Hysteresis Voltage Loop\nFigure  provides an illustrative summary of the structural evolution of Fe‐containing Na ion batteries based on previous results, taking FC4.0 as an example. Figure a is the pristine O3 structure, with full Na and flat TM layer. Upon Na ion de‐intercalation by charging, Fe is oxidized and FeO6 is softened. After softened FeO6 octahedrons accumulate to a certain amount, the structure enters the rippling phase, corresponding to around 0.4 Na in the case of FC. It is known that diffusivity is proportional to the interlayer distance of the layered structure in O3 for both charge‐localized and de‐localized systems. Therefore, when charging beyond certain voltage (3.7 V in FC) and entering the rippling phase, Na ions in the region with larger local interlayer distance (black boxed regions in Figure b) is extracted first due to higher diffusivity, followed by the Na ions in other lower spacing regions (Figure c).\nHowever, at the beginning of discharge (Figure d), Na ions are first intercalated to the wider interlayer region (black boxed regions in Figure d) based on the same diffusivity argument, leading to the asymmetry between charge and discharge. The Na ions staying in the wider interlayer region tend to further expand the layer spacing less than the ones in the narrower region (Figure d), leading to the reduced average interlayer distance in discharge compared with charge (Figure d,e). As mentioned before, the structure goes back to flat again toward the end of discharge, when enough amount of Na ions are intercalated back to stiffen FeO6 at the reduced state (Figure f). The hysteresis evolution is hence reversible between cycles.\nIt is worth noting that in order for the asymmetric structure evolution to be prominent, the rippling phase has to be percolated. If we consider the Na sites with at least one Fe in the neighbor, the network formed by such Na sites is percolated with around 30% Fe composition according to our simulation (Figure ). Thus, in FC with 50% Fe almost all the Na sites are covered by Fe, giving continuous pathways of expanded regions for fast Na ion diffusion. This also explains that the asymmetric structure evolution is most prominent in the binary system with 50% Fe, while less obvious in ternary system with 33% Fe and not observed in the quaternary system with 25% Fe.\nThe extra Na ions needed to transform the structure back to flat phase, as discussed in FC4.0 case, is the counterpart of the coercive force in the ferromagnetic hysteresis loop. Note that this behavior is not limited to the FC system but is a general feature for O3‐type Fe containing compounds. The (003) peak broadening in charge are also found in Nax[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 (FM) at x < 0.2, Nax[Fe0.5Ni0.5]O2 (FN) at x < 0.26, Nax[Fe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3]O2 (FMN) at x < 0.26 and Nax[Fe1/3Co1/3Ni1/3]O2 (FCN) at x < 0.3, respectively, together with the asymmetric structural evolution in discharge, as shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). Also note that although the Na composition for P3 to high voltage O3 transition in FC (Figure b) and some other binary and ternary systems (FM, FN, FMN in Figure S7, Supporting Information) coincides with the Na composition for the flat to rippling phase transition in charge, this is not generally true. For example, in MFCN the two transition Na compositions for stacking and rippling are 0.34 Na and 0.24 Na, respectively, while for FCN they are 0.36 and 0.3, respectively. For MFCN16 and FCN, at high voltage the structure first transforms from P3 to O3 with sharp (003), then to the rippling O'3 phase with peak broadening. For FMN, FC, FM, and FN, the sharp O3 phase does not develop and O'3 rippling phase directly follows the P3 phase in charge.\nMoreover, since the transition between flat and rippling phase does not involve shear gliding and significant volume change as in the O–P phase transition, and the rippling phase naturally perturbs long range sodium ordering, good rate capability can be expected, as previously observed in FC, where the high rate up to 30 C was demonstrated specifically in discharge, while the charge was kept at 0.05 C. This battery test strategy can be explained well by the asymmetric rippling phase evolution, where the P3 phase was bypassed by the coercive rippling phase in discharge to avoid the O3‐P3‐O3 transition that is detrimental to the high rate. In addition, compared with, for example, NaCoO2, with a symmetric charge‐discharge evolution (see Figure S13, Supporting Information), FC4.0 with hysteresis voltage loop shows higher average discharge voltage (3.148 V) than NaCoO2 (2.936 V) and lower over potential, consistent with previous report. Our understanding here thus may lead to the new strategy to engineer the structural evolution with extended rippling phase region for improved battery performance.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The cathode film was made by mixing powder of active materials, Super P carbon black (Timcal), and dry PTFE (DuPont) with the weight ratio of 80:15:5. A Swagelok battery was assembled using glass fiber (Whatman GF/F) as a separator, Na metal (99.95% Sigma‐Aldrich) as an anode, and 1 m NaPF6 (98%, Sigma‐Aldrich) dissolved in EC:DEC (anhydrous, 1:1 volume ratio) as an electrolyte with the moisture level less than 3 ppm. The galvanostatic cycling was tested on Solartron 1470E. The cathode film loading density was around 2 mg cm−2.\nIn Situ XRD: The in situ lab XRD was taken on Bruker D8 X‐ray diffractometer equipped with a Mo source from a homemade in situ electrochemical cell with Be window. The in situ cell was charged galvanostatically at C/50 rate on Solartron 1470E with each XRD pattern scanned from 6.5° to 30.5° 2θ angle range (equivalent to 14.1°–69.7° on Cu source) for 1 h, corresponding to 2% Na composition resolution per pattern.\nSTEM: A Swagelok battery cell was dissembled after reaching designated potentials. Cathode films were sonicated in dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The DMC solutions were then dropped onto the TEM copper grids. The TEM sample was sealed in an airtight bottle before loading into the microscope column. All the sampling processes were done in Ar‐filled glove box. The HAADF‐STEM images were taken on the Hitachi HD 2700C at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV equipped with a probe aberration corrector and cold field‐emission gun at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The collection angle for HAADF‐STEM imaging was 64–341 mrad.\nNeutron Diffraction: Neutron diffraction measurements were performed on 5 g each of pristine Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2, Na[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2, and Na[Mn0.5Fe0.5Co0.5Ni0.5]O2 powder using the triple‐axis spectrometer BT‐7 at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. Measurements were taken in two‐axis mode with a fixed initial neutron energy of 14.7 meV (wavelength 2.359 Å), collimator configuration open‐80'‐sample‐80', and a radial‐position sensitive detector.\nDFT: All DFT calculations in this work were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package within the projector augmented‐wave approach using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof GGA functional and the GGA+U extension to it. The U values for Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni were 3.9, 4.0, 3.4, and 6.0 eV, respectively, in line with previous literature. Supercells with size 2 × 8 × 3 (4 × 1 × 1 Gamma centered k‐point) and 2 × 8 × 2 (4 × 1 × 2 k‐point) were used for calculating the rippling without Na and a 6 × 6 × 3 supercell (1 × 1 × 1 k‐point) for the rippling coupled to Na clusters. A 520 eV plane‐wave energy cutoff was used for all calculations. The Van der Waals interaction was treated by both the Grimme's DFT‐D2 method and cross‐checked with the DFT‐D3 method with Becke‐Johnson damping on top of GGA+U. In all the calculations concerning mixing of different TMs, the input files of atomic positions for DFT simulations were generated with random sampling of TM positions, while keeping the composition of each TM the same or as close as possible in each layer (see the Supporting Information for more detail).

The cathode film was made by mixing powder of active materials, Super P carbon black (Timcal), and dry PTFE (DuPont) with the weight ratio of 80:15:5. A Swagelok battery was assembled using glass fiber (Whatman GF/F) as a separator, Na metal (99.95% Sigma‐Aldrich) as an anode, and 1 m NaPF6 (98%, Sigma‐Aldrich) dissolved in EC:DEC (anhydrous, 1:1 volume ratio) as an electrolyte with the moisture level less than 3 ppm. The galvanostatic cycling was tested on Solartron 1470E. The cathode film loading density was around 2 mg cm−2.\nIn Situ XRD: The in situ lab XRD was taken on Bruker D8 X‐ray diffractometer equipped with a Mo source from a homemade in situ electrochemical cell with Be window. The in situ cell was charged galvanostatically at C/50 rate on Solartron 1470E with each XRD pattern scanned from 6.5° to 30.5° 2θ angle range (equivalent to 14.1°–69.7° on Cu source) for 1 h, corresponding to 2% Na composition resolution per pattern.\nSTEM: A Swagelok battery cell was dissembled after reaching designated potentials. Cathode films were sonicated in dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The DMC solutions were then dropped onto the TEM copper grids. The TEM sample was sealed in an airtight bottle before loading into the microscope column. All the sampling processes were done in Ar‐filled glove box. The HAADF‐STEM images were taken on the Hitachi HD 2700C at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV equipped with a probe aberration corrector and cold field‐emission gun at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The collection angle for HAADF‐STEM imaging was 64–341 mrad.\nNeutron Diffraction: Neutron diffraction measurements were performed on 5 g each of pristine Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2, Na[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2, and Na[Mn0.5Fe0.5Co0.5Ni0.5]O2 powder using the triple‐axis spectrometer BT‐7 at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. Measurements were taken in two‐axis mode with a fixed initial neutron energy of 14.7 meV (wavelength 2.359 Å), collimator configuration open‐80'‐sample‐80', and a radial‐position sensitive detector.\nDFT: All DFT calculations in this work were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package within the projector augmented‐wave approach using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof GGA functional and the GGA+U extension to it. The U values for Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni were 3.9, 4.0, 3.4, and 6.0 eV, respectively, in line with previous literature. Supercells with size 2 × 8 × 3 (4 × 1 × 1 Gamma centered k‐point) and 2 × 8 × 2 (4 × 1 × 2 k‐point) were used for calculating the rippling without Na and a 6 × 6 × 3 supercell (1 × 1 × 1 k‐point) for the rippling coupled to Na clusters. A 520 eV plane‐wave energy cutoff was used for all calculations. The Van der Waals interaction was treated by both the Grimme's DFT‐D2 method and cross‐checked with the DFT‐D3 method with Becke‐Johnson damping on top of GGA+U. In all the calculations concerning mixing of different TMs, the input files of atomic positions for DFT simulations were generated with random sampling of TM positions, while keeping the composition of each TM the same or as close as possible in each layer (see the Supporting Information for more detail).

The cathode film was made by mixing powder of active materials, Super P carbon black (Timcal), and dry PTFE (DuPont) with the weight ratio of 80:15:5. A Swagelok battery was assembled using glass fiber (Whatman GF/F) as a separator, Na metal (99.95% Sigma‐Aldrich) as an anode, and 1 m NaPF6 (98%, Sigma‐Aldrich) dissolved in EC:DEC (anhydrous, 1:1 volume ratio) as an electrolyte with the moisture level less than 3 ppm. The galvanostatic cycling was tested on Solartron 1470E. The cathode film loading density was around 2 mg cm−2.\nIn Situ XRD: The in situ lab XRD was taken on Bruker D8 X‐ray diffractometer equipped with a Mo source from a homemade in situ electrochemical cell with Be window. The in situ cell was charged galvanostatically at C/50 rate on Solartron 1470E with each XRD pattern scanned from 6.5° to 30.5° 2θ angle range (equivalent to 14.1°–69.7° on Cu source) for 1 h, corresponding to 2% Na composition resolution per pattern.\nSTEM: A Swagelok battery cell was dissembled after reaching designated potentials.

The cathode film was made by mixing powder of active materials, Super P carbon black (Timcal), and dry PTFE (DuPont) with the weight ratio of 80:15:5. A Swagelok battery was assembled using glass fiber (Whatman GF/F) as a separator, Na metal (99.95% Sigma‐Aldrich) as an anode, and 1 m NaPF6 (98%, Sigma‐Aldrich) dissolved in EC:DEC (anhydrous, 1:1 volume ratio) as an electrolyte with the moisture level less than 3 ppm. The galvanostatic cycling was tested on Solartron 1470E. The cathode film loading density was around 2 mg cm−2.\nIn Situ XRD: The in situ lab XRD was taken on Bruker D8 X‐ray diffractometer equipped with a Mo source from a homemade in situ electrochemical cell with Be window. The in situ cell was charged galvanostatically at C/50 rate on Solartron 1470E with each XRD pattern scanned from 6.5° to 30.5° 2θ angle range (equivalent to 14.1°–69.7° on Cu source) for 1 h, corresponding to 2% Na composition resolution per pattern.\nSTEM: A Swagelok battery cell was dissembled after reaching designated potentials. Cathode films were sonicated in dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The DMC solutions were then dropped onto the TEM copper grids. The TEM sample was sealed in an airtight bottle before loading into the microscope column. All the sampling processes were done in Ar‐filled glove box. The HAADF‐STEM images were taken on the Hitachi HD 2700C at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV equipped with a probe aberration corrector and cold field‐emission gun at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The collection angle for HAADF‐STEM imaging was 64–341 mrad.\nNeutron Diffraction: Neutron diffraction measurements were performed on 5 g each of pristine Na[Fe0.5Co0.5]O2, Na[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2, and Na[Mn0.5Fe0.5Co0.5Ni0.5]O2 powder using the triple‐axis spectrometer BT‐7 at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. Measurements were taken in two‐axis mode with a fixed initial neutron energy of 14.7 meV (wavelength 2.359 Å), collimator configuration open‐80'‐sample‐80', and a radial‐position sensitive detector.\nDFT: All DFT calculations in this work were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package within the projector augmented‐wave approach using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof GGA functional and the GGA+U extension to it. The U values for Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni were 3.9, 4.0, 3.4, and 6.0 eV, respectively, in line with previous literature. Supercells with size 2 × 8 × 3 (4 × 1 × 1 Gamma centered k‐point) and 2 × 8 × 2 (4 × 1 × 2 k‐point) were used for calculating the rippling without Na and a 6 × 6 × 3 supercell (1 × 1 × 1 k‐point) for the rippling coupled to Na clusters. A 520 eV plane‐wave energy cutoff was used for all calculations. The Van der Waals interaction was treated by both the Grimme's DFT‐D2 method and cross‐checked with the DFT‐D3 method with Becke‐Johnson damping on top of GGA+U. In all the calculations concerning mixing of different TMs, the input files of atomic positions for DFT simulations were generated with random sampling of TM positions, while keeping the composition of each TM the same or as close as possible in each layer (see the Supporting Information for more detail).

Especially for the rechargeable ion batteries, great success has been achieved during the last two decades. Since the 1990s, the lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) have been commercialized and dominated the market owing to their high safety, stability, and capability of storing and converting clean energy to provide a constant power supply. Due to limited lithium resources, however, it is desirable to find an alternative source for next generation EES devices. Recently, sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates because sodium‐containing compounds are highly abundant and have cheap raw materials (Figure a). Compared to the Li‐ion‐battery system, sodium possesses a larger ionic radius (1.02 Å for Na+ vs 0.76 Å for Li+) and a reduction potential about 300 mV higher than lithium. In lithium‐containing compounds, lithium can exist in octahedral or tetrahedral coordination. Sodium rarely has the tetrahedral coordination, but prefers octahedral and prismatic coordination. In general, these differences may cause a sluggish reaction mechanism and critical conditions for sodium‐ion diffusion, which means that some materials may not be suitable for SIBs. For example, graphite displays a very low capacity (lower than 35 mA h g−1) in SIBs. Thus, it is urgent to find good anode materials for SIBs in the near future.\nThe reaction mechanisms of anode materials for SIBs are similar to those for LIBs, which can always be classified into three categories: intercalation, conversion, and alloying (Figure b). The materials with intercalation reactions have obvious charge and discharge platforms and feature a relatively low theoretical capacity. Conversion reactions provide high theoretical capacity, always above 400 mA h g−1, due to multiple‐electron reactions during cycling. The conversion reaction suffers, however, from large volume changes and voltage polarization. Alloying type materials, such as red phosphorus, tin, and antimony, also have high theoretical capacity, and the reaction is also accompanied by large volume expansion. Typical anode materials include carbon materials, metal phosphides, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, sodium‐containing compounds, etc. In terms of the carbon materials, as mentioned above, graphite has a very low practical capacity in carbon‐ester electrolyte. Hard carbon could be a good choice because of the stable cycling performance. The synthesis of hard carbon needs high‐temperature treatment (above 1000 °C), however, and safety problems such as sodium dendrites may be caused by the low reaction voltage range (below 0.1 V). Graphene and porous carbon materials are also proved to be electrochemically active in SIBs, but the low Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle, undesirable side reactions derived from the large surface area, and the high cost means that they could not meet the requirements for practical use. Metal phosphides have recently received great attention because of their high theoretical capacity. Their synthesis methods, however, are limited because their raw material is dangerous red phosphorus. Metal oxides have been extensively investigated in LIBs, and excellent long‐term cycling performance can be achieved by carbon modification and suitable morphology design. On the contrary, FeO, CoO, and NiO show almost no electrochemical activity in SIBs.\nMetal sulfides/selenides (MXs) have been investigated as electrode materials for LIBs since the 1970s, such as titanium disulfide, which can achieve very high capacity and long cycling life according to laboratory tests. They are also very popular in SIBs because of their easily‐controlled morphology and high theoretical specific capacity, which makes them very competitive with other anode materials. Numerous excellent reviews focused on the general conversion reaction for SIBs have given a brief introduction to MXs. Here, recent progress on MXs for SIBs is systematically summarized. The synthesis methods, electrochemical performances, reaction mechanisms, and kinetics of both the layered and nonlayered MXs are introduced in detail. Their challenges, improvement strategies, and outlook are also discussed. In the future, more research needs to focus on the conversion reaction to bring conversion type materials to commercialization.\n\n\nTheories and Challenges for MXs\n\nTheories\nPlatform changes during cycling are very common in MXs, especially in the first two cycles. According to previous reports, some MXs cannot be reproduced after the initial discharge process. For example, 2H‐MoS2 was proved to be irreversible during cycling by in situ X‐ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. The charging product was 1T‐MoS2 in the case where no more than 1.5 Na+ was intercalated into the MoS2 in the initial sodiation process. When more than 1.5 Na+ was reacted with MoS2, Mo nanocrystallites and sodium sulfides were detected, and in the charging process, the MoS2 was never reproduced. Platform changes always have a bad influence on the cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency.\nAs sodium sulfides are considered to be the most common discharge products of the conversion reaction between metal sulfides and sodium, polysulfides should be a possible intermediate, which will react with carbon‐ester‐based electrolyte and dissolve into ether‐based or carbon‐ester‐based electrolyte, leading to severe capacity loss and safety issues.\nNanostructured materials have a large surface area and numerous active sites for sodium‐ion diffusion and storage, which guarantees fast reaction kinetics resulting in high capacity and good rate capability. The ionic diffusion coefficient (Dion), diffusion length (l), and diffusion time (τ) usually have the following relationship \nFor the same materials with same structural parameters, the Dion is always a constant. Thus τ is proportional to l2. Therefore nanosized structure can shorten the diffusion time of sodium ions and achieve high rate capability.\nAccording to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, some nanosized sodium metal sulfides feature metallic conductivity, which makes a capacitance contribution to the battery system. The charge and discharge processes include three kinds of capacity contribution: the faradaic contribution from the sodium intercalation process, the faradaic contribution from the charge transfer caused by incorporation of sodium ions in the material's surface, expressed as pseudocapacitance, and the non‐Faradaic contribution from double layer capacitance. From the cyclic voltammogram (CV) data, the measured current (i) at fixed voltage (U) and the scan rate (ν) can be related by Equation , where k1ν and k2ν1/2 represent the current contributions from surface capacitance and the redox reaction. By analyzing the CV data at different scan rates and neglecting the slight shifts for the specific voltages, the values of the parameters k1 and k2 can be calculated. Thus, pseudocapacitance during the charge and discharge processes is able to be quantified. When the size of active materials decreases to the nanosize, the pseudocapacitance can make a significant contribution to the charge and discharge processes, which indicates fast Na+ migration and good rate performance\n\nPlatform Changes\nPlatform changes during cycling are very common in MXs, especially in the first two cycles. According to previous reports, some MXs cannot be reproduced after the initial discharge process. For example, 2H‐MoS2 was proved to be irreversible during cycling by in situ X‐ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. The charging product was 1T‐MoS2 in the case where no more than 1.5 Na+ was intercalated into the MoS2 in the initial sodiation process. When more than 1.5 Na+ was reacted with MoS2, Mo nanocrystallites and sodium sulfides were detected, and in the charging process, the MoS2 was never reproduced. Platform changes always have a bad influence on the cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency.\n\nSodium Polysulfides\nAs sodium sulfides are considered to be the most common discharge products of the conversion reaction between metal sulfides and sodium, polysulfides should be a possible intermediate, which will react with carbon‐ester‐based electrolyte and dissolve into ether‐based or carbon‐ester‐based electrolyte, leading to severe capacity loss and safety issues.\n\nSodium Ion Diffusion\nNanostructured materials have a large surface area and numerous active sites for sodium‐ion diffusion and storage, which guarantees fast reaction kinetics resulting in high capacity and good rate capability. The ionic diffusion coefficient (Dion), diffusion length (l), and diffusion time (τ) usually have the following relationship \nFor the same materials with same structural parameters, the Dion is always a constant. Thus τ is proportional to l2. Therefore nanosized structure can shorten the diffusion time of sodium ions and achieve high rate capability.\n\nPseudocapacitance\nAccording to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, some nanosized sodium metal sulfides feature metallic conductivity, which makes a capacitance contribution to the battery system. The charge and discharge processes include three kinds of capacity contribution: the faradaic contribution from the sodium intercalation process, the faradaic contribution from the charge transfer caused by incorporation of sodium ions in the material's surface, expressed as pseudocapacitance, and the non‐Faradaic contribution from double layer capacitance.

By analyzing the CV data at different scan rates and neglecting the slight shifts for the specific voltages, the values of the parameters k1 and k2 can be calculated. Thus, pseudocapacitance during the charge and discharge processes is able to be quantified. When the size of active materials decreases to the nanosize, the pseudocapacitance can make a significant contribution to the charge and discharge processes, which indicates fast Na+ migration and good rate performance\n\nChallenges and Methods\nAlthough MXs have many advantages, there are still several problems. First, the final discharge products may have side reactions with the electrolyte. Second, large volume expansion is caused by the large amount of sodium participating in the electrochemical reaction. Third, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Fourth, the low conductivity and ion‐diffusion coefficient degrade the rate performance. The most common strategies to solve these problems are nanostructure design, carbon modification, electrolyte optimization, and voltage range selection. Recent progress has led to great improvements in MXs, and the synthesis methods and electrochemical performances have been summarized in Table .\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity. Some reports have applied a higher terminal voltage to avoid the conversion reaction and obtain long cycling performance. For example, bare MoS2 suffered a great capacity loss when cycled in the range of 0.1–3.0 V. It was different, however, when the terminal voltage was 0.4 V. By controlling the amount of sodium intercalated, stable capacity can last for hundreds of cycles with no obvious fading.\n\nStructure Design\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\n\nCarbon Modification\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\n\nElectrolyte Optimization\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\n\nCut‐Off Voltage\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity. Some reports have applied a higher terminal voltage to avoid the conversion reaction and obtain long cycling performance. For example, bare MoS2 suffered a great capacity loss when cycled in the range of 0.1–3.0 V. It was different, however, when the terminal voltage was 0.4 V. By controlling the amount of sodium intercalated, stable capacity can last for hundreds of cycles with no obvious fading.\n\n\nLayered MXs\n\nLayered MXs\nLayered MXs have recently attracted great attention because of their unique structure. Common layered MXs include MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, TiS2, VS2, and SnS2. Monolayer MXs have special physical properties such as good electrical conductivity (Figure a). Two types of S–M coordination exist. One is trigonal prismatic (H‐phase, Figure b), and the other is octahedral coordination (T‐phase, Figure c). For bulk MXs, the weak van der Waals forces between each set of X–M–X layers are easy to break down, and then the alkali ions can insert themselves into the interlayers. With continuous sodium intercalation, the conversion reaction takes place. Metal and sodium chalcogenides are finally found in the fully discharged state. For some materials, the sodium sulfide or sodium selenide and metal cannot be recovered to the original layered material, which means that the expanded‐layer structure would have a limited effect on the electrochemical performance during the following cycles.\n\nMolybdenum and Tungsten Dichalcogenides\nMolybdenum and tungsten dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo and W, X = S and Se), belong to the 2D transition‐metal dichalcogenide (TMD) group. The unique layered structure makes them suitable for wide applications as photocatalysts and solid lubricants, and in electrical‐energy‐storage devices.\nMoS2 is one of the most important members of the 2D TMDs group. The unique sandwiched S–Mo–S layers are connected by van der Waals forces with a typical layer distance of 0.62 nm. According to the different layer‐stacking sequences, MoS2 can be divided into the two‐layer‐stacked hexagonal polymorph 2H‐MoS2, the one‐layer‐stacked trigonal 1T‐MoS2, and the three‐layer‐stacked rhombohedral 3R‐MoS2, as shown in Figure a–c. In each layer, Mo and S exhibit trigonal prismatic (2H‐MoS2 and 3R‐MoS2) or octahedral coordination (1T‐MoS2). Among them, 2H‐MoS2 is a room‐temperature stable product obtained by general synthesis methods, such as solvothermal reaction, microwave assisted solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, CVD, and electrospinning. Wang et al. elucidated the mechanism by in situ XRD, ex situ XRD, and scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization of bulk MoS2 samples (Figure d–l). When sodium ions are intercalated into the interlayers, the van der Waals forces are broken, leading to phase and stacking sequence changes. The initial discharge mechanism of MoS2 in SIBs has been reported (Equations –). When the terminal discharge voltage was 0.2 V, no metal Mo nanoparticles and sodium sulfides were generated, and during the deintercalation process, a solid‐solution reaction took place. The final charge product was partially 1T‐MoS2, and no 2H‐MoS2 was found in the charging state. In this voltage range, the x value in the 1T‐NaxMoS2 should be less than 1.5. In terms of testing in 0.01–3.0 V, the platform at 0.06 V corresponded to the formation of metal Mo nanoparticles and sodium sulfide, and no MoS2 could be reversibly generated in the next charging process. The possible reason may be the same as that for LIBs. In the charging process, Mo nanoparticles will remain electrochemically inert, and the alkali sulfides will be oxidized to S. Thus, the reaction in the following cycles is similar to that in the lithium–sulfur batteries. According to the DFT calculations, the calculated formation energy (Ef) suggested that the 2H‐MoS2 was transformed to 1T‐MoS2 when the sodium concentration was greater than 0.39 per MoS2, which was very close to the x value obtained from experimental results. The Ef of NaxMoS2 was higher than −1.0 eV, but the Ef of the fully discharged state is significantly lower and had the value of −15.46 eV, which indicated that the Mo metal and sodium sulfide were very stable and not easy to reverse back to MoS2. Some reports, however, assigned the platform around 1.8 V to the oxidation reaction to reform the MoS2. Further investigations on the mechanism of the reaction are needed to provide more detailed and reasonable evidence \nMoS2 electrodes have a severe cycling problem and large voltage polarization, due to the irreversible reaction and the shuttle effects of polysulfides. Effective ways to solve these problems have been widely proposed. Nanostructure design can shorten the diffusion paths of sodium ions and provide the capability to accommodate large volume changes. Carbon analogues can help to confine the bad effects of volume changes, prevent the dissolution of active materials, and provide high electrical conductivity. Reports on 1D to 3D‐structured MoS2 composites are summarized in Figures –. Zhu et al. synthesized single‐layered MoS2 nanoplates embedded in carbon nanofibers by a facile electrospinning method and calcination (Figure a–e). The ultrasmall particle size ensured a short Na+‐ion diffusion time, and the carbon matrix provided high electrical conductivity. Thus, the composites showed a high discharge capacity of ≈400 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. Shi et al. synthesized 1D MoS2/C nanotubes through a solvothermal reaction (Figure f–i). The obtained material showed a capacity of 471 mA h g−1, and the capacity retention was about 100% after 200 cycles. In the meantime, the capacity could reach 187 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1. David et al. prepared a 2D MoS2 nanosheet/graphene paper through a liquid solution reaction, ultrasonic treatment, and subsequent calcination (Figure a). The improved electrochemical reaction is shown in Figure b. Re‐doped 3D fullerene‐like MoS2 was reported by Tenne and co‐workers (Figure c–e). The rate performance was optimized by Re‐doping, and a capacity of 74 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 with a terminal voltage at 0.7 V was obtained. Chen and co‐workers synthesized 3D MoS2/C microspheres by using a spray pyrolysis method, and the results showed an ultralong‐term cycling life with a capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 (Figure a–d). The successful design of MoS2 nanosheets homogeneously dispersed inside the carbon matrix provided great stability to the active materials. The microsphere structure could still be maintained after 100 cycles. Park et al. obtained hierarchical few‐layer MoS2 embedded in hierarchical porous carbon as a long‐cycle‐life electrode for SIBs. The cycling performance showed capacity retention of ≈70% after 300 cycles as shown in Figure e–g.\nThe performances were effectively enhanced through nanocrystallization and carbon modification, but the capacity retention still cannot be maintained above 90% after hundreds of cycles. Further investigations on the cut‐off voltage and electrolyte selection are responsible for the great progress on MoS2/Na batteries. According to the DFT calculations, the very stable discharging products of Mo and Na2S make the reaction hard to reverse. Therefore, it is possible to avoid the conversion by cutting off the terminal voltage. Moreover, modifying the MoS2 interlayers through synthetic procedures has been investigated, such as by introducing expanded layers and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or graphene intercalated layers. Li et al. obtained interlayer‐expanded MoS2/PEO nanocomposites. The synthesis method and accompanying transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image are shown in Figure a,b, respectively. After introducing two PEO layers into adjacent S–Mo–S layers, the optimized MoS2L/PEO nanocomposites showed a capacity of 225 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after the first 5 cycles of activation. Bang et al. prepared few‐layer MoS2 by liquid‐phase exfoliation. The results showed highly stable charge capacities of 164 and 161 mA h g−1 for the 1st and the 50th cycles at 20 mA g−1, respectively. Chen and co‐workers investigated the changes in the MoS2 layers when the batteries were cycled at 0.4–3.0 V with selected 1 m NaCF3SO3/diglyme electrolyte. Capacities of 200 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 175 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 were obtained in the first few cycles, as shown in Figure c, and then the capacities were slightly increased. After cycling for 300 cycles, the capacity was increased to 350 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, which was caused by the exfoliated layers. The fewer the number of layers in the MoS2 sheets, the greater the number of Na+ ions that they can take up. The ex situ TEM images from the 10th, 500th, and 1000th cycles confirmed that the MoS2 layers had gradually expanded and been exfoliated during cycling (Figure d–f). Meanwhile, the pseudocapacitance found in the battery system facilitated long‐term cycling performance and high rate capability.\nMoSe2 has a similar structure to MoS2. 2H‐MoSe2 is stable at room temperature and can be obtained through common synthesis methods such as solvothermal reaction, the reflux method, and spray pyrolysis. According to previous reports, the reaction mechanism has not been clearly determined. In the initial discharge process, some reports declared that two reduction peaks found at around 0.6 and 0.3 V corresponded to the sodium intercalation into the MoSe2 crystal structure and the conversion to Mo and sodium selenides, respectively. Other studies, however, found a much higher reduction peak above 1.3 V, which was assigned to the sodium intercalation reaction. In the oxidation process, a peak around 1.8 V was observed in most reports, but different theories have been proposed. One was that the peak corresponded to the formation of selenium. The other theory was that the peak reflected the formation of MoSe2. Some evidence such as ex situ XRD has been provided, but further investigations such as in situ XRD and TEM analysis are still needed. Due to the poor electrochemical performance of bare MoSe2, effective ways to modify bare MoSe2, such as carbon coating, porous structure design, and nanocrystallization, have been reported. Xie et al. synthesized MoSe2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites through a hydrothermal process. The MoSe2/rGO composites showed improved cycling performance. The capacities at the 10th and the 100th cycles were 462 and 456 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, respectively. Tang et al. used an oleic acid assisted reflux method to synthesize MoSe2/C composite. The amorphous carbon coating on the MoSe2 surface stabilized the structure. Thus, the composite showed a reversible capacity of 445 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 100 cycles. Ko et al. synthesized yolk–shell MoSe2 by using the selenization method to treat MoO3, as shown in Figure a,b. The charge and discharge curves indicated a phase change in the initial two cycles. The rate performance was also improved, and a capacity of 345 mA h g−1 was achieved at 1.5 A g−1 (Figure c).\nTungsten and molybdenum are both group 6 transition metals, and they share similar structures and properties. WS2 and WSe2 belong to the hexagonal phase. The mechanisms of WS2 and WSe2 include both the sodium‐ion‐intercalation process and the conversion reaction during the initial discharge process. Suffering from the common failings of MXs, the cycling performances of bare WS2 and WSe2 are not satisfactory. To improve the cycling performance, Su et al. prepared WS2/graphene composites, which showed a capacity of ≈600 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1. Chen and co‐workers prepared WS2 nanowires through a solvothermal reaction and subsequent calcination in Ar atmosphere. The obtained WS2 nanowires exhibited capacities of 550 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 236 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, respectively. Wang et al. prepared free‐standing WS2/carbon nanotube (CNT)‐rGO aerogel by applying an ice template method. The resultant product displayed a capacity of 311 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Choi et al. obtained WS2/3D‐graphene composites by using spray pyrolysis and a sulfuration process (Figure d). The void space of 3D‐graphene derived from the decomposition of polystyrene (PS) template was employed to accommodate the volume changes during cycling (Figure e). Thus, the WS2/3D‐graphene showed greatly improved stability compared to the sample without PS template, and the rate capability was enhanced by the 3D‐graphene conductive networks (Figure f). WSe2 was also synthesized through solid‐state reaction by using tungsten powder, selenium, and Super P carbon. The initial capacity was 300 mA h g−1, and then it dropped to 270 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle at 200 mA g−1.\n\nMoS2\nMoS2 is one of the most important members of the 2D TMDs group.

The initial capacity was 300 mA h g−1, and then it dropped to 270 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle at 200 mA g−1.\n\nSnS2 and SnS\nSnS2 and SnS have received tremendous attention due to their high theoretical capacities of 1022 mA h g−1 and 1136 mA h g−1, respectively. The mechanism of their reactions is summarized in Equations  and . After the conversion reaction in the discharge process, tin can alloy with sodium to form Na3.75Sn, which leads to an ultrahigh theoretical capacity. SnS2 has a CdI2‐type layered structure with an interlayer spacing of 0.59 nm. Normally, researchers prefer to pursue improved electrochemical properties by integrating SnS2 with graphene or other carbon materials. For example, Qu et al. prepared SnS2/rGO composite through a hydrothermal synthesis. The as‐prepared SnS2/rGO anode delivered a high specific capacity of 500 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1 A g−1, and good rate performance of 544 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1. The binder‐free SnS2/rGO nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth prepared by Xu et al. also exhibited good cycling performance. A capacity of 378 mA h g−1 was maintained at 1.2 A g−1 after 200 cycles. The discharge capacities at specific currents of 0.2, 1, 2, and 3 A g−1 were 633, 523, 458, and 348 mA h g−1, respectively \nSnS features a distorted NaCl‐type structure. Hexagonal‐SnS2 was transformed into orthorhombic‐SnS by Zhou et al. through an annealing step in an argon atmosphere. The authors concluded that the SnS experienced the structural transformation from orthorhombic‐SnS to cubic‐Sn to orthorhombic‐Na3.75Sn, while the SnS2 possessed the mechanism from hexagonal‐SnS2 to tetragonal‐Sn to orthorhombic‐Na3.75Sn during the cycling process. They also argued that the SnS phase was reproduced during desodiation, and less structural change provided good structural stability and excellent cycling stability for sodium‐ion storage in SnS. The SnS/graphene composite delivered a specific capacity of 492 and 308 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g−1 after 250 cycles, respectively. Carbon modification of SnS has also received great attention. SnS/C composite powders were prepared by Choi et al. through a spray pyrolysis method. The discharge capacity of the as‐prepared SnS/C composite was 433 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 500 mA g−1, and the capacity retention was 89% compared with the second cycle. Recently, graphene‐foam‐supported SnS nanoparticles were reported for SIBs. The three kinds of morphology shown in Figure a displayed great improvement in their cycling and rate performances (Figure b,c). Among them, the nanohoneycomb SnS exhibited high reversible capacities of ≈1100 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 and ≈420 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1, respectively. The excellent high‐capacity and high‐rate sodium‐ion storage performance was attributed to its maximized extrinsic pseudocapacitance contribution (Figure d).\n\nTiS2\nTiS2 has been widely investigated in relation to Li chemistry since the 1970s. Although it features good reversibility for lithium intercalation and deintercalation, TiS2 is not used in commercial applications due to the safety issues. Recently, some reports applied TiS2 as an electrode for SIBs with long‐term stability. The synthesized room temperature product TiS2 belongs to the Pm1 trigonal phase, and the common interlayer spacing is 0.57 nm. TiS2 exhibited an intercalation reaction when the terminal voltage was set to 1.0 V. According to the Na+ concentration in the NaxTiS2, several x ranges existed. When the x value was lower than 0.5, the interlayers gradually expanded as sodium intercalated into the TiS2 structure. The interlayer spacing, however, decreased as the x value was further increased. The reaction was reversible in the charging process, and TiS2 was finally formed. Liu et al. prepared TiS2 nanoplates by reflux reaction and calcination under Ar atmosphere. The obtained TiS2 nanoplates showed a capacity of 186 and 101 mA h g−1 at 24 and 2400 mA g−1, respectively. The long‐term cycling performance at 480 mA g−1 featured a capacity of about 175 mA h g−1 at the 2nd cycle and a capacity of about 140 mA h g−1 at the 300th cycle.\n\nVS2, VS4, and NbS2\nV and Nb are both group 5 transition metals, and their disulfide compounds, VS2 and NbS2, exhibit metallic conductivity, which is very important for achieving high rate capability. There are only a few reports, however, that focus on these materials. Mai and co‐workers obtained VS4/rGO composites. The results showed that the VS4 cannot be reproduced in the charge process, which resulted in bad cycling performance. Ou et al. prepared NbS2 nanosheets by a solid state sulfuration method and proved that the reaction mechanism was quite different from that of other TMDs. In the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V, no obvious conversion reaction was found according to the in situ XRD characterization, and the final product was NaxNbS2. The electrochemical tests showed a discharge capacity of ≈190 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and the capacity remained about 157 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.\n\n\nNonlayered MXs\n\nNonlayered MXs\nNon‐layered MXs (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sb, Bi and X = S, Se) are also very popular. Some of them can be obtained from natural minerals, such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, marcasite, and sphalerite. Thus, the advantages of low price and high theoretical capacity make them very competitive compared to other anode materials.\n\nIron‐Based MXs\nThe pyrite FeS2 is a natural mineral, which is widely used to obtain sulfuric acid. Its low price makes it very competitive as a commercial electrode material for battery devices. As early as the 1990s, Energizer Corporation first produced commercial primary FeS2/Li 18650‐type batteries. With the strong demand for rechargeable use, the cycling performance is one of the most important issues for FeS2 for use in SIBs. FeS2 features a cubic structure and belongs to the Pa space group, in which Fe occupies the (FeS6) octahedral sites and sulfur atoms exist as S22−. During the discharge process, S22− is first reduced to S2−, and then Fe2+ is transformed to Fe along with the generation of sodium sulfides. Although, there are different theories about the voltage platforms, which have been summarized in Table , the main difference is whether Na2S and Fe can be formed above 0.8 V or not. In the charge process, a new charge product, NaxFeS2, is generated instead of the original pyrite FeS2. The whole reaction provides a high theoretical specific capacity of 894 mA h g−1.\nKim et al. obtained 400 mesh FeS2 particles by ball milling and further sieving. The initial discharge capacity was 447 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. As expected, the bare FeS2 suffered a severe capacity loss, and only 70 mA h g−1 remained after 50 cycles. The bad cycling performance could also be caused by the side reactions of polysulfides. Thus, ether‐based electrolyte together with a cut‐off voltage to control the discharge products has been used for the FeS2/Na battery system, and a long‐cycle‐life FeS2/Na battery has been achieved. Chen and co‐workers prepared FeS2 microspheres through solvothermal reaction. 1 m NaCF3SO3/diglyme was selected as the optimized electrolyte, and a terminal voltage of 0.8 V (vs Na+/Na) was applied (Figure a). The optimized FeS2/Na batteries showed great stability at −50, 25, and 50 °C, and a typical capacity of 205 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 was achieved with no degradation after 20 000 cycles (Figure b,c). Even at an ultrahigh current density of 20 A g−1, the battery still had a stable capacity of 170 mA h g−1. Although controlling the terminal voltage to 0.8 V was responsible for the low discharge capacity, the discharge product NaxFeS2 led to better cycling performance, and made the battery a suitable candidate for commercialization. Meanwhile, both the intermediates and the discharge products were sodium iron sulfides, which were shown to be metallic‐type conductive by DFT calculations. By analyzing the CV data, pseudocapacitance was found to contribute a 46% fraction of the total charge transfer (Figure d). These two advantages guaranteed superior rate performance. Very recently, Zhang et al. synthesized Co‐doped FeS2 nanospheres, and by trying different Co ratios, the optimized Fe0.5Co0.5S2 was confirmed to be the best choice. After Co doping, the discharge capacity at 1 A g−1 was improved to 261 mA h g−1, which was achieved by applying the cut‐off discharge voltage at 0.8 V and 1 m NaCF3SO3/diglyme as electrolyte.\nIron disulfide as one of the most promising candidates for next‐generation rechargeable sodium batteries has several strong advantages. Although, FeS2 suffers from great capacity loss in the full charge/discharge voltage range, a reasonable electrolyte choice and cut‐off voltage can lead to excellent cycling and rate properties. Yu and co‐workers have published a sulfuration method to prepare FeS2/C composites as anode materials for LIBs. No such report focusing on the carbon modification of FeS2 for SIBs has been reported, however.\nCompared with FeS2, iron sulfide (FeS) features a lower theoretical capacity of 609 mA h g−1. FeS belongs to the hexagonal cell system with the space group P63/mmc. During the discharging process, FeS first turns into NaxFeS2 with Fe after sodiation (Equation ). Then, in the fully discharged state (about 0.1 V), iron and Na2S are found (Equation ). Some reports claimed that NaxFeS2 was the final charge product in the subsequent charging process, which indicated that the whole electrochemical reaction was not reversible. The x value was 0.23, and the valence of Fe in NaxFeS2 was (2 − x). Lee et al., however, reported that the FeS could be reproduced in the fully charged state\nFeS obtained through a mechanical alloying method was reported as anode material for SIBs by Kim et al. The initial discharge capacity was 610 mA h g−1, but it dropped quickly during the next 150 cycles, and only 195 mA h g−1 remained. The possible reason for the bad cycling performance is likely to be the large volume changes and the presence of sodium polysulfides. Later research focused on carbon modification to improve the electrochemical performance. Wu et al. used the solvothermal method and L‐proline as their carbon and nitrogen source to obtain N‐doped FeS/C microspheres (FeS/C\uf8ffN). Owing to the SEI film, FeS/C\uf8ffN displayed a very low Coulombic efficiency of about 52.6% and high irreversible capacity (706 mA h g−1) in the first cycle at 100 mA g−1. The capacity was 354.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 500 cycles. Lee et al. prepared FeS/rGO composites by using spray pyrolysis and a sulfuration treatment. After rGO modification, FeS achieved high rate capability of 340 mA h g−1 at 6 A g−1. Meanwhile, no obvious capacity fading was found in 50 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Wang et al. prepared yolk–shell FeS/carbon nanospheres by using a spatially confined sulfuration strategy, as shown in Figure a. The galvanostatic curves at 50 mA g−1 and the CV curves are also provided in Figure b,c. The CV profiles show great shifts in the oxidation and reduction peaks in the initial two cycles, which was caused by the irreversible electrochemical reactions. The discharge capacities were 621, 584, 537, 505, and 452 mA h g−1 at 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 5000 mA g−1, respectively (Figure d). The cycling stability test showed that the capacity retention after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1 was 67.6%. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM images collected after 50 cycles, the nanosphere structure was maintained. This was because the unique yolk–shell structure provided large enough room for the volume changes during cycling. Nevertheless, the conversion reaction pulverized the electrode materials, and the amorphous intermediates occupied the void space, which caused capacity fading during long‐term cycling. Yu and co‐workers also fabricated FeS/C on carbon cloth as a flexible electrode by hydrothermal reaction. Then, the thus‐obtained colloid product was bonded with carbon cloth and treated at 500 °C in Ar. The easily obtained flexible electrode displayed a discharge capacity of ≈500 mA h g−1 at the initial cycle and 430 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 91 mA g−1, and the discharge capacity was 280 mA h g−1 at the high current density of 4568 mA g−1.\nAbove all, the cycling performances were improved by using carbon modification. Due to the possible sodium polysulfides intermediates and the large volume changes, however, the electrode still, to some extent, suffered capacity loss. rGO displayed much more excellent cycling and rate performances because of the large specific surface area and the high electronic conductivity. The yolk–shell structure also confines the active material loss and accommodates the volume changes.\nIron diselenide is another compound among the iron‐based chalcogenides. The synthesis methods include solvothermal reaction or combinations of spray pyrolysis and sulfuration methods. FeSe2 features the orthorhombic Pnnm space group and a theoretical specific capacity of 500 mA h g−1. During the discharging process, FeSe2 is first reduced to NaxFeSe2, and then FeSe appears (Equations  and ). Finally, iron atoms and Na2Se are detected in the fully discharged state (Equation ). Then, in the charging process, quite differently from the iron sulfides, the reaction is reversible, and the final charge product is FeSe2\nFeSe2 was first reported by Zhang et al., which was synthesized using ammonium iron sulfate and selenium in a solvothermal reaction. The size of the pure FeSe2 microspheres was 2–5 µm, and they each were assembled from several nano‐octahedra (Figure a). Figure b displays galvanostatic curves of FeSe2/Na batteries with 1 m NaCF3SO3/diglyme as electrolyte. The changed voltage plateau indicates phase or morphology changes. The relatively high platform around 1.5 V provides the advantage of high safety for SIBs anodes, which is the same as for the widely reported Li4Ti5O12 in LIBs. Compared to the carbon–ester‐based electrolyte, ether‐based electrolyte delivered a stable capacity of 403 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, as shown in Figure c. The capacity retention was 89.0% after 2000 cycles. High rate capability derived from the pseudocapacitance led to a discharge capacity of 226 mA h g−1 at 25 A g−1. Other reports showed improved cycling performance by carbon modification. Park et al. synthesized an FeSe2/amorphous carbon composite by a spray‐drying and the selenization method. A stable discharge capacity of 383 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 was achieved, and there was 69% capacity loss after 150 cycles. Zhang et al. prepared FeSe2/rGO composites, and the discharge capacity was 408 mA h g−1 after cycling for 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 90% (compared with the capacity of the 2nd cycle).\nAlthough carbon modification can effectively improve cycling and rate performances in carbon–ester‐based electrolytes, it still cannot fulfill the demands for FeSe2 with long cycling life. Coated carbon or rGO may separate from the active materials after hundreds of cycles. Moreover, the sodium selenide may have side effects with and dissolve in the electrolyte, which is the most likely reason for the capacity fading.\n\nPyrite FeS2\nThe pyrite FeS2 is a natural mineral, which is widely used to obtain sulfuric acid.

The cycling performance showed a slightly increasing capacity from 280 to 310 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the first 20 cycles, and then the capacity at the 1000th cycle remained at 192 mA h g−1. Liu et al. prepared CoS2 in the form of hollow structures assembled from nano‐octahedra (H‐CoS2) by the solvothermal method. The stable capacity of 700 mA h g−1 was achieved at 1 A g−1 without obvious capacity fading after 100 cycles by applying 1.0 m NaCF3SO3 in diglyme as the electrolyte.\nCo3S4 possesses a theoretical capacity of 702 mA h g−1. Co3S4 nanosheet/graphene composites were reported by Du et al. The charge capacity was 423 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and the capacity of 329 mA h g−1 remained after 50 cycles, corresponding to capacity retention of ≈71%. The good rate property resulted from the highly conductive graphene sheets. Thus, at 10 A g−1, the charge capacity can reach 154 mA h g−1.\nCoS belongs to the hexagonal crystal system and has the space group P63/mmc. The theoretical specific capacity is 589 mA h g−1. A sandwich‐like CoS/rGO composite was first reported by Zhou et al. Compared to the rapid capacity loss of bare CoS from 602 to 68 mA h g−1 within 40 cycles, the CoS/rGO showed capacities of 567 mA h g−1 at the 1st cycle and 231 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle (with both materials tested under 0.1 A g−1).

The theoretical capacity of 544 mA h g−1 is less than that of CoS. As expected, the bare Co9S8 had bad cycling performance. Therefore, carbon coating has become the most efficient way to solve this problem. Ko et al. synthesized Co9S8 by the spray pyrolysis method.

The discharge capacities were 380 and 300 mA h g−1 for the 2nd and 50th cycles at 0.5 A g−1, corresponding to capacity retention of 77%.

The mechanism consists of multiple‐step reactions. In the first step, NaxNiS2 was generated. Then in the fully discharged state, Na2S and Ni were the final products. In the charging process, all the reactions were reversible. Wang et al. prepared NiS2/graphene nanosheets (NiS2/GNS). The capacity of NiS2/GNS was much higher and more stable than for the pristine NiS2. Nevertheless, according to the theoretical capacity of 873 mA h g−1, there is much room to improve the electrochemical performance of NiS2 because the only stable capacity of ≈400 mA h g−1 has been achieved.\nNi3S2 belongs to the rhombohedral crystal system. Owing to the low content of sulfur in the molecular formula, it possesses a low theoretical capacity of 446 mA h g−1. As for the synthesis methods, Ni3S2 grown in situ was made from polished nickel plate or nickel foam by treating it by the sulfuration method. rGO–Ni3S2 was synthesized through solvothermal reaction or spray drying together with a sulfuration process. In terms of the electrochemical reactions, it was shown in the discharging process that the Ni3S2 reacted with sodium ions to form Ni metal and Na2S, and then in the charging process, all the reactions were reversible. Bare Ni3S2 that was purchased from Aldrich Chem. Co. was used for SIBs by Ahn and co‐workers. The initial discharge capacity was 422 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and the capacity retention was 81% after 15 cycles. Further investigations on material optimization, such as by Fe doping and electrolyte selection, were reported by Ahn and co‐workers. Go et al. used a simple sulfuration treatment of nickel plate and obtained Ni3S2 petals. The stable discharge capacity was around 175 µA h cm−3 at 20 mA cm−2. Shang et al. used nickel foam and treated it by the hydrothermal method, but the as‐prepared materials still suffered from low capacity retention of less than 60% after 50 cycles. Song et al. also prepared nanostructured Ni3S2 on nickel foam, but the capacity slowly dropped after around the 60th cycle. Other reports were on rGO modification of Ni3S2 composites. The cycling stability and rate performances were improved. Park et al. synthesized Ni3S2 hollow nanospheres/rGO composites. The results showed a stable capacity of about 450 mA h g−1 for 150 cycles, and a high capacity of 377 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1.\nNiSe2 has a cubic structure with a theoretical capacity of 495 mA h g−1. The mechanism was found to be quite similar to that of FeSe2. In the discharge process, the three‐step mechanism included two intermediates: NaxNiSe2 and NiSe. The final products were Ni and Na2Se. In the charge process, NaxNiSe2 was first formed, and then the NiSe2 was reversibly reproduced in the charge state. Yan and co‐workers synthesized NiSe2 nanoplates for sodium storage. The cycling performance showed great stability at 1 A g−1 and a capacity of 311 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle.\n\nNiS2\nNiS2 is a cubic phase with space group Pa, the same as cubic FeS2. The mechanism consists of multiple‐step reactions. In the first step, NaxNiS2 was generated. Then in the fully discharged state, Na2S and Ni were the final products. In the charging process, all the reactions were reversible. Wang et al. prepared NiS2/graphene nanosheets (NiS2/GNS). The capacity of NiS2/GNS was much higher and more stable than for the pristine NiS2. Nevertheless, according to the theoretical capacity of 873 mA h g−1, there is much room to improve the electrochemical performance of NiS2 because the only stable capacity of ≈400 mA h g−1 has been achieved.\n\nNi3S2\nNi3S2 belongs to the rhombohedral crystal system.

The cycling performance showed great stability at 1 A g−1 and a capacity of 311 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle.\n\nSb2S3 and Bi2S3\nSb2S3 and Bi2S3 have high theoretical capacities because of their electroactive Sb and Bi, which makes them very promising as anode materials for SIBs (Equations  and ), although some reports express doubt on the existence of an alloy reaction between Bi and sodium. As for the electrochemical performances, due to the large volume changes, it is very hard to obtain good cycling performance. Bulk Sb2S3 had a very high irreversible capacity in the 1st cycle and bad cycling performance. The initial capacity was about 980 mA h g−1, and after 50 cycles only 200 mA h g−1 remained. In the case of the bare Bi2S3, although there was a very high initial discharge capacity of 1250 mA h g−1, the capacity dropped to only 100 mA h g−1 at the 7th cycle\nMethods such as carbon modification and nanocrystallization were used to obtain Sb2S3 with improved electrochemical performance. Yu et al. synthesized rGO‐supported Sb2S3 nanocrystallites, and the results showed a stable capacity of 670 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with high capacity retention of 95% after 50 cycles. Hou et al. prepared a rod‐like Sb2S3/C composite. The results showed superior cycling stability, and the electrode materials delivered a capacity of 699 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 95.7%. Zhao et al. produced amorphous Sb2S3 embedded in graphite composite. Even when subjected to the high current density of 10 A g−1, it could achieve a capacity of 661 mA h g\n\nSb2S3\nMethods such as carbon modification and nanocrystallization were used to obtain Sb2S3 with improved electrochemical performance.

First, the final discharge products may have side reactions with the electrolyte. Second, large volume expansion is caused by the large amount of sodium participating in the electrochemical reaction. Third, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Fourth, the low conductivity and ion‐diffusion coefficient degrade the rate performance. The most common strategies to solve these problems are nanostructure design, carbon modification, electrolyte optimization, and voltage range selection. Recent progress has led to great improvements in MXs, and the synthesis methods and electrochemical performances have been summarized in Table .\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity. Some reports have applied a higher terminal voltage to avoid the conversion reaction and obtain long cycling performance. For example, bare MoS2 suffered a great capacity loss when cycled in the range of 0.1–3.0 V. It was different, however, when the terminal voltage was 0.4 V. By controlling the amount of sodium intercalated, stable capacity can last for hundreds of cycles with no obvious fading.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, the final discharge products may have side reactions with the electrolyte. Second, large volume expansion is caused by the large amount of sodium participating in the electrochemical reaction. Third, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Fourth, the low conductivity and ion‐diffusion coefficient degrade the rate performance. The most common strategies to solve these problems are nanostructure design, carbon modification, electrolyte optimization, and voltage range selection. Recent progress has led to great improvements in MXs, and the synthesis methods and electrochemical performances have been summarized in Table .\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity. Some reports have applied a higher terminal voltage to avoid the conversion reaction and obtain long cycling performance. For example, bare MoS2 suffered a great capacity loss when cycled in the range of 0.1–3.0 V. It was different, however, when the terminal voltage was 0.4 V. By controlling the amount of sodium intercalated, stable capacity can last for hundreds of cycles with no obvious fading.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, the final discharge products may have side reactions with the electrolyte. Second, large volume expansion is caused by the large amount of sodium participating in the electrochemical reaction. Third, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Fourth, the low conductivity and ion‐diffusion coefficient degrade the rate performance. The most common strategies to solve these problems are nanostructure design, carbon modification, electrolyte optimization, and voltage range selection. Recent progress has led to great improvements in MXs, and the synthesis methods and electrochemical performances have been summarized in Table .\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity. Some reports have applied a higher terminal voltage to avoid the conversion reaction and obtain long cycling performance. For example, bare MoS2 suffered a great capacity loss when cycled in the range of 0.1–3.0 V. It was different, however, when the terminal voltage was 0.4 V.

First, the final discharge products may have side reactions with the electrolyte. Second, large volume expansion is caused by the large amount of sodium participating in the electrochemical reaction. Third, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Fourth, the low conductivity and ion‐diffusion coefficient degrade the rate performance. The most common strategies to solve these problems are nanostructure design, carbon modification, electrolyte optimization, and voltage range selection. Recent progress has led to great improvements in MXs, and the synthesis methods and electrochemical performances have been summarized in Table .\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity.

First, the final discharge products may have side reactions with the electrolyte. Second, large volume expansion is caused by the large amount of sodium participating in the electrochemical reaction. Third, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Fourth, the low conductivity and ion‐diffusion coefficient degrade the rate performance. The most common strategies to solve these problems are nanostructure design, carbon modification, electrolyte optimization, and voltage range selection. Recent progress has led to great improvements in MXs, and the synthesis methods and electrochemical performances have been summarized in Table .\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity. Some reports have applied a higher terminal voltage to avoid the conversion reaction and obtain long cycling performance. For example, bare MoS2 suffered a great capacity loss when cycled in the range of 0.1–3.0 V. It was different, however, when the terminal voltage was 0.4 V.

First, the final discharge products may have side reactions with the electrolyte. Second, large volume expansion is caused by the large amount of sodium participating in the electrochemical reaction. Third, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Fourth, the low conductivity and ion‐diffusion coefficient degrade the rate performance. The most common strategies to solve these problems are nanostructure design, carbon modification, electrolyte optimization, and voltage range selection. Recent progress has led to great improvements in MXs, and the synthesis methods and electrochemical performances have been summarized in Table .\nThe general synthesis methods to prepare MXs include solvothermal reaction, spray pyrolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning, exfoliation, sulfuration or selenization, reflux, ball milling, etc. Some materials need to be further treated by freeze‐drying or high‐temperature calcination. As for the morphology design, nanosized particles can effectively minimize the effects of volume expansion and also provide a short ion‐diffusion length. Yolk–shell‐structured and hollow‐structured materials have been widely investigated to improve their performance. Both of these structures introduce more contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, provide more active sites, so as to enhance the electrochemical performances of the target materials.\nCarbon materials are widely used as electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries because of their high electrical conductivity, high stability, and low cost. Introducing carbon analogs such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene into MXs materials can improve their electrical conductivity and stability to enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In general, organic materials can be coated onto the material surface and be carbonized through high‐temperature treatment in an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Some materials cannot be synthesized in this way, however, to obtain a carbon coating due to their inferior thermal stability. For example, FeS2 will convert into FeS and S at temperatures above 500 °C, and CuS will lose S to form Cu2S. Therefore reports are mainly focused on the sulfuration or selenization of metal oxides/carbon to obtain the MXs/C materials. Meanwhile, introducing porous structures or doping with nitrogen or phosphorus can further enhance the stability of active materials through alleviating large volume expansion and increasing the electrical conductivity.\nCommonly used electrolytes can be mainly classified into carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), etc., ether‐based electrolytes, including dimethyl ether, diglyme, tetraglyme, etc., ionic liquids, and solid‐state electrolytes. The carbon‐ester‐based electrolytes will react with polysulfides and have bad effects on the cycling performance and the solid‐state electrolytes feature very low ionic conductivity. Thus, ether‐based electrolytes have been widely investigated to help achieve long‐life battery performance.\nMost MXs possess multiple reaction mechanism during the first discharge process. In general, the intercalation reaction will be the first to occur. Then, the conversion reaction takes place, accompanied by large volume expansion and irreversible capacity. Some reports have applied a higher terminal voltage to avoid the conversion reaction and obtain long cycling performance. For example, bare MoS2 suffered a great capacity loss when cycled in the range of 0.1–3.0 V. It was different, however, when the terminal voltage was 0.4 V. By controlling the amount of sodium intercalated, stable capacity can last for hundreds of cycles with no obvious fading.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

They have similar working mechanism as lithium‐ion batteries but possess much lower cost due to cheaper sodium and aluminum current collectors. However, there are still some major barriers for their wide‐scale usage. One of them is the lack of suitable anode materials. Therefore, the search for a suitable anode for sodium‐ion batteries is an essential task toward practical usage of sodium‐ion batteries. Like the anodes for lithium‐ion batteries, there are several kinds of anodes for sodium‐ion batteries based on the insertion, alloying, or conversion mechanism. Among three kinds of anodes, the most widely applied ones are those based on the insertion mechanism. Basically, the “insertion” anodes involve a sodium‐ion storage mechanism that is a redox process taking place in the host material. From a crystallographic point of view, this process is a reversible electrochemical reaction, which involves the change in the oxidation state of transition metals and a topotactic reversible intercalation of sodium ions inside the crystal structure of the host without major structural changes. Except for the anodes based on the insertion mechanism, there are also anodes based on the alloying or conversion mechanism. The anodes based on the alloying mechanism are those that can electrochemically store sodium ions via alloying reaction (M + nNa+ + ne− = NanM). In this electrochemical reaction, sodium ions form alloys with anode materials. Contrasting to the insertion mechanism, the bonds between host atoms are broken. Therefore, the atomic framework of the host does not constrain the reaction, which grants the alloying anodes much higher specific capacity than that in the “insertion” anodes. As regards anodes based on the conversion mechanism, the conversion reaction is usually defined as the reaction of sodium and a binary transition metal compound, MaXb (M = transition metal, X = O, S, P,…), to yield M nanoparticles embedded in a matrix of NayX. This electrochemical reaction involves the full reduction of the transition metal to its metallic state, which assures high theoretical capacity. Like in the case of alloying reaction, the bonds between M and X are broken, which grants the “conversion anodes” high theoretical capacity. Since the crystal structure is destroyed and new compounds are formed during these electrochemical reactions, the high capacity anodes undergo severe volume expansion and the consequent capacity fading upon cycling. This is one of the key obstacles toward practical applications of these high capacity anodes.\nHollow structured materials, with the functional thin shells and the inner voids, offer the advantages of a large surface‐to‐volume ratio, short diffusion length, large contact area, etc. Resulting from numerous benefits, they have been widely employed in several fields, for example, electrocatalysts, supercapacitors, and lithium‐ion batteries. Instead of modifying nanostructure of anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries, the employment of hollow structured materials resulted in a significant enhancement of the rate performance, durability, and specific capacity. While the rational design of hollow structured anodes for sodium‐ion batteries is similar to that of hollow structured anodes for lithium‐ion batteries, the requirements referring to the properties of materials are different due to the differences in sodium and lithium‐ion batteries. First, because the expansion and strain of anodes in sodium‐ion batteries during charging/discharging processes are more significant than those in the anodes used in lithium‐ion batteries, the sodium anodes are easier to peel off. Therefore, in the rational design of hollow structured anodes for sodium‐ion batteries, apart from the simple hollow structure, there is a need to design an extra space to accommodate a larger volume expansion. Additionally, due to the larger ion radius of sodium, the reaction kinetics is more sluggish during the charging/discharging processes than that in the case of lithium‐ion batteries. Hence, in addition to the simple hollow structured anode to reduce the diffusion length at the interface between electrode material and electrolyte, the building block should be specially designed to accelerate the ion diffusion in the hollow structure to further enhance the sodium kinetics. The most importantly, due to the lower voltage of sodium cathodes than those of lithium cathodes, the energy density of sodium‐ion batteries is lower than that of lithium‐ion batteries. Another concern is the low volumetric density of hollow structured electrode materials. Therefore, because of the low energy density of sodium‐ion batteries and the low volumetric density of hollow structured electrode materials, the energy density of anodes in sodium‐ion batteries is one of the major concerns toward application of these batteries. To sum up, although the design of hollow structured anodes for sodium‐ion batteries should be similar to that in the case of lithium‐ion batteries, the different features of these batteries require the use of proper anode materials.\nThere are several reports on the use of hollow structured anodes in sodium‐ion batteries but a critical appraisal of this important area of research is not available yet. Here, we summarize recent advances in the development of hollow structured anodes for sodium‐ion batteries. First, we present the progress in the application of simple hollow structured anodes in sodium‐ion batteries. After that, the fabrication and application of different complex hollow structured anodes for sodium‐ion batteries are discussed. Finally, a brief outlook of the future trends in this area is presented.\n\n\nSimple Hollow Structures\nIn this section, we summarize the application of simple hollow structured anodes in sodium‐ion batteries. These structures are defined as follows: (i) the hollow structure is without any confinement, (ii) the building blocks are simple nanoparticles without further tailoring, and (iii) the hollow structure consists of single shell. Among all kinds of “insertion” anodes, the carbon‐based anodes are the most widely used. For instance, Tang et al. developed simple carbon hollow spheres by hydrothermal carbonization of the mixture of poly(styrene) latex and d‐glucose. As compared to the solid carbon spheres, the hollow carbon spheres as shown in Figure A,B exhibited higher reversible capacities under both low and high current densities. Under the current density of 1 A g−1, the hollow carbon spheres exhibited a reversible capacity of over 100 mA h g−1 while the solid ones delivered a reversible capacity of about 50 mA h g−1 (Figure C). This result demonstrates that the hollow structure has favorable transport properties, which assure a superior electrochemical performance.\nIn addition to hollow spheres, hollow nanotubes, 1D hollow structures, are also attractive for sodium‐ion batteries because of the structural stability and good conducting connectivity. Liu et al. used the in situ transmission electron microscopy to investigate the behavior of hollow carbon nanofibers (CNF) for sodium‐ion batteries. This study suggested that there is a strain caused by volume change during sodiation process, which can be partially alleviated by the hollow structure. Except for hollow carbon tubes, there are also other reports on sodium titanate hollow tubes, another “insertion” anode. Thanks to the good connectivity of tubes and different modifications as shown in the scanning and transmission electron microscope (SEM and TEM) images, a capacity retention of over 90% after 10 000 cycles was achieved, demonstrating their excellent stability (Figure D–F). As compared to the hollow spheres, thanks to the prolonged length and the consequently high length‐to‐diameter ratio, the 1D hollow structured anodes, for example, nanotubes, possess extra advantages of good conducting connectivity and better structural stability. Therefore, the nanotubes normally exhibit better cycling performance than hollow spheres.\nThere are also several reports on 3D hollow structures. Zhao et al. prepared the 3D macroporous MXene films with different compositions. The as‐prepared samples exhibited a reversible capacity of 250 mA h g−1 at 2.5 C after 1000 cycles, which was significantly better than the reversible capacity obtained on multilayer MXenes and MXene/CNT hybrid open structure (Figure G–I). This work demonstrates that the proper architecture is crucial for achieving great electrochemical performance. As compared to 0D and 1D hollow structures, the 3D architecture provides higher electrolyte/electrode contact area, which is beneficial for the transportation of sodium ions, and consequently, assures a superior rate performance.\nNumerous studies showed that the hollow structure of anodes is crucial for good electrochemical performance because of several reasons: (i) large amount of electrochemical active sites due to the large surface‐to‐volume ratio; (ii) large contact area between electrode and electrolyte; (iii) short ion diffusion path because of thin shell and inner void. The above‐mentioned reasons grant the hollow structured anodes in sodium‐ion batteries the performance better than that in the solid structured analogs.\n\n\nComplex Hollow Structures\nAlthough simple hollow structures possess many advantages, it is worth to mention that most of the reports on simple hollow structured anodes with good performance are not based on the alloying or conversion mechanism. On the other hand, several simple hollow structured “alloying and conversion” anodes have been reported.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

As shown in Figure\xa0, all the reflections can be indexed based on h‐FeSe with the refined lattice parameters of a = b = 3.6183 Å and c\xa0= 5.8938 Å, consistent with the previous reported values.[] In contrast, as displayed in Figure\xa0, the reflections of t‐FeSe are indexed based on two different phases of FeSe: the main phase belongs to tetragonal symmetry with a space group of p4/nmm, while, the minor one corresponds to hexagonal structure with a space group of P63/mmc. Rietveld refinement suggests a molar ratio of 71:29 for t‐FeSe:h‐FeSe. It has been demonstrated that t‐FeSe exists on the Fe‐rich side, while h‐FeSe phases exists on the Se‐rich side according to the phase diagram of Fe‐Se system.[] When the annealing temperature is increased above the sublimation temperature of Se (685\xa0°C), the poor Se environment benefit to the formation of tetragonal phase. However, it is really hard to achieve a uniform environment during solid phase reaction, so minor phase of h‐FeSe is accompanied. The high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Figure , Supporting Information) also reveal a mixed phase formation that the interplanar spacing of 0.55\xa0nm corresponds to (001) plane of tetragonal phase, while, 0.31\xa0nm belongs to (100) plane of hexagonal phase. Moreover, the resistivity of h‐ and t‐phases were measured via a four‐point probe method. As displayed in Figure\xa0, h‐FeSe shows a semiconducting behavior, in sharp contrast to the metallic conductivity of t‐FeSe (Figure\xa0) whose resistivity decreases as the temperature lowers, despite the mixed phase characteristic. In particular, the room‐temperature electronic conductivity of t‐FeSe is achieved as 1003 S cm–1, more than 13 times higher than that of h‐FeSe (73 S cm–1). Noted that the electronic conductivity of t‐FeSe is also very competitive as compared with various carbonaceous materials (10–1000 S cm–1),[] seeing a strong possibility to construct a working electrode without Super P additive. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure\xa0,)\xa0shows that both h‐ and t‐FeSe crystallize into microsized particles. Energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy mapping (Figure , Supporting Information) indicates a homogeneous distribution of Fe and Se in the as‐prepared t‐phase FeSe.\n\nSodium Storage Property of t‐FeSe\nThe sodium storage property of t‐FeSe was first evaluated by assembling a coin‐type cell with normal mass ratio of active materials, Super P and binder as 7:2:1. The h‐phase electrode was prepared in the same way for comparison. To understand the redox behavior during Na+ insertion and extraction, cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles were recorded at a scan rate of 0.1\xa0mV s–1 between 3.0 and 0.3\xa0V (vs Na+/Na). As displayed in Figure , three intense peaks appear in the first cathodic scan. The ones at 1.3 and 0.7\xa0V correspond to the formation of intermediate phase of NayFe2Se2 and further conversion reaction into Fe particles and Na2Se, respectively. Detailed phase evolution will be discussed in the subsequent in situ XRD discussion. The one at 1.1\xa0V, which appears in the first cycle and vanishes in the subsequent cycles, can be attributed to the conversion reaction of impurity h‐FeSe (Figure , Supporting Information). In the anodic scan, t‐FeSe shows one distinct broad peak at 1.5\xa0V due to the reverse process from Fe and Na2Se into t‐FeSe. Additionally, there are several weak humps in the CV profiles, like 2.0\xa0V in the anodic and 1.6\xa0V in the cathodic scan, which can be attributed to the side redox reaction of Super P (Figure , Supporting Information). After the initial cycle, h‐FeSe shows the same two cathodic peaks as t‐phase (Figure , Supporting Information), indicative of a phase transition from h‐ to t‐phase. And all the CV curves are superposed on each other, indicative of an excellent electrochemical reversibility. Furthermore, t‐FeSe anode delivers an initial discharge and charge capacities of 449 and 407\xa0mAh g–1, respectively, with initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 91%, as shown in Figure\xa0. After 50 cycles, the electrode can still deliver a high capacity of 377\xa0mAh g–1 with a high capacity retention of 93% (Figure\xa0). Interestingly to note that there is no big difference between the cycle performance for t‐ and h‐phase FeSe in the normal electrode configuration (Figure , Supporting Information). The reason lies in the positive effect of introduced conducting additive (Super P in our case) that facilitates fast electron transfer for the semiconducting h‐FeSe.\nTo emphasize the efficiency of high electronic conductivity of t‐FeSe, the conductive additive is removed from the electrode complex and a CA‐free electrode is assembled for SIBs application. As shown in Figure\xa0, there is nearly no difference in the resistance at the OCV states for t‐FeSe before (Rct\xa0= 11.7\xa0± 0.9 Ω) and after taking CA out (Rct\xa0= 11.8\xa0± 0.8 Ω) owing to its inherent high conductivity. In sharp contrast, the CA‐free h‐FeSe electrode delivers much larger resistance than the CA‐contained electrode because of its semiconducting behavior (Figure , Supporting Information). As compared in Figure\xa0, the CA‐free t‐FeSe electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 400\xa0mAh g–1 with a capacity retention of 99% over 30 cycles, in sharp contrast to the extremely low capacity of the h‐phase. Even if the CA is moved out, the inherent high electronic conductivity of the t‐phase guarantees high utilization of the active materials, yet the h‐phase does not. Note that the experimental capacity is a little higher than the theoretical expected one (397\xa0mAh g–1). This phenomenon could be attributed to the interface storage since the conversion‐[] or alloying‐type[] anode materials would decompose into nanoparticles with large specific area when being discharged to the low working potential. A recent study also suggested that the electrochemically reduced Fe nanoparticles could contribute to the spin‐polarized capacitance owing to the accumulation of spin‐polarized charges at the interface.[] In addition, the advance of metallic t‐FeSe electrode is presented in the comparison of discharge capacities at various rates, as shown in Figure\xa0. At a high current rate of 12.5 C, t‐FeSe electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 284\xa0mAh g–1, which recovers to 374\xa0mAh g–1 when the current rate turns back to 0.5 C, while, CA‐free h‐FeSe electrode can hardly deliver any capacity at 1.25 C‐rate due to the sluggish kinetic properties. Thus, h‐FeSe plays a negligible role in the electrochemical performance of the mixed t‐FeSe phases since the inherent semiconducting electronic conductivity of the h‐phase induces sluggish kinetic properties.\nIn addition, the electrochemical properties of CA‐free t‐FeSe with different electrode components (active material:CA:binder = 7:2:1, 8:1:1, 9:0:1 and 29:0:1) were measured. The detailed calculation method for the volumetric capacity is given in the Experimental Section and Figure  (Supporting Information). As shown in Figure , four electrodes exhibit similar profiles, indicative of the similar Na+ storage processes, yet slight distinction in voltage polarization. While the volumetric capacity reveals a significant difference in response to the conducting additive content. As shown in Figure\xa0, 9:0:1 electrode delivers volumetric capacity of 825\xa0mAh cm–3, higher than the 8:1:1 (639\xa0mAh cm–3) and 7:2:1 (408\xa0mAh cm–3) samples. On account of the high density of FeSe, we further reduce the content of electrochemical inactive binder to achieve a high utilization of active material. Surprisingly, the highest volumetric capacity of 1011\xa0mAh cm–3 is delivered in the 29:0:1 sample, which is one of the highest values among the transition metal sulfides or selenides (Figure\xa0). Besides, the ICE of 29:0:1 sample is achieved as 96%, the highest value in the state‐of‐the‐art metal sulfides or selenides, as compared in Table  (Supporting Information). This enhancement in the volumetric capacity and ICE is closely related to the proposed strategy of removing the puffy Super P from the electrode complex, which not only contributes to the increase of density of the electrode but also suppresses the side reactions between the electrolyte and electrode, since Super P has larger specific areas (65.5593 m2 g−1, detailed nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown in Figure , Supporting Information) than t‐FeSe (14.0772 m2 g−1). Furthermore, decreasing the binder content to 3% could help to increase the electrochemical reversibility and ICE, since the binders are known as insulating and electrochemically inactive.[] The superiority in the CA‐free t‐FeSe electrode is also demonstrated in the high‐rate capability tests, as depicted in Figure\xa0. Though all four electrodes demonstrate strong tolerance to the applied current densities, the CA‐free t‐FeSe electrode delivers the highest reversible capacities owing to the high utilization of the active materials. In comparison with the reported volumetric capacities in the up‐to‐date SIBs anodes (Figure\xa0), the CA‐free t‐FeSe electrode is also very competitive, especially under higher current density.\nWhat is more, in circumstances of commercial application, such as electric vehicles and 3 C products, the strong ability of fast charging and slow discharging is highly desirable.[] As for the half‐cell setup, whether the anode could afford fast discharge and slow charge scanning is especially essential since the charging processes of full cell corresponds to the inserted process of ions into the anode side. Thus, the CA‐free t‐FeSe electrode was further evaluated in a fast‐discharge–slow‐charge (FDSC) mode, under which various current rates are applied in discharge process, while recharged at 0.5 C rate. As demonstrated in Figure\xa0,, the electrode delivers a reversible volumetric capacity of 803\xa0mAh cm–3 at 5 C discharge rate (corresponding to 9\xa0min). When being recharged at 0.5 C rate, all of the inserted sodium ions can be released. After cycled at FDSC mode for 100 cycles, the electrode exhibits decent cycling capability with almost no capacity decay. Moreover, the CA‐free electrode demonstrated outstanding long‐term cycle stability with a capacity retention of 94% and 92% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C and 2.5 C, respectively, as displayed in Figure\xa0, which is attributable to the selected ether electrolyte in favor of cycling stability even for the micro‐sized material.[] Besides, the higher cutting off voltage of 0.3\xa0V could benefit to suppress the over‐reaction of conversion‐type materials with long‐lived cycle life.[] In addition, impressively to note that the proposed CA‐free electrode raised the active material utilization from 70% (CA‐contained) to 96.7% without sacrificing the durability and rate capability. As compared in Table  (Supporting Information), the material utilization in our electrode configuration outperforms most of the reported anode materials or commercial LIBs level (92%–96% depending on various electrode materials), further demonstrating the superiority of our proposed design strategy.\n\nSodium Storage Process\nThe phase evolution of t‐FeSe was then investigated via in situ XRD. Figure  displays the contour map of t‐FeSe on a live SIB cell for the initial two cycles. At the OCV state, all the reflections belong to t‐FeSe phase, except the ones from Be window and h‐FeSe (at 32.3°). As the initial discharge to 1.36\xa0V, there is no obvious peak change, indicative of Na+ insertion process into t‐FeSe with the potential product of NaxFeSe. Subsequently, the reflections of the t‐phase fade away rapidly; in the meanwhile, a series of new ones at 24.3°, 30.5°, and 36.2° emerge along with the flat voltage plateau at 1.35\xa0V in the GCD profile, characteristics of a two‐phase transition. After careful indexing, these new reflections can be attributed to ThCr2Si2‐structured NayFe2Se2 with space group of I4/mmm.[] Also, the reflection of h‐FeSe at 32.3° disappears completely upon Na+ insertion, consistent with the small plateau at 1.14\xa0V. Further Na+ insertion induces the flat voltage plateau at 0.75\xa0V, where NayFe2Se2 decomposes and converts to Na2Se and Fe, as evidenced by the vanish of these reflections and the simultaneous appearance of broad diffraction peaks at 22.5° (Na2Se), 37.6° (Na2Se), and 44.6° (Fe). During the charging process, the reflections of Na2Se and Fe gradually disappear and fully convert into t‐FeSe, which means the Na+ ions stored by discharging process could be fully released to the external and achieve high Coulombic efficiency in the cycle and response for the excellent cycle performance. Upon the charging process, no intermediate phase formation could be detected, this behavior is consistent with the long voltage plateaus in GCD curve and one peak in the anodic scanning of CV profile. Note that the hexagonal phase cannot be re‐formed after Na+ extraction, which is consistent with the previously reported result,[] and also verified by the ex situ XRD (Figure , Supporting Information). The irreversible phase transformation can be attributed to the higher formation energy of h‐FeSe (−0.08\xa0eV) than that of the tetragonal phase (−0.275\xa0eV).[] In the second cycle, t‐FeSe exhibits the same phase transition as the initial one, suggestive a high reversibility upon sodium insertion and extraction. The redox reactions of t‐FeSe can be summarized below:\nDischarge process:1FeSe+xNa++xe−→NaxFeSe22NaxFeSe+(y−2x)Na++y−2xe−→NayFe2Se23NayFe2Se2+(4−y)Na++4−ye−→2Fe+2Na2Se4Total:FeSe+2Na++2e−→Fe+Na2Se\nCharge process:5Fe+Na2Se→FeSe+2Na++2e−\n\nDesign Methodology Used in Li‐Ion Batteries\nThanks to the encouraging effect of t‐FeSe for the enhanced volumetric capacity, we branch out the design methodology to LIBs using the CA‐free t‐FeSe electrode as the cathode for high volumetric energy and power densities. As shown in Figure , the GCD profiles of CA‐free t‐FeSe electrode in the Li battery were recorded at 0.5 C rate in the potential range of 1.0–2.8\xa0V versus Li+/Li. After the initial conditioning cycle, the discharge plateau increased from 1.37 to 1.53\xa0V, leading to a decreased overpotential from 0.44 to 0.35\xa0V, indicative of an enhanced reaction kinetics. The enhanced kinetics is also verified via the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Nyquist plots (Figure\xa0) suggests that the cell after the initial cycle demonstrates low charge transfer resistance of 5.1 ± 0.3 Ω, in sharp contrast to the OCV state (59 ± 3.1 Ω) as listed in Table  (Supporting Information). Furthermore, the redox peaks in the incremental charge (dQ) versus potential curves (Figure\xa0) identify the conversion reaction between FeSe and Li2Se with Fe nanoparticles, which will be further discussed later. As exhibited in Figure\xa0, the proposed system delivers a high volumetric capacity of 1010\xa0mAh cm–3 in the initial cycle, corresponding to a high volumetric energy density of 1373\xa0Wh L–1 (calculated based on the whole cathode electrode). The t‐FeSe cathode shows slight capacity decay in the first 15 cycles and then stabilizes at 758\xa0mAh cm–3 for the subsequent cycles with no obvious capacity decay. As illustrated in Figure\xa0, a high volumetric capacity of 618\xa0mAh cm–3 can be delivered at a high current rate of 5 C, corresponding to the volumetric power density of 7200 W L–1. As compared in Figure\xa0 (and comprehensive comparison in Table , Supporting Information), the battery offers very competitive volumetric capacity and rate capability in comparison with the latest reported transition metal selenides for Li+ storage. Due to the inherent semiconducting conductivity, h‐FeSe can hardly deliver any reversible capacity or high‐rate capability (Figure , Supporting Information), that means it plays a negligible role on the manifested electrochemical performance of the mixed phases. In addition, it is worthy to note that the electrochemical performance of Li battery is somewhat inferior to that in SIBs. Similar phenomenon has been observed in other reports in the literature,[] which can be attributed to the higher desolvation energy of Li ions in the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in a slower kinetics.\nIn addition, the phase evolution of t‐FeSe in Li battery was investigated via in situ XRD. As shown in Figure , the characteristic peaks of t‐FeSe slightly shift to their lower angle along with a small slope in discharge profile at the beginning of the discharge process, which suggests that Li+ ions are inserted into the interlayers of tetragonal lattice with an expansion of volume. Subsequently, the intensity of t‐FeSe peaks gradually decreases and eventually disappear at 1.4\xa0V. In the meanwhile, a series of new peaks emerged, among which the ones at 25.6°, 29.7°, and 42.7° can be indexed based on Li2Se and reflection at 44.4° belongs to metallic Fe, indicative of the conversion reaction process. In contrast, the charge process demonstrates a reverse phase transition: the Li2Se and Fe gradually react and convert into t‐FeSe. According to the above discussion, the reactions during discharge and charge processes are as following:\nDischarge process:6FeSe+xLi++xe−→LixFeSe7LixFeSe+2−xLi++2−xe−→Fe+Li2Se\nCharge process:8Fe+Li2Se→FeSe+2Li++2e−\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

We first compare the formation energy of pristine NLM, Mg doped at Na‐sites (donated as NMLM), and TM‐sites (donated as NLMM) by first‐principle calculations to investigate their phase stability for the possible doped sites in NLM (see section calculation details in the experimental section). As shown in Figure\xa0, NLM exhibits a formation energy of −742.5\xa0eV while NMLM displays a slightly reduced value of −743.9\xa0eV, indicating that the structural stability of NLM can be improved by incorporating Mg into the Na layers. In sharp contrast, the structural optimization of Mg doping at the TM sites failed to converge. It can be seen from the inset section of Figure\xa0 that a local nonphysical connection between Li and Na in NLMM appears during the optimization process, which is unreasonable. Therefore, the calculated results demonstrated that Mg ions are suitable to substitute Na ions. Based on the above‐mentioned structure, we further calculate the formation energy calculation of mixing enthalpy to investigate the effect on thermodynamic stability. Figure\xa0 displays the mixing enthalpy of different Na contents in NLM and NMLM. With further desodiation, the mixing enthalpy values of NLM and NMLM increased, indicating an unstable structure at highly desodiation states. Interestingly, the slope at the desodiation content from 0.43 to 0.7 in NMLM is smaller than that of NLM, which suggests that the formation of unstable phases is alleviated by Mg substitution.\nExperimentally, NLM and NMLM have been successfully synthesized via a traditional one‐step solid‐state reaction, with detailed synthesis procedures described in the experimental section. Figure\xa0 shows the XRD patterns, where all peaks can be indexed to a hexagonal layered structure (space group: P63/mmc). The (002) diffraction peak shifts to higher 2θ after Mg substitution (inset of Figure\xa0), indicating the unit cell shrinks along the c axis. The decrease in TM layers distance reflects that Mg ions have successfully entered into the Na layer of NMLM (Figure\xa0), since the ionic radius of Mg2+ ion (0.72 Å) is smaller than Na+ ion (1.02 Å). In addition, the weak diffraction peak at 22.5°can be attributed to the in‐plane Li+/Mn4+ ordering with a √3a×√3a‐type supercell (“1/3 1/3 1” superlattice).[] The observed intensity of this superstructure peak of NMLM is similar to NLM, confirming that the Li+/Mn4+ ordering has not been suppressed by Mg substitution. It's well known that the TM1/TM2 cationic ordering of Mn‐rich cathodes with TM‐sites substituting by Mg ions would be suppressed.[] Thus, Mg ions have not entered into the TM layers of NLM in this case. Furthermore, the calculated patterns of NLM and NMLM fit well with the XRD results (Figure\xa0; Tables  and , Supporting Information). Based on the XRD Rietveld refinement, NMLM exhibits reduced lattice parameters of c and V (Figure\xa0), further confirming that Mg ions successfully occupy the 2b Wyckoff of Na sites (Table , Supporting Information) in NLM.\nWe further employed STEM technique to validate the location of the doped Mg and investigate the difference between NLM and NMLM. Figure\xa0 exhibits the STEM‐HAADF images in the bulk of NLM and NMLM, respectively. Both of them show the well‐ordered of Mn atoms, demonstrating that they have high crystallinity. Because of the Na and O ions’ low atomic masses, they usually cannot be detected in the HAADF mode. Interestingly, some discontinuous dark‐atoms (marked with red frames and circles) can be seen in the Na layers (Figure\xa0), inferring the presence of some heavy atoms while its atomic number should be lower than Mn. Therefore, we can conclude that Mg ions partially occupy the Na sites. We also observed the effect of Mg doping on surface structure. As exhibited in Figure\xa0, the HAADF image of NLM clearly demonstrates the layered arrangement Mn atoms at the surface, however, a thickness of ≈1–1.5\xa0nm spinel structure is formed on the surface of NMLM. The atomic arrangement of this spinel phase is similar to MgMn2O4.[] Generally, the formation of spinel phase on the surface of layered oxide cathodes is beneficial for its surface stability at high voltages.[]\nNext, we evaluated the electrochemical performance of NMLM and NLM in the voltage range of 2–4.5\xa0V using a half‐cell configuration. Figure\xa0 and Figure  (Supporting Information) show the representative galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles. Both of them exhibit a two‐step charge profile with a sloping shape followed with a long voltage plateau above 4.0\xa0V. It can be inferred that the substitution of Mg ions at Na sites has no effect on the diffusion of in‐plane Na+. In the first charge profile, both of NMLM and NLM delivered low capacity of ≈15 mAh g−1 below 3.5\xa0V, corresponding to a low portion of Mn3+/Mn4+ oxidation. With continuous charging, the anionic charge compensation starts to contribute to the capacity where a capacity of ≈220 mAh g−1 was obtained with NLM, which is agreement with other P2 analogues.[] Interestingly, NMLM shows a smaller capacity of 205 mAh g−1 due to the decrease of a linear shape (Na–O–Li) that can form labile oxygen (lone‐pair O) electrons for charge‐compensation after Mg substitution. During the following discharge process, NLM displays a first cycle discharge capacity of 210 mAh g−1 based on the oxygen‐related anodic and Mn reduction, which is higher than that of NMLM (192 mAh g−1) due to the partially replacement of Na by the inactive Mg ions. Surprisingly, charge/discharge profiles of NMLM for the initial four cycles overlap well with each other, suggestive of an excellent cycling stability. In addition, compared to NLM, NMLM also manifests a smaller charge/discharge voltage hysteresis, which demonstrates that replacing Na ions by Mg ions can adjust the voltage of the redox process. Moreover, an obvious voltage decay above 3.2\xa0V can be observed for NLM, intimating the surface structural rearrangement caused by the loss of oxygen on the surface. [] Such a phenomenon has not been observed in NMLM, in contrast, illustrating the alleviated oxygen loss by Mg substitution.\nThe corresponding dQ/dV curves within 5 cycles are given as well (Figure\xa0). Two pairs of redox peaks at ≈2.6/4.2\xa0V (charge) and ≈2.4/2.7\xa0V (discharge) are expected to relate with the Mn3+/Mn4+ and O2−/(O2)n− redox couple. For NLM, both peaks of Mn3+/Mn4+ and O2−/(O2)n− redox are gradually decreased after the first cycle, which indicates the possible release of surface oxygen and structural phase transition (such as P2–O2, P2–P2'). In contrast, the consistent peaks in NMLM demonstrate that the reversible oxygen redox and structural stability have been greatly improved by Mg substitution. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was employed to further investigate the kinetic superiority of NMLM over NLM, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. NMLM exhibits a smaller overpotential and a larger Na+ diffusion coefficient than that of NLM, indicative of its superior reaction kinetics and rate capability. As displayed in Figure\xa0 and Figure  (Supporting Information), NMLM gives a discharge capacity of 140 mAh g−1 at a current density of 400\xa0mA g−1. As opposed, NLM exhibits a capacity of only 20 mAh g−1 at the same test condition. At an even higher current density of 1000\xa0mA g−1, NMLM still delivers a discharge capacity as high as 102 mAh g−1. To the best our knowledge, such a superior rate capability has been rarely reported for the oxygen‐related Mn‐rich based layered cathodes.[]\nTo evaluate how an oxygen‐related anionic redox chemistry can be preferably stabilized by Mg substitution, we further observed the oxygen redox activity within a reduced voltage window of 2.6–4.5\xa0V. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectrums (XPS) was employed to investigate the charge compensation mechanism of Mn in this voltage window. As displayed in Figure  in the Supporting Information, the valence of Mn keeps +4 when discharged to 2.6\xa0V, confirming that Mn is inactive at above 2.6\xa0V. Therefore, the capacity in 2.6–4.5\xa0V is mostly contributed by oxygen charge compensation, consistent with the reported results.[] Figure\xa0 and Figure  (Supporting Information) show the cycling performance, where NMLM shows a 4 times higher capacity retention than NLM over 100 cycles, demonstrating a greatly improved oxygen redox stability by Mg substitution.\nNext, soft X‐ray absorption spectroscopy at the 3d transition elements L2,3 edges with high sensitivity to the oxidation state[] and local environment[] was further employed to investigate the oxygen redox. The SXAS spectra with the total fluorescence yield (TFY) mode at O K‐edges was collected to study the O2p holes of NLM and NMLM at various states.[] Figure\xa0 shows the O K‐edge SXAS spectra at different desodiation states in the first cycle. The dominant pre‐edge peaks below 533\xa0eV correspond to the unoccupied O2p state derived from the covalent mixing of O2p and TM3d orbitals.[] The intensity change of the pre‐edge peak area during charge/discharge reflects the covalent intensity of TM3d‐O2p or the generation of oxygen holes.[] In addition, a weak peak at 533.5\xa0eV represents the oxygen‐containing surface species, such as inorganic (Na2CO3) or organic (ROCO3) sodium carbonates.[] When being charged to 4.5\xa0V, the obvious increase in the O K‐edge pre‐edge area in Figure\xa0 correspond to the removal of electrons from oxygen, namely an increase in the O2p holes.[] This increase cannot be explained by the further oxidation of Mn4+ (Figure , Supporting Information), thus the change in the spectral weight is exclusively contributed by oxygen oxidation.[] Upon being discharged to 2.0\xa0V, the decreased intensity of the O K‐edge pre‐edge area can be clearly observed in Figure\xa0, which indicates that the oxygen‐hole states are repopulated and the valence of Mn is reduced. In the Mn L2,3‐edge SXAS‐TEY spectra (Figure\xa0), the weight center of the spectra has shifted to the lower energy, suggestive of a lower Mn valance. Compared with the references of MnO (+2) and LaMnO3 (+3), Mn ions in the surface of NMLM at discharged 2.0\xa0V is the mixture of mainly Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions. In general, there are two possible reasons for the existence of Mn2+ in the surface of Mn‐rich layered TM oxide cathodes, including irreversible lattice oxygen redox[] and the occurrence of surface reactions.[] To obtain the accurate valence of Mn in this stage, we carried out SXAS measurements with total fluorescence yield (TFY) mode with a detection depth of few hundreds of nanometers. As shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information, the Mn L2,3‐edge IPFY spectrum of discharged NMLM at 2.6\xa0V is similar to that of Li2MnO3,[] indicating that the valence of Mn in NMLM at 2.6\xa0V is still +4. Figure  in the Supporting Information exhibits the Mn L2,3‐edge IPFY spectrum (yellow) of NMLM at 2.0\xa0V and its fitted spectrum (bule) using LaMnO3 (Mn3+)[] and NMLM at 2.6\xa0V (Mn4+) as references. We can see that the weight center of the Mn L2,3‐edge IPFY spectrum shifts to lower energy, suggesting the lowering of Mn valance. The appearance of the new spectral feature between the sharp peaks at 640.7 and 643.3\xa0eV for the Mn4+ indicates the existence of Mn3+. We further carried out the fitting of Mn L2,3‐edge IPFY spectrum of NMLM at 2.0\xa0V to analyze the content of Mn3+ and Mn4+. The fitted spectrum (bule) using 30% LaMnO3 (navy blue) and 70% discharged NMLM (cutoff potential: 2.6\xa0V, purple) spectrum is similar to the experimental spectrum, verifying that Mn is composed of Mn4+ (70%) and Mn3+ (30%) at this stage.\nTo explore the stability of oxygen redox upon cycling, we collected the O K‐edge spectra at the extended cycles, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  (Supporting Information). When being re‐charged to 4.5\xa0V in the second cycle, the O K‐edge spectra of both NLM and NMLM are very similar to their counterparts in the initially charged state at 4.5\xa0V, implying the re‐generation of the O2p holes. Surprisingly, the O K‐edge spectra of NMLM after five cycles also displayed similar characteristics to that of the previous cycles, reflecting the highly reversibility of oxygen redox. We also investigated the differences in O K‐edge spectra between NLM and NMLM after 50 cycles, as displayed in Figure\xa0. Clearly, the O K‐edge pre‐edge peak of NMLM at 50th cycle still exhibits an increased intensity than that of the pristine one, which demonstrates that the O in NMLM still maintains high activity. Especially, an increase in spectral weight at 530.8\xa0eV, which was related the O‐O covalent bonding found previously.[] In contrast, the O K‐edge spectra of NLM shows the overlapped with pristine state. The above results indicate that the oxygen redox stability in NLM has been significantly strengthened by Mg substitution.\nThe stability of oxygen redox in the layered oxide cathode is also related to its structure.[] We collected the Mn K‐edge X‐ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra and extended X‐ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of different cycles at charged state to elucidate the effects on the structural stability of NLM upon Mg substitution.[] As seen in Figure  in the Supporting Information, all the XANES spectra of both NLM and NMLM overlap with each other, verifying an excellent reversibility of Mn valence state during the extended cycles. However, the spectral weight of pre‐edge peak of NMLM decreases with number of cycles indicating more symmetric coordinated Mn ion with oxygen.[] The local structure evolution at extended cycles was further revealed by EXAFS spectra. Figure\xa0 exhibit the Fourier transforms of Mn K‐edge in NLM and NMLM electrodes at different cycles, respectively. The first peak at ≈1.50 Å in EXAFS originates from Mn‐O coordination, while the second peak at ≈2.55 Å originates from Mn‐Mn/Li coordination. It is widely known that the intensity generally relates to the coordination number of the central element (Mn) or structural disorder.[] Obviously, from 1st to 50th cycle, the intensity of the Mn‐O bond length of NMLM increases, while it decreases for NLM. Although, the number of coordination obtained from analyzing EXAFS has 30–40% errors, the enhanced height of the first peak in general demonstrates an increase in the coordination number or decrease in the structural disorder. Since the local symmetry has only negligible change as shown in the pre‐edge region at the Mn‐K XANES in Figure  in the Supporting Information, the structure of NLM has suffered from deterioration over long‐term cycling. In strong contrast to this result, the position of this peak in NMLM remain unchanged and its height increases over long‐term cycling suggesting its superior structure stability.\nTo further confirm the structural stability of NMLM upon the Na+ (de)intercalation process, we collected in/ex situ XRD patterns of NMLM and NLM (Figure\xa0; Figure , Supporting Information). During the first charging process of NLM, a new O2‐type phase appears at 4.1\xa0V (Figure , Supporting Information), suggesting a P2‐O2 phase transition during charging. Then, the P2 phase is completely transformed to O2 phase at the end of charge, which is in accordance with the reported results.[] This phase transition can generate severe strain on the crystal lattice, causing the formation of internal stress and cracks upon long‐term cycling.[] When being discharged to 2.0\xa0V, the (002) peak shifts towards a higher angle, indicating a poor structural reversibility of NLM. In contrast, phase transition cannot be observed in NMLM upon the cycling. All diffraction peaks of NMLM can be indexed to the P2 phase with a gradual change in (002) peak positions, verifying that NMLM experiences a moderate structural evolution without phase transition. The lattice parameters (V and c) of NMLM at different charge/discharge states were also calculated from the in situ XRD results, as presented in Figure\xa0 and Figure  (Supporting Information). The maximum changes of lattice parameters V and c are only 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively, much smaller than those of the previously reported results for layered cathode materials.[] Consequently, the strategy of Mg substitution on the Na site can effectively suppress both the phase transition and volume change upon charge/discharge.\nWe further investigated the structural changes of NMLM at atomic scale during the charging process. Figure  (Supporting Information) displays the STEM‐HAADF images of NMLM at pristine and charged 4.5\xa0V. Clearly, when charged to 4.5\xa0V, we can see that Mn atoms are not migrate to Na layers to form rock‐salt or order‐disorder phases in the bulk of NMLM (Figure\xa0), which indicates that Mg doping reinforces the stability of NLM structure. In addition, the presence of dark‐atoms in the Na layers in the bulk of NMLM means that Mg atoms cannot be extracted during charging process. For the surface structure of NMLM, the thickness of spinel phase keeps unchanged upon charged.[] We employed first‐principle calculations to further explore the effect of Mg substitution on the oxygen stability and the electrochemical performances. Firstly, we calculated the formation energy of more than 500 structures of NLM (Figure , Supporting Information), followed by choosing the structure with the lowest formation energy. To explain the excellent rate capability of NMLM, total density of states (TDOS) was calculated. As seen in Figure\xa0, the bandgap of the majority bands is reduced from ≈0.3 to ≈0.2\xa0eV after Mg substitution, demonstrating an enhanced electrical conductivity and a potentially better power capability, which agrees well with the experimental results. The rate capability of cathode is also highly related to the Na ions migration in the structure. Thus, two diffusion paths (noted as path 1 and path 2) are proposed (Figure , Supporting Information), respectively. The corresponding Na‐ions migration energy in NLM and NMLM are plotted in Figure\xa0. It appears that Mg substitution could reduce the energy barrier of Na ions migration in both path 1 and path 2. Therefore, NMLM can exhibit a significantly enhanced rate capability. We also compared the projected density of states (PDOS) of O2p on the highly desodiated states (Na0.11Li0.25Mn0.75O2 and Na0.12Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2, Figure\xa0). We can see that the occupied state and the unoccupied state overlap in the Majory band, which indicates that NLM and NMLM become semi‐metals at the highly desodiated states. However, Na0.12Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 shows a smaller number of states near the Ef than Na0.11Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Such a difference in electronic structure, to some degree, could limit the electron transfer during the dissociation of the carbonate‐based electrolyte, which is beneficial to stabilize the cathode‐electrolyte interface. The oxygen chemical potential can be used as a basis for deterring if a material undergoes an oxygen release reaction.[] Figure\xa0 shows the computed oxygen chemical potential of the NLM and NMLM materials in their charged state. Surprisingly, the oxygen chemical potential of desodiated NMLM is lower than that of the NLM, which suggests that the lattice oxygen of NMLM is more stable than NLM at highly voltages. We also calculated the formation energy of Na0.11Li0.25Mn0.75O2 and Na0.12Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 to investigate the effect of Mg substitution on the structural stability of NLM in its charged state. As displayed in Figure  in the Supporting Information, the formation energy of desodiated NLM has decreased from −681 to −689\xa0eV after Mg substitution, suggesting a significantly improved structural stability at highly charged state by Mg substitution. These results have been confirmed by the experimental results including electrochemical performance, XAS and in situ XRD.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

After 88 h of alkalization process, the 2D layered Ti3C2 with micrometer size (Figure , Supporting Information) transformed into the intermediate product a‐Ti3C2 formed by stacking nanoparticle units. The nanoparticles on the surface of a‐Ti3C2 self‐assembled into fibers (Figure , Supporting Information). As reaction time is prolonged to 156 h, all nanoparticle units of a‐Ti3C2 have completed self‐assembly to form 1D fibrous and hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2), as shown in Figure . Its tube diameter is 30–40\xa0nm, and the internal lattice spacing is further increased (Figure\xa0). The solutions with weight mass ratio of h‐Ti3C2 to CNTs (Figure\xa0) of 0:1, 0.3:1, and 1.0:1, are prepared through ultrasonic mixing, and abbreviated as CNTs, 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (or h‐Ti3C2/CNTs) and 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (Figure , Supporting Information) and 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs solution (Figure\xa0) indicated that the h‐Ti3C2 closely intertwined with CNTs, which would contribute to well mechanical property and tenacity of h‐M‐SSG resulting in a benign 3D conductive network. The h‐M‐SSG scaffold is prepared by vacuum filtration in the order of 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, and CNTs solutions, as shown in Figure\xa0. The sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 content of h‐M‐SSG gradually increased from top to bottom.\nAs we can see from TEM–energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (TEM–EDX) elemental mappings (Figure 2f; Figure , Supporting Information), O and F elements are uniformly distributed throughout h‐Ti3C2, which play a key role in inducing Na homogeneous deposition. Meanwhile, the increasement of lattice spacing of h‐Ti3C2 conduces to the adsorption of K+ during the alkalization process, and resulted in the increasing of K element content. It is worth noting that the high sodiophilic peculiarity of h‐M‐SSG stems from the rich content of O, F, and K function groups of h‐Ti3C2, as shown in Figure\xa0, Figures\xa0 and  in the Supporting Information. Among them, the O and F functional groups possess relatively large binding energies with Na atom, which can effectively reduce nucleation energy, and form the sodiophilic sites. The corresponding high X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of O1s and F1s are shown in Figure\xa0, respectively. From these XPS spectra, we can know that most of O and F functional groups are bonded with Ti of h‐Ti3C2. As for the K functional group, it could be alloyed with Na, which further improves the sodiophilic property of h‐Ti3C2.\nThe different thicknesses of the h‐M‐SSG scaffolds from 80 to 250\xa0µm are easily prepared by adjusting the volume of various h‐Ti3C2/CNTs solutions during the preparation, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The various thickness scaffolds can be applied to meet the requirements of different application scenarios. To get more clearly gradient structure in the characterization of SEM–EDX, we choose the thickness about 250\xa0µm as a research object. In addition, the thickness of h‐M‐SSG scaffold is in direct relation to the thickness of Na composite anode. Therefore, the thicker h‐M‐SSG/Na composite anode is more suitable for the following cycling experiment of ultrahigh charging/discharging areal capacity, such as 1–40 mAh cm−2. The prepared h‐M‐SSG keeps perfect without any cracks or deformation after several times repeated folding operation (Figure ), indicating that it possesses satisfied flexibility. This trait is inherited on h‐M‐SSG/Na composite anode. In Figure\xa0, the prepared h‐M‐SSG film with the thickness about 250 μm has a relatively loose porous structure (101.4 m2 g−1, shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information), which is conducive to increase sodium loading capacity and reduce the local current density during cycling to lengthen the Sand's time for inhibiting dendrites growth. In order to verify the stepped gradient structure of h‐M‐SSG, it is characterized by EDS‐mapping. It is worth noting that Ti element comes from h‐Ti3C2, while C element comes from h‐Ti3C2 and CNTs. As shown in Figure\xa0, the structure of h‐M‐SSG can clearly be divided into three layers based on Ti content, indicating that the sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 content stepped increases from top to bottom. This viewpoint is also further verified by the distribution graph of C content (Figure\xa0) and related element line scanning (Figure , Supporting Information). Among them, the presence of sporadic Ti element in the top layer of h‐M‐SSG may be caused by slight interference between different solution layers during the preparation process.\nThe different capacity‐limited protocols are conducted to plate Na on the h‐M‐SSG scaffolds to explore the deposition behavior. The corresponding schematic illustration about bottom‐up deposition and related optical photograph are shown in Figure\xa0. The optical photograph of the bottom of h‐M‐SSG exhibits obvious metallic luster (silvery white) after Na deposition with the capacity of 10 mAh cm−2, whereas the top surface does not, which obvious demonstrates that the sodiophilic gradient structure of h‐M‐SSG could induce Na deposition preferentially at the bottom of anode. This conclusion is further confirmed by the cross‐sectional SEM images of h‐M‐SSG after Na deposition, as shown in Figure\xa0. After 1 h of Na deposition at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, Na filled the whole of h‐M‐SSG, but it could be clearly divided into three layers based on the compactness of Na. The Na layer at the bottom of the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is the most compact and thickest layer, which almost forms a smooth plane without any voids (Figure\xa0).\xa0The\xa0Na layer at the middle of the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is relatively compact. Amounts of microsize sodium particles are stacked crossing each other, and exhibiting a rough granular surface (Figure\xa0). The Na layer at the top of h‐M‐SSG scaffold is relatively loose and porous, and still keeps bits of fibrous CNTs (Figure\xa0). Therefore, it can be inferred that the deposition behavior of Na on the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is preferentially deposition on the bottom, and then gradually deposit to the middle and top at the condition of the bottom is filled tightly. The cross‐sectional SEM of h‐M‐SSG with different Na deposition capacity‐limited of 20, 30, and 40 mAh cm−2, also verified above bottom‐up deposition behavior, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. This is caused by the fact that the rich content of sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 at the bottom.\nThe sodium deposition behaviors with the capacity of 10 mAh cm–2 on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs) and CNTs scaffolds, are also studied as a control group. As we can see from the cross‐sectional SEM images of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (Figure ) after Na deposition, Na filled the whole of scaffold. The obtained h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na could be clearly divided into two layers based on the compactness of Na. The upper of Na layer is compact and thick, and the bottom of Na layer is relatively loose. There is no similar bottom‐up deposition sequence as h‐M‐SSG for h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold. Therefore, the sodium deposition is uniform in the early middle stage, while it will be preferentially inducing Na deposition at the upper layer of scaffold in the latter stage. The metallic luster (silvery white) of top surface of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold after Na deposition, further verified this viewpoint (Figure\xa0). From the cross‐sectional SEM images of CNTs (Figure\xa0), we can see that Na will preferentially deposit at the surface layer of the scaffold resulting in amounts of bulges and dendrites. This is due to the poor sodiophilic property of CNTs. The metallic luster of surface of CNTs after Na deposition also verified this point (Figure\xa0). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the bottom‐up deposition sequence of h‐M‐SSG only stems from its stepped sodiophilic gradient structure.\nThe first Na plating behaviors on CNTs, h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, and h‐M‐SSG scaffolds at high current density of 10 mA cm−2, are investigated by in situ XRD. Their corresponding color plots of XRD patterns are shown in Figure\xa0, respectively. The characteristic peak of Na2CO3 appeared after the deposition time of 6 and 15\xa0min for Na–CNTs and Na–h‐Ti3C2/CNTs half batteries, respectively. However, Na2CO3 is one of typical by‐product resulting from decomposition of electrolyte or the side reaction between Na metal and electrolyte. Compared to Na–CNTs half‐batteries, the signal intensity and presentation time of characteristic peak of Na2CO3 for Na–h‐Ti3C2/CNTs is weaker and later, which means the relatively mild side reaction. This is largely due to the sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 component of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold. As for the XRD pattern of Na–h‐M‐SSG, there is still no signal peak of Na2CO3, which means that the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure could effectively inhibit side reaction. That is to say, the h‐M‐SSG scaffold with sodiophilic gradient structure possesses excellent affordability for high current density and capacity.\nThe sodium‐ion transfer resistances of Na, CNTs/Na, h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, and h‐M‐SSG/Na are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figures  and  in the Supporting Information. After 100 charge/discharge cycling times at 1.0 mA cm−2 and 1.0 mAh cm−2, the symmetric battery based on h‐M‐SSG/Na shows the smallest semicircle (3.18 Ω), which means that it possesses the most favorable Na+ transfer kinetics. This conclusion is further verified by Tafel plot, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. Compared with Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, the Tafel curve of the h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetric battery exhibited the maximum intersection with the y‐axis. It means the largest exchange current for Na plating/stripping in h‐M‐SSG/Na anode (I0\xa0= 11.88 mA cm–2) and fastest charge transfer kinetic.\nTo further investigate the inhibiting Na dendrites effect of sodiophilic gradient structure, the morphological change of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na are observed by an in situ optical microscopy during Na stripping and replating at 10 mA cm−2. The flat surface of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrode became uneven, and generated amounts of micrometer‐level protrudes and dendrites after Na stripping for 30\xa0min and replating for 30\xa0min, as shown in Figure\xa0. This is due to the preferential stripping and re‐plating behavior on top layer of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na at high current density, which would cause serious tip effect resulting in nonuniform deposition and intensifying the formation of dendrites. By comparison, the surface of h‐M‐SSG/Na remained flat and no trace of dendrite (Figure\xa0), which is due to the bottom‐up deposition sequence of h‐M‐SSG. In conclusion, the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure can effectively enhance the affordability of h‐M‐SSG for high current density and capacity. It is worth noting that the high sodiophilic peculiarity of h‐M‐SSG stems from the rich content of O and F function groups of h‐Ti3C2. It is further demonstrated by the first‐principles DFT calculations (Figure\xa0; Figure , Supporting Information). The most stable structures of a single Na atom absorbed on h‐Ti3C2 surface groups (h‐Ti3C2O, h‐Ti3C2F) and CNTs and corresponding binding energies are shown in Figure\xa0. The binding energies between Na atom with h‐Ti3C2O (−10.8\xa0eV) and h‐Ti3C2F (−2.0\xa0eV) are significantly larger than CNTs (−1.1\xa0eV). The stronger binding energy means effectively reduce nucleation energy and form the sodiophilic sites, which is conducive to the uniform Na plating/stripping and dendrite‐free anode.\nThe long‐term cycling stability of symmetrical batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na is assessed by galvanostatic tests. The symmetrical batteries based on Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na anodes are also studied as a control group. At the relatively moderate current densities (1, 5 mA cm−2) and capacities (1, 5 mAh cm−2), symmetrical batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na and h‐Ti3C2/Na anodes exhibit a low polarization voltage and excellent cycling stability, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. The charging–discharge curve of symmetrical batteries based on Na and CNTs/Na anodes, in contrast, show a huge fluctuation and large polarization voltage. For instance, symmetrical batteries based on h‐Ti3C2/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes, remain a low voltage of 0.113–0.050\xa0V, respectively, for more than 1200 h at 1.0 and 1.0 mAh cm−2. On the contrary, symmetrical batteries based on CNTs/Na and pure Na shown a huge polarization voltage fluctuation after cycling time of 300 h.\nWith the current density increased from 5 mA cm−2 to 10, 15, 20, 40 mA cm−2, the cycling stability of symmetrical batteries based on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na are beginning to show an enormous difference. The symmetric cell based on h‐M‐SSG/Na has a stable charge–discharge curve and a low polarization voltage of only 93\xa0mV for more than 100 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 10 mAh cm−2, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. However, the charge–discharge curve of symmetric battery based on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, shows a huge voltage fluctuation, and the polarization voltage began to increase sharply after 9 h operation, and exceeds 1.79\xa0V at 100 h. Impressively, the excellent cycling stability of h‐M‐SSG/Na also continues at high current density of 15, 20, 40 mA cm−2 and high areal capacity of 15, 20, 40 mAh cm−2, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. For example, symmetric battery based on h‐M‐SSG/Na exhibits the charge–discharge curves and a low polarization voltage of only 0.145\xa0V for more than 180 h at 40.0 mA cm−2 and 40.0 mAh cm−2. However, the charge–discharge cycle curves of symmetric batteries based on Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na anodes, show a huge fluctuation, and large polarization voltages more than 1.212, 0.584, and 0.547\xa0V, respectively. It further highlights the advantages of h‐M‐SSG framework. Therefore, we can know that the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure could effectively improve the affordability of the scaffold for high current density and capacity, and maintain a lower polarization voltage and longer cycling life in symmetrical batteries. In addition, the related plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies (CE) data of Na || Cu and Na || h‐M‐SSG half batteries are provided in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The first Coulombic CE of Na || h‐M‐SSG half battery is as high as 99.99%, and its cycle life is far superior to that of Na || Cu battery. The cycling performance of h‐M‐SSG/Na is well ahead of all the other previous reported scaffolds for Na composited anodes for cycling current density and areal capacity, as shown in Figure\xa0. Most of scaffold‐based Na anodes are limited by the high charging/discharging capacity (>5 mAh cm−2) at current density (>10 mA cm−2). In addition, the rate performance of h‐M‐SSG/Na is also studied by charge/discharge cycling at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mA cm−2 (Figure , Supporting Information). The voltage hysteresis of h‐M‐SSG/Na stepped increases with ampere density and maintains excellent steady even at 40 mA cm−2, which demonstrate the excellent rate performance. On the contrary, the symmetric batteries based on pure Na, CNTs/Na, and h‐Ti3C2/Na exhibit the huge voltage fluctuations with the increasing of current density.\nTo further verified the feasibility of h‐M‐SSG in practical battery, Na−O2 batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes, are assembled (Figure\xa0). The cycling lifetime and potential gap of batteries are tested at 1000 mA g−1 (0.14 mA cm−2, based on the practical loading of Super‐P on carbon paper is 0.14 mg cm−2) and a control capacity of 1000 mAh g−1 (0.14 mAh cm−2). The Na–O2 battery with h‐M‐SSG/Na anode keeps a stable charge–discharge curve with an average CE of 93.74%, and a low potential gap of 0.137\xa0mV for more than 45 cycles, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. However, the cycling life of Na–O2 batteries with pure Na metal, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrodes are 5, 15, and 24 cycles, respectively, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries with pure Na metal, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrodes decreased to 548 mAh g−1 (after 7 cycles), 682 mAh g−1 (after 17 cycles) and 151 mAh g−1 (after 24 cycles), respectively. Furthermore, the rate performance of Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes are investigated at the different current densities and a control capacity of 1000 mAh g−1. With the increasement of current density (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mA g−1), the low overpotential gap of batteries is 81, 87, 91, 95, 113, 220, and 425\xa0mV, respectively, which implying the satisfied rate performance (Figure\xa0). Therefore, the introduction of sodiophilic gradient structure in Na–O2 cell can effectively reduce overpotential, and improve the rate performance and cycle life at high current density.\nAs for Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na electrodes, its current density of 1000 mA g−1 is relatively higher than that of the common Na–O2 batteries with pure Na‐metal anodes of 200–500 mA g−1. Due to the open system of Na–O2 batteries, the discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na electrodes cut‐off with 1000 mAh g−1. The increase of discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries will increase the running time and aggravate the shuttle effect of O2 between Na‐metal anode and electrolyte resulting in terrible cycling performance. In our next research work, we plan to make use of the synergistic effect of h‐M‐SSG/Na and quasi‐solid electrolyte to resolve above problem and improve discharge capacity.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Among of them, the concentration of CNTs aqueous solution was about 2.0 mg L−1. The h‐M‐SSG scaffold was prepared by vacuum filtration in the order of 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), and CNTs solutions (10\xa0mL), and using two glass plates to keep smooth at 55\xa0°C for 16 h under vacuum condition.\n\nPreparation of the Cathode of Na–O2 Battery\nThe super‐P of 7.5\xa0mg and PVDF of 0.833\xa0mg were mixed in 75\xa0mL ethanol. After ultrasonic mixing for 2 h, this solution was spray coated onto the carbon paper with the size of 6\xa0cm × 7\xa0cm under 100\xa0°C. This TGP‐H‐060 hydrophilia carbon paper with the thickness of 0.19\xa0mm and density of 0.44 g cm−3 was purchased from Toray Corporation of Japan. The weight of a carbon‐paper disk with the diameter of 8.0\xa0mm in Na–O2 battery was 4.202\xa0mg. The final practical loading of Super‐P on carbon paper was only 0.14 mg cm−2.\n\nCharacterization\nThe SEM (JSM‐7500F, JEOL) and HR‐TEM (FEI Talos F200x G2) were used to characterized the morphology and structure of samples. The surface properties of samples were tested by XPS (Perkin Elmer PHI). The electrolytes in symmetrical and Na–O2 batteries were 1 mol L−1 NaCF3SO3‐diglyme (NaOTF‐G2) solution. The diameter of electrodes in all batteries was 8.0\xa0mm. All batteries were assembled in glovebox under the condition Ar atmosphere. The cycling lifetime and potential gap of Na–O2 batteries were tested in pure O2 at cut‐off voltage of 1.8–2.0\xa0V. The current density of Na–O2 batteries was calculated from the loading of Super‐P on carbon paper.\n\nComputational Details\nThe solution environment does affect the deposition process of Na. However, considering the variability of electrolyte system and the complexity of SEI formation, the dynamic evolution of electrolyte near the surface of Na metal is much difficult to simulate based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Therefore, the electrolyte was kept unchanged in the whole experiments, thus ensuring that the electrolyte has the same effect on the Na deposition process. DFT analysis were performed here for qualitatively comparing the interaction between different substrates and Na. The similar DFT analysis in other research works can further verify above viewpoints.[] All the calculations were carried out by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)[] with the projector augmented wave (PAW)[] potentials for core electrons and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)[] form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchange and correlation functional. An energy cutoff of 450\xa0eV was adopted for the plane wave expansion of valence electron wave functions. A 4 × 4 × 2 k‐point mesh was used for geometric optimization of the 3 × 3 supercell of Ti3C2. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was introduced to avoid interactions between adjacent layers. All structures were relaxed with all atoms allowed to move until the force was less than 0.02\xa0eV Å−1.

The CNTs are hydrophobic and hard to be homogeneously dispersed in the aqueous solution. To obtain the well dispersion of CNTs, the CNTs were first dispersed in ethylene glycol (EG) through strong ultrasonication then they were mixed with the NVP precursor solution (Figure , Supporting Information). After being dried and annealed in the flowing nitrogen atmosphere, the NVP@C@CNTs were obtained. The NVP@C were synthesized without adding the CNTs during the synthesized processes. The X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure\xa0) of the NVP@C@CNTs and NVP@C are well indexed to the rhombohedral phase (JCPDS No. 53‐0018), indicating the high purity.[] The carbon content of the NVP@C@CNTs and NVP@C is 4.31 and 9.28\xa0wt% respectively, according to the thermogravimetric analysis (Figure , Supporting Information). Thus, the CNTs contents in NVP@C@CNTs is 4.97\xa0wt%. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of NVP@C@CNTs (Figure\xa0) shows the NVP particles are well embedded in the CNTs frameworks. The particle sizes of NVP are 100–300\xa0nm. While, the NVP@C shows self‐aggregated morphologies (Figure\xa0). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure\xa0) shows the well‐separated NVP particles in the CNTs networks. The high‐resolution (HR)TEM image of NVP@C@CNTs (Figure\xa0) shows the well crystalline NVP grains. The distinct lattice fringe of d‐spacing of 0.44\xa0nm corresponds to the (210) plane.[] The NVP particles are coated with the amorphous carbon layer of ≈4\xa0nm, and they are well connected to CNTs. While the NVP@C shows the amorphous carbon coating layers (Figure\xa0). The conductivity of the NVP@C@CNTs and NVP@C is 1144 and 1.7 mS cm−1, respectively. For better comparing the electrochemical performance, the NVP@C were ball‐milled with 5\xa0wt% of CNTs (named as NVP@C/BM‐CNTs, Figure , Supporting Information), and its conductivity is 140 mS cm−1, lower than that of NVP@C@CNTs.\n\nSodium‐Ion Storage Performance of the NVP Cathode\nThe electrochemical performance of the NVP cathodes was measured using half‐cell with metallic sodium as the counter and reference electrode. Figure\xa0 shows the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of the NVP cathodes at 0.1 A g−1 in the potential window of 2.5–4.3\xa0V versus Na+/Na. The NVP@C@CNTs and NVP@C/BM‐CNTs show the specific capacity of 117 mAh g−1, close to the theoretical capacity of 118 mAh g−1.[] The flat charge and discharge plateaus at ≈3.4\xa0V are from the reversible two‐phase transitions between Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3.[] The NVP@C@CNTs cathode shows a small overpotential (ΔEQ/2) of 23\xa0mV, lower than the 35\xa0mV for NVP@C/BM‐CNTs (inset of Figure\xa0).[] Rate performance was measured at the specific currents ranging from 0.1 to 80 A g−1 (Figure\xa0). The NVP@C@CNTs cathode delivers the specific capacity of 112, 87, and 73 mAh g−1 at 1, 10, and 20 A g−1, higher than those of NVP@C/BM‐CNTs (102, 61, and 47 mAh g−1). Even more, the NVP@C@CNTs display the specific capacity of 50 and 34 mAh g−1 at 50 and 80 A g−1, corresponding to the time of ≈3.6 (1000C) and 1.5 s (2400C). The NVP@C@CNTs and NVP@C/BM‐CNTs cathodes still display the platform at the high specific currents (Figures\xa0 and\xa0), indicating the delivered capacity largely relies on the two‐phase transition reaction.\nFigure\xa0 shows the IR‐drop and overpotential as a function of specific current for the two samples.[] The quasi‐linear relation of the IR‐drop and overpotential versus current obeys the Ohmic rule.[] Owing to the much enhanced electronic conductivity of the NVP@C@CNTs, its overpotential and IR‐drop are 214 and 108\xa0mV even at 10 A g−1, much lower than those of 776 and 576\xa0mV for NVP@C/BM‐CNTs, leading to the enhanced rate performance. The rate capability of the NVP@C@CNTs cathode is comparable to those of state‐of‐the‐art NVP cathodes (Figure\xa0).[] In addition, the NVP@C@CNTs cathode delivers ultralong‐term cycling performance at 20 A g−1 (Figure\xa0): a specific capacity of ≈70 mAh g−1 after 20\xa0000 cycles with neglectable capacity fading. The corresponding coulombic efficiency of the NVP@C@CNTs is highly stable over 99.9% during the cycles. The excellent cycling performance indicates the robust and reversible two‐phase transition of the NVP@C@CNTs materials at the ultrahigh rate.\nThe reaction kinetics and the charge transfer behaviors of the NVP‐carbon composites are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves of the NVP@C@CNTs and NVP@C/BM‐CNTs at various sweep rates ranging from 0.5 to 10\xa0mV s−1 are shown in Figures\xa0 and\xa0, respectively. The CV curves show the sharp redox peaks along with the increasing of sweep rates, indicating a superior rate capability.[] As known, the corresponding peak current followed a power‐law relationship, ip\xa0= aυb, where a is a constant and b is the power‐law exponent.[] When the b\xa0= 0.5, it indicates a diffusion‐controlled process, as occurs in battery materials. By fitting the slope of the plots of log(ip) versus log(υ) (Figure , Supporting Information), it is found that b‐values are close to 0.5 for all the cathodic and anodic peaks within the sweep rates ranging from 0.5 to 10\xa0mV s−1. Even at high sweep rate (20 to 100\xa0mV s−1, Figure , Supporting Information), the fitted b‐value is still equal to ≈0.5. This indicates the sodium‐ion storage of NVP@C@CNTs is a diffusion‐controlled process (based on the two‐phase transition reaction), even at the high sweep rate of 100\xa0mV s−1.[]\nFor the charge storage reaction is based on the semi‐infinite diffusion, the peak current (ip) and sweep rate (υ) follows the Randles–Sevcik equation:[]1ip=0.4463\u2009nFAcD1/2\u2009υ1/2αnFRT\u20091/2where, c is surface concentration, α is transfer coefficient, D is diffusion coefficient, A is surface area, R is molar gas constant, and T is temperature. According to the linear fitting of the plots of ip versus υ1/2 (Figure\xa0), the calculated Dsodiation and Ddesodiation for the NVP@C@CNTs are 6.49 × 10−9 and 5.06 × 10−9 cm2 s−1, while those for NVP@C/BM‐CNTs are 7.39 × 10−9 and 5.17 × 10−9 cm2 s−1, respectively. The apparent diffusion coefficients of the two samples are close. The corresponding ΔE (potential separation of the redox peaks from CV curves, Figure\xa0 and Figure c, Supporting Information) shows the linear relationship to υ1/2, obeying the Ohmic rule (consistent with the galvanostatic cycling measurements, Figure\xa0). The overpotential data from previously reported NVP cathodes were collected,[] and those values showed the linear relation of ΔE versus υ1/2 as well (Figure , Supporting Information), confirming the following of the Ohmic rule. The Nyquist plots (Figure\xa0) show the very small semicircle at the high‐frequency range, which is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct), and the linear slope at low frequency refers to Warburg resistance (ZW). The Rct of the NVP@C@CNTs is ≈3 Ohm cm2, much smaller than that of 15.3 Ohm cm2 for the NVP@C/BM‐CNTs.\nThe as‐synthesized NVP@C@CNTs has the well dispersion and strong connection between the NVP@C particles and CNTs frameworks, leading to the much higher conductivity to that of the NVP@C/BM‐CNTs (1144 versus 140 mS cm−1). The overpotential of NVP cathodes follows the Ohmic rule (Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information), therefore, the enhancement of electric conductivity for NVP@C@CNTs composites could largely reduce the overpotential and boost the rate capability. When the mass loading increased to 10\xa0mg cm−2 (single side), the NVP@C@CNTs cathodes still exhibit excellent rate and cycling performance (Figure , Supporting Information).\n\nSodium‐Ion Storage Performance of the MCMB Anode\nMCMB shows typical XRD pattern of crystalline graphite (Figure\xa0). The particle sizes of the MCMB anode are ≈5 to 15\xa0µm (inset of Figure\xa0). The sodiation curve of the MCMB anode shows three steps: a quasi‐linear slope in 1.5–0.65\xa0V, a flat platform in 0.65–0.5\xa0V, and a linear slope in 0.5–0.02\xa0V (Figure\xa0). The galvanostatic (de)sodiation curves of the MCMB anode show the similar plots to the natural graphite anodes.[] The initial sodiation and desodiation capacity are 123 and 111 mAh g−1 (Figure\xa0), corresponding to an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 90.2%. The small initial irreversible capacity is from the partial decomposition of the electrolyte and formation of thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers.[] In the following cycles, the galvanostatic (de)sodiation curves are well overlapped, indicating the reversible of the [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation/extraction processes. The reversible capacity of 111 mAh g−1 for MCMB anode reaches a stoichiometry of [Na‐diglyme]C20.[]\nThe CV curves at the sweep rates ranging from 0.2 to 10\xa0mV s−1 show multi redox peaks (Figure\xa0), corresponding to the multistep structural evolutions.[] Kang and coworker investigated the co‐intercalation behaviors of graphite anode by in‐situ XRD, confirming the multistep structural evolution of [Na‐diglyme]Cx from stage 3 to stage 1.[] The b‐values of each redox peaks are further calculated to investigate the reaction kinetics related to the structural evolutions (Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information). Step 1: in the beginning range of 1.5–0.65\xa0V, the bp1, bp2, and bp3 are all close to 1, owing to the single‐phase‐like reaction at the beginning of [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation into the layers.[] Thus, the first intercalation step of [Na‐diglyme]+ is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the enlarged layer‐spacing is beneficial for the fast ions intercalation. Step 2: in 0.65–0.5\xa0V, the bp4 is equal to 0.63, corresponding to the phase transitions of state 2 to stage 1.[] Step 3: in the potential below 0.5\xa0V, the bp5 and b0.25\xa0V is equal to ≈1, since the single‐phase reaction of the addition sodiation to stage 1.[] In the desodiation process, the b‐values show consistent results to the sodiation steps. The apparent diffusion coefficients of the [Na‐diglyme]+ are calculated as high as ≈10−7 to 10−8 cm2 s−1, leading to the fast intercalation speeds.[]\nThe MCMB anode shows remarkable rate capability (Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information). The specific capacity is 99, 88, 75, 47, and 23 mAh g−1 at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 A g−1, corresponding to the time of ≈36 s (100C) and 16 s (225C), 9 s (400C), 4.2 (860C), 1.66 (2168C). The MCMB anode also displays remarkable cycling stability for 10\xa0000 cycles at 2 A g−1 (Figure\xa0). As known, for the traditional LIBs or SIBs, the dendrites grow easily under the high rates, when the ions difficultly intercalate into the anode materials.[] Importantly, the MCMB anode shows a better rate capability than that of the NVP@C@CNTs cathode when the specific current is <30\xa0A g−1, which benefits us for realizing the safe charges at the high rates (Figure\xa0).\nThe morphological evolution of MCMB and the composition of the SEI layer were examined by ex‐situ SEM, TEM, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Ex‐situ SEM images (Figure , Supporting Information) display the remaining sphere‐like morphologies sodiation. There are some expanded slits in the sphere, owing to the largely expanded layer‐spacing by the [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation. The expanded slits might be beneficial for the permeation of electrolyte and the enhancement of rate performance. Ex‐situ TEM images (Figure , Supporting Information) show the clean surface of MCMB material after sodiation, indicating the very thin SEI layers. Ex‐situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Figure , Supporting Information) indicate the SEI layers on the MCMB surfaces are consisted of more organic components from the adsorption of diglyme molecules, and fewer inorganic components from the reduction of the solvent and NaPF6.[] In addition, the EIS results of the MCMB anode (Figure , Supporting Information) show the low, stale Rct at different depth of discharge (DOD) states, indicating the stable, reversible co‐intercalation reactions. Therefore, the MCMB anode shows very high ICE and stale cycles.\n\nThe MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in Diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs Full‐Cell SIB\nThe prototype of full‐cell SIB, MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs, is illustrated in Scheme\xa0. The specific current, energy density, and power density were calculated based on the total mass of electrodes. Benefitting from the high ICE of the MCMB anode, the full SIB is assembled directly without additional pre‐sodiation treatments. The assembled full‐cell SIB shows a high ICE of ≈88.7% at 0.1 A g−1 in the voltage window of 1.2–3.6\xa0V. The CV curves of full‐cell SIB (Figure , Supporting Information) shows the redox peaks according to the multistep sodiation processes for the MCMB anode. Figure\xa0 shows the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves at the specific currents from 0.05 to 15 A g−1. Remarkably, the delivered capacities of the assembled full‐cell SIB are 51, 45, 42, 38, and 20 mAh g−1 at 0.05, 0.5, 2.5, 5, and 15 A g−1, corresponding to the time of 3123 (≈1.2C), 278 (≈13C), 50 (≈72C), 22 (≈164 C), and 4.5 s (800C), respectively. Meanwhile, the full‐cell SIB was charged at a consistent rate (1 A g−1, equal to ≈25 C) and discharged at different currents, showing an ultrahigh‐power delivering ability (Figure\xa0): a high discharge capacity of 30 mAh g−1 at 25 A g−1. Moreover, the full‐cell SIB shows an excellent cycling stability (Figure\xa0): a capacity retention of 72.7% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1.\nIntegrating the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of full‐cell SIB, the Ragone plots are calculated and shown in Figure\xa0. The full‐cell SIB delivers an energy density of 128\xa0Wh kg−1 at 0.15\xa0kW kg−1. The high energy density of 112, 100, and 88\xa0Wh kg−1 are still obtained at the high power density of 1.5, 5.6, and 10.6\xa0kW kg−1. Even the ultrahigh power density increase up to 23 and 30\xa0kW kg−1, the energy density of 58 and 38\xa0Wh kg−1 are achieved. On the basis of a comprehensive literature study among the reported SIBs,[] sodium‐ion capacitors (SICs),[] lithium‐ion capacitors (LICs),[] and electric double‐layer capacitors (EDLCs),[] to the best of our knowledge, the MCMB|Na+‐diglyme|NVP SIB realizes the challenge of achieving a high energy density at an ultrahigh power density.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Among the numerous anode candidates, cobalt‐based phosphides including CoP, Co2P, and CoP2 have received considerable attention because of their diverse morphology, controllable preparation, and high theoretical capacity of 894\xa0mAh\xa0g−1.[] Nevertheless, the intrinsic low conductivity and poor charge transfer kinetics bring about inferior rate capability, and moreover active materials were usually physically mixed with adhesives, which would be easily peeled off from the current collectors in the absence of strong chemical bonding if suffering drastic volume variation and structure collapse after repeated sodiation/desodiation processes, inevitably resulting in rapid capacity decay and thus poor cycling life.[] The exfoliation of electroactive materials from current collectors should be mainly responsible for their heavy loss of electrochemical activity and capacity as well as electrochemical instability during cycling.[]\nTo overcome these hurdles, a common strategy is to downsize cobalt‐based phosphides and to integrate them with a highly conductive carbon matrix like graphene, carbon nanotube, and carbon fiber.[] For instance, a hierarchical CoP nanostructures embedded into N/S‐codoped porous carbon sheets has shown a rate capacity of 162\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 5.0\xa0mA\xa0g−1.[] It also reports a kind of hollow CoP@C composites as anode for SIBs exhibiting excellent cycling stability, retaining 121\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 after 7000 cycles at 1.0\xa0A\xa0g−1.[] In spite of great efforts on improving the sodium‐storage performance of cobalt‐based phosphides, it cannot be considered as satisfactory after evaluating their capacity and long‐term cycling life at a high‐rate current until now. This is mainly caused by the lack of effective and reasonable fabrication of electrode structures and further integration of different functions and synergistic effects between components. Therefore, rational structure design seems indispensible for high electrochemical performance and cycling ability of electrode materials. In general, the traditional fabrication of electrodes cannot work without adhesives to help load electroactive materials onto current collector, however, the inevitable adhesive failure will surely cause serious exfoliation of electroactive materials, resulting in the rapid capacity and stability attenuation, and even the death of a battery.[]\nThe construction of “all in one” 3D hierarchical electrode can effectively solve these aforementioned issues via in\xa0situ growth of electroactive materials on flexible carbon substrates.[] This strategy could help eliminate the utilization of insulated adhesives and provide a good 3D conductive network for transport of electrons, and more importantly avoid the attenuation of electrochemical performance due to the failure of adhesive.[] Moreover, well‐tailored hierarchical nanostructures including nanosheets, nanoneedles, nanofibers, and nanotubes would be more favorable for integral structural stability during the electrochemical process.[] For example, the hierarchical poly(ethylene oxide)‐coated diatomite‐derived Li4.4Si‐Li electrode provided a 3D porous framework with rich transport pathways for electrons/ions and exhibited a rigid mechanical characteristic that could support the entire electrode with a negligible volume change while charging/discharging.[] Besides, the presence of mixed‐valence states is favorable for the electrochemical performance of electroactive materials. A large number of studies have reported that the existence of stable redox couples such as Co3+/Co2+,[] V5+/V4+,[] Fe3+/Fe2+,[] Ce4+/Ce3+,[] Ti4+/Ti3+,[] and Cu2+/Cu+[] in electrode materials could improve electrical conductivity and ability of metal‐ion intercalation/deintercalation. For example, when V5+ in V2O5 nanobelts was partially reduced into V4+, the in\xa0situ formation of V5+/V4+ redox couples resulted in faster ion diffusion, higher electrochemical activity, and electrical conductivity compared to the pristine V2O5. Specifically, the electrical conductivity of V4+–V2O5 (2.86\xa0×\xa010−5\xa0S\xa0cm−1) was at least ten\xa0times higher than that of pristine V2O5 (2.33\xa0×\xa010−6\xa0S\xa0cm−1), and the lithium‐ion diffusion coefficient of V4+–V2O5 (1.53\xa0×\xa010−10\xa0cm2\xa0S−1) was two orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine V2O5 (1.71\xa0×\xa010−12\xa0cm2\xa0S−1).[] Similarily, the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples produced by hydrogenation of TiO2 brought about a very high electrical conductivity of 8\xa0×\xa010−2\xa0S\xa0cm−1 (much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 for 2.2\xa0×\xa010−7\xa0S\xa0cm−1) and an ultrafast exchange rates of lithium ions.[]\nHerein, we have tried to address the abovementioned issues commonly occurring in cobalt phosphides by aid of the mixed‐valence strategy and construction of the “all in one” electrode, hoping to synchronously improve the structure stability and sodium storage performance.

Moreover, the continuous shift of peak position to higher angle with increased x in Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) implies a solid solution over this composition range, and a shrink of crystal size affected by the substitution of B. This observation is in agreement with previous report concerning variations of crystal volume of the B doped Li3V2(PO4)3.\nMoreover, the half‐height width of the peak changes to broaden with the increasing of B contents. The average crystallite sizes of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 with x = 0, 1/10, 1/6, and 1/3 calculated by Scherrer's equation are 205, 110, 80, and 64 nm, respectively, indicate that doping B can prevent the growth of nanoparticles, which is favorable for improving the kinetics of Na+ diffusion in bulk materials. Nevertheless, substantial changes in the B substitution in a Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) procure the formation of impurities of Na2V(PO4)2 while x > 1/2 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The particle size and morphologies of Na3V2P3–xBxO12(0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) were explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure S2, Supporting Information), showing sphere‐like morphologies with similar particle size range of 0.5–2 μm. The high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR‐TEM) images (Figure ) of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 with x = 0 and x = 1/6 shows that both particles are coated uniformly by carbon layer with around 3 nm. It is believed that modification with carbon could endow the Na3V2P3–xBxO12 higher electronic conductivity. Interplanar spacing of 3.7 Å corresponded to the (113) planes of Na3V2(PO4)3.\nAccording to the reports on the ion doping, the incorporation of impurity is more likely to replace those ions which have the similar valence states and the closer ionic radii. Therefore, the boron prefers to substitute phosphorus or vanadium. To explore the effect of B doped Na3V2(PO4)3, a spin‐polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to investigate the crystal structure change while phosphorus or vanadium is replaced by boron. Figure c shows the lowest total energy configuration of Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12, in which boron atom occupies the tetrahedral interstitial site. It can be clearly observed that a small amount of boron doping does not alter the framework of the material (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The corresponding lattice constants before and after doping are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The changes in the lattice parameter of the calculated Na3V2(PO4)3 with reference to the experimental value are less than 2%. The optimization results show that the lattice constant of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) decreases with the increase of boron concentration and a slight deformation of initial rhombohedral structure, which is owing to the smaller ion radius of B3+ (0.27 Å) relative to P5+ (0.38 Å). This is in good agreement with the XRD results. In addition, due to the weaker Coulomb interaction, the strength of the B\uf8ffO bond is weaker than that of the P\uf8ffO bond which can provide larger Na+ diffusion channel. However, the lattice parameter c elongates and volume expands significantly when the boron substitutes vanadium site, which are not conform to the experimental results, indicating that boron prefers to substitute for phosphorus.\nTo identify the local structural change and enhance the comprehension of the shrink of crystal volume affected by B substitute, X‐ray absorption spectra including X‐ray absorption near‐edge structure (XANES) and extend X‐ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were carried out. According to XANES (Figure a) at V K‐edge, the edge of B substituted sample shifts to higher energy compared to pristine sample, indicating a higher oxidation state of V in Na3V2P3‐1/3B1/3O12, which is consistent with the fact that replacing P5+ with aliovalent ion B3+ accompanies partly charge compensation of V in the compound. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) of V 2p further confirms the formation of V4+ (Figure S4, Supporting Information) and demonstrates that boron successfully a substitute for phosphorus as expected. As Park et al. noted, V4+ usually exhibits a short vanadyl V\uf8ffO bond length, which trends toward a distorted VO6 octahedron. XANES spectra at V K‐edge reveal the local environment surrounding V atom. The variation of peak intensity for the samples may be caused by the distortion of VO6 octahedron and other local structural changes after incorporation of B in crystal. Moreover, the V–O distances of the B substituted sample Na3V2P3‐1/3B1/3O12 and pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 determined from the EXAFS data (Figure b) was 1.964 Å and 1.971 Å, suggesting that V–O distances were slightly reduced by substitution of B.\nThe local structure around the doping site was simulated to better understand the variation. As shown in Figure c,d, detail local environment for P and B illustrates that the bond length of B‐O2 (O3, O4) in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 is slightly shorter than that of P‐O2 (O3, O4) in the corresponding position of pure Na3V2(PO4)3, while the bond length of B‐O1 in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 is slightly longer than that of P‐O1 in pure Na3V2(PO4)3, which illustrates the local tetrahedral distortion after B doped Na3V2(PO4)3. In addition, as compared with the undoped samples, the V1\uf8ffO1 and V3\uf8ffO3 bond length of Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 is significantly shortened, while other V\uf8ffO bond length only slight shrinkage (Table S2, Supporting Information), showing the same tendency with the experimental results. For the pure Na3V2(PO4)3 or NaV2(PO4)3, the calculated local magnetic moments of V ion are the same (1.98 or 1.103 μB). However, the calculated local magnetic moment of V1 (1.179 μB) and V3 (1.170 μB) are quite different with other V ion (1.975–1.988 μB) in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12, indicating that the V1 and V3 ions are oxidized when boron substitutes phosphorus. Therefore, the strong Coulomb interaction leads to the shrinkage of V1‐O1 and V3‐O3 when the oxidation state of V1 and V3 changes from V3+ to V4+. The change of local element valence induces the adjacent polyhedron geometry distortion.\nThe effects of substitution on intrinsic electronic conductivity were explored by calculating the density of state of Na3V2P3–xBxO12. The spin up density of states (DOS) of Na3V2(PO4)3 and the projected DOS of atoms as labeled in Figure c are displayed in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. It clearly shows that Na3V2(PO4)3 is a semiconductor with a large band gap of 2.57 eV and the high energy occupied regions in valence band are mainly ascribed to the V‐3d states with little contribution of O‐2p states, while the low energy occupied regions in conduction band are mainly ascribed to the O‐2p states with little contribution of V‐3d states, which are in agreement with the other theoretical calculation result using HSE06 hybrid function. All the V‐3d states and O‐2p states are nearly the same. Due to the larger band gap, the electronic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 is poor, which seriously affects its electrochemical performance. In order to identify the possible electron conduction mechanism after B doping Na3V2(PO4)3, the electronic structures of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (x = 0, 1/6, 1/3) were calculated. The band gap of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (as listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information) decreases with the increase of boron doping due to the occurrence of new boundary states, as shown in Figure a. However, although the band gap of Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 (Eg = 1.633 eV) is significantly narrower than Na3V2(PO4)3, the change is not obvious when continuing to increase the amount of doping. The partial spin up density of states of Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 as presented in Figure b illustrates that the new energy states in the band gap near the bottom of conduction band are mainly ascribed to the 3d states of V1 and V3 atoms, while those near the top of the valence band are mainly ascribed to the 3d states of V2 and V4 atoms. There are two holes when B3+ substituted P5+, which may be transferred to the vicinity of the V1 and V3 atoms and induce the new energy states near the bottom of conduction band. Then the oxidation state of V1 and V3 changes from V3+ to V4+, resulting the VO6 octahedral distortion. The change of the local structure also affects the electronic structure of the adjacent atoms, such as V2 and V4, and the appearance of the new energy states may improve the electrical properties of the materials.\nTo investigate the influence of B substitution on the cycling stability and rate capability of the batteries, half‐cells were tested at various charge/discharge rates in the potential range of 2.5–4.0 V. Figure a compares the rate capability of the Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (x = 0, 1/10, 1/6, 1/3) electrodes at charge–discharge rate increasing from 0.5 to 10 C. All the samples display the similar capacity of 105 mAh g−1 at lower C‐rate of 1 C regardless of B content. However, samples with various B concentration shows distinct improvement of high C‐rate capability above 3 C. Na3V2P3–xBxO12 with x = 1/6 exhibits the highest rate capability, giving remarkable enhanced capacity of 100 and 70 mAh g−1 when the C‐rate increases to 5 C and 10 C, respectively. The flat potential plateau displaying nearly theoretical capacity of 2 Na intercalation/deintercalation at around 3.4 V with weak polarization was observed at 1 C (Figure b). With the increase of C‐rate, Na3V2(PO4)3 delivers the lower capacity and larger potential gap as compared with that of Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12, indicating more severe polarization at higher C‐rate due to sluggish kinetics of electrochemical reaction.\nThe cycling performance of the electrode with B substitution was slightly improved than that of pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (Figure c). Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 maintained 98.4% of the initial discharge capacity after 200 cycles, whereas the Na3V2(PO4)3 retained a lower portion of 97.2% of the initial discharge capacity after the same cycles, exhibiting the similar cycling stability of the electrodes. However, the pronounced discrepancy of cycling stability of the samples was observed at an elevated cycling rate of 5 C. As shown in Figure d, the capacity retention of Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 is 98.7% after 200 cycles, which is much higher than that of pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (91.8%). Capacity retention of the electrodes demonstrates that the electrode with B substitution improves the cycling performance of the battery, especially at higher C‐rate.\nFurther kinetic analysis of the Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (x = 0 and x = 1/6) was performed by cyclic voltammograms (CV). CV curves at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 in potential range of 2.5–4.0 V versus Na+/Na (Figure S6, Supporting Information) show that Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 exhibits a smaller potential polarization between cathodic and anodic peaks than pristine material, indicating weaker electrode polarization and faster ionic migration. With increasing of scan rates from 0.2 to 0.5 mV s−1 (Figure ), slight shifts of potential of oxidation and reduction peaks at fast scan rate further suggest the existence of fast kinetics and weak polarization of the electrochemical reaction for electrode. A linear relationship between peak current (ip/m) and square root of potential scan rate indicates that the electrode reaction would be favored to be a diffusion‐determining step. Diffusion coefficient of Na ions (DNa) can be calculated from the slope of the linear relationship using Randles–Sevcik equation\nThe absolute values of slope for anodic and cathodic peaks of Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 are 48.17 and 47.55, higher than that of pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (36.43 and 33.66) from the linear fitting results. Therefore, the DNa is ≈1.7 and 1.9 times higher in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 than those in pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 for anodic and cathodic process, respectively. Fast kinetics properties can be attributed to the enhanced ionic and electronic conductivities of the materials after B substitution.\nNa3V2(PO4)3 has two Na ion positions, namely Na1 and Na2, along the conduction channels and there are two typical ion transport pathways in the NASICON structure, namely Na2‐Na1‐Na2 and Na2‐Na2. In order to figure out the effect of doping on ionic conduction, the Na ion hopping barriers along the path of Na2‐Na1 and Na2‐Na2 in Na3V2P3‐xBxO12 (x = 0 and x = 1/6) were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method. The distances of neighboring Na1‐Na2 (3.315 Å) and Na2‐Na2 (4.358 Å) near the doping site in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 are shorter than those in Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.416 Å, 4.472 Å) respectively; however, the distances of Na1‐Na2 and Na2‐Na2 far from the doping site in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 are nearly the same as those in Na3V2(PO4)3. The diffusion trajectory in Na3V2(PO4) and the corresponding migration energy barriers for Na ion near the doping site along the path of Na2‐Na1 and Na2‐Na2 in Na3V2P3‐xBxO12 (x = 0 and x = 1/6) are plotted in Figure . In pathway 1 and pathway 2, the Na ions diffuse through a bottleneck triangle and the migration trajectory are parallel to the two nearest VO6 octahedral due to the strong electrostatic repulsion between V and Na ions (Figure a,b). Although the activation energy along Na2–Na2 (0.396 eV) is lower than that of Na2–Na1 (0.43 eV), the distance of Na2–Na2 is relative longer. The diffusion routes of Na ion in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 are similar to that in Na3V2(PO4)3. As discussed above, the shrinkage of tetrahedral of the doping site and the distortion of adjacent octahedral after B doping Na3V2(PO4) may lead to a larger diffusion path. The energy barriers of Na ion in Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 along Na2‐Na1 (0.347 eV) and Na2‐Na2 (0.282 eV) are lower than that in Na3V2(PO4)3 (Figure c,d), indicating that Na ion is more likely to migrate after B substituted P as a result of the shorter distance of Na1–Na2 and Na2–Na2 and the larger diffusion channel induced by the local structure distortion.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The plane‐wave basis set was determined with a cutoff energy of 520 eV and the k‐point sampling of Brillouin‐zone integrals used a 2 × 2 × 1 Gamma grid. The simplified rotationally invariant approach introduced by Dudarev to the Hubbard model corrections was used with a U‐J parameter of 4.2 eV for vanadium atom, whereas the correction was not used for the other species. The U value of vanadium is a little higher than the experimental formation enthalpy of vanadium oxides as there are high inductive effects in vanadium phosphates. The calculations were performed in a rhombohedral chemical cell consisting 6‐f.u. Na3V2(PO4)3 and a sodium‐ordered form was chosen in our models which had been demonstrated in other literatures. Different boron substitution positions of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (x = 1/6 and x = 2/6) and Na3V2‐1/6B1/6(PO4)3 were calculated, and the lowest energy structure was selected. The Na+‐ion hopping barriers were obtained using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method, which can determine the pathway for structure changes efficiently.\nSample Preparation: The NASICON structured Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) was synthesized by a sol–gel process and followed by solid‐state reaction. Typically, 2 mmol NH4VO3 and 4 mmol citric acid were added to 70 mL deionized water maintaining at 80 °C with continuous stirring to obtain a clear solution, and then stoichiometric amount of Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4, and H3BO3 were added. After evaporation of water at 80 °C, the solution transforms from sol to gel. The gel was dried in an oven at 150 °C for 4 h, and heat‐treated at 400 °C for 5 h under nitrogen atmosphere to remove CO2, H2O, and NH3. Afterward, the powder was grounded and annealed at 800 °C under Ar flow for 12 h to produce the final compound.\nStructure Characterization: X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as prepared samples were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the materials was observed by Hitachi S‐4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE‐SEM). High resolution transmission electron microscope (HR‐TEM) images were taken on a JEOLJEM‐2010F microscope (JEOL, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was measured at the V k‐edge, at 12‐BM at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne national laboratory.\nElectrochemical Characterization: The work electrode was prepared by coating a mixture of 80 wt% Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), 10 wt% PVDF and 10 wt% Super P onto Al current collector. The electrode was then dried at 120 °C in vacuum for 12 h. The test cells were assembled into coin cell in an argon‐filled glovebox. Sodium metal foil was used as the counter electrode and a glass fiber filter (Whatman) was used as the separator.

The plane‐wave basis set was determined with a cutoff energy of 520 eV and the k‐point sampling of Brillouin‐zone integrals used a 2 × 2 × 1 Gamma grid. The simplified rotationally invariant approach introduced by Dudarev to the Hubbard model corrections was used with a U‐J parameter of 4.2 eV for vanadium atom, whereas the correction was not used for the other species. The U value of vanadium is a little higher than the experimental formation enthalpy of vanadium oxides as there are high inductive effects in vanadium phosphates. The calculations were performed in a rhombohedral chemical cell consisting 6‐f.u. Na3V2(PO4)3 and a sodium‐ordered form was chosen in our models which had been demonstrated in other literatures. Different boron substitution positions of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (x = 1/6 and x = 2/6) and Na3V2‐1/6B1/6(PO4)3 were calculated, and the lowest energy structure was selected. The Na+‐ion hopping barriers were obtained using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method, which can determine the pathway for structure changes efficiently.\nSample Preparation: The NASICON structured Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) was synthesized by a sol–gel process and followed by solid‐state reaction. Typically, 2 mmol NH4VO3 and 4 mmol citric acid were added to 70 mL deionized water maintaining at 80 °C with continuous stirring to obtain a clear solution, and then stoichiometric amount of Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4, and H3BO3 were added. After evaporation of water at 80 °C, the solution transforms from sol to gel. The gel was dried in an oven at 150 °C for 4 h, and heat‐treated at 400 °C for 5 h under nitrogen atmosphere to remove CO2, H2O, and NH3. Afterward, the powder was grounded and annealed at 800 °C under Ar flow for 12 h to produce the final compound.\nStructure Characterization: X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as prepared samples were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the materials was observed by Hitachi S‐4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE‐SEM). High resolution transmission electron microscope (HR‐TEM) images were taken on a JEOLJEM‐2010F microscope (JEOL, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was measured at the V k‐edge, at 12‐BM at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne national laboratory.\nElectrochemical Characterization: The work electrode was prepared by coating a mixture of 80 wt% Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), 10 wt% PVDF and 10 wt% Super P onto Al current collector. The electrode was then dried at 120 °C in vacuum for 12 h. The test cells were assembled into coin cell in an argon‐filled glovebox. Sodium metal foil was used as the counter electrode and a glass fiber filter (Whatman) was used as the separator. A 1 m solution of NaClO4 in EC/DMC (1:1 by volume) was prepared and used as the electrolyte. The charge/discharge, C‐rate capacity and cycling ability of cells were recorded on a LAND battery test system. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were performed using a CHI 440A instrument (CHI Instrument Inc.) at a scanning rate from 0.2 to 0.6 mV s−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

For comparison, a sample that was created without the nitrogen‐doped graphene oxide‐wrapping was denoted as VN/C. The detailed processes for the two samples are summarized in the experimental section. To obtain the precise phase constituents and atomic arrangements, synchrotron radiation powder diffraction was employed. Figure\u2005\u2009a shows the low Rietveld refinement results on the obtained powder diffraction pattern of the VN/C@NGO sample with a low‐weighted profile R‐factor (Rwp=5.19\u2009%). All the peaks are well fitted with two detected phases, the main phase of Na3V(PO3)3N (blue bars) and the Na3V2(PO4)3 impurity phase (green bars). According to the final refinement results of both VN/C@NGO and VN/C samples, the proportion of Na3V2(PO4)3 are 2.98\u2009% and 2.16\u2009% by weight, respectively. The trace amount of Na3V2(PO4)3 seems inevitable even after adding a sufficient amount of ascorbic acid as reducing agent, which was also mentioned in previous work. The sample can be indexed to the cubic symmetry within the space group P213 (a=9.4490(1)\u2005Å), which is very rare in polyanionic systems. Within the 3D robust framework, the [V(PO3)3N] units along the a‐axis each consist of one VO6 octahedron and three (PO3)N tetrahedra, and all the (PO3)N tetrahedra are corner‐sharing with respect to the VO6 octahedra through O atoms (insets in Figure\u2005\u2009a). The N atoms are shared with three (PO3)N tetrahedra, resulting in a strong inductive effect towards adjacent V atoms.\nThe VN/C sample also exhibited good crystallinity with the symmetric of P213 (as shown in Figure\u2005S2). The detailed summarized atomic site information for VN/C@NGO and VN/C samples can be found in Table\u2005S1 and Table\u2005S2, respectively. A schematic of the specially designed carbon matrix of the VN/C@NGO sample is shown in Figure\u2005\u2009b. The carbon matrix can enhance the electron transport and the doped N on graphene oxide can provide extra bonding sites for bulk materials. Figure\u2005S3 shows the paramagnetic properties of the field‐dependent magnetization curve (M–H) and the temperature‐dependence of the magnetic susceptibility ((M/H–T) and the inverse magnetic susceptibility (χ−1–T) of the VN/C@NGO sample, probing the spin state of V. The calculated value for the effective magnetic moment (μeff) is 4.67\u2005μB\u2009V−1 per formula unit, which is close to theoretical value of 4.50\u2005μB\u2009V−1 per formula unit for the high‐spin V3+ state (d2, t2g2, S=0).\nThe carbon contents of the VN/C@NGO and VN/C samples were measured to be 5.54\u2009% and 4.34\u2009%, respectively (Figure\u2005S4). Further characterizations were carried out with X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Figure\u2005\u2009c,d shows the surface chemical compositions of the V and N elements. There are almost no obvious differences for V 2p1/2 and 2p2/3, and their bonding energies are close to the theoretical values for trivalent vanadium. Pyridinic N and graphitic N contribute to the N 1s spectra of both samples, and the peak intensity of VN/C@NGO is higher than that of VN/C, indicating that the nitrogen concentration on the surface is increased by introducing the N‐doped graphene oxide. The Raman spectrum in the range from 100\u2005cm−1 to 2100\u2005cm−1 is displayed in Figure\u2005\u2009e. The observed small bands located at 151.73\u2005cm−1 and 353.88\u2005cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching/bending vibrations of (PO3)N tetrahedra, while bands at 493.33\u2005cm−1, 619.76\u2005cm−1, and 1059.65\u2005cm−1 can be considered as the bending/stretching motions of the VO6 octahedra. The intensity ratio of the D band (ID) to the G band (IG) of VN/C@NGO is slightly higher than that of VN/C. The D band normally reflects the defects, edges, and structural disorder, while the G band commonly represent the E2g mode of sp2 carbon layers. This phenomenon indicates that the N‐doped GO possesses more defects, which can favour the electron conductivity as well as possible bonding sites. Additionally, from the FTIR spectra in Figure\u2005S5, both symmetric and asymmetric bending/stretching modes of the tetrahedra and octahedra can be found near 1000\u2005cm−1.\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images are shown in Figure\u2005 and Figure\u2005S6 for both samples. Figure\u2005\u2009f,g clearly shows the wrapped N‐dope graphene oxide on as‐obtained Na3V(PO3)3N particles with an average size of 1\u2005μm. The morphology of VN/C samples is shown in Figure\u2005S6\u2009a,b. The carbon layer is uniformly coated on both VN/C@NGO and VN/C particles (Figure\u2005\u2009h and Figure\u2005S6\u2009c) with thickness around 3–5\u2005nm. The closely wrapped N‐doped GO also can be observed near the particles, and its thickness was measured to be 2–3\u2005nm on average (Figure\u2005S7). The (110) and (310) lattice planes were measured and confirmed for the VN/C@NGO and VN/C samples, respectively. The insets in Figure\u2005\u2009h and Figure\u2005S6\u2009d are the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, implying that well‐crystallized structures of both samples were obtained with space group of P213. From the high angle annular dark field (HAADF)‐STEM images in Figure\u2005\u2009i and Figure\u2005S6\u2009d, the lattice fringes of both samples can be clearly observed with the identified atom arrangements represented above. The STEM‐based energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping results for both samples are displayed in Figure\u2005\u2009j and Figure\u2005S6\u2009e, respectively, where the elements Na, V, P, O, N, and C coexist and are uniformly distributed, which is in satisfactory agreement with the refined powder diffraction data. The element N is also homogeneously distributed on the graphene oxide, indicating the proposed N‐doped graphene oxide was well‐prepared.\nThe electrochemical performances of both the VN/C and the VN/C@NGO samples were examined in coin cells with Na metal as the counter electrode. The electrolyte used in this paper consisted of 1\u2009m NaClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC, 1:1 by volume with 5\u2005vol.\u2009% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as additive agent). The loading mass was controlled to be ca. 2.5\u2005mg\u2009cm−2 for all electrochemical tests. The Na3V(PO3)3N material shows a typical 4\u2005V class working platform, as shown in Figure\u2005\u2009a. The initial cycle Coulombic efficiency is around 80\u2009%, which is possibly due to the pre‐oxidation of vanadium in this nitrogen‐containing system, which will be analysed and discussed later. The VN/C@NGO electrode can deliver specific capacities of 78.9\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 0.1\u2005C (1\u2005C=80\u2005mA\u2009g−1) and 59.2\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 30\u2005C without any obvious large polarization (Figure\u2005\u2009b). The polarization of the VN/C electrode is slightly larger but remains acceptable. Excellent rate capabilities of both samples are demonstrated in Figure\u2005\u2009c, which are entirely comparable with the known NASICON‐structured polyanionic materials, such as the well‐studied Na3V2(PO4)3. The inset in Figure\u2005\u2009c presents the cyclability of both samples at low current density (0.1\u2005C) for 100 cycles, and almost no capacity drops were observed. In addition, the long‐term cyclability of both electrodes was also measured at both 1\u2005C (800 cycles) and 10\u2005C rates (5000 cycles), and capacity retention of 91.0\u2009% and 75.9\u2009% could be achieved, respectively. Notably, there is almost no mid‐voltage decay within 800 cycles, which is very important for maintaining the overall energy density retention in practical use. The VN/C electrode shows similar trends of capacity degradation in these cycling tests, indicating that the N‐doped GO is the only reason for the electrochemical discrepancy. We further examined the electrode after 5000 cycles, and no obvious cracks were observed, while the lattice fringes of the (110) plane could still be clearly observed. The SAED pattern also shows the well‐crystallized structure, and all the detected elements, C, Na, V, P, O and N, are homogeneously distributed (Figure\u2005S8), indicating the robustness of the framework even after a thousand cycles of sodium de‐/insertion. In Figure\u2005\u2009f, we compare all the vanadium‐based polyanionic cathode materials regarding their cyclability, working potential, and corresponding capacities for SIBs. The Na3V(PO3)3N material presented in this work has a high‐voltage platform and balanced cycling stability, although its current achievable capacity is relatively low due to the restricted electrolyte voltage window. The potential for a second sodium de‐/insertion is calculated to be around or above 5\u2005V, which is far beyond the stable voltage window of current commercial electrolytes.\nThe cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves for the initial five cycles of VN/C@NGO electrode are exhibited in Figure\u2005\u2009g. Unlike those alluaudite‐type polyanions, this Na3V(PO3)3N material does not show any changes in the cation arrangement or phase in the initial cycle, which is favourable for long‐term cycling stability with only a very small volume change. No significant difference can be found between the pristine electrodes of VN/C@NGO and VN/C in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results; but after one cycle, the interface resistance of VN/C@NGO showed a large decline, which can be attributed to the formation of the solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (Figure\u2005S9). The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was carried out in a coin cell after reaching its thermal equilibrium (10 cycles; Figure\u2005\u2009h). A solid‐solution reaction mechanism can be recognised based on the one‐electron transfer process. Sodium diffusion coefficients for VN/C@NGO were calculated based on the GITT results and are shown in the inset in Figure\u2005\u2009h within the main range from 10−13 to 10−11\u2005cm2\u2009s−1, which is comparable to those of well‐known NASICON‐type materials. The details for this calculation can be found in Figure\u2005S10. Furthermore, the capacitance contribution was calculated from a series of different CV scan rates (Figure\u2005S11). It provides convincing evidence that both the faradic and non‐faradic processes always coexist during cycling and that they both have positive effects on the ultimate electrochemical performance. The faradic process (oxidation/reduction reaction) can provide a fixed working potential, while the non‐faradic process can help the fast charge transitions related to the double‐layer effect (normally regarded as pseudocapacitance). The capacitance contribution is shown in Figure\u2005\u2009i (22.3\u2009% of the total current) with the values for the b parameter around 0.70 with four identified redox peaks. This can be considered as another key factor behind the excellent electrochemical performance of VN/C@NGO electrode.\nWe further tested the air stability and all‐climate performances of Na3V(PO3)3N material with a view towards its real applications. We first prepared a Na3V(PO3)3N//hard carbon full cell, and the results are shown in Figure\u2005\u2009a,b. The hard carbon was purchased from KURARAY Co., Ltd., Japan (Type 2), and both the capacity and current density values are based on the anode part. An initial reversible specific capacity of ca. 200\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 could be achieved at a current density of 100\u2005mA\u2009g−1 in the voltage window of 1.5–4.0\u2005V. Capacity retention of 80\u2009% was achieved after 150 cycles with high Coulombic efficiency near 100\u2009%. Since the initial cycle Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of hard carbon is relatively low, the anodes in the full cell were pre‐cycled. From Figure\u2005\u2009c, it can be seen that the VN/C@NGO samples that were subjected to air exposure and high‐temperature showed no obvious difference (90.3\u2009% and 86.4\u2009%, respectively), while the low‐temperature one showed more stable cycling performance but lower specific capacity (92.3\u2009%). The C‐rate performances in Figure\u2005\u2009d show the similar tendencies. The satisfactory high/low‐temperature properties cannot be achieved without the sturdy framework of its 3D open polyanionic cubic structure as well as 3D sodium diffusion pathways, which will be explored and discussed later. From the results above, it can be deduced that this Na3V(PO3)3N material can work under different conditions, which is very promising for real applications of SIBs in the commercial market. We further examined the details of the fresh sample and the air‐exposed sample to gain a deeper understanding of air stability properties. We first employed STEM to obtain the crystal details. Figure\u2005S12 shows that the air‐exposed VN/C@NGO sample maintained good crystallinity and a uniform carbon layer as well. The SAED pattern also exhibits a single‐phase crystalline character. In addition, the STEM‐EDS mapping results indicate that all the relevant elements remain homogeneously distributed. In Figure\u2005\u2009e,f, the V 2p and N 1s XPS spectra were deconvoluted, and it was found that there was no significant discrepancy or shift in position between the fresh and the air exposed samples, which means that the surface chemical surroundings are almost the same for both samples. Furthermore, we immersed the Na3V(PO3)3N material in water for 1\u2005h with ultrasonication to test its solubility. To our surprise, the water immersed sample still showed high crystallinity (as shown in Figure\u2005\u2009g) with very good Rietveld refinement results except for a trace amount of unknown phase (as illustrated in the inset in Figure\u2005\u2009g). We also employed STEM to determine the reasons for these observations. It can be seen in Figure\u2005S13 that the NGO was removed by ultrasonication and that the Na3V(PO3)3N material is insoluble, although phase segregation can be observed in the HAADF image. It is possible that the phase transition on the surface may have hindered more crystal change in the bulk, although the generated new phase is currently unknown. The SAED and EDS data demonstrate that the whole material is still crystalline even after being immersed in water for 1\u2005h. Its water stability is quite uncommon in the case of pyrophosphates, which usually suffer from surface electrochemical degeneration. This phenomenon also indicates that the P−N bond is highly hybridized in Na3V(PO3)3N and can be possibly used in other types of polyanionic materials. Therefore, this material is worthy of being investigated as a cathode material for aqueous SIB systems as well.\nIn order to obtain more precise phase‐transition and valence‐variation information, both in\u2005situ synchrotron‐based XRD patterns and X‐ray absorption spectra (XAS) were collected at the Australian Synchrotron and the P64 beamline at DESY, Germany, respectively. The wavelength was changed manually to 1.5406\u2005Å for more visual comparison. A whole pattern over the full range from 5° to 90° (λ=1.5406\u2005Å) is shown in Figure\u2005S14. From Figure\u2005\u2009a–c, it can be seen that this material almost underwent a zero‐strain phase change during the initial cycle. Major reflections such as 110, 111, and 201 were easily identified and showed almost no shifts during charge and discharge. From the 2D contour plot, almost imperceptible peak shifts were observed and measured. The TEM and HRTEM images of fully charged and fully discharged Na3V(PO3)3N electrode are displayed in Figure\u2005\u2009d–g. Lattice fringes for the (201), (111), and (200) planes are clearly observed and identified, indicating that the high crystallinity is well maintained throughout all the electrochemical procedures. The remaining Na+ ions in the crystal structure (around 67\u2009%) can be regarded as the key factor for the zero‐strain process. Kang's group previously explained that the reduced electrostatic attraction created by larger vacant Na1 sites can compete with the shrinking V−O bonds. Additionally, the unusual cubic symmetry can prevent possible cation displacements. We carefully measured the very small crystal parameter and volume changes, and a total 0.40\u2009% volume change was identified, which is negligible compared to other types of cathode materials (Figure\u2005\u2009h,i). This zero‐strain topotactic single‐phase transition of Na3V(PO3)3N electrode is interesting and will be investigated further. Furthermore, in\u2005situ X‐ray absorption near‐edge structure (XANES) spectra are exhibited in Figure\u2005\u2009j–l. V2O3, VO2, and V2O5 were used as references for the valences of V3+, V4+, and V5+, respectively. The 2D contour plot of the normalized XANES spectra shows obvious reversible variations in the valence of V around 5510\u2005eV in the illustrated cycles. Figure\u2005\u2009k shows the XANES spectra shifting towards higher energy during charge and shifting towards lower energy during discharge, which demonstrates the excellent valence reversibility of V in Na3V(PO3)3N material. We carefully examined and simulated the valence of V during the 1st cycle charge and discharge processes, and we found that the valence of V changes with ca. V3.2+/V4.2+, not as the supposed V3+/V4+ redox. This finding provides a good explanation for the relatively low ICE of Na3V(PO3)3N illustrated in Figure\u2005\u2009a. The same phenomenon was observed by Reynaud et\u2005al. and Zhang et\u2005al. previously, indicating that the relative low ICE is largely due to the pre‐oxidation of V from +3 in the initial charge process. Moreover, the pre‐edge of the V K‐edge during charging also exhibits discernible variation with reversible peak shifts, although the pre‐edge peaks are not similar to those in the references, which can be ascribed to the different fingerprint information on VO6 octahedra. In Figure\u2005\u2009m, we also employed the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) technique to probe the valence variations of V. The areas for the EELS tests are displayed in Figure\u2005S15. It was found that corresponding shifts of the V‐L3 edge occur from 520.57\u2005eV to 519. 77\u2005eV, which indicates charge compensation in the 3d orbital of V. No variations of the N K‐edge were found, meaning that the strongly hybridized N atoms were not involved in the electrochemical reactions. The XPS results in Figure\u2005S16 also confirmed similar conclusions to those observed in the EELS tests. The full theoretical specific capacity of Na3V(PO3)3N is expected to be achieved with significant breakthroughs in high‐voltage durable electrolytes since the V4+/V5+ redox couple was not fully involved.\nIn order to fully understand the intrinsic properties of the unique cubic structure that possesses excellent C‐rate performance, a DFT study was employed to probe the migration energy barriers of Na+ within different Na+ ion types. We first found that the 12\u2009Na+ ions in a single crystal unit can be divided into three different types, based on their individual binding energies (namely A, B, and C types). The details for the three types of Na+ ions and the corresponding calculation method are shown in Table\u2005S3. In Figure\u2005\u2009a,b, various images of Na3V(PO3)3N material with three different types of Na+ ions are displayed. Sodium diffusion between the same types of Na+ ion is possible except for the A‐to‐A type since the O atom will block the pathway. The energy barriers to sodium diffusions between B‐to‐B and C‐to‐C types are all below 0.5\u2005eV according to calculations. The B‐to‐B type along the c direction has the lowest energy barrier and shortest diffusion distance, so that this type is likely to be first extracted during the charging process. Then, we performed the calculations between different types of Na+ ions, which are equivalent to 3D diffusion pathways because the a, b, and c orientations are all involved (Figure\u2005\u2009c–e). From Figure\u2005\u2009f, it can be seen that the energy barriers are all below 1.1\u2005eV, which are all highly active diffusion pathways for Na3V(PO3)3N material, providing solid evidence for this newly recognized NASICON‐type structure with 3D sodium diffusion pathways. Additionally, according to a previous report, the Na3V(PO3)3N material possesses high ionic conductivity, which is of the same order as well‐recognized NASICON‐type Na3V2(PO4)3 at various temperatures. The vibrational density of states results presented in Figure\u2005S17 for this Na3V(PO3)3N material also indicate the highly mobility of sodium ions at 1–10\u2005THz (equivalent to 40–400\u2005K), which agrees well with the all‐climate performance reported in Figure\u2005. Considering the high‐voltage platform, long‐term cycling stability, outstanding C‐rate capability, and all‐climate performance, we believe that this newly recognized NASICON‐type Na3V(PO3)3N material is a highly competitive candidate for real application in SIBs in large‐scale EESs with the potential to reach even higher energy density once the electrolyte can sustain wider voltage windows in the near future.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The ground state is a thermodynamically stable phase, and the pseudo‐ground state is an unstable or metastable phase. For NC, the formation energy diagram shows that the stability increases for the value below x=0.50–0.58, and further desodition leads to a thermodynamic instability. For NCRT, the formation energy reveals that the increase in stability is still observed for a value below x=0.67. These results imply that the desodiated NCRT at x=0.67 is thermodynamically more stable than NC. The atomic structures of NC with x=0, 0.25, and 0.67 are presented in Figure\u2005. The desodiated structure at x=0.25 shows that the vacancy sites are observed in each Na layer, which can be deemed as a random Na‐extraction reaction derived from only Cr in the TM layer and Cr participates in the charge compensation. However, that at x=0.67 interestingly shows that the empty Na layer with fully desodiated layer (denoted as Na‐free layer) between the CrO2 layers is formed. In the random desodiation process, the oxidation of Cr in one TM layer does induce the extraction of sodium from the adjacent two sodium layers, while the sodium in two adjacent layers does not always extract the same amount. Therefore, the homogeneous oxidation of Cr in the two adjacent TM layers will induce one sodium layer to extract more sodium than the adjacent two sodium layers, until the formation of Na‐free layer and subsequent Cr migration. This results in the thermodynamic severe instability accompanying by the severe Cr‐migration to the Na layers.\nTaking geometric point of view into considerations, Figure\u2005 likewise illustrates the desodiated structures of NCRT with x=0, 0.33, and 0.67, and their TM layers contain the mixed layer including CrO6, RuO6, and TiO6 octahedrons and the Cr‐rich layers. The detailed Ru and Ti positions are shown in Figure\u2005S1. Intriguingly, the desodiated structure at x=0.33 indicates that vacancy sites are present nearby the mixed layers. This can be deemed as a selective desodiation reaction, which likely stems from different cationic redox potentials and are in contrast to the desodiation mechanism for NC. In general, 4d‐based cation redox reactions occur in lower voltage window than 3d‐based ones in layered oxides for SIBs and LIBs (herein, Ru4+/Ru5+ versus Cr3+/Cr4+). Along this line, we can surmise that the Na related to the Ru redox reaction are first extracted from the host material and the inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru‐contained TM layers. In addition, the desodiated NCRT at x=0.67 shows the presence of Na in all Na layers without the Na‐free layer.\nTo unlock the origin of the selective desodiation mechanism and the all‐layer‐stacked Na under high desodiated state, the electronic structures of TM (Cr, Ru and Ti) in the mixed layer of NCRT was investigated. Figure\u2005 and Figure\u2005S2a shows the combined graphs of partial density of states (PDOSs) of the TM nd‐electron (n=3 or 4) at x=0.17 and x=0.67 in NCRT. The PDOSs of Ru 4d‐electron at x=0.17 indicate an electronic structure of Ru4+ having a redox capable electron (t2g4) and the Ru(t2g)‐band is present in the higher energy states (−1.0≤E−Ef≤0) than the Cr(t2g)‐band (−2.0≤E−Ef≤−1.0), which imply that a single cation redox reaction of Ru4+/Ru5+ first occurs because of the low‐lying Cr 3d‐electron, relatively. It indicates that these different t2g‐band positions lead to the selective desodiation mechanism of NCRT as compared NC. The PDOSs of Ti 3d‐electron unquestionably show a Ti4+ electronic configuration in the octahedral complex, implying that there is no redox capable Ti 3d‐electron to compensate charge balance. For a better understanding, we calculated spatial electron distribution in the mixed layer based on the three‐divided occupied bands: i) −1.0≤E−Ef≤0, ii) −2.0≤E−Ef≤−1.0, iii) −3.0≤E−Ef≤−2.0, as illustrated in Figure\u2005 and Figure\u2005S2b. It is obvious that the hybridized Ru(4d)‐O(2p) electron is present in the first occupied band range, whereas there is no the Cr(3d)‐O(2p) electron densities. In the second occupied band range, the Cr\u20053d‐electron hybridized with the O\u20052p‐electron is strikingly observed. As shown in the PDOSs of Ti, the spatial electron density in the final region unambiguously reveals non‐existence of Ti 3d‐electron unhybridized with O\u20052p‐electron (i.e., lone‐pair O). These results imply that the first contributing species for charge compensation mechanism is the cationic redox reaction via the Ru(4d)‐O(2p). Based on the concrete understanding on the desodiation mechanism, we suggest that a well distributed mixed layer in NCRT plays a crucial role in suppressing the formation of Na‐free layer and alleviating subsequent crystal structure collapse and TM migration.\n\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The CuS crystal structure along [110] crystallographic direction and uniformly distributed Cu and S elements are observed. Considering that direct addition of Cu cations into the electrolyte will cause displacement reaction with sodium metal and affect the surface properties of sodium, Cu current collector is used to introduce Cu cations on the electrode surface. Electrochemical performance of CuS as anode in the SIBs was conducted via assembling with Cu (CuFG) and Ti (TiFG) current collectors, respectively, in 1\u2005M NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte. As shown in Figure\u2005, CuFG displays high initial discharge and charge capacities of 567.4 and 535.7\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 94.4\u2009% at 0.4\u2005C, higher than that of TiFG (80.5\u2009%). In addition, according to discharge curve at 2nd cycle, TiFG suffers from high electrochemical polarization, leading to lower reduction potential, and no conversion reaction occurs. It can be concluded that CuFG and TiFG play an important role for SEI property. The peaks of 1.90, 1.54, and 0.96\u2005V in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Figure\u2005S3) can be assigned as sodium ions insertion into the CuS lattice, resulting in the formation of NaxCuS. While, the peak at 0.5–1.0\u2005V belongs to the formation process of SEI.\nCuFG displays an excellent cycling stability (507.0\u2005mAh\u2009g−1) over 400\u2005cycles at 1.0\u2005C without capacity decay, and the average coulombic efficiency (CE) is around 100\u2009% (Figure\u2005). In comparison, TiFG retains only 26.7\u2009% of the initial capacity (354.6\u2005mAh\u2009g−1) after 400\u2005cycles. For CuFG, although particle fracture and breakage occur from the SEM images of CuS after 1, 2, 5, 10\u2005cycles (Figure\u2005S4), high average CE (99.4\u2009%) during initial 10\u2005cycle still demonstrates little electrolyte consumption and ultrathin SEI. This result further explains increasing capacity for initial 100\u2005cycles due to adequate reaction depth. The charge/discharge and dQ/dV curves of CuFG are almost coincident at 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400th cycle, demonstrating its high reaction reversibility (Figure\u2005, S5a and S5b). After experiencing 7000\u2005cycles, the specific capacity only decreases to 402.8\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 and its capacity retention attains 100\u2009% (Figure\u2005). In addition, CuFG performs superior rate performance that the discharge capacities are 543.4, 513.6, 501.0, 497.3, 489.0 and 461.5\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at the current densities of 0.2\u2005C, 0.4\u2005C, 1.0\u2005C, 2.0\u2005C, 4.0\u2005C and 10\u2005C, respectively. The charge‐discharge profiles of CuFG at 10\u2005C still deliver stable charge/discharge plateaus and slightly increased overpotential (Figure\u2005S5c). Compared with reported anode in SIBs (Table\u2005S1), CuFG performs excellent rate‐performance and a peerless advantage in cycling stability, which is attributed to its high interfacial stability and reaction kinetics.\nCuFG also displays excellent low‐temperature performance with high reversible capacities of 495, 490, 381, and 314\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 0, −20, −40 and −50\u2009°C (Figure\u2005). Even at −50\u2009°C, the reversible capacity at 5\u2005C still retains 67.4\u2009% compared with that at 0.1\u2005C (Figure\u2005S6). In order to illustrate its practical application, the full cell is assembled with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode (Figure\u2005S7). CuS||NVPF full cell delivers the discharge capacities of 389, 309, 274.2, 255.8, 243.7\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0\u2005C, respectively. Relative energy density and power density are 116\u2005Wh\u2009kg−1 and 166.7\u2005W\u2009kg−1, respectively. In addition, it affords a high specific capacity about 248.1\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 after 140\u2005cycles with capacity retention of 71.47\u2009% (Figure\u2005 and ).\nThe reason why CuFG could enhance the electrochemical performance is revealed from the bulk reaction to the interfacial chemistry. In situ and ex situ X‐ray diffraction examines the reaction mechanism of CuFG during cycling process (Figure\u2005S8). Upon discharging, the [103], [110] peaks of CuS gradually disappears accompanied by the appearance of [221] and [321] peaks of Na3(CuS)4. When discharging to 0.4\u2005V, [220] peak of Na2S can be detected. Relative redox reaction corresponds to: 4\u2009CuS+3\u2009Na++3\u2009e−→Na3(CuS)4, Na3(CuS)4+5\u2009Na++5\u2009e−→4\u2009Cu+4\u2009Na2S. Upon charging, the reverse process occurs: Na3(CuS)4 and CuS with low crystalline regenerates, suggesting complete conversion reaction. The above reaction mechanism of CuFG is consistent with that of CuS in the reported literature. Thus, it can be concluded that enhanced cycling stability is mainly resulting from the interfacial difference.\nFirstly, the chemical stability of Cu current collector is carried out. It is discovered that corrosion of electrolyte will lead to micro dissolution of Cu current collector (Figure\u2005). Cu current collector is immersed into NaSO3CF3/DGM electrolyte for different times of 0, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 72\u2005h (Figure\u2005). Then trace amount of neocuproine chromogenic agent is added, and color of solvent becomes yellow. The longer the standing time of Cu current collector, the darker color of the solution. And the positive zeta potentials for Cu current collector in the electrolyte further suggests dissolution of Cu+ (Figure\u2005). Above results indicate Cu+ gradually dissolves into the electrolyte as time goes on because Cu+ only reacts with neocuproine to form yellow complexes. Moreover, ultraviolet‐visible absorption spectroscopy analysis is used for quantitative analysis of Cu+ content with Cu small disc of 13\u2005mm diameter. An obvious absorption peak is located in the 450\u2005nm for standard Cu+ solution with different concentrations (Figure\u2005S9a). According to fitting curve between peak intensity and Cu+ concentration (Figure\u2005S9b), obtained 0.07\u2005mol\u2009L−1 Cu+ can dissolve into the electrolyte after 72\u2005h (Figure\u2005).\nThe chemical environment of Cu+ in the electrolyte is characterized by magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. No color change is observed when Cu current collector is only immersed into DGM solvent, indicating the salt of NaSO3CF3 plays an important role in the corrosion of Cu current collector (Figure\u2005S9c). Compared with 19F NMR spectrum of NaSO3CF3/DGM electrolyte, an obvious chemical shift (Figure\u2005) after adding Cu current collector can be detected, and no peak shift is observed in 17O NMR and 1H spectra (Figure\u2005S10) revealing F‐containing functional group (Figure\u2005) in the NaSO3CF3 leads to corrosion of Cu current collector in the electrolyte due to its electron rich property. In addition, coordination environments of Na and Cu were also investigated by MD simulations (Figure\u2005). The electrolytes of 1\u2005M NaSO3CF3/DGM exhibit average coordination numbers 2.06 DGM and 0.10 SO3CF3− per Na+ in its solvation shell of 5\u2005Å by analyzing the radial distribution function (RDF) (Figure\u2005). And 5\u2005Å solvation structure of Cu+ contains 1.75 DGM and 0.55 SO3CF3− in the Cu++NaSO3CF3/DGM electrolyte (Figure\u2005). Calculated results suggest that SO3CF3− anion replaces the solvent molecules to participate in primary solvation shell for solvation structure of Cu+, indicating that anions can be easily dragged into EDL along with Cu+. In addition, the Cu[DGM]2[SO3CF3] performs lower LUMO energy level than Cu[DGM]2[SO3CF3] via DFT calculation, demonstrating its preferential decomposition to form final SEI (Figure\u2005).\nThe formed EDL on the electrode surface dominates the initial chemical composition and structure of electrode/electrolyte interface. The in situ electrochemical surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (in situ SERS) can detect the compositional evolution of electrode/electrolyte interface from the molecular level, which is used to explore the evolution of the EDL. CuS coats on the Cu/Ti mesh with deposition of gold nanoparticle in the FG (Figure\u2005). The Raman peaks at 480\u2005cm−1 arise from the vibration of the Cu−S in the CuS electrode for CuFG and TiFG electrolyte (Figure\u2005 and ). Obviously, in the CuFG, a new Raman peak belonging to Cu−F appears at 430\u2005cm−1, and the Cu−F concentration at the interface rises gradually during discharge process, indicating the enrichment of the counterion under the effect of the electric field. It can be observed that weaker peak of the DGM solvent 800–840\u2005cm−1 exists in the CuFG system. Above analysis strongly confirmed that NaSO3CF3‐Cu structure enriches in the EDL of CuFG system with few solvent molecular. This experimental data is consistent with MD result that SO3CF3− anion is distributed into the primary solvation shell of Cu cation.\nThe morphology of EDL structure was characterized Cryo‐transmission electron microscopy (cryo‐TEM) technique. The surface of pristine CuS electrode is smooth without interface layer (Figure\u2005). When CuS with Cu current collector is immersed into the NaSO3CF3/DGM, amorphous layer with ≈2.0\u2005nm is uniformly and densely packed (Figure\u2005). In addition, the mapping represents the uniform distribution of Cu, S, Na, C, O, F elements (Figure\u2005). DFT calculation result (Figure\u2005 and ) shows that binding energies between DGM, Li, Na, Mg, K, Ca, Cu, Zn, Ag with CuS [110] plane are −0.03, −2.47, −2.54, −0.37, −1.48, −1.73, 1.68, 1.05 and 1.66\u2005eV, respectively. Above result suggests that Cu element easily absorbs on the surface of CuS compared with DGM solvent, other metal species.\nThe morphology and composition of obtained SEI of anode in CuFG are further revealed by cyro‐TEM and XPS. At initial discharging to 0.4\u2005V, the SEI with about 3.3\u2005nm thick forms on the Na3(CuS)4 surface, and it can be observed that amorphous CuF2 particles disperse in polymer‐like matrix (Figure\u2005 and ). After 1, 2, 10, and 100\u2005cycles, thicknesses of SEI are 3.5, 3.5, 3.8, and 3.6\u2005nm, suggesting its high stability during cycling process (Figure\u2005–). As a comparison, the thicker SEI layer around 12\u2005nm is formed on that of TiFG (Figure\u2005–) with lattice fringe of 0.28\u2005nm attributed into Na2O or Na2CO3. The formed ultrathin SEI of anode for CuFG can minimize electrolyte consumption despite large volume change, guaranteeing the high cycle stability. In the high‐resolution F 1s XPS spectra (Figure\u2005), there is C−F originated from PVDF for the pristine state. And Na−F (22\u2009%) and Cu−F (45\u2009%) can be detected after 1 cycle for CuFG, which can be resulting from the NaF and CuF2 species. Lower C−F organic compound (33\u2009%) for TiFG than CuFG (80\u2009%), indicating its SEI mainly contains inorganic compound of NaF and CuF2. As etching 20\u2005s, C−F species disappear (Figure\u2005), and CuF2 content is higher than NaF. Dispersed CuF2 and F‐containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption. In the C 1s spectra (Figure\u2005S11), weak C−F peak of SEI for CuFG is consistent with the above analysis. In addition, the contents of F, Cu and S elements rapidly increase and C, O, Na contents decrease, implying higher ratio of CuF2 in the inner layer of SEI (Figure\u2005).\nThe conductivity of EDL on the pristine assembled SIBs and SEI in CuFG and TiFG is characterized to explore role of Cu+ by ex situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure\u2005 and ). In the equivalent circuit model of impendence, Rint is the resistance of the EDL and SEI layer, and Zw is the Warburg impendence attributed to the combined effect of Na+ diffusing across the electrode‐electrolyte interface. CuFG and TiFG show different EIS curves during the initial cycle process, and CuFG displays lower Rint (Figure\u2005), suggesting low polarization. The calculated result in SIBs at the pristine state and charging to 3.0\u2005V is that CuFG possesses higher ion conductivity (1.31×10−13\u2005cm2\u2009s−1 and 3.4×10−13\u2005cm2\u2009s−1) for EDL and SEI than that of CuS in FG (Figure\u2005 and S12). EIS data at the pristine state from 303, 313, 323, 333, and 343\u2005K (Figure\u2005S13) is fitted showing that EDL in CuFG exhibits low activation energy (29.60\u2005kJ\u2009mol−1) for Na+ transfer (Figure\u2005). In addition, obtained SEI in CuFG at charging to 3.0\u2005V also displays low activation energy (15.3\u2005kJ\u2009mol−1) for Na+ transport compared with the SEI without Cu component (Figure\u2005). The above results demonstrate that Cu cation‐tailoring EDL can decrease interfacial impendence and form enhanced ion‐conductivity SEI.\nThe strategy applying Cu‐tailoring EDL may be expanded to other conversion‐type anode (Figure\u2005S14). To this end, we have also synthesized pure CoS and Cu7S4 via conventional method, which are characterized in SIBs. The modified CoS and Cu7S4 also display significantly enhanced ICE and cycling stability. In addition, introduction of CuSO3CF3 additive into the NaSO3CF3/DGM also benefits with capacity retention of CuS (Figure\u2005S15). Above result suggests that Cu‐tailoring EDL possesses certain universality for high‐capacity conversion‐type anode.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

However, LIBs are challenged by the limited abundance and uneven geopolitical distribution of Li resources. With the urgent demand for low‐cost and economic sustainable energy storage, rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as the most appealing alternative to LIBs in large‐scale energy storage because of the globally abundant and even distribution of Na element, low cost of raw materials in sodium battery systems and low (de)solvation energy of Na+ ions. As a vital part of the battery, cathode materials have received much attention. However, conventional layered oxide cathodes face the challenge that charge compensation only originates from transition metal (TM) redox during charging and discharging, which reflected in the limitation of specific capacity for energy storage demand. Since the emergence of anionic redox, the charge compensation mechanism has been changed that extra capacity and higher working voltage synergized with cationic redox can be realized. Recent research works mainly focused on the rational design of the local structures for triggering anionic redox reaction by adjusting the Li/Na−O−X (X: metal ions) configurations, and it has broader space for exploration.\nDefect engineering in energy storage materials has been proven as a versatile approach to maneuver their electrochemical performances by regulating the crystal and electronic structure. For example, introducing defects not only adjusts the bandgap or change the distribution of electron to improve charge transfer, but also disturbs the surrounding atoms and provides more storage sites to promote ion diffusion effectively. Vacancies in layer materials for secondary batteries have been studied with much attention in correlating the crystal structure with electrochemical performances. By tuning the synthetic methods (e.g., annealing time, cooling rate etc.), vacancies can be introduced into the TM layer. and trigger anionic redox. However, the understanding of this kind of defect chemistry is still too insufficient to obtain the ideal cathode materials with high capacity and reversible anionic redox.\nHerein, we aim to overview how TM vacancy forms, the idea booms and alters the cathode materials design in SIBs. Based on the fundamental scientific issues behind anionic redox, we summarized the working mechanisms of vacancy‐triggered oxygen redox, revisited the advanced techniques for characterizing TM vacancies and reviewed the viable progress in stabilizing the reversibility of vacancy induced oxygen redox in detail. Finally, the problems deserving to be solved in the future were also highlighted.\n\n\nThe Formation of TM Vacancies in SIBs\nThe formation of TM vacancies in Na‐based metal oxides has been observed over the past decades. In the early 1970s, Hagenmuller's group had proposed a phase diagram for sodium manganese bronzes and suggested that Na0.70MnO2 would uptake oxygen during the cooling process after sintering below 600\u2009°C, resulting in the elevated valence state of Mn ions and the formation of Mn deficient (denoted as “□”) phase Na0.70MnO2+δ (0≤δ≤0.25), the whole reaction process can be written as:\nLater, Dahn's group found a reversible mass increase below 600\u2009°C and decrease above 600\u2009°C in Na2/3MnO2, which represented the uptake and release of O during cooling and heating processes, resulting in the generation of Mn vacancies. Guenne et\u2005al. further verified that these compounds should be expressed in terms of manganese‐deficiency containing phases as Na0.70xMnxO2 (x=1/(1+y/2)=2/(2+y)) rather than the “over‐stoichiometry” formulation Na0.70MnO2+y. Among them, there are two kinds of layered allotropic phases, corresponding to two composition domains of hexagonal α‐Na0.62Mn0.89O2/Na0.68Mn0.975O2 (α‐Na0.70MnO2+y, 0.05≤y≤0.25) and orthorhombic β‐Na0.68Mn0.975O2/Na0.70MnO2 (β‐Na0.70MnO2+y, 0≤y≤0.05). Manthiram's group have successfully synthesized hexagonal P2‐Na0.7MnO2+δ (δ≤0.25) and orthorhombic P2‐Na0.7MnO2+δ without cation vacancies (δ≈0) by reducing NaMnO4 with NaI in the alkaline environment followed by sintering process. Besides the reaction solvents and sintering temperatures, the content of TM vacancy is directly related to the cooling rates. Komaba's group unveiled Mn vacancy formation in P2‐type sodium manganate during slow cooling. By inductive coupled plasma (ICP) and iodometry, they determined the accurate chemical formula Na0.59Mn0.9□0.10O2 (hexagonal), which exhibited moderate phase transitions compared to the distorted P′2‐Na0.64MnO2 (orthorhombic) without TM vacancies obtained through quenching process.\nModulating suitable content of TM vacancies and enhancing Mn redox center by doping can effectively improve comprehensive electrochemical performances, especially in the high voltage region. Kwon et\u2005al. clarified the effect of vacancies on phase evolution of β‐Na0.7[Mn1−xLix]O2+y through substituting Mn by Li. They found that Li ions extracted and vacancies formed during charging process. Similar as the disordered distribution of Li, Mn vacancies randomly distributed in the TM layer, which caused uneven electrostatic repulsion between Na and Mn, leading to the Na+/vacancy disordered structure during desodiation and sodiation. Yang's group demonstrated a synergetic strategy through liquid N2 quenching to introduce vacancy and Fe/Al co‐doping to modulate the average valence of Mn. Besides, the stronger Al−O bond can stabilize the P2 structure by enlarging the spacing of sodium layers. It was also found that proper amounts of Fe‐doping can break cations ordered structure and suppress unexpected P2−O2 transition, thus enhancing cycle stability. They also revealed that more TM vacancies (7.8\u2009%) formed in natural cooling can suppress TMO2 gliding and prevent stacking faults during cycling but delivered relatively low capacity. In contrast, low content of TM vacancies (1.6\u2009%) resulted in higher capacity but poor cycle stability.\n\n\nTM Vacancies for Triggering Oxygen Redox\n\nTM Vacancies for Triggering Oxygen Redox\nIn Li‐rich oxide cathode materials for LIBs, two types of O\u20052p orbitals created: one is along Li−O−TM configuration and the other is along Li−O−Li configuration, as shown in Figure\u2005(a). The O\u20052p orbital along Li−O−Li configuration neither hybridizes with TM d orbitals nor Li\u20052s orbital because of their large difference in energy. This unhybridized state elevates the energy level to a higher position than the hybridized oxygen bonding states, but lower than the TM anti‐bonding states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The unique isolated O state with respect to the TM (t2g) non‐bonding (NB) identity facilitates the oxidation of the isolated O electrons to participate in charge compensation. However, it is difficult to directly synthesize Na‐rich layered oxide materials (e.g., Na[Na1/3Mn2/3]O2) due to the large radius difference between Na+ and TMn+.\nTo date, the mainstream approaches to trigger oxygen redox in sodium deficient oxide materials is constructing Na−O−X configurations, where X includes non‐TM elements without d orbital electrons (Li, Mg, Al), and TM elements with d10 electrons (Cu, Zn). Corresponding works have demonstrated that relatively strong ionic interactions of Li−O, Mg−O, and Al−O generate (quasi) O\u20052p NB states, so that electrons are fully localized on O, promoting oxygen redox. Previous reports have disclosed that Zn2+ exhibits a conspicuous intermediate state between systems having strong ionic character and strong covalent interaction with O, due to its higher electronegativity (1.65) than Li (0.98), Na (0.93), Mg (1.31), and the fully filled 3d10 orbital overlapped with O\u20052p orbitals, which still can make one of them form a quasi‐NB state staying above the rest of TM−O orbitals, as shown in Figure\u2005(b). Besides, in the Cu contained systems, electrons are inclined to delocalize on the more covalent Cu−O bonds, and the largely overlapped Cu\u20053d−O\u20052p states ensure the robustness of O frame by suppressing the local distortion of O environment, which realize reversible lattice oxygen redox, as shown in Figure\u2005(c).\nIn recent years, introducing intrinsic TM vacancies into the lattice has risen as another achievable approach to logically create oxygen NB states along Na−O−□ (O coordinated with two Na ions, two Mn ions, and two vacancies) and □−O−□ configurations, which can serve as highly ionic sites to stabilize electron holes on O atoms, thus lattice oxygen redox reaction can be preferentially activated along these configurations, as shown in Figure\u2005(d).\n\nP‐type layered oxide materials\nIn 2013, Dahn's group had precisely confirmed vacancy concentrations by Rietveld refinement, Monte Carlo stimulation, density measurements and redox titration, proposing that metal site vacancies can facilitate the reactivity of oxygen in layered cathode materials. Inspired by this, Meng's group designed P2‐Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69□0.08O2 with high Na content and TM‐vacancy, which provided a reversible capacity contributed by both cationic and anionic redox reactions. The charge compensation above 4.2\u2005V is originated from oxygen redox, where O2− around □ can also participate at the unhybridized O\u20052p orbital, as seen in Figure\u2005. Hu and co‐workers successfully prepared Na0.653Mn0.929O2 layered oxide with Mn vacancy in TMO2 subunits, which exhibited a distinct voltage plateau at 4.2\u2005V originated from oxygen redox, delivering a total discharge capacity of 210\u2005mAh\u2009g−1. The electronic structures of Na2/3Mn11/12□11/12O2 with TM vacancies and Na2/3MnO2 without any vacancy are presented in Figure\u2005. An increased projected density of states (pDOS) of O\u20052p orbitals near the Fermi level could be found in the Na−O−□ configuration for Na0.667Mn0.917O2 compound with TM vacancies, thus triggering oxygen redox. Bai et\u2005al. reported that charge compensation of the P2‐Na0.63[□0.036Mg0.143Mn0.82]O2 cathode depended on both cationic and anionic redox. They also found that Mg and vacancy provoked two kinds of voltage stage of oxygen redox. When charged above 4.0\u2005V, Na0.72[Mg0.31Mn0.69]O2 without TM vacancy exhibits an anionic voltage plateau (4.2\u2005V), corresponding to 0.44 Na+ extracted. However, Na0.63[□0.036Mg0.143Mn0.82]O2 exhibits two voltage plateaus (4.10 and 4.35\u2005V) and the voltage plateau at 4.1\u2005V diminished after the second charging process, which might be ascribed to vacancy removal caused by the local structure distortion and irreversible phase transitions. Thus, the vacancy distribution mode and doped TM ions codetermine the reversibility of anionic redox. Yang et\u2005al. studied the role of TM vacancy in enhancing the anionic redox in P2‐Na2/3[Mn7/9Mg1/9□1/9]O2 (Figure\u2005), and tailoring low‐spin Mn3+ to enhance the structural stability in P2‐Na2/3[Mn7/9Zn1/9□1/9]O2, respectively. By DFT calculations and magnetic susceptibility analysis, it becomes unveiled that the presence of the native TM vacancies makes the TMO6 octahedron more flexible against the structural distortion during desodiation. Our group created intrinsic vacancies in TM layers of P2‐Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6□0.2]O2 and P2‐Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07□0.13]O2 cathode materials by incorporating Mg ions into the sodium layer, thus constructing Na−O−□, Mg−O−□ and □−O−□ configurations, and delivering reversible capacity originated from both the cationic and oxygen redox couples in 1.5–4.5\u2005V. Schematic is shown in Figure\u2005. The O\u20052p NB orbitals that point to native TM vacancies induced reversible anionic redox in the initial stage, which is superior than that along the Na−O−Mg configuration. Based on our works, Liu and co‐workers successively synthesize P2‐Na0.76Ca0.05[Ni0.23□0.08Mn0.69]O2, P2‐Na0.75Ca0.05[Li0.15Fe0.2Mn0.6□0.05]O2 and P2‐Na0.75Ca0.04[□0.03Li0.1Ni0.2Mn0.67]O2 compounds, and prove the successfully triggering of oxygen redox owing to the generation of O\u20052p NB states along the Na−O−□ configuration created by vacancy manufacturing. pDOS and differential charge density results of DFT calculations ascertained that after Na+ deintercalation, O around TM vacancies lost electrons and contributed to the charge compensation, as seen in Figure\u2005. Later, Massaro et\u2005al. dissected oxygen redox behavior in NaxNi0.25Mn0.68O2 by calculations, analyzing the formation of vacancies and peroxide species at different desodiation stages. The Mn‐bridged low‐energy intermediate superoxide (O2n−) formed near the Mn vacancy sites at low Na content stage, and further generated molecular O2 at the deeply desodiation state. However, the reversibility of this process strictly depends on whether the molecular O2 is trapped in the lattice or removed to the surface. Nam's team revealed the mechanism of transition‐metal vacancies in triggering oxygen redox in P2‐Na2/3[□1/6Mn5/6]O2 (Figure\u2005). They precisely controlled the □/Mn ratio in the MnO2 layer to suppress multiple phase transitions, as well as trigger oxygen redox. which is a vital strategy to obtain reversible oxygen activity in layered cathode materials.\nBesides P2‐layered cathode materials, introducing TM vacancies in P3‐type compounds have also been reported. Armstrong's group have prepared two kinds of P3 compounds: Na0.67Mg0.20Mn0.76□0.04O2 and Na0.6Co0.19Mn0.76□0.06O2 with oxygen redox triggered by oxygen 2p NB states generated along Na−O−□ or □−O−□ configurations, which extended the scale of vacancy controlled anionic redox chemistry in the P‐type family.\n\nO‐type layered oxide materials\nAlthough TM vacancies have been successfully incorporated into the P‐type layered oxides, there still exist many possibilities in the exploration of O‐type oxides.

However, in general synthesis processes, the fast precipitation rate of PBAs is always accompanied by the generation of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies. Consequently, coordinated water from the hydrous preparation environment occupies the six corners of the resulting octahedral cavities as seen in Figure\u2005\u2009c. Because Cu has the largest hydration energy among the first period transition metals, it is easier to coordinate with water molecules in aqueous solution to form hydrated Cu2+ ions. The hydrated Cu2+ ions will bring a lot of water molecules into the CuHCF framework during its growth. Because of the coordinated water, the Cu2+ ions can no longer coordinate with the N atoms of [Fe(CN)6], which they are supposed to, leading to [Fe(CN)6] vacancies in the framework, for example, K0.71Cu[Fe(CN)6]0.72⋅3.7\u2009H2O. As a result, there are fewer active redox sites in such high‐vacancy CuHCF (HV‐CuHCF). On the other hand, sodium migration also relies on the integrity of the framework as the ion diffusion in PBA framework is calculated to be a W‐shaped path from one face center to another. Once [Fe(CN)6] vacancies emerge, the ion pathways become discontinuous, which would hinder the sodium intercalation/deintercalation. To minimize the formation of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies during the synthesis of CuHCF, a dehydrated synthesis method was designed. Ethanol was used as the solvent to prevent Cu2+ ions from coordinating with water. Much less coordinated water is introduced into the CuHCF framework during the precipitation process, giving birth to a low vacancy CuHCF (LV‐CuHCF) with a high Fe/Cu ratio of 0.931. In contrast, HV‐CuHCF prepared in hydrous conditions shows a low Fe/Cu ratio of 0.647. The X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of LV‐CuHCF and HV‐CuHCF can both be well indexed to the same cubic structure (JCPDS No. 86‐0513; Figure\u2005\u2009a,\u2009c). However, there is a clear shift of peaks to lower angles in LV‐CuHCF, indicating a larger lattice parameter owing to the minimization of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies, which will be favorable for sodium diffusion. FTIR spectroscopy (see the Supporting Information, Figure\u2005S1) provides information on the octahedral [Fe(CN)6] ligand, wherein the observed absorption bands were related to the vibrations of CN−, Fe−C, and water. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Figure\u2005S2) and Raman spectroscopy (Figure\u2005S3) showed that LV‐CuHCF has much lower coordinated water and [Fe(CN)6] vacancy contents than HV‐CuHCF. As a result, LV‐CuHCF is expected to provide more sodium storage sites and unbroken sodium ion pathways, enabling intercalation pseudocapacitance to achieve higher capacity and faster kinetics.\nConsidering the low electronic conductivity of PBAs, Ketjen black (KB) was introduced to obtain PBA‐carbon composites for both LV‐CuHCF and HV‐CuHCF. Figure\u2005S4 shows that the cubic‐shaped CuHCF particles embedded in the KB matrix are homogeneous for both samples. Figure\u2005\u2009b and d compare the first‐cycle charge–discharge profiles of LV‐CuHCF and HV‐CuHCF at 1\u2009C. As expected, LV‐CuHCF exhibits twice the capacity of HV‐CuHCF, achieving a record value of 86\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 among all previous reports on CuHCF‐based cathode materials. In addition to the higher charge–discharge voltage plateau at 3.48/3.38\u2005V, an extra plateau at a lower voltage of 2.96/2.72\u2005V appears compared with HV‐CuHCF. This unforeseen pair of plateaus can be ascribed to the redox reaction of copper, which will be discussed later.\nRate capability is one of the primary hurdles that hinders the application of SIBs considering the large ionic radius and high mass of sodium. As a unique mechanism, intercalation pseudocapacitance is supposed to be powerful in accelerating sodium kinetics. Figure\u2005\u2009a and b display the charge–discharge profiles of LV‐CuHCF from 1 to 100\u2009C and HV‐CuHCF from 1 to 50\u2009C. Upon increasing the current rate to 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50\u2009C, the discharge capacity of LV‐CuHCF maintains 77, 71, 64, 58 and 50\u2005mAh\u2009g−1. In contrast, HV‐CuHCF only possesses a capacity of 17\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 50\u2009C. Impressively, even when cycled at an extremely high rate of 100\u2009C, which is the highest rate ever reported for PBAs, the LV‐CuHCF electrode can still exhibit a reversible capacity of 41\u2005mAh\u2009g−1, corresponding to a high capacity retention of approximately 50\u2009% of the capacity at 1\u2009C. Besides the appealing rate capability, a long cycle life is also demonstrated for the LV‐CuHCF electrode with a reversible capacity of 42\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 10\u2009C over 1000\u2005cycles.\nUltrafast kinetics with outstanding rate capability is hard to be fulfilled, assuming the conventional diffusion‐controlled electrochemical behavior of an electrode. Considering the three‐dimensional open framework and the weak interaction of Na+ with the anion pπ electrons, intercalation pseudocapacitance is predicted to play a crucial rule in realizing ultrahigh rate performance of LV‐CuHCF. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out with variation of the sweep rates (0.1–300\u2005mV\u2009s−1) to examine the intercalation behavior of Na+ in the LV‐CuHCF electrode (Figure\u2005\u2009a and Figure\u2005S5). In accord with the two voltage plateaus in the charge–discharge profiles of LV‐CuHCF, two pairs of redox peaks are observed in the CV curves at low sweep rates (Figure\u2005S5\u2009a). Upon increasing the sweep rate, there are peak shifts for both cathodic and anodic peaks, as well as the evanescence of the low‐voltage peak couple (2.75/3.10\u2005V). The remaining pair of peaks (3.40/3.25\u2005V) corresponds to the redox couple of [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3−, which is commonly observed in previous studies. In principle, the current response i of CV scans can be described as a power‐law formula with the sweep rate v [Eq.\u2005]:\nwhere b reflects the control process of the electrochemical behavior. The variation of b value from 0.5 to 1 represents the transformation of the electrochemical behavior from a diffusion‐controlled process to a surface‐controlled one. As shown in Figure\u2005\u2009b, for the sweep rates from 1 to 10\u2005mV\u2009s−1, the b values for the cathodic and anodic peaks are 0.85 and 0.88, respectively, suggesting that the current is primarily surface‐controlled in LV‐CuHCF. Specifically, the capacitive contribution gradually increases from 63\u2009% to 84\u2009% upon increasing the sweep rate from 0.5 to 4\u2005mV\u2009s−1 (Figure\u2005S6), further verifying the domination of capacitive storage to the total electrochemical process. When increasing the sweep rate to 20\u2005mV\u2009s−1 and above, the values of b decrease to 0.54 and 0.62 for the cathodic and anodic peaks, respectively, indicating a slow diffusion‐controlled process in the electrode. This phenomenon is associated with an increase in the ohmic contribution and/or diffusion constraints/limitations under ultrahigh sweep rates, which has been also reported in other intercalation electrodes such as TiO2 and T‐Nb2O5.\nIn addition, the rate‐limiting step of the LV‐CuHCF electrode can be further identified by the relationship between capacity and sweep rate. As solid‐state diffusion always exhibits linear dependence of sweep rate in a plot of normalized capacity versus v−1/2, a capacity roughly independent of sweep rate from 0.1 to 10\u2005mV\u2009s−1 (region 1 shown in Figure\u2005\u2009c) implies that the rate‐limiting process in our LV‐CuHCF electrode is surface‐controlled. In region 2, from 20 to 300\u2005mV\u2009s−1, the linear decrease in capacity with v−1/2 indicates that the rate‐limiting step changes from surface‐controlled to diffusion‐controlled at high sweep rates. That is, diffusion is rate‐limiting for charging times of less than 60\u2005s, similar to most conventional electrodes. However, for charging periods above 120\u2005s (ca.\u200516\u2009C), a fully capacitive manner dominates the behavior of this intercalation‐based system with no indication of diffusion limitations. Another feature that identifies the intercalation pseudocapacitance behavior of LV‐CuHCF is the small peak shift with sweep rate. As shown in Figure\u2005\u2009d, the cathodic peak shift is less than 0.2\u2005V at sweep rates below 5\u2005mV\u2009s−1. In addition, despite a slightly higher charge transfer resistance (Rct; Figure\u2005S7\u2009a), the sodium diffusion coefficient (DNa+) of LV‐CuHCF calculated from the relationship between Zre and ω−1/2 in the low frequency region (Figure\u2005S7\u2009b) is 5.7×10−11\u2005cm2\u2009s−1, an order of magnitude higher than that of HV‐CuHCF (5.44×10−12\u2005cm2\u2009s−1), indicating a fast diffusion process.\nThe above‐mentioned redox reaction of Cu+/Cu2+, which contributes considerable capacity in the LV‐CuHCF electrode, was verified by ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ex situ XRD at different states of charge (Figure\u2005). As displayed in Figure\u2005\u2009a, the existence of CuII is identified in the electrode at a charged state (3.4\u2005V). With an increasing amount of inserted Na+ ions in the framework, the peak at 933.2\u2005eV shifts to a lower binding energy. In the meantime, the peak of CuI appears until the electrode is discharged to 2.0\u2005V. The transformation from cupric to cuprous in CuHCF was demonstrated by Giorgetti and co‐workers through X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Nevertheless, negligible capacity was contributed by this less activated Cu+/Cu2+ redox couple owing to the insufficient ionic and electronic conductivity, as previously reported for CuHCF electrodes.\nEx situ XRD analysis (Figure\u2005\u2009c) shows the phase variation of LV‐CuHCF at different states of charge (Figure\u2005\u2009b). The XRD peaks shift negligibly during the Na+ extraction/insertion process with a volume change of less than 1\u2009% (see note in the Supporting Information), demonstrating the robust structure of LV‐CuHCF, which is a key factor in achieving intercalation pseudocapacitance. Notably, the XRD peaks shift gradually toward higher angles during Na extraction and conversely change during Na insertion except at the charge state of 2.0\u2005V. The abnormal volume shrinkage upon charging from 2.0\u2005V to 2.8\u2005V may be caused by the Jahn–Teller effect of Cu2+, which leads to strong distortion of CuN6 octahedra. The twist of CuN6 octahedra will be generated by the oxidation of Cu+ upon sodium insertion. On the contrary, such structure transformation is not observed in HV‐CuHCF electrode (Figure\u2005S8). Such discrepancy between LV‐CuHCF and HV‐CuHCF further verifies the redox activity of Cu in LV‐CuHCF.\nFor ESS application, fast charge–discharge with superior cycling performance is required not only at room temperature, but also at higher and lower temperatures. As low temperature decreases the energy and power densities of the cathodes more significantly owing to the sluggish solid‐diffusion process, the need for cathode materials with ultrahigh rate capability at low temperature is even more urgent. LV‐CuHCF with intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior may satisfy the requirements for application at low temperature. Galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of LV‐CuHCF and HV‐CuHCF in half‐cells under different rates at 0\u2009°C are shown in Figure\u2005\u2009a and b. The LV‐CuHCF electrode delivers capacities of 61, 55, 46, 38, 27, and 19\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40\u2009C rates. Opposite to HV‐CuHCF, which delivers a specific capacity of only 26\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 1\u2009C and nearly no capacity upon the rate increasing to 40\u2009C, LV‐CuHCF maintains impressive rate capabilities even at freezing point. In term of cycling stability, LV‐CuHCF maintains a reversible capacity as high as 60\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 after 100\u2005cycles with negligible capacity fading under 1\u2009C at 0\u2009°C whereas HV‐CuHCF delivers less than a half of the capacity of LV‐CuHCF (Figure\u2005\u2009c).\nMore details can be seen in their charge–discharge profiles (Figure\u2005S9\u2009a). The plateau corresponding to the [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3− couple in LV‐CuHCF is much longer than that of HV‐CuHCF and the plateau corresponding to the Cu+/Cu2+ couple in LV‐CuHCF can still be observed clearly. The typical shape of the discharge curve of LV‐CuHCF can remain even after cycling under a tenfold rate at 0\u2009°C, whereas the curve of HV‐CuHCF becomes a straight line with negligible capacity under the same conditions (Figure\u2005S9\u2009b). The capacity retention of LV‐CuHCF and HV‐CuHCF at 0\u2009°C calculated on the basis of their own specific capacities under different current rates at room temperature is exhibited in Figure\u2005\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

After direct calcination of disodium stannous citrate (DSC) at 650\u2009°C CO2 and H2O are released, whereas Sn and Na2CO3 particles are uniformly embedded in the pyrolytic carbon matrix (Sn@C@Na2CO3). After washing with hot deionized water (≈50\u2009°C), the Na2CO3 template could be removed and porous Sn@C particles are obtained. After a simple sulfuration process using sublimed sulfur, the Sn@C particles are transformed into SnS2@C composite. As shown in Figure\u2005\u2009a and b, the Sn particles grow unrestrictedly during the sulfuration process and impale the carbon matrix to become flake‐like SnS2. Owing to the intrinsic low conductivity of SnS2, the flake‐like SnS2, disconnected from the continuous conductive carbon network, will have low electrochemical activity and gradually lose Na+/K+ storage capabilities. Considering the reduction conditions of SnII and the citrate base of DSC, GO flakes can be reduced in\u2005situ and strongly coated on the surface of the composites to confine the growth of Sn particles during the sulfuration process. To prove this, a certain amount of DSC was directly added into the GO solution, and after stirring for 1\u2005h, the solution became black in color (Figure\u2005S1, see the Supporting Information) signifying the newly emerged rGO whereas the control solution remained brown in color (the original color of GO solution). Considering that excess amount of GO will decrease the specific energy density, which is calculated based on the mass of the whole electrode materials, GO solutions of various strength were investigated. As shown in Figure\u2005S2, insufficient GO will lead to uncovered surface, whereas excess GO will form a thick layer of rGO on the surface. Figure\u2005S3 further displays the SEM images of Sn@C and Sn@C@rGO‐x composites. Sn@C@rGO‐3 displays a thin and well‐covered rGO layer on the surface. Furthermore, after the sulfuration process, the rGO‐coating layer on the prepared SnS2@C@rGO‐3 was still intact (Figure\u2005\u2009c and d). The energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping results also confirmed the uniform distribution of Sn and S atoms under the rGO layer (Figure\u2005\u2009e–h).\nXRD analysis were conducted to track the phase transformation during the carbonization, washing, and sulfuration processes. As shown in Figure\u2005\u2009a, after calcination the samples exhibit peaks indicating the co‐existence of Sn (JCPDS No.04‐0673), Na2CO3 (JCPDS No.19‐1130), and SnO (JCPDS No.06‐0395). Figure\u2005\u2009b shows the XRD patterns of samples after washing with de‐ionized water, in which the peaks assigned to Na2CO3 disappear completely. Subsequently, after the sulfuration process, the XRD patterns (Figure\u2005\u2009c) of all samples closely resemble those of SnS2 (JCPDS No.23‐0677), and the peak corresponding to the existence of carbon at around 26°(2θ) is weakened owing to the strong signal of Sn and SnS2. Thus, Raman spectra were acquired to confirm the existence of carbon. As shown in Figure\u2005\u2009d, the strong signals of characteristic D (≈1330\u2005cm−1) and G bands (≈1585\u2005cm−1) representing carbonaceous materials were detected. Moreover, an additional band was detected at roughly 311\u2005cm−1, corresponding to the A1g vibration of SnS2. The clearly reduced signal intensity of SnS2 in the SnS2@C@rGO‐4 composite can be attributed to the thick rGO layer on the surface, which could partially shield the Raman signal of SnS2. This result is also in agreement with the SEM observation (Figure\u2005S2\u2009e and Figure\u2005S3\u2009e).\nDuring the calcination process, the released CO2 gas (conventional pore‐creating reagent) is expected to create mico‐ and mesopores on the carbon matrix, whereas removal of the Na2CO3 hard template will create meso‐ and macropores. Thus, to evaluate the surface confinement effect and the pore structure, the gas‐sorption studies were performed using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. As depicted in Figure\u2005\u2009a, the sorption isotherm curves for both SnS2@C and SnS2@C@rGO‐3 are composed of a weak knee‐like inflexion (P/P0≈0.01), a hysteresis loop (P/P0 between 0.4–0.9), and an uplift (P/P0 between 0.9–1.0), corresponding to a combination of Type\u2005I (indicating micropores), Type\u2005IV (characteristic of mesoporous materials) and Type\u2005II (feature of macroporous structure). The BET specific surface areas (SSA) of SnS2@C and SnS2@C@rGO‐3 were calculated to be 26.67 and 16.02\u2005m2\u2009g−1, respectively. The decreased SSA of SnS2@C@rGO‐3 can be attributed to the coating of rGO, which restrains the SnS2 particles from growing freely. This is also in accordance with the well‐maintained spherical morphology of SnS2 particles in SnS2@C@rGO‐3 (Figure\u2005\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Compared with the standard diffraction pattern of PBAs, CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF demonstrates a monoclinic rather than a typical face‐centered cubic structure. The (220), (420), (440), and (620) peaks are split into two near‐identical peaks. Similar phase‐transition phenomena were reported by previously and result from the high concentration of Na+ and suppressed defects in the crystal framework through the controlled low‐speed crystal growth process. In the Raman spectrum for Ni‐HCF, there are two distinctive peaks at 2103.7 and 2136.3\u2005cm−1, whereas that for CoNi‐HCF displays three peaks at 2103.7, 2141.9 and 2180.0\u2005cm−1, respectively (Figure\u2005S2). The core–shell CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF gives rise to three Raman peaks at 2107.2, 2144.1, and 2182.2\u2005cm−1, which lie between the core (CoNi‐HCF) and shell (Ni‐HCF) spectra, indicating that the surface of the core material is successfully coated by shell material. In the infrared spectra (Figure\u2005S3), the sharp absorptions at 1621 and 3550\u2005cm−1 are related to O−H stretching and H−O−H bending, which are caused by the interstitial and absorbing water, the peaks around 2090\u2005cm−1 are caused by the CN− bonding with Fe2+/3+. In thermogravimetric analysis (Figure\u2005S4), the mass retention before 300\u2009°C of the core and the shell are 86.06\u2009% and 85.28\u2009%, respectively. The weight loss could be due to the adsorbed and coordinated water, whereas the water content in the crystal framework remains stable after the coating process.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) patterns show that both CoNi‐HCF and CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF nanocubes are monodisperse with uniform sizes of 100 and 130\u2005nm, respectively (Figure\u2005). After coating, the core–shell CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF retains the cubic morphology, which is probably due to the aforementioned low‐speed coprecipitation synthesis method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) figures further identify that Ni‐HCF is uniformly coated on the surface of CoNi‐HCF and forms a smooth shell with a thickness of 15\u2005nm. According to the weight before and after the coating process, the mass ratio of core to shell is around 10:7 and could be optimized by modifying the ratio of raw materials and, in addition, by increasing the ratio of chelating agent, the particle size distribution would be increased simultaneously.\nTo investigate the practical application of core–shell PBAs as cathode materials for SIBs, the electrochemical performance was studied at an ultrahigh mass loading (6\u2005mg\u2009cm−2). Figure\u2005\u2009a and\u2005b show the charge–discharge curves of CoNi‐HCF and CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF at 15\u2005mA\u2009g−1. Owing to the reversible Na+ storage offered by coating material Ni‐HCF, the specific capacity only reduces slightly from 129.2 to 104.3\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 after coating and Coulombic Efficiency are 96.1\u2009% and 96.3\u2009% before and after coating, respectively, corresponding to 1.52 and 1.23\u2009Na+ reversible storage per formula. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF electrode carried out at 0.1\u2005mV\u2009s−1 from 2.0 to 4.2\u2005V (Figure\u2005) gave rise to two well‐defined symmetric redox peaks at 3.56 and 3.10\u2005V, corresponding to the redox of Fe2+ and Fe3+. The CV curves in the following cycles overlap well, showing the highly reversible redox reaction of the active materials. The peaks at 3.86 and 3.73\u2005V for CoNi‐HCF can be ascribed to the redox reaction of Co2+ and Co3+ binding to N. Remarkably, the oxidation peaks at 4.15\u2005V almost disappeared in the core–shell PBA, demonstrating that the shell materials effectively avoid the side reaction between the core material and the electrolyte at the voltages higher than 4.0\u2005V.\nFigure\u2005\u2009c shows the rate performances of CoNi‐HCF and CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF at 30–1500\u2005mA\u2009g−1. Owing to the shell materials’ capacity retention of around 77\u2009% at 4250\u2005mA\u2009g−1[5b,\u200912d] and lower activation energy, as expected, the core–shell‐structured CoNi‐HCF@Ni‐HCF exhibits an enhanced rate performance, especially at high current density. The discharge capacity remained 79.1\u2005mAh\u2009g−1 at 10\u2009C (1\u2009C=150\u2005mA\u2009g−1\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Improvements through changing the type of binder or adding EN as a co‐solvent are given relative to this reference.\n\nInfluence of the Binder on Electrode Expansion/Shrinkage\nPVDF and CMC are the most common binders used in battery research. Although PVDF is still commonly used to produce carbonaceous as well as noncarbonaceous anodes for SIBs,[] the need for NMP (N‐methylpyrrolidone) as the solvent during slurry preparation is undesired due to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, aqueous processing is possible in case of CMC; this being the reason why water‐soluble binders are preferred and used for commercial production of LIB graphite electrodes.[] The general characteristics of both types of binders and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross‐section images of the prepared electrodes are shown in Table S1, Figure S1 and S2, Supporting Information. The main difference is that PVDF can be found mainly on top of the electrode, whereas CMC is more homogeneously distributed in the volume.\nThe impact of the type of binder on the electrode breathing in sodium‐ion half cells is shown in Figure\xa0. Note that the type of binder also influences the electrode preparation, which is why there is a slight deviation in electrode loading (active material) and initial thickness (with current collector) (mwith\u2009CMC\u2009=\u20097.0\u2009mg\u2009cm−2 vs mwith\u2009PVDF\u2009=\u20096.5\u2009mg\u2009cm−2 and h0,with\u2009CMC\u2009=\u200997\u2009μm versus h0,with\u2009PVDF\u2009=\u200985\u2009μm). As can be observed from the voltage profile and the ECD signal, intercalation of sodium ions (cell discharging) leads to an electrode expansion while deintercalation (cell charging) leads to an electrode shrinkage. Figure\xa0 shows results for the first five cycles.\nThe obtained capacities range from 95–106\u2009mAh\u2009g−1, which is close to the theoretical value of around 110\u2009mAh\u2009g−1 for [Na(2G)x]C20. This means that the electrode capacity does not depend on the type of binder (which is expected and shows that a comparison is feasible). On the other hand, the ECD results show that the type of binder has a notable influence on the electrode expansion during the first cycle. Although the first sodiation leads to an expansion of 175% in the case of PVDF, 142% is found for CMC. The difference in 33 percentage points corresponds to an improvement for the CMC electrode by 19% (33/175) when referring to the PVDF electrode as a reference. During subsequent desodiation, the electrode does not return to its original thickness, which is due to structural rearrangement and exfoliation of the particles leading to larger electrode porosity as previously discussed. During subsequent cycling, breathing of the electrodes is similar for CMC (45–55%) and PVDF (46–49%).\nOverall, the results clearly show that the type of binder has a notable influence on the initial electrode expansion with CMC leading to a smaller increase compared with PVDF. This may be caused by several factors: 1) CMC is more homogeneously distributed over the electrode (see Figure S1 and S2, Supporting Information) which might lead to a better preservation of the electrode structure compared with PVDF; 2) CMC has a higher Young's modulus compared with PVDF and, therefore, a higher stiffness,[] which could counteract more efficiently the expansion of the electrode, and 3) the interactions of CMC with the graphite surface. Regarding the latter, whereas the backbone of CMC interacts with graphite and stabilizes the structure,[] the interactions between hydrogen and fluoride in PVDF are stable and, therefore, the interaction with the graphite surface is weak.[]\nIn a second series of experiments, the influence of the electrode loading (and with that the initial electrode thickness) was studied; see Figure S3 and S4, Supporting Information. The results are summarized in Figure\xa0 and are in line with the findings shown in Figure\xa0.e., the type of binder influences the first cycle (shown with triangles), where electrodes made with CMC show an overall lower electrode expansion compared with the ones made with PVDF. In the following cycles, breathing of the electrodes is in the same range for both binders. An overview of all experiments conducted with different loadings is shown in Table S2, Supporting Information. As can be observed, the thickness changes in the initial cycle of the graphite electrodes are always lower in the case of the CMC binder. In addition, even a difference in the mass loading as large as 2.1\u2009mg\u2009cm−2 (mwith\u2009CMC\u2009=\u20097.1\u2009mg\u2009cm−1 vs mwith\u2009PVDF\u2009=\u20095.0\u2009mg\u2009cm−1) (which translates into 39\u2009μm higher initial thickness) leads to a lower thickness change in the first cycle for the CMC‐based electrode compared with the one made with PVDF. Although this study is the first report on binder comparison for solvent co‐intercalation reactions, the findings are in line with previous studies on hard carbon electrodes[] and SnO2 electrodes[] for which the use of CMC also leads to better properties compared with PVDF. For comparison, we tested the graphite electrodes also in Li‐ion half cells and found the same trend, i.e., the expansion is reduced in the first cycle in case CMC is used as binder; see Figure S5, Supporting Information.\n\nInfluence of EN as a Co‐Solvent on Electrode Expansion/Shrinkage\nVery recently, Zhang et al.[] showed through ex\u2009situ XRD that the expansion of the graphite lattice during t‐GIC formation can be reduced by 57% when adding EN to a 2G electrolyte. Although only the initial expansion was studied, the approach seems promising. Encouraged by these findings, we studied whether the smaller lattice expansion also translates into reduced electrode breathing during cycling. To that end, graphite electrodes (with PVDF) were cycled in sodium‐ion half cells with electrolyte solutions based on pure 2G and 2G\u2009+\u200910\u2009v/v EN. Figure\xa0 shows the voltage profiles of the graphite cells with and without EN as a co‐solvent. As expected from previous studies, results for the first two cycles are comparable when 2G is used as the electrolyte solvent, i.e., the reaction is reversible. The Coulomb efficiencies of the first (ICE) and second cycle reach 74% and 88%, respectively. This is in fact lower compared to when coin cells are used, but we generally observe somewhat lower ICE values in the ECD device. In contrast, cells made with the addition of EN show a very different behavior. During initial discharging, the plateaus are slightly shifted, especially the middle region, which becomes elongated. In addition, it does not occur as a single plateau, but as a sloping region with a small plateau in the end. The discharge capacity reaches 191\u2009mAh\u2009g−1 but is only partially regained during charging. The low ICE of 38% indicates a much more severe electrolyte decomposition compared to pure 2G. In the second cycle, the reaction becomes more reversible, reaching a Coulomb efficiency of 87% and a discharge capacity of 91\u2009mAh\u2009g−1, being slightly lower compared to 2G. In the second to fifth cycle, the Coulomb efficiencies reach values of 88–93% for the pure 2G system and 86–95% when 10 v/v EN is added, showing that both systems have a similar, good reversibility. The low ICE value and the complex storage process are drawbacks of using EN and further investigations on their origin are required.\nImportantly, the additional plateaus in the voltage profile remain, meaning that the redox reaction (see Equation\xa0()) changes. In other words, EN participates in the electrode reaction and changes the formation of the t‐GIC. The change in the redox reaction due to EN is also corroborated through the different XRD patterns of the electrodes after full sodiation, as can be seen in Figure S6, Supporting Information. Thus, when the graphite electrode was fully sodiated in pure 2G, the reflections for the t‐Na‐GIC at 15.3°, 23.8°, and 29.9° correspond to the expected stage 1\u2009t‐GIC. In contrast, the final product of the sodium electrode with 2G\u2009+\u2009EN at 0.01\u2009V exhibits a different behavior. The XRD pattern shows the existence of well‐defined signals at 12.6° as well as at 25.5° that can be attributed to a monolayer t‐GIC as suggested by Zhang et al.[] Although a difference in XRD patterns is evident between 2G and 2G\u2009+\u2009EN, a more clear interpretation of the diffraction date will require in\u2009situ studies.\nFigure\xa0 shows the ECD results over five cycles for a cell with EN as a co‐solvent. Compared to the results for pure 2G (see Figure\xa0), it can be clearly seen that the addition of EN effectively decreases the thickness change of the electrode. In the first cycle, the expansion decreases from 175% to 100%. In the second to fifth cycle, the electrode breathing is only 17–20% when EN is used compared to 46–49% with 2G as the only electrolyte solvent. This might be explained through changes in the overall cell reaction as well as the intercalation in the graphite structure of the smaller EN molecules compared to 2G molecules. Thus, the use of a suitable co‐solvent can be much more effective for the reduction of volume expansion than the variation of the type of glyme (compare to ref.\xa0).\nFigure\xa0 shows the relative thickness change and the voltage profile for the second cycle of the cells made with pure 2G and the ones made with the addition of 10\u2009v/v EN in more detail. The first cycle is shown in Figure S7, Supporting Information, but it was omitted due to the low ICE value. As mentioned earlier, the most notable impact of EN is the reduction in the electrode breathing and the higher complexity of the voltage profile. However, some additional similarities and differences can be seen. For more clarity, we discuss these by means of three regions (labeled I, II, and III); see Figure\xa0. First of all both systems show a sloping increase (region I) of the electrode thickness during sodiation followed by a plateau (region II). For 2G and 2G\u2009+\u200910\u2009v/v EN, the storage capacities of the plateau regions are 28 and 36\u2009mAh\u2009g−1, respectively, corresponding to fractions of 26% and 40% of the total discharge capacity. For cells with 2G as sole solvent, we recently assigned this plateau to a pseudocapacitive storage mechanism because in this region, charge is being stored without any significant change in electrode volume and the voltage almost linearly changes during sodiation/desodiation (indicated by the gray arrows). In other words, in region II, the graphite structure seems to be temporarily pillared. The situation seems more complex in the case when EN is present. Then, region II during discharge correlates with a flat voltage plateau at ≈0.4\u2009V, followed by a sharp voltage drop until the cut‐off voltage of 0.01\u2009V (gray arrow). A flat voltage is typical for two‐phase reactions, i.e., it indicates a stage transformation. Still, the electrode expansion in this region is very small, which would support the suggestion by Zhang et al. that the graphite layers are pillared by the stronger interaction with the co‐intercalated solvent molecules.[] Second, the voltage profile and ECD signal are symmetric during sodiation/desodiation in case of 2G and they become asymmetric if EN is added. Although the electrode expansion in region I is sloping, the electrode shrinkage in region III is almost linear (indicated by the black arrows). Moreover, in region II, the single flat discharge voltage at ≈0.4\u2009V splits into two plateaus during charging (see gray arrows). Such an asymmetric behavior for voltage and ECD signals is unexpected and indicates that the sodiation and desodiation are governed by different processes.\nAt the present, it is difficult to rationalize this asymmetric behavior and further studies are required to provide a convincing explanation. It is possible that the stronger interaction of EN within the t‐GIC compound influences the dynamic behavior of the electrode reaction. A hint toward the asymmetric behavior being influenced by kinetics can be seen from the voltage hysteresis plot shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information. Although the polarization is small in region II, the voltage profiles show that the polarization in case of EN increases with the degree of charging, which indicates that kinetic effects play a role. Nevertheless, the results clearly demonstrate that ECD is a very useful tool to study the electrode behavior during cycling through which important characteristic features can be identified.\nInterestingly, the ECD results only partially agree with the ex\u2009situ XRD results from Zhang et al. Although Zhang et al. suggest that the use of EN as a co‐solvent along with 2G leads to a permanent pillaring (constant lattice expansion regardless of the state of change), our results indicate that pillaring occurs for 2G and 2G\u2009+\u2009EN and occurs only in a certain stoichiometry range (region II), i.e., the pillaring is only temporary, as breathing of the electrode during cycling is clearly detected. The temporary pillaring could also explain the findings by Zhang et al., who suggest that the degree of pillaring depends on the EN content. Nevertheless, the change in electrode breathing from 2G to 2G\u2009+\u2009EN is found to be similar, Zhang et al. see a reduction of 57% by ex\u2009situ XRD when EN is added, while a reduction of 61% can be found with in\u2009situ ECD. Considering our results and the results by Zhang et al., the behavior of t‐GIC in electrochemical cells with different solvent molecules is a largely unexplored research field that requires further systematic studies and the use of additional in\u2009situ methods.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

NMP (Sigma‐Aldrich) was used as the solvent to cast electrodes when PVDF (PI‐KEM Ltd) was used as the binder. In the case of CMC (PI‐KEM Ltd), an aqueous solution was prepared. Electrodes were cast with different initial thicknesses to obtain different mass loadings and thicknesses and dried overnight in air. Finally, the electrodes were punched out and dried again under vacuum overnight at 110\u2009°C.\nAll cell assemblies took place in an argon‐filled glovebox from MBraun. Film thicknesses were measured inside the glovebox before cell assembly with a digital thickness dial gauge from Käfer Messuhrenfabrik GmbH. The sodium‐ion cells contained a graphite electrode with a diameter of 10\u2009mm as the working electrode and pure sodium (BASF) as counter and reference electrode. 1\u2009m NaPF6 (purity >99%, Sigma‐Aldrich) in 2G (Sigma‐Aldrich, pre‐dried using a 4\u2009Å molecular sieve) was used as the electrolyte. The lithium‐ion cells contained the earlier‐mentioned graphite electrode as the working electrode and lithium (Rockwood Lithium) as counter and reference electrodes. 1\u2009m LiOTf in 2G was used as the electrolyte. The in\u2009situ ECD experiments were conducted using an ECD‐nano cell device from EL‐CELL GmbH. The cell was designed as a three‐electrode set‐up. Working and counter electrode were separated by a fixed glass ceramic separator so that only the thickness change of the working electrode was measured. Around 250\u2009μL electrolyte were used for one cell. The ECD experiments were conducted with a Biologic SP‐50 instrument at 25\u2009°C. GCPL (galvanostatic charge and discharge with potential limitation) experiments were conducted between 0.01–2\u2009V versus Na+/Na for the sodium‐ion cells and between 0.1–2\u2009V versus Li+/Li for the lithium‐ion cells. The voltage window for the lithium‐ion cells was set to a higher lower cut‐off voltage, as a long voltage plateau occurred below 0.1\u2009V, which might have been caused by side reactions.[] The thickness change in the electrodes was measured simultaneously with the GCPL experiments. For the ECD experiments with EN as a co‐solvent, the same electrodes as mentioned earlier for the sodium‐ion cell were used. The electrolyte consisted of 1\u2009m NaOTf (purity >98.0%, Sigma‐Aldrich) in 2G\u2009+\u200910\u2009v/v EN (Sigma‐Aldrich, pre‐dried using a 4\u2009Å molecular sieve). NaOTf was purified before by dissolving in ethanol, reflux, hot filtration, and drying for 24\u2009h at 120\u2009°C under vacuum. Previous experiments showed that there is no notable impact on the electrode expansion/shrinkage between PF6− and OTf−.[] The relative thickness changes (%) shown as red curves on Figure\xa0,\xa0,\xa0, S3, S4, S5, and S7, Supporting Information, were calculated by using2hrelative/%=hx−h0h0×100%where, hx is the thickness of the electrode at each point and h0 is the initial thickness before the first discharge. The thickness changes in each half cycle, mentioned in the text and shown in boxes in the aforementioned graphs, were calculated using the following equations3hrelative/%=hmax−hnhn×100%or4hrelative/%=hmax−hn+1hn×100%where hmax is the maximum thickness of the electrode in one cycle, hn is the thickness at the beginning of each cycle (local minimum), and hn+1 is the thickness at the beginning of the next cycle.\nThe cross‐section images of the electrodes were taken with a SEM (PhenomProX, Phenom World) using an accelerating voltage of 10\u2009kV (electrode with CMC) and 15\u2009kV (electrode with PVDF). Cross‐section images were generated by cutting one electrode with scissors and using special sample holders. Energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX) images were taken with the same device using an accelerating voltage of 15\u2009kV. XRD was performed using a D2 Phaser instrument from Bruker. The measurement was conducted with a Cu X‐ray tube (30\u2009kV, 10\u2009mA) between 5° and 40°, using a step width of 0.05°. Air‐tight sample holders with a copper plate were used for the measurement. Electrodes for XRD were retrieved from coin cells that were cycled for 3½ cycles at 0.1 C, i.e., the measurement was stopped at a fully discharged state. Disassembling of the cells and XRD sample preparation took place inside an argon‐filled glovebox.\n\nElectrode Preparation\nThe electrodes contained 90\u2009w/w graphite powder (MTI Corp.) and 10\u2009w/w binder material.

NaOTf was purified before by dissolving in ethanol, reflux, hot filtration, and drying for 24\u2009h at 120\u2009°C under vacuum. Previous experiments showed that there is no notable impact on the electrode expansion/shrinkage between PF6− and OTf−.[] The relative thickness changes (%) shown as red curves on Figure\xa0,\xa0,\xa0, S3, S4, S5, and S7, Supporting Information, were calculated by using2hrelative/%=hx−h0h0×100%where, hx is the thickness of the electrode at each point and h0 is the initial thickness before the first discharge. The thickness changes in each half cycle, mentioned in the text and shown in boxes in the aforementioned graphs, were calculated using the following equations3hrelative/%=hmax−hnhn×100%or4hrelative/%=hmax−hn+1hn×100%where hmax is the maximum thickness of the electrode in one cycle, hn is the thickness at the beginning of each cycle (local minimum), and hn+1 is the thickness at the beginning of the next cycle.\nThe cross‐section images of the electrodes were taken with a SEM (PhenomProX, Phenom World) using an accelerating voltage of 10\u2009kV (electrode with CMC) and 15\u2009kV (electrode with PVDF). Cross‐section images were generated by cutting one electrode with scissors and using special sample holders. Energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX) images were taken with the same device using an accelerating voltage of 15\u2009kV. XRD was performed using a D2 Phaser instrument from Bruker. The measurement was conducted with a Cu X‐ray tube (30\u2009kV, 10\u2009mA) between 5° and 40°, using a step width of 0.05°. Air‐tight sample holders with a copper plate were used for the measurement. Electrodes for XRD were retrieved from coin cells that were cycled for 3½ cycles at 0.1 C, i.e., the measurement was stopped at a fully discharged state. Disassembling of the cells and XRD sample preparation took place inside an argon‐filled glovebox.\n\nElectrode Preparation\nThe electrodes contained 90\u2009w/w graphite powder (MTI Corp.) and 10\u2009w/w binder material. NMP (Sigma‐Aldrich) was used as the solvent to cast electrodes when PVDF (PI‐KEM Ltd) was used as the binder. In the case of CMC (PI‐KEM Ltd), an aqueous solution was prepared. Electrodes were cast with different initial thicknesses to obtain different mass loadings and thicknesses and dried overnight in air. Finally, the electrodes were punched out and dried again under vacuum overnight at 110\u2009°C.\n\nElectrochemical Measurements\nAll cell assemblies took place in an argon‐filled glovebox from MBraun. Film thicknesses were measured inside the glovebox before cell assembly with a digital thickness dial gauge from Käfer Messuhrenfabrik GmbH. The sodium‐ion cells contained a graphite electrode with a diameter of 10\u2009mm as the working electrode and pure sodium (BASF) as counter and reference electrode. 1\u2009m NaPF6 (purity >99%, Sigma‐Aldrich) in 2G (Sigma‐Aldrich, pre‐dried using a 4\u2009Å molecular sieve) was used as the electrolyte. The lithium‐ion cells contained the earlier‐mentioned graphite electrode as the working electrode and lithium (Rockwood Lithium) as counter and reference electrodes. 1\u2009m LiOTf in 2G was used as the electrolyte. The in\u2009situ ECD experiments were conducted using an ECD‐nano cell device from EL‐CELL GmbH. The cell was designed as a three‐electrode set‐up. Working and counter electrode were separated by a fixed glass ceramic separator so that only the thickness change of the working electrode was measured. Around 250\u2009μL electrolyte were used for one cell. The ECD experiments were conducted with a Biologic SP‐50 instrument at 25\u2009°C. GCPL (galvanostatic charge and discharge with potential limitation) experiments were conducted between 0.01–2\u2009V versus Na+/Na for the sodium‐ion cells and between 0.1–2\u2009V versus Li+/Li for the lithium‐ion cells. The voltage window for the lithium‐ion cells was set to a higher lower cut‐off voltage, as a long voltage plateau occurred below 0.1\u2009V, which might have been caused by side reactions.[] The thickness change in the electrodes was measured simultaneously with the GCPL experiments. For the ECD experiments with EN as a co‐solvent, the same electrodes as mentioned earlier for the sodium‐ion cell were used. The electrolyte consisted of 1\u2009m NaOTf (purity >98.0%, Sigma‐Aldrich) in 2G\u2009+\u200910\u2009v/v EN (Sigma‐Aldrich, pre‐dried using a 4\u2009Å molecular sieve).

NMP (Sigma‐Aldrich) was used as the solvent to cast electrodes when PVDF (PI‐KEM Ltd) was used as the binder. In the case of CMC (PI‐KEM Ltd), an aqueous solution was prepared. Electrodes were cast with different initial thicknesses to obtain different mass loadings and thicknesses and dried overnight in air. Finally, the electrodes were punched out and dried again under vacuum overnight at 110\u2009°C.\nAll cell assemblies took place in an argon‐filled glovebox from MBraun. Film thicknesses were measured inside the glovebox before cell assembly with a digital thickness dial gauge from Käfer Messuhrenfabrik GmbH. The sodium‐ion cells contained a graphite electrode with a diameter of 10\u2009mm as the working electrode and pure sodium (BASF) as counter and reference electrode. 1\u2009m NaPF6 (purity >99%, Sigma‐Aldrich) in 2G (Sigma‐Aldrich, pre‐dried using a 4\u2009Å molecular sieve) was used as the electrolyte. The lithium‐ion cells contained the earlier‐mentioned graphite electrode as the working electrode and lithium (Rockwood Lithium) as counter and reference electrodes. 1\u2009m LiOTf in 2G was used as the electrolyte. The in\u2009situ ECD experiments were conducted using an ECD‐nano cell device from EL‐CELL GmbH. The cell was designed as a three‐electrode set‐up. Working and counter electrode were separated by a fixed glass ceramic separator so that only the thickness change of the working electrode was measured. Around 250\u2009μL electrolyte were used for one cell. The ECD experiments were conducted with a Biologic SP‐50 instrument at 25\u2009°C. GCPL (galvanostatic charge and discharge with potential limitation) experiments were conducted between 0.01–2\u2009V versus Na+/Na for the sodium‐ion cells and between 0.1–2\u2009V versus Li+/Li for the lithium‐ion cells. The voltage window for the lithium‐ion cells was set to a higher lower cut‐off voltage, as a long voltage plateau occurred below 0.1\u2009V, which might have been caused by side reactions.[] The thickness change in the electrodes was measured simultaneously with the GCPL experiments. For the ECD experiments with EN as a co‐solvent, the same electrodes as mentioned earlier for the sodium‐ion cell were used. The electrolyte consisted of 1\u2009m NaOTf (purity >98.0%, Sigma‐Aldrich) in 2G\u2009+\u200910\u2009v/v EN (Sigma‐Aldrich, pre‐dried using a 4\u2009Å molecular sieve). NaOTf was purified before by dissolving in ethanol, reflux, hot filtration, and drying for 24\u2009h at 120\u2009°C under vacuum. Previous experiments showed that there is no notable impact on the electrode expansion/shrinkage between PF6− and OTf−.[] The relative thickness changes (%) shown as red curves on Figure\xa0,\xa0,\xa0, S3, S4, S5, and S7, Supporting Information, were calculated by using2hrelative/%=hx−h0h0×100%where, hx is the thickness of the electrode at each point and h0 is the initial thickness before the first discharge. The thickness changes in each half cycle, mentioned in the text and shown in boxes in the aforementioned graphs, were calculated using the following equations3hrelative/%=hmax−hnhn×100%or4hrelative/%=hmax−hn+1hn×100%where hmax is the maximum thickness of the electrode in one cycle, hn is the thickness at the beginning of each cycle (local minimum), and hn+1 is the thickness at the beginning of the next cycle.\nThe cross‐section images of the electrodes were taken with a SEM (PhenomProX, Phenom World) using an accelerating voltage of 10\u2009kV (electrode with CMC) and 15\u2009kV (electrode with PVDF). Cross‐section images were generated by cutting one electrode with scissors and using special sample holders. Energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX) images were taken with the same device using an accelerating voltage of 15\u2009kV. XRD was performed using a D2 Phaser instrument from Bruker. The measurement was conducted with a Cu X‐ray tube (30\u2009kV, 10\u2009mA) between 5° and 40°, using a step width of 0.05°. Air‐tight sample holders with a copper plate were used for the measurement. Electrodes for XRD were retrieved from coin cells that were cycled for 3½ cycles at 0.1 C, i.e., the measurement was stopped at a fully discharged state.

SnS2 nanoplates were separately prepared through a hydrothermal process. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the as‐obtained SnS2 nanoplates is shown in Figure S1a (Supporting Information). The detailed fabrication process of GO@MF and SnS2 is illustrated in the Experimental Section. Simply by drying the mixture of GO@MF and SnS2 dispersed solution and then annealing at a carbonization temperature of 700 °C, the TCM was obtained (inset in Figure a). MF resin was used to act as not only a nitrogen source, but also a hard template to inhibit the restacking of carbon nanosheets, thus shaping a 3D interconnected porous structure during carbonization. It should be noted that the mixture amount of GO@MF and SnS2 dispersed solution was carefully controlled with no excessive SnS2. The TCM precursor was pyrolyzed during the annealing process, triggering the in situ reduction of SnS2 to Sn and S. Meanwhile, a small amount of S elements participates in the carbonization process and was doped into the carbon lattice, resulting in a tin nanoparticle decorated, N, S codoped carbon monolith. For comparison, carbon monolith (CM) was also fabricated through similar experimental procedure without the addition of SnS2 nanoplates. The SEM image of CM is shown in Figure S1b (Supporting Information). Besides, commercial pure tin nanoparticle (TNP) was examined for further performance comparison (Figure S1c, Supporting Information).\nThe SEM image under a low magnification shown in Figure a confirms the monolithic 3D structure of as‐obtained TCM, indicating its good structural integrity. The wrinkled morphologies accompanied with interconnected carbon nanosheets and abundant pores are observed from the SEM images under higher magnifications in Figure S1d (Supporting Information), indicating a highly porous structure. Such unique 3D structure can evidently facilitate the rapid ion insertion and extraction, shorten the electrolyte penetration path, and provide the buffer space for volume expansion during cycling, which is favorable for enhanced sodium storage electrochemical performance. It should be noted that no large tin particles are observed from the SEM images. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was applied to gain further insight into the microstructure of TCM. As shown in Figure b,c, the ultrasmall tin nanoparticles with mean size of around 5 nm are uniformly distributed in the carbonaceous framework. Despite the similar SEM images of TCM and CM, the introduction of tin nanoparticles in TCM is affirmed by comparing its TEM image with that of CM (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The STEM image of TCM and the corresponding elemental mappings are shown in Figure d that clearly confirmed the existence and uniform distribution of C, Sn, N, and S in the whole TCM structure. And the high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images further demonstrate that the tin nanoparticles with ultrasmall size (<5 nm) uniformly decorated in carbonaceous structural scaffold (Figure e). Furthermore, from the corresponding selected‐area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of TCM in Figure f, diffraction rings marked by the white arrow can be clearly observed, which corresponds to the (200), (220), (301), and (321) crystalline planes of tin. The diffraction rings marked by the yellow arrow correspond to the porous carbon framework. Additionally, as demonstrated in Figure g, the lattice fringes of tin nanoparticles exhibit an interplanar spacing of 2.91 Å, which corresponds to the (200) plane of tin nanoparticles.[] And the interplanar spacing of carbon is measured to be ≈3.72 Å, corresponding to the expanded (002) plane of graphitic carbon.\nIn order to investigate the crystalline structure of the as‐obtained TCM, X‐ray diffraction (XRD) was applied. As revealed in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), the broad peak detected at around 24° can be assigned to (002) plane of carbon content, indicating its amorphous nature. The broad peaks with weak intensities diffraction peaks can be indexed to the tetragonal tin (JCPDS Card No. 04‐0673), which is consistent with the results of SAED patterns, indicating the small crystalline size of tin.[] Figure a shows the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis and the pore size distribution of TCM. The Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) measurement surface is 167 m2 g−1, and the distinct hysteresis loop at relative pressure P/P0 ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 indicates the presence of mesoporous. The pore size distribution curve of TCM was calculated from adsorption branch by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, as shown in the inset of Figure a. The sizes of the majority of the mesopores fall within a relatively narrow range of 10–15 nm. The rich porous structure and suitable specific surface area can enhance the wettability of electrode and fast ion/electron transportation. As shown in Figure b, the content of tin in TCM was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in O2 atmosphere. The fast decrease of the curve before 150 °C is attributed to the evaporation of adsorbed water. After that, the curve go through a stable period until 410 °C, which is attributed to the simultaneous occurrence for formation of tin oxide (Sn + O2→SnO2) and carbon combustion (C + O2→CO2↑). When all tin is converted to tin oxide, the curve declines rapidly until 600 °C, which is attributed to the complete consumption combustion of carbon. Therefore, it could be calculated that the content of tin in TCM was ≈33.1%.\nThe chemical composition of TCM was characterized by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The three peaks exhibited in C 1s XPS spectra are attributed to C\uf8ffC, C\uf8ffN, and C(O)OR bonding, respectively (Figure c). As shown in Figure d, the N 1s XPS spectra exhibit three dominated peaks at 398.6, 400.4, and 401.7 eV, corresponding to pyridinic nitrogen (N‐6), pyrrolic nitrogen (N‐5), and graphitic nitrogen (N‐Q), respectively. In Figure e, the XPS spectra of S 2p of TCM show two peaks at 163.6 and 164.9 eV, corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks for the \uf8ffC\uf8ffS\uf8ffC\uf8ff covalent bond. These results further confirm the successful codoping of N and S. Remarkably, according to previous reports, doping heteroatoms in carbon can enlarge interlayer distance, create defective sites, and enhance the electronic conductivity, thus facilitating the Na‐ion insertion/extraction and boosting sodium storage ability. As shown in Figure f, two strong individual peaks at 486.9 and 495.3 eV are related to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively, indicating that at the surface tin nanoparticles are partially oxidized to SnO2.[] Raman spectra of TCM and CM in Figure S4 (Supporting Information) both show two characteristic peaks of D‐band and G‐band at ≈1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively. It can be clearly observed that the TCM sample exhibits higher intensity ratio of D to G band (ID/IG) than that of CM sample, indicating a higher content of structural defects due to the decoration of tin and codoping of nitrogen and sulfur. This highly defective structure can provide more active sites for sodium storage, thus enhancing its reversible capacity.\nTo explore its sodium storage mechanism, cyclic voltammetry (CV) of TCM was also investigated. Figure a shows the initial three CV curves of TCM at a scanning rate of 0.05 mV s−1 within the potential range of 0.005–3 V. During the first cathodic sweep, a broad irreversible peak from 1.0 to 1.5 V is observed for TCM, which disappears from the following cycles, corresponding to the formation of the SEI film. Similar observation is found in the CV curve of CM (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Compared with that of CM, an additional reduction peak at around 0.3 V is originated from the formation of NaxSn alloy in the first sodiation process. In the anodic sweep, four well‐defined peaks at 0.23, 0.27, 0.58, and 0.82 V can be ascribed to the alloy formation of Na15Sn4, Na9Sn4, NaSn, and NaSn5, respectively.\nThe sodium storage performance of the TCM anode was systematically evaluated by galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling in a voltage window of 0.005–3 V. Figure b shows the voltage profiles of TCM in the first three cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1. A relatively high initial reversible capacity of 455 mAh g−1 is delivered, corresponding to a Coulombic efficiency of 48%. The irreversible capacity loss in the first sodiation/desodiation cycle can be assigned to the formation of SEI film on the electrode surface.[] However, it should be noted that the Coulombic efficiency reached over 90% from the second cycle, demonstrating a high reversibility. As shown in Figure c, the TCM anode was tested at increasing current densities from 100 to 5000 mA g−1 for five cycles at each rate to evaluate the rate capability. Impressively, TCM can deliver the reversible capacities of 372, 333, 307, 280, 250, and 230 mAh g−1 obtained at 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 mA g−1, respectively. The electrode shows minor drops upon increasing current density, and virtually no capacity decay is exhibited at each rate, demonstrating an excellent high‐rate stability. Besides, when the current density is abruptly returned to the origin value of 100 mA g−1 after high‐rate cycling, the reversible capacity of TCM anode is recovered to 344 mAh g−1, indicating its good tolerance of large charge/discharge currents.\nThe high‐rate and long‐term cycling property is an important parameter for the practical application of SIBs and was further examined for TCM electrodes. As revealed in Figure d, the TCM electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 283 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1. A relatively rapid charge capacity drop in the beginning of cycling was attributed to the inevitable electrolyte decomposition and the SEI formation in the initial cycles process. After 1000 cycles, a high reversible capacity of 250 mAh g−1 is delivered. More impressively, upon further increasing the current density to 5000 mA g−1 in Figure e, the TCM electrode still exhibits stable long‐term cycling performance. After 2000 cycles, the electrode is stabilized at a reversible capacity of 228 mAh g−1 with a capacity retention of nearly 100%, demonstrating an exceptional high‐rate and long‐term stability. Meanwhile, the cycling performance of CM and TNP electrode is also investigated in SIBs. Compared with CM and TNP, the TCM exhibits a much better Na‐storage performance. Specifically, in the cycling performance comparisons of TCM, CM, and TNP electrodes are evaluated at different current densities as shown in Figure f,g, TCM outperforms CM and TNP in terms of charge capacity throughout the testing period at two different current densities.\nFurthermore, the electrochemical performance comparisons of TCM and other Sn/C composites in literature for SIBs are shown in Figure h,i and Table S1 (Supporting Information). Figure h demonstrates a comparison of capacity retention properties under same current densities. Compared to previous reports, the TCM electrode exhibits the most stable cycling performances with the capacity retention maintains over 90% in 200 cycles. In a comparison of the rate performance for TCM with other reported Sn/C composites in Figure i,[] it can be obviously observed that the TCM electrode reveals the best capacity retention properties at high rates. Even at a high current density of 5000 mA g−1, TCM can also deliver 50% capacity of that at low current density of 50 mA g−1, demonstrating its outstanding rate capability. The TCM electrode exhibits such outstanding high‐rate performance and long‐term cycling stability, which is mainly ascribed to the following three reasons: (a) 3D interconnected porous carbonaceous structure offers high integrity and durability electrolyte/electrode interface for the charge transfer reaction, which obviously enhance interfacial kinetics that facilitates ultrafast electron transfer and ion transport, as well as prevent pulverization and aggregation of ultrasmall tin nanoparticles; (b) the uniformly ultrasmall tin nanoparticles (<5 nm) decorated in carbonaceous structure greatly reduce the interface resistance, facilitate the formation of homogeneous, robust, and high conductive SEI, shorten the ion diffusion path, and buffer the mechanical stress induced by the volume changes; (c) the introduction of nitrogen and sulfur in carbon framework can expand its interlayer distance, create more defect sites, and enhance the electronic conductivity.\nIn addition, the satisfactory cyclic stability and rate capability can be further supported by the structure retention ability. Figure S6 (Supporting Information) shows the STEM image of TCM electrode after 500 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The electrode still preserves its original appearance compared to preceding STEM image before cycling, and the tin nanoparticles (white dots) still retain their ultrasmall sizes without severe agglomeration, demonstrating the high structural integrity and durability of TCM during electrochemical tests, which is highly beneficial to the sodium storage performance.\nInterfacial transport behavior is of immense importance to the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. In order to gain further insight into the outstanding sodium storage stability and rate capability of TCM, through the combination of in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (in situ EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) to inspect the kinetics and interfacial phenomena of electrode during the first sodiation process, including characteristics of microinterface change between electrolyte and electrode, the formation mechanism of SEI films, charge transfer resistance, ionic diffusion, and so on. As shown in Figure a,b, the in situ EIS curves are recorded for CM and TCM electrodes during the first discharge processes at a current density of 50 mA g−1, respectively. As can be observed from the in situ EIS curves, the discharge process of CM and TCM is mainly controlled by the charge transfer and diffusion processes. Therefore, based on electrochemical impedance quantitative analysis of Nyquist plots obtained from the equivalent circuit (Figure S7, Supporting Information), information of system resistance (R0), the interfacial resistance between electrolyte and electrode (SEI impedance, R1), and charge transfer resistance (R2) can be obtained. As shown in Figure c,d, R1 and R2 of CM and TCM are plotted against discharge voltage to aid discussion.\nAs shown in Figure a,b, both CM and TCM exhibit large impedances at initial stage of discharge, which is attributed to the absence of fast‐ionic conductor film between the electrode surface and electrolyte. According to previous reports, besides the variation of charge distribution near electrode–electrolyte interface, there was no SEI film formation at this stage, which is also consistent with the corresponding CV curve in Figure a. After that, R1 presents an interesting change with the depth of discharge. Specifically, at the initial stage of discharge (The color portion is shown in Figure c), a loose and inhomogeneous SEI film with large impedance appears due to the electrolyte solvent reductive decomposition to form a nonuniform precipitation of heterogeneous intermediates products on the electrode surface, which is accompanied by the production of partial irreversible capacity. Subsequently, R1 experienced a relatively rapid decline after this stage, and decrease gradually with the increase of discharge depth. Then, R1 exhibits a relatively stable value until the end of the discharge process, which indicates the formation of a uniform, dense as well as high conductive SEI film during this process that can prevent further decomposition of electrolyte and protect the electrode active materials. Compared with that of CM electrode, TCM exhibits smaller SEI impedance (R1) and faster access to stability in the whole sodiation process, which is attributed to the lower potential barrier of the uniformly ultrasmall tin nanoparticles that greatly affect the electronic conduction and sodium storage reactions, resulting in a higher exchange current density, thus further enhancing Na+ diffusion kinetics by form a highly efficient and fast Na+ transport channel.\nThe changes of charge transfer resistances (R2) of TCM and CM show distinct behavior to those of R1 in Figure d. For the fresh electrode, it is reflected as a synthetically surface impedance. During the initial discharge stage, R2 decreases rapidly, followed by a slow downward trend after the depth of discharge reaches middle stage and raises slightly at the last stage of discharge. Compared to CM electrode, TCM exhibits smaller charge transfer resistance (R2) in the whole sodiation process, which is attributed to the enhanced Na+ migration and faster electron transportation enabled by good ion/electron combination at electrochemical active sites and tin decoration, respectively, leading to an excellent interface with smaller electrochemical polarizations and concentration polarizations. Therefore, TCM can achieve outstanding rate capability in SIBs. It is particularly noteworthy that at the last stage of the discharge depth, the R2 has a slight rise in both CM and TCM electrode, which is attributed to the diffusion of Na+ in electrode materials leads to structural changes or the formation of new phases. Subsequent Na+ sodiation needs to overcome the coulomb repulsion of ions those that have already occupied limited storage sites, thus impeding further charge transfer. In addition, from Figure S8 (Supporting Information), TCM also shows slightly low system impedance (R0) compared with CM.\nIn order to further demonstrate the high ionic conductivity of TCM, GITT was employed to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient of Na+ in TCM electrode with a pulse current at 50 mA g−1 for 30 min between rest intervals for 2 h. DNa+ of CM electrode was also measured via the same method as a reference. The diffusivity coefficient can be estimated according to Fick's second law as the following simplified equationD=4πτmBVMMBS2ΔESΔEτ2where τ is the pulse duration, mB, MB, and VM are the active mass, molar mass, and molar volume of the electrode material for CM and TCM, respectively; S is the active surface area of the electrode; MB/VM is obtained from the density of CM and TCM measured by the Archimedes' method (ASTM C‐373‐88); and other parameters in the equation could be obtained from the GITT curves as shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information).\nAs shown in Figure e,f, the CM and TCM electrodes have similar potential responses and diffusivity coefficient variations during GITT measurement, apart from the observation that TCM exhibits much larger diffusion coefficient during the entire sodiation process. The calculated values of DNa+ as a function of potential are shown in Figure f, with both CM and TCM electrodes showing slow declines of DNa+ with the sodiation until 0.5 V. It is clearly shown that TCM exhibits much higher DNa+ than CM, being nearly 3.2 times higher than that of CM at initial sodiation stage, which is ascribed to the lower Na+ diffusivity resistance in TCM and easily accessible sites of uniform distribution of ultrasmall tin for rapid electron transmission. As sodiation continues, a sharp decline of DNa+ appears below 0.5 V, which is found to be more dramatic for the DNa+ of CM compared to that of TCM. A sharp drop below 0.5 until 0.1 is attributed to the fact that Na+ must overcome a coulomb repulsion of the existing Na+ in the electrode. The better ionic conductivity of TCM is due to the better coverage of electrode/electrolyte and shorter ion diffusion distance promoted by the ultrasmall tin nanoparticles (<5 nm), which is also consistent with the electrochemical impedance results of in situ EIS in Figure c,d.\nRecent studies have reveal that high rate and ultrastability storage performance of ion storage are attributed to the superior pseudocapacitive contribution. To explain and explore the excellent high‐rate behavior of TCM, kinetic analysis was performed for CV measurements at various scan rates. Figure a exhibits the CV profiles of the TCM at the scan rates from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 between 0.005 and3 V. According to the corresponding power‐law relation[]i\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009avbwhere i is the current response, ν is the scan rate, and a and b are constants. Figure b shows the plot of log (i) versus log (ν), where the slope of the linear line corresponds to the b‐value. While the b = 0.5 indicates an ideal diffusion‐controlled process, while that of the b = 1 indicates a surface capacitive‐controlled one. By calculation, the b‐value was 0.73 for cathodic peak, and 0.95, 0.90, and 0.98 for the anodic peaks, indicating the pseudocapacitive Na+ charge storage contributed most of the capacity. To quantitatively separate the contribution of diffusion‐controlled and surface capacitive‐controlled elements, the relationship between current response and scan rate can be described by the following equationiV\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009k1v\u2009\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, the Mn+ cations, thioacetamide (TAA), and glucose were dissolved in deionized water to form a transparent solution, in which the TAA would rapidly coordinate with Mn+ to form stable coordinate complexes (\uf8ffMn+\uf8ffTAA\uf8ff) because of the delocalization of lone pair electrons of the NH2 group. To prepare the precursor for the TMSs@C/3DNCF, the as‐purchased MA sponge (Figure b) was immersed into the mixed solution of the Mn+, TAA, and glucose. The different colors after being immersed (Figure c) visually confirm that various Mn+ cations have been successfully incorporated into the MA sponge. More strikingly, the colors of MA sponges change slightly even after extensive sonication in deionized water (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which evidently authenticates the strong coordination between the MA substrate and Mn+ ions. After annealing the precursor of MA‐CoCl2‐TAA in N2 atmosphere, the black Co9S8@C/3DNCF sponge with superb flexibility is obtained (Figure d), where the black core–shell Co9S8@C nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on the 3DNCF. To further figure out the intrinsic interaction between the sponge and Mn+ cations (the Co2+ as an example), corresponding X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations are further conducted. The pronounced signal for the elemental S, as discerned from the XPS survey spectrum of the MA‐CoCl2‐TAA (Figure e), proves the existence of the TAA throughout the MA sponge. As displayed in Figure f, the high‐resolution N 1s peak in the precursor shows obvious shift (0.5 eV) to a higher binding energy (BE) compared with the pristine MA sponge. Besides, a new peak at BE of 401.1 eV can be identified in the deconvoluted N 1s spectrum, which is attributed to the formation of Co\uf8ffN bonds, whereas the N 1s spectrum in the MA sponge only shows two peaks at BEs of 398.5 and 400.1 eV, corresponding to the \uf8feN\uf8ffand \uf8ffNH\uf8ff groups, respectively. Then a unique structure of \uf8ffMA\uf8ffMn+\uf8ffTAA\uf8ff is formed via chemical bonds. Furthermore, the glucose is also believed to be incorporated by the sponge owing to its unusual hydrogen‐bond adsorption capability. As a comparison, other TMSs/3DNCF composites without adding glucose were also fabricated. The weight percentages of TMSs@C in the TMSs@C/3DNCF composites are calculated to be about 27.6–37.3 wt% via the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and mass difference between the TMSs@C/3DNCF and pure 3DNCF products (Table S1, Supporting Information).\nThe as‐obtained TMSs@C/3DNCF composites were studied by X‐ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the crystal structures. As observed in Figure a, the broad diffraction peaks located at 22° reveal the nongraphitic structures of the carbon foams due to the low carbonization temperature. The abnormal high ID/IG ratios in Raman spectra confirm the remarkably defective structure of the 3DNCF (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information). Besides, the XRD patterns demonstrate several characteristic diffraction peaks, which can be perfectly indexed to the MnS (JCPD No. 89‐4952), FeS (JCPD No. 80‐1026), Co9S8 (JCPD No. 65‐6801), Ni3S2 (JCPD No. 76‐1870), and ZnS (JCPD No. 36‐1450), respectively. All these diffraction peaks for the TMSs@C/3DNCF have very low intensity, suggesting that the coarsening of TMSs NPs has been suppressed by the strong coordinate covalent bonds.\nDue to the low intensity of the diffraction peaks, XPS measurement was then performed to figure out the chemical structure of the as‐fabricated TMSs@C/3DNCF. Taking the Co9S8@C/3DNCF as an example, the survey spectrum (Figure b) displays distinctive peaks of the elemental S, C, N, O, and Co, in which the significant O 1s peak is ascribed to the residue oxygen containing group and/or the adsorbed oxygen on surface during the sample preparation. All the TMS@C/3DNCF composites have the similar N contents of 6.5%–7.1% (Table S1, Supporting Information). To probe the chemical state, high‐resolution XPS spectra of each element were analyzed. The spin–orbit split peaks of the Co 2p (Figure c) are located at 780.5 (2p3/2) and 796.3 (2p1/2) eV, and the spin–orbit split peaks of S 2p are centered at 161.6 (2p3/2) and 162.6 (2p1/2) eV (Figure S4, Supporting Information), which are consistent with the documented BEs for the Co9S8. An additional peak located at 163.9 eV is observed in the S 2p spectrum of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF, which is attributed to the formation of S\uf8ffC bond. Therefore, the deconvoluted peak appeared at 285.7 eV in the C 1s spectrum (Figure d) is assigned to S\uf8ffC bond. The N 1s spectrum (Figure e) can be divided into four characteristic peaks at BEs of 398.5 (pyridinic N, 54.9 at.%), 399.8 (pyrrolic N, 19.3 at.%), 400.9 (graphitic N, 17.6 at.%), and 402.5 (oxidized N, 8.2 at.%) eV. The first two kinds of N are usually regarded as metal‐coordination sites because of their lone‐pair electrons, and therefore the predominance of the two kinds of N can to a certain extent indirectly demonstrate the formation of Co\uf8ffN bonds. Similar phenomena are observed for all other metal sulfides (Figures S5–S8, Supporting Information), which confirm that the TMSs@C/3DNCF composites are successfully fabricated via the facile method we developed and TMSs are chemically anchored with the 3DNCF backbone via the C\uf8ffS and metal\uf8ffN bonds.\nThe morphologies of the as‐obtained TMSs@C/3DNCF were then investigated via field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high‐resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Figure ). Compared with smooth surface of the 3DNCF (Figure S9, Supporting Information), a large number of NPs with size of 30–80 nm are homogeneously anchored on the surface of the 3DNCF without obvious aggregation for the TMSs@C/3DNCF composites. The uniform distribution of NPs upon the 3DNCF may be attributed to strong coordination between the Mn+ and MA sponge. Meanwhile, the particle size of different TMSs shows some differences, which may be caused by various bonding strength between different Mn+ ions and MA sponge. Except for the ultrasmall NPs, 3D porous interconnected structures are observed for all the TMSs@C/3DNCF composites in the low‐magnification TEM images, in which the dark dots and light regions correspond to TMSs NPs and void spaces, respectively. The porous structure, which is confirmed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area and the pore size distribution (Figure S10, Supporting Information), is formed via the thermal decomposition of the MA sponge, glucose, and TAA. HRTEM images clearly demonstrate the TMSs NPs are wrapped by a uniform layer carbon with a thickness of 5–13 nm. In sharp contrast, the TMSs on 3DNCF prepared without adding the glucose tend to aggregate into large particles of 200–600 nm (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Therefore, the carbon coating layers can prevent the aggregation of the NPs during annealing. Meanwhile, the lattice fringe spacings and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the TMSs NPs agree well with those of MnS, FeS, Co9S8, Ni3S2, and ZnS, respectively, which are consistent with the aforementioned XRD and XPS results. The energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings were also utilized to study the elemental compositions of the TMSs@C/3DNCF. Obviously, the TM (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), N, and S elements are dispersed uniformly throughout the 3D framework.\n\nElectrochemical Evaluation\nThe TMSs@C/3DNCF composites were explored as binder‐free anodes for evaluating their sodium storage capabilities. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Figure a) of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF anode at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage window of 0.01–3 V for the first three cycles are collected to elucidate its electrochemical mechanism. Typically, the sharp reductive peak located at 0.21 V in the first sodiation process is indexed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, while the peak at 0.47 V is ascribed to the Na+ insertion into the Co9S8, accompanying with the phase conversion from Co9S8 to Co and Na2S. The oxidation peak at 1.69 V corresponds to the conversion of Na2S and Co to Co9S8. In the subsequent scanning, the CV curves are almost overlapped, demonstrating the extraordinary reversibility of the unique Co9S8@C/3DNCF electrode. The large irreversibility for the first sodiation process usually originates from the formation of SEI layer and partial irreversible desodiation process, which is observed in most anode materials. The Co9S8@C/3DNCF shows a high charge capacity of 701.4 mAh g−1 (based on the weight of Co9S8@C) with an initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 68.9%. The capacity tends to stabilize at 659.5 mAh g−1 and the CE can reach over 97% from the second cycle (Figure c). Given the ultralow capacity of the 3DNCF (83.8 mAh g−1; Figure S12, Supporting Information), the capacity contribution from the 3DNCF in the Co9S8@C/3DNCF is marginal. Rate performance of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF was also investigated at various current densities (Figure c). Strikingly, the Co9S8@C/3DNCF composite consistently outperforms the Co9S8/3DNCF counterpart with a Co9S8 content of 36.8 wt% (Figure c). Remarkable capacities of 590.7, 523.8, 438.7, 371.2, and 291.1 mAh g−1 are achieved for the Co9S8@C/3DNCF at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g−1, respectively. Although the gaps between the charge and discharge curves gradually increase, the voltage plateaus are still exhibited even after a 50× increase in the current density. Furthermore, the capacity can be recovered to 618.9 mAh g−1 when the current density is reset to 0.1 A g−1. Obviously, the carbon coating layer in the Co9S8@C/3DNCF plays a critical role in achieving a high capacity.\nIt is well known that the areal mass loading and packing density of active materials have great effects on the specific capacity and cycle stability. Therefore, it is worth investigating the electrochemical performances of the flexible Co9S8@C/3DNCF electrodes with higher loading of the Co9S8@C. As displayed in Figure d, the flexible electrode delivers decreasing capacities with the increase of the areal mass loading, from 445.6 mAh g−1 (1.1 mg cm−2) to 233.1 mAh g−1 (5.2 mg cm−2). However, all the electrodes show superior cycle stability at a high current density of 1 A g−1. To further demonstrate the rate capability and cycling stability, the long‐term cycle stabilities over 1000 cycles of the TMSs@C/3DNCF (with the areal mass loading of 1.1 mg cm−2) composites were then explored at 1 A g−1. All of the composites show extraordinary cycle stabilities (Figure e and Figure S13, Supporting Information). For the Co9S8@C/3DNCF, as shown in Figure e, a high reversible capacity of 400.4 mAh g−1 is achieved after 1400 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 90.5%. More encouragingly, the gravimetric capacity and cycle stability of our flexible Co9S8@C/3DNCF composite are superior to many other metal sulfide based electrodes as reported (Table S2, Supporting Information). In vast contrast, the Co9S8/3DNCF electrode exhibits a much lower capacity with a rapid capacity decay. Apparently, the carbon coating can significant improve the long‐term cyclability of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF composites.\nThe surface‐controlled pseudocapacitive contribution of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF anode is investigated to explicate the superior rate performance and outstanding cycling performance via CV test at different scan rates. As displayed in Figure a, the collected CV profiles show similar shapes with increasing the sweep rate from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1. The peak currents (i) of cathodic and anodic peaks and sweep rates (v) were utilized to analyze the kinetics of sodiation/desodiation processes according to the following equation: log(i) = blog(v) + log(a). The value of b is calculated by the slope of the log(i) versus log(ν). Generally, b = 0.5 represents the diffusion‐controlled Faradaic contribution, while b = 1.0 suggests an ideal pseudocapacitive process. Figure b displays the linear relationship between log(i) and log(ν) of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF electrode, and the b values of peak 1 and peak 2 are calculated to be 0.74 and 0.82, demonstrating the sodiation/desodiation process of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF composite is dominated by the surface pseudocapacitance. The percentage of the pseudocapacitive contribution is usually distinguished and quantified according to the Dunn's work. As shown in Figure c,d, the pseudocapacitive contribution of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 is ≈65%. As the scan rate increases, the ratio of pseudocapacitive contribution increases and it can reach 95% at 1.0 mV s−1. In contrast, the Co9S8/3DNCF electrode shows lower percentages of the capacitive contribution at all scan rates (Figure S14, Supporting Information), deteriorating the sodiation/desodiation kinetics and leading poor rate performance and cycle stability. The high ratio of the capacitive contribution significantly boosts the rate performance and cycle stability of Co9S8@C/3DNCF anode for SIBs. The microstructure of cycled Co9S8@C/3DNCF electrode after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 was investigated. Postmortem SEM images (Figure e) verify that the robust architectures of Co9S8@C/3DNCF are largely maintained, except all the particles are covered by a thick SEI layer. It is also worth noting that the Co9S8 NPs are still anchored well on surface of 3DNCF without severe agglomeration, although they tend to coarsen to be about 100‒120 nm. More remarkably, typical TEM image (Figure f) shows that the Co9S8 NPs are well wrapped by carbon coating layers.\nThe superior electrochemical performances of our fabricated Co9S8@C/3DNCF composite in terms of high capacity, remarkable rate capability, and ultralong cycle life can be ascribed to a rational integration of the following prominent advantages. First, the robust architecture with Co9S8 NPs chemically anchored on 3DNCF substrate via C\uf8ffS and Co\uf8ffN bonds can not only ensure convenient transport pathways for the electronics, but also prevent the NPs from peeling off the backbone during long‐term cycling. Second, the strong coordinate covalent bonds between the MA sponge and metal ions result in the uniform dispersion of the Co9S8@C NPs on the 3DNCF substrate, which can effectively prevent the agglomeration of nanoscaled Co9S8 in the repeated charge–discharge process. Third, the introduce of glucose in the fabrication process can prevent the coarsening of the Co9S8 during annealing process, and then can shorten the diffusion paths of Na+ and provide more active sites for the sodiation/desodiation reaction. Last but not least, the outer nanocarbon layer can increase the electronic conductivity of the composite as well as accommodate the volume expansion under the huge volume changes.\nConsidering the exceptional sodium storage performances in half cells, we then investigate the electrochemical performance of the Co9S8@C/3DNCF composite in flexible pouch‐type full cell (Figure a) with Na3V2(PO4)3@C as the cathode (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The weight ratio of the Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode to Co9S8@C anode is calculated based on their stabilized capacities, and fixed to be 5 (the capacity ratio of the cathode/anode is 1.1:1). To compensate the consumption of Na+ in the generation of a uniform SEI film, the Co9S8@C/3DNCF anode was electrochemically presodiated in half cell. As shown in Figure b, the as‐fabricated full cell can demonstrate an exciting capacity of 377.4 mAh g−1 with an ICE of 90.2% at 0.5 A g−1 (normalized to the weight of anode material). Most important, the full battery exhibits a prominent capacity retention of 92.1% after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 (Figure c). Meanwhile, the flexible battery can power a light‐emitting diode (LED) (2 V, 20 mW) under curving condition (Figure d–h).\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Ltd., Sichuan, China. Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (Mn(Ac)2), Fe(CH3COO)2 (Fe(Ac)2), CoCl2·6H2O, Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (Ni(Ac)2), ZnNO3·6H2O, NH4H2PO4, NH4VO3, and Na2CO3 were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.\nMaterials Synthesis: First, the MA sponge (0.5 cm in thickness) was cut into several pieces with the identical size of 4 cm × 4 cm, washed with ethanol, and dried overnight. Typically, 177 mg of CoCl2·6H2O, 142.5 mg of TAA, and 32.5 mg of glucose were dissolved in a mixture solvent composed of 50 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of distilled water at room temperature. Subsequently, the MA sponge was placed into the above solution and taken out drying at 80 °C to harvest the precursor (MA‐CoCl2‐TAA). The MA‐CoCl2‐TAA was heated at 700 °C for 2 h in flow N2 to fabricate the Co9S8@C/3DNCF. The procedures for synthesizing MnS@C/3DNCF, FeS@C/3DNCF, Ni3S2@C/3DNCF, and ZnS@C/3DNCF were the same as that for the Co9S8@C/3DNCF except that the CoCl2 was replaced by Mn(Ac)2, Fe(Ac)2, Ni(Ac)2, and ZnNO3, respectively. For comparison, the Co9S8/3DNCF composites were prepared using the same procedure for Co9S8@C/3DNCF just with the absence of glucose. To prepare Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode, NH4H2PO4, NH4VO3, Na2CO3, and glucose with a mole ratio of 3:2:1.5:0.15 were first mixed by ball milling (with a speed of 500 rpm) for 5 h in acetone solution, and then the mixtures were dried at 80 °C, and further annealed at 700 °C under a hydrogen/nitrogen mixture atmosphere.\nMaterials Characterization: The morphologies of the samples were characterized by FESEM (Hitachi S‐8100), TEM, scanning TEM (STEM), SAED, and high‐resolution TEM (JEM‐2010, JEOL, 200 KV) with an X‐ray spectrometer attached to the TEM instrument. The samples were analyzed by XPS (Thermo K‐Alpha XPS spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The phase structures were characterized by XRD (Bruker D8, Germany) operating with Cu Kα radiation. The mass of TMS in TMS@C/3DNCF was measured by an ICP‐atomic emission spectrometry (Agilent‐720). Raman spectroscopy was obtained on an AXIS ULTRA DLD instrument with Renishaw RM1000 micro spectroscopic system.\nElectrochemical Evaluation: The as‐synthesized TMS@C/3DNCF was directly served as flexible electrode. The half cells were fabricated in an Ar‐filled glove box. The load mass of active materials on every disc was about 0.5–1.1 mg cm−2. The electrolyte was 1.0 m solution of NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1 in volume) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate. The sodium storage capabilities were evaluated at 0.01–3.0 V (vs Na+/Na) on LAND testing instrument. CV was recorded with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua, Shanghai) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was collected on the electrochemical workstation in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Before the full‐cell fabrication, the Co9S8@C/3DNCF anode was electrochemically presodiated via discharging–charging for three cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 in half cells.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Mesoporous amorphous FePO4 was first synthesized through the chemical induced precipitation, and then mixed with sodium and phosphate sources to obtain M‐NFPF@C composite through the ball‐milling method and subsequent calcination process. In order to confirm the formation of the mesoporous amorphous FePO4 and the M‐NFPF@C product, X‐ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is shown in Figure a. It is clearly found that there is only a wide peak detected in the XRD pattern for FePO4 material, indicating an amorphous characteristic. For the final products, both M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C samples show the same diffraction peaks, which can be well indexed to orthorhombic space group of Pbcn of Na2FePO4F structure. The sharp peaks indicate good crystallinity of the Na2FePO4F particles. The orthorhombic Na2FePO4F exhibits a layer framework of face‐sharing Fe octahedral coordinating to four oxygen and two fluorine ions (the inset of Figure a). The Fe2O6F3 bi‐octahedra units are connected by corner‐sharing (via F2) to other pairs of Fe face‐shared octahedral along a direction. The chains of corner‐sharing Fe octahedra are connected through of PO43− tetrahedra along the c‐direction. Two independent sodium atoms occupy two different sites, namely, Na(1) and Na(2), which are both [6 + 1] coordination. The sodium ions at Na(2) sites can be removed more easily upon oxidation process than Na(1) sites because of the smaller bond populations and the slightly greater repulsion when ionic interactions (Fe2+–Na+) are considered toward Na(2)‐site ions. Thus, a theoretical capacity of 124 mAh g−1 is obtained on the basis of the reversible insertion/extraction of the Na ions at Na(2) sites. The carbon contents of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C are 0.64 and 3.4%, respectively, measured by the elemental analyzer.\nNitrogen sorption isotherms are generated to investigate the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface and the porous structure of the sample. As shown in Figure b, an obvious hysteresis loop indicates microporous structure characteristics of the composites. The specific surface area of the M‐NFPF@C was calculated to be 31.9 m2 g−1, whereas that of the M‐NFPF was only 5.4 m2 g−1, suggesting that the carbon coating not only maintains hierarchical pore structure but also immensely enhances specific surface area of the material. A detailed statistics on the pore size distribution is also employed. As displayed in the inset of Figure b, the average pore sizes are about 8 and 12 nm for M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C, respectively. The pore size is similar to the FePO4 (10 nm),which can be checked in previous published article by our group, while smaller average pore size of the M‐NFPF@C than the M‐NFPF corresponds to a filling effect due to carbon coating. The results demonstrate that both the M‐NFPF@C and M‐NFPF composites still remain the mesoporous architecture of the FePO4 precursor.\nFigure  shows some typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C samples. The as‐prepared M‐NFPF with little carbon content shows the primary particle sizes of 100 nm (Figure a). As a comparison, the M‐NFPF@C sample exhibits reducing primary particle size about 70 nm, indicating that aggregation is effectively suppressed. A small particle size could shorten the Na+ diffusion distance and provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions, which can be beneficial to the rate capability. As shown in Figure d, a carbon coating layer of about 4 nm can be seen clearly in the high‐resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image for M‐NFPF@C sample. Figure e shows the HRTEM image of the FePO4, which can confirm an amorphous nature because no discernible lattice fringe can be observed. Moreover, uniform distribution of Na, Fe, P, O, and F in Na2FePO4F@C particles was measured by energy‐dispersive X‐ray (EDX) mapping of the elements shown in Figure f. Thus, the M‐NFPF@C with uniform carbon coating, small particle size, hierarchical pore structure, and large surface area can be beneficial to the ionic and electronic diffusion and the infiltration of the electrolyte, and provide more electrochemical active sites, which should improve the electrochemical reversibility.\nFigure  displays the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C composites. The typical CV curves of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C electrodes at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the potential range of 2–4 V (vs Na/Na+) are shown in Figure a. For M‐NFPF@C composite, two couples of symmetric redox peaks are located at 3.00/3.16 and 2.82/2.95 V respectively, corresponding to two different Na+/vacancy ordering states during the redox reaction of Fe2+↔Fe3+. However, the M‐NFPF shows more broad and unsymmetric redox peaks, implying poor kinetic behavior because of the lack of conductive network compared to the M‐NFPF@C electrode. Figure b exhibits the typical charge–discharge profiles of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C electrodes cycled in the voltage region of 2–4 V at 0.2 C (1 C refers to 124 mA g−1). The M‐NFPF@C electrode shows two distinct voltage plateaus around 3.07 and 2.91 V, which corresponds to the following reaction.Na2FeIIPO4F−e−⇌Na1.5FePO4F+0.5Na+Na1.5FePO4F−e−⇌NaFeIIIPO4F+0.5Na+\nInterestingly, the total plateau capacity of the M‐NFPF@C electrode reaches more than 90 mAh g−1. However, the M‐NFPF electrode exhibits sloping discharge/charge curve and no obvious potential plateau can be observed. This suggests that the carbon coating can immensely promote the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. In previous studies, most of Na2FePO4F materials showed absent or barely visible plateau capacity. The comparison of different works can be shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Compared to these, our work shows preferable reversible electrochemical characteristics of sodium‐ion insertion and extraction for Na2FePO4F material. This might result from the use of mesopores FePO4 and efficient carbon coating to construct the ionic and electronic highway in the Na2FePO4F material. The reversible capacity of the M‐NFPF@C electrode is 110 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, which is much higher than that of the M‐NFPF electrode (93.5 mAh g−1) at the same current density (Figure b). The difference on the reversible capacity can be explained as follows: M‐NFPF@C electrode has conductive carbon matrix and the large specific surface, which effectively improve the electron transport rate and shorten the transport distance of the Na+ so as to promote the electrochemical utilization of the material.\nFigure a compares the rate capability of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C electrodes at various current densities. The M‐NFPF@C electrode shows the discharge capacities of 114, 110, 105, 96, 82, and 58 mAh g−1 at the rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively. Even at the high rate of 10 C, the M‐NFPF@C electrode can display a capacity of 42 mAh g−1. When the current rate return to the low rate (0.1 C), this electrode can deliver a capacity of 110 mAh g−1, corresponding to almost 96% capacity retention compared to its initial capacity. For comparison, the M‐NFPF electrode shows poor rate capability. When the current rate rises to 5 C, the reversible capacity of the M‐NFPF electrode drops almost to zero. Figure b displays the cycling ability of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C electrode at the current of 1 C. It can be seen that M‐NFPF@C electrode also shows a high capacity retention of 80% over 100 cycles compared to the M‐NFPF electrode (45%). Additionally, Figure c shows the long‐term cycling ability (55% of its initial capacity over 600 cycles) of the M‐NFPF@C electrode at 5 C. The improved electrochemical properties can be attributed to the reduced particle size and the increased specific surface area caused by the coating of the carbon matrix, which can be beneficial to the electrochemical properties of the material.\nThe Na+ ion diffusion coefficient (DNa+) is an important factor to influence the rate capability of the electrode. Thus, the DNa+ of the M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C electrodes is determined from the low‐frequency Warburg contribution of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The equation for DNa+ based on the EIS response can be written asDNa+=12VmFSAWdEdx2where Vm is the molar volume of the Na2FePO4F (Vm = 64.13 cm3 mol−1), F is the Faraday constant (F = 96 485.4 C mol−1), S is the area of the active cathode material (S = 1.13 cm2), Aw is the Warburg coefficient derived from the average value of the slope of Z′ and −Z″ versus ω−1/2 plots (Aw = 143.6 for Na2FePO4F@C and 428.3 for Na2FePO4F), dE/dx is the differential of the galvanostatic titration curve (dE/dx = 0.658 for M‐NFPF@C and 0.686 for M‐NFPF). As shown in Figure , the DNa+ in the layered M‐NFPF@C and M‐NFPF calculated are 3.63 × 10−12 and 4.44 × 10−13 cm2 s−1, respectively. The improved DNa+ in the M‐NFPF @C is obviously related to the decrease of the particle size and the carbon coating.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, 0.02 mol (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 and NH4H2PO4 were dissolved in deionized water, respectively. Then, NH4H2PO4 solution was added slowly into (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 solution to form a uniform solution under vigorous stirring. After that, 4 mL of 30 wt% H2O2 solution acted as an oxidizer was added dropwise into the aforesaid solution. The mixing solution was stirred for another 2 h to produce milky white amorphous FePO4·3H2O precipitation. Finally, the FePO4·3H2O precursor was dehydrated at 400 °C for 24 h in air to form mesoporous amorphous FePO4.\nPreparation of Mesoporous Na2FePO4F@C (M‐NFPF@C) Composite: M‐NFPF@C composite was prepared through a simple ball‐milling and further calcination method. First, the stoichiometric ratio of CH3COONa, NaF, and mesoporous FePO4 was added into a high‐energy ball‐milling vial. To reduce Fe3+ citric acid (FePO4:citric acid = 3:1) was also added during the ball‐milling. Then the ball milling vial was grounded under Ar atmosphere for 6 h to obtain the precursor. Finally, the precursor was sintered for 6\u2005h at 600\u2005°C in Ar atmosphere to obtain M‐NFPF@C composite. For comparison, the bare Na2FePO4F (M‐NFPF) was also prepared by similar synthesis process with decreasing the amount of citric acid (FePO4:citric acid = 5:1) to only ensure the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+.\nMaterial Characterization: XRD was carried out by using Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (40\u2005kV, 40\u2005mA). The 2θ range was from 10° to 50° with a scan rate of 2° min−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and elemental distribution mappings were obtained using a Zeiss Merlin Compact instrument (ZEISS Merlin Compact, Germany), and an Oxford X‐MaxN probe (INCAPentalFETx3, Oxford Instruments, Britain), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed by using a JEM‐2010FEF instrument (JEOL, Japan). The carbon content was measured by elemental analysis using an elemental analyer (Vario EL, Germany). The specific surface area and pore structure of the materials were analyzed using nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements by surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP 2020 HD88, USA).\nElectrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical characterizations were carried out using a half‐cell, with an as‐prepared material as the working electrode and a homemade Na piece as the counter electrode. All the cells were assembled in a glove box with water and oxygen content lower than 0.1 ppm and tested at room temperature. The M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C electrodes were prepared by mixing active material, acetylene black, and 4% poly(vinyldifluoride) (PVDF) in a N‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (DMF) solution in a ratio of 7:2:1 by weight. The area of the electrode was 1.13\u2005cm2, while the average loading of the material was about 1.5\u2005mg\u2005cm−2. The electrolyte was 1\u2005mol\u2005L−1 NaClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC, 1:1, v/v) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Cyclic voltammetry tests were performed using a CHI660C electrochemical work station (ChenHua Instruments Co., China) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the range from 2 to 4\u2005V. EIS measurements were conducted in the frequency range from 10\u2005mHz to100\u2005kHz on both M‐NFPF and M‐NFPF@C electrodes using an AutoLab PGSTAT 128N (EcoChemie, Netherlands). Before the EIS tests, the electrodes were relaxed for 4\u2005h. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement was performed using a LAND cycler (Wuhan Kingnuo Electronic Co., China) in the voltage range 2.0–4.0\u2005V.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The co‐intercalation of the solvent does not occur in the same apparatus as that of the carbonate electrolyte. The structural changes of the graphite materials in the ether‐based electrolytes are characterized by high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Graphite has a regular layered structure (Figure\xa0,). However, the structure becomes asymmetrical with a non‐uniform distance between the graphite layers after the electrodes are discharged in the ether‐based electrolyte (Figure\xa0). This is confirmed by the schematic of the co‐intercalation of the solvated Na‐ions (Figure\xa0). The results of Raman spectroscopy reveal that the occurrence of co‐intercalation in the ether‐based electrolytes significantly reduces the degree of graphitization; however, the ordering of the materials returns to the original state after charging (Figure\xa0) that is consistent with the results of X‐ray diffraction (XRD) in the literature.[] Furthermore, it demonstrates the high reversibility of the graphite structure. In addition, the electrochemical performance of graphite in the ether‐based electrolytes is markedly different from that in the carbonate‐based electrolytes (Figure\xa0). The reduction at ≈ 0.5\xa0V during the first discharge process corresponds to the decomposition of the carbonate‐based electrolyte and the formation of the SEI on the graphite surface. However, no redox reactions occur during the subsequent charge/discharge processes (Figure\xa0). In the ether‐based electrolytes, the voltage platform at ≈ 0.6\xa0V (Figure\xa0) corresponds to the intercalation of the solvated Na ions and the formation of a stable ternary compound Na(solv)xCy.[] Since the Na‐GICs are unstable, the graphite anode exhibits a low capacity (<30\xa0mAh\xa0g−1) in the carbonate‐based electrolyte without the involvement of carbonate solvents (Figure\xa0). The cells that utilize the diglyme‐based electrolyte exhibit a relatively stable cyclic performance at 50 mA g−1 (Figure\xa0; furthermore, the capacity of the graphite increases slightly after cycling, which indicates that the adsorption sites of solvated sodium ions in graphite increase under the huge volume changes. Generally, the structural stability of the electrode material will gradually decrease with the increasing current density; however, the opposite trend is observed for the co‐intercalation (Figure S1, Supporting Information). One should note the capacity is increased by only 6% under the huge volume expansion, which exactly shows that the graphite structure is highly stable during the cycle. The initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) for the graphite electrode in the ether‐based electrolyte (64.9%) is higher than that for the graphite electrode in the carbonate‐based electrolyte (20.4%). This indicates that the redox activity of the carbonate‐based electrolyte is higher than that of the ether‐based electrolyte. Moreover, the high coulombic efficiencies (99.5%) in the subsequent cycles indicate that if the SEI existed, then it does not crack and re‐form during cycling.\nThe AC impedance method is utilized for a detailed analysis of the interphase between the electrode and electrolyte (Figure\xa0,). The kinetic behavior of the electrode is reflected by a specific frequency in the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The Randles model states that the EIS comprises the following four components: 1) RS is the bulk resistance of the cell at high frequencies (104–105\xa0Hz) that reflects the combined resistance of the electrolyte, separator, and electrodes. 2) RSEI and CPE1 are the resistance and capacitance, respectively, of the ion diffusion inside the SEI on the surfaces of the two electrodes at approximately 101–102\xa0Hz. 3) Rct and CPE2 are the charge‐transfer resistance and its relative double‐layer capacitance, respectively, at medium frequencies (1–10−1\xa0Hz). 4)\xa0W is the Warburg impedance that is related to the semi‐infinite diffusion of the Na ions or solvated Na ions inside the electrode materials. It corresponds to the sloping line at the low frequency (10−2\xa0Hz) end of the Nyquist plot. The EIS plots for both electrolytes (Figure\xa0) show two partially overlapping semicircles, which correspond to the impedances of SEI and charge‐transfer, and a straight sloping line at the low‐frequency end. The feature semicircle followed by the charge transfer semicircle confirms the presence of the SEI despite the overlapping with the contact impedance (see details in Supporting Information when the voltage (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information), loading (Figure S4, Supporting Information), and pressure (Figure S5, Supporting Information) of the cell are varied). An equivalent circuit (Figure\xa0) can fit the aforementioned pattern of the EIS.[] The impedance‐fitting data for the carbonate‐ and ether‐based electrolytes (Table S1, Supporting Information) show the similarity in RS for both the electrolytes. RSEI for graphite in the ether‐based electrolyte (15.63 Ω) (Figure\xa0) is significantly lower than that in the carbonate‐based electrolyte (140.7 Ω) (Figure\xa0) at approximately 102\xa0Hz. This reveals the fast kinetics of ion diffusion across the interphase. The charge transfer is represented by a frequency of approximately 1\xa0Hz. The results indicate that Rct in the ether‐based electrolyte (53.37 Ω) is significantly lower than that in the carbonate‐based electrolyte (105 Ω). Therefore, an SEI layer is formed on the surface of the graphite electrodes in the ether‐based electrolytes. This interphase exhibits a low impedance of RSEI that facilitates the de‐intercalation of the solvated Na ions and the rapid formation of ternary compounds in the form of Na(solv)xCy. Meanwhile, the low charge‐transfer impedance reflects the fast redox reaction at the surface of the graphite electrode in the ether‐based electrolyte. The combination of the low interfacial ionic diffusion resistance and the low charge‐transfer resistance benefit the fast intercalation kinetics of the graphite electrodes in SIBs.\nThe excellent mechanical properties of the SEI in the ether‐based electrolytes are expected due to the huge volume changes of the graphite anode material during cycling. The ether‐derived SEI on the surface of the graphite electrode is tolerant to huge volume changes. AFM is performed to study the mechanical properties and determine the physicochemical state of the ether‐derived SEI. The pressing (Figure\xa0) and rising (Figure\xa0) of the indenter on the graphite electrode (before cycle) confirm the presence of the SEI in both electrolytes. The Young's modulus of graphite is 1.99\xa0GPa, and the viscous force is approximately 7.0 nN. The curves in Figure\xa0 indicate the stark difference between the mechanical properties of the graphite surface in the carbonate‐ and ether‐based electrolytes. To quantify this difference, the Young's modulus and the thicknesses of the SEIs are calculated by the Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) model. The stiffness of the ether‐derived SEI (≈ 435.86\xa0MPa) is higher than that of the carbonate‐derived SEI (≈ 108.5\xa0MPa). The viscous force of the ether‐derived SEI (6.8 nN) (Figure\xa0) is lower than that of the carbonate‐derived SEI (7.2 nN) (Figure\xa0). This indicates the high stiffness of the ether‐derived SEI that is corroborated by the results of the Young's modulus tests. The thickness of the ether‐derived SEI (≈ 5.5\xa0nm) is lower than that of the carbonate‐derived SEI (≈ 15\xa0nm). Therefore, the topography of the surface of graphite electrode in the ether‐based electrolyte (Figure\xa0) is more smooth than that of the graphite electrode in the carbonate‐based electrolyte (Figure\xa0). In a word, surface of the graphite electrode in the ether‐based electrolyte is covered with a layer of the ether‐derived SEI. The high cycle efficiency (≈ 99.5%) and excellent cycle performance (96.6% capacity retention ratio at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 over 860 cycles) of the graphite anode (Figure S6, Supporting Information) are attributed to the thin and stable ether‐derived SEI that possessed a high Young's modulus and tolerance to huge volume changes. In addition, to clear the relationship between SEI thickness and electrochemical performance, the experiment of electrolyte exchange is carried out (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Results indicate that electrochemical properties of the graphite in SIBs are not determined by the thickness of the SEI, but by the composition of SEI.\n\nFormation Mechanism and Components of SEI\nThe excellent mechanical properties of the SEI can be attributed to its components. Theoretical calculations and experiments are performed to detect the components of the SEI. The theoretical calculations determine the formation paths and the possible components of the SEI. The density functional theory (DFT) is utilized to determine the decomposition paths, molecular orbitals, and bond‐dissociation energies of the ethylene carbonate (EC) and diglyme solvents (Figure\xa0). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) value is used to measure the reducing strength of the reactants. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) are used as reference solvents to increase the reliability of the calculation. The LUMO values of diglyme, DEC, EC, and FEC are different (Figure\xa0). FEC exhibits the lowest LUMO value (−0.57\xa0eV) among these solvents, which indicates the preferential decomposition of FEC to form the SEI during reduction. Therefore, FEC is commonly used as an SEI film‐forming additive. The LUMO value of diglyme (1.15\xa0eV) is the highest among the solvents. Furthermore, the LUMO value of EC is lower than that of DEC. Therefore, in the mixed solvents of EC/DEC, SEI is mainly composed of the decomposition products from EC, and not DEC, which is consistent with the current perceptions. The decomposition paths of EC are listed in Figure\xa0\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

It is widely accepted that Ar is the adsorptive of choice when dealing with heteroatom‐rich adsorbents like those encountered in this work, because contrary to, for example, N2, Ar lacks a quadrupole moment and therefore does not exhibit specific interactions with heteroatoms and other energetically heterogeneous areas on the material's surface.[] The higher boiling point further gives rise to better resolved isotherms and increases diffusion rates.[] As presented in Figure\xa0, a IUPAC type I(a) isotherm with a steep uptake in the low relative pressure range is observed for both, C‐HAT‐550 and C‐HAT‐1000. C‐HAT‐550 additionally shows a type H4 hysteresis loop, which in combination with the type I(a) isotherm indicates a considerable amount of “inkbottle” pores (i.e., pores that are only accessible via small necks), inhibiting the equilibrium desorption of Ar. This “cavitation effect” is less pronounced in the isotherms of materials obtained at higher temperatures. C‐HAT‐1000 has a higher total Ar uptake with broader distribution over the low relative pressure range compared to C‐HAT‐550, revealing a higher volume of slightly larger micropores in C‐HAT‐1000. This is confirmed by the DFT‐pore size distributions of the materials in Figure\xa0,, which show that the pore volumes of C‐HAT‐550 and C‐HAT‐1000 are dominated by small micropores with narrow size distribution centered around 1.0 and 1.3\xa0nm, respectively. The specific surface areas (SSAs) of C‐HAT‐550 and C‐HAT‐1000 as determined by the BET as well as the DFT model are summarized in Table\xa0 and have similar values around 700\xa0m²\xa0g−1 for both materials. C‐HAT‐1600 exhibits a type III isotherm, as it is typical for materials with low nanoporosity and prevalent external surface area. Consequently, the detected SSA is as low as 20\xa0m²\xa0g−1 and arises mainly from adsorption on the external particle surface at high relative pressure. It is worth noting, that even though the area accessible to Ar dropped significantly, the pore volume available for the adsorption of CO2 at 273 K reduced by only ≈25% after heating to 1600\xa0°C, which means that during the second heat treatment the porosity did not collapse completely. As the heteroatom content is negligible in C‐HAT‐1600, the size of the remaining pores can be estimated from CO2 physisorption by an NLDFT fit, yielding an average pore size of 0.6\xa0nm (see Table\xa0 and Figure\xa0, Supporting Information). The presence of such pores after thermal treatment is in stark contrast to the behavior of carbohydrate derived hard carbons, where at a carbonization temperature of 1600\xa0°C no CO2 porosity is left.[] From the present physisorption data C‐HAT‐1600 can be best described as a hard carbon material with abundant, but nearly inaccessible micropores.\nThe heteroatom content was determined by elemental analysis and is shown in Table\xa0. With 36\xa0wt% of nitrogen, C‐HAT‐550 is a nitrogen‐rich material rather than a pristine‐ or classical nitrogen‐doped carbon. At higher pyrolysis temperatures the N‐content decreased to 6.57\xa0wt% for C‐HAT‐1000 and 0.41\xa0wt% for C‐HAT‐1600, that is, typical values for nitrogen‐doped carbons. It is already known from previous work that the nitrogen is bound mainly as cyano, pyrazinic, and quaternary nitrogen in C‐HAT‐550.[] With increasing carbonization temperature the amount of cyano and pyrazinic groups diminishes and the relative contribution of the quaternary nitrogen is increasing in C‐HAT‐1000. With an amount of nitrogen as low as 0.41\xa0wt%, C‐HAT‐1600 can hardly be regarded as nitrogen‐doped, as for such low nitrogen contents the impact of adsorbed nitrogen species cannot be ruled out. Chemically it is better described as a rather typical pristine hard carbon with the morphology adapted from the parental material.\nPowder X‐ray diffraction patterns shown in Figure\xa0, Supporting Information, prove the amorphous structure of C‐HAT‐550, which shows only a broad reflex at 27°, as it is typical for highly microporous carbon‐based materials. In the cases of C‐HAT‐1000 and C‐HAT‐1600, a slightly more ordered carbonaceous structure develops with both, the (002) and (100) reflexes being more intense. However, both high‐temperature materials still have a diffraction pattern that is characteristic for porous carbon materials. Especially the comparably low 20\xa0m²\xa0g−1 of SSA detected by Ar physisorption are not at all in line with the shape of XRD pattern of C‐HAT‐1600. The graphene interlayer distance as estimated from the (002) reflex using Bragg's condition is reduced from 3.8\xa0Å in C‐HAT‐1000 to 3.7\xa0Å in C‐HAT‐1600, that is, in both cases well above graphite (3.36 A). The FWHM of the (002) signal slightly decreases at higher synthesis temperatures indicating a slightly improved graphitic‐stacking for C‐HAT‐1600. The two reflexes indicated by asterisks in C‐HAT‐1600 originate from crystalline SiC contaminations from the high temperature oven.[] Nonetheless, the small size of the reflexes compared to the carbon signals and the elemental analysis indicate the amount of the impurity to be small.\nRaman spectroscopy provides valuable insights into the binding motifs of a carbonaceous material. The Raman spectra of the samples are presented in Figure , Supporting Information. Figure  shows a fit of the region between 900 and 1900\xa0cm−1 to a four band model, including the TPA‐, D‐, A‐, and G‐bands, following the method of Hu at al.[] With increasing final heat treatment temperature, the TPA‐ and A‐ bands decrease in intensity as compared to the D‐ and G‐bands. The former two bands originate from trans‐polyacetylene bonds and amorphous carbon regions, respectively, while the presence of D‐ and G‐bands indicates a disordered structure dominated by sp2 carbon. Therefore, it is not surprising to find the D‐ and G‐bands becoming more separated for C‐HAT‐1000, and to prevail the Raman spectrum of C‐HAT‐1600 almost entirely.[] Additionally, the presence of the overtones of the D‐ and G‐bands above 2400\xa0cm−1 hint at a more ordered structure in the carbon network of C‐HAT‐1600.[]\nAccording to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Figure\xa0, the C‐HAT keeps their discoid structure throughout all carbonization temperatures. This fact points at a stable, cross‐linked network formed during the pyrolysis of the HAT‐CN precursor which then undergoes only local structure rearrangements. Further it can be seen that the surface of the C‐HAT discs becomes increasingly smooth and the number of fragments decreases for higher pyrolysis temperatures, which is well in line not only with the observed low porosity in C‐HAT‐1600 determined both by gas sorption. It should be further mentioned that higher conductivity and facilitated electron transport over longer distances is indicated by the higher field emission contrast when doing SEM on C‐HAT‐1600.\nThe morphology is kept throughout the carbonization on TEM‐scale, as well, as can be seen in the bright‐field TEM images in Figure , Supporting Information, where all of them show contorted structures on a size scale of a few tens of nanometers.\n\nRelations between Ar/CO2 Physisorption and Sodium Storage\nIn order to get a first impression of the sodium storage characteristics of carbonized HAT‐CN materials, charge–discharge curves have been recorded at a current density as low as 18.6\xa0mA\xa0g−1 in a voltage window between 2.5 and 0\xa0V. Such a low current density enables the study of the charge storage mechanism under equilibrium conditions without running into mass transfer restrictions and other systematic limitations. Typical first and fifth sodiation/desodiation cycles of each studied material are shown in Figure\xa0, as by the fifth cycle the system is found to be stable and invariant enough to represent the materials’ reversible sodiation behavior, the first four cycles are shown in Figure , Supporting Information.\nAll of the materials have in common that the sodiation capacity retention between the first and the first stable cycle is rather low, with retentions between 25% and 34%. This behavior is potentially problematic for the practical application of the material as it would mean a significant loss of electrolyte during the first cycle.\nThe very high capacity in the first cycle of C‐HAT‐550 is further noteworthy if viewed outside of the context of subsequent cycles. The first sodiation capacity of C‐HAT‐550 is almost double that of C‐HAT‐1000, suggesting a connection between heteroatom content of the materials framework and the first cycle capacity. A significant portion of the current measured during the first cycle is therefore apparently due to SEI‐formation including irreversible reactions facilitated by the large nitrogen content of C‐HAT‐550.\nOn the other hand, C‐HAT‐1600 shows an Ar surface area of 20\xa0m²\xa0g−1 but a first sodiation capacity comparable to C‐HAT‐1000 with an Ar BET‐surface area of 750\xa0m²\xa0g−1. Considering the relatively high CO2 uptake of both materials it can be concluded that electrolyte molecules and ions are able to enter pores inaccessible to probe gases like Ar and, considering the comparable boiling point and molecular dimensions, most likely also N2 at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, CO2 at 273\xa0K is a more suitable probe gas to estimate the “electrochemically active surface area” of such a material during the first cycle. From a\xa0physisorption perspective, this is related not only to its slightly smaller kinetic diameter (Ar: 0.34\xa0nm, CO2: 0.33\xa0nm)[] and higher polarizability, but mainly originates from the higher temperature at which the sorption experiment is conducted.

On the other hand, phase stability of P2‐type Fe/Mn‐based layered material is hindered by phase transition at high voltage region and Jahn–Teller distortion at low voltage region. As explained above, we have exploited formation of multiphase layered oxide by substitution of non‐transition metal element in order to minimize undesirable phase transition. In this exploration, we selected P2‐type Na0.67Fe0.25Mn0.75O2 (P2‐FMO) as a model compound and conducted lithium doping at the transition metal sites, thus achieving Na0.67Li0.1Fe0.225Mn0.675O2 (P2‐LFMO) and Na0.67Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2 (P2/O3‐LFMO). The lithium substitution increased from 0.0 to 0.2, while the total amount of Mn and Fe decreased from 1.0 to 0.8. Since the ratio between Fe and Mn is one of the key factors that affects phase transition behavior and electrochemical performance, the stoichiometric ratio of 1:3 for Fe and Mn was maintained constant for all three compounds on purpose to minimize the effect from the different Fe/Mn ratio.[] The final composition of samples were confirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP‐OES) analysis in Table , Supporting Information, and detailed experimental procedures are summarized in the Experimental Section.\nIn terms of understanding structure–electrochemical property relationships, it is critical to understand the substitution site and configuration within a layered structure. Previous studies have discovered that the lithium substitution can take place in either alkali or transition‐metal sites.[] Therefore, we utilized both synchrotron powder X‐ray diffraction (SPXRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) to examine the crystal structures of the synthesized compounds and substitution site of lithium.\nThe SPXRD patterns and corresponding hkl indices are summarized in Figure\xa0 and Rietveld refinement result are summarized in the Supporting Information (Figure  and Tables –, Supporting Information). All diffraction peaks of Na0.67Fe0.25Mn0.75O2 (P2‐FMO) well matched with the P2‐type layered structure (space group: P63/mmc). With Na0.67Li0.1Fe0.225Mn0.675O2 (P2‐LFMO) compound, the diffraction pattern confirmed the pure P2 phase with the emergence of superstructure (space group: P63). In detail, the diffraction peaks at 20.15° and 21.65° correspond to the √3a\xa0×\xa0√3a\xa0× c superlattice of P2‐type layered structure (Figure\xa0).[] The formation of superstructure strongly suggests the possibility of transition metal ordering, which is mainly originated from the difference in the ionic radii of elements in the transition metal layers.[] In the P2‐FMO with the chemical formula of Na0.67Fe0.25Mn0.75O2, 56% of Mn has 4+ oxidation state while the rest of Mn and all Fe has 3+ state, that is, Na0.67Fe(III)0.25[Mn(III)0.56Mn(IV)0.44]0.75O2, in order to satisfy charge neutrality.[] Since the Fe and Mn exhibit similar ionic radii at the same oxidation state, they are mostly randomly mixed and thereby would not cause strong transition metal ordering. When lithium substitutes transition metals, however, all Mn atoms oxidize to 4+ state, leading to a notable difference in ionic radius between Mn4+ (0.53 Å) and other cations (0.65 Å and 0.76 Å for Fe3+ and Li+, respectively).[] This would cause cation ordering within the transition metal layers. Therefore, the presence of lithium induces the ordering of Fe and Li, that is, superstructure.\nThe SPXRD pattern of Na0.67Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2 (P2/O3‐LFMO) well‐matched with the P2 phase with √3a\xa0×\xa0√3a\xa0× c superlattice (space group P63), O3 phase (R3¯m), and Li2MnO3 impurity phase, with the fraction of 89.1, 6.6, and 4.3%, respectively (Figure , Supporting Information). As mentioned, while P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO display pure P2‐type structure, P2/O3‐LFMO exhibits P2/O3 biphasic structure, which indicates that increasing substitution of lithium induced the formation of O3 phase. Based on previous reports, it is expected that the P2 and O3‐type structure of P2/O3‐LFMO formed intergrown composite.[] Also, P2/O3‐LFMO showed more intense and sharp superstructure peaks, suggesting that the substituted lithium is located at the transition metal site more regularly. The superstructure and substitution site of lithium in the P2/O3‐LFMO were further confirmed by Rietveld refinement of NPD patterns (Figure\xa0). The occupancy of Mn, Fe, and lithium were refined in the three different transition metal sites. The pattern was best refined when the lithium is mostly located at Li3 site, whereas the Mn is mainly on Mn1 and Mn2 sites, displaying that Li is surrounded by Mn. The refined superstructure and its schematic illustration are provided in Table , Supporting Information, and Figure\xa0, respectively.\nDFT calculations also confirmed that that the refined honeycomb‐ordered Li and Fe are energetically more stable than disordered cases (Figure , Supporting Information). Interestingly, Figure , Supporting Information, shows that the stability of the Li–Fe–Mn mixed phases are linearly correlated with the electrostatic energy of the system. It indicates that the cation ordering of lower‐charged species (Li and Fe) minimizes the electrostatic repulsion of the system, contributing to the formation of the superstructure in addition to the above‐mentioned ionic radius difference.\nIt is worth mentioning that all diffraction peaks in P2/O3‐LFMO have a sharp peak profile compared to the other cases, indicating the high crystallinity and less stacking faults. In comparison, P2‐FMO exhibited anisotropic full width at half maximum (FWHM) values: 0.111, 0.394, and 0.494 for (100), (102), and (104) peaks, respectively. It implies worse periodicity along the interlayer direction (c‐axis) compared to planar direction (ab‐plane), which can be attributed to strong presence of stacking faults in the P2‐type layered structure.[] In addition, based on the broadness of the (104) and (102) peaks compared to the (100) peak, the degree of stacking fault in P2‐LFMO seems less severe than P2‐FMO. The result may indicate that substitution of lithium induced formation of more defect‐free layered structure under given synthesis condition.\n\nElectrochemical Measurements as Na‐Ion Battery Cathodes\nOn the basis of the above discussion, we set the electrochemical study to investigate the impact of lithium substitution at the layered structure. The electrode is composed of active materials, carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, in a weight ratio of 80:10:10, respectively. All the electrochemical analysis was conducted with the CR2032 coin‐cell configuration. The galvanostatic measurements were performed in the range of 1.5–4.5\xa0V, hereafter, and all the potentials are based on V versus Na/Na+.\nThe first discharge capacities of the P2‐FMO, P2‐LFMO, and P2/O3‐LFMO were 122, 144, and 196 mAh g–1, while the first discharge capacities were 215, 208, and 227 mAh g−1, respectively, at a scan rate of 10\xa0mA g−1 (Figure\xa0). The relatively low initial charge capacity of the P2‐FMO can be attributed to low Na content and mixed oxidation state of as‐synthesized materials, as is often observed in P2‐type layered oxides. On the other hand, the redox reaction of transition metal elements could not solely explain the high initial charge capacity of the P2/O3‐LFMO, suggesting that other charge compensation and redox mechanism may be at play. The possible charge compensation and anion redox will be explored in a later section. The charge capacities and coulombic efficiencies are shown in Figure , Supporting Information. The P2‐FMO compound exhibited rapid capacity decay throughout the cycling (Figure\xa0). The P2‐LFMO and P2/O3‐LFMO displayed relatively large capacity decline during the initial five cycles and became stabilized in the consecutive cycles. We suspect this initial capacity loss may be attributed to the irreversible oxygen evolution reaction or lithium extraction.[] Nonetheless, the P2/O3‐LFMO displayed superior cycling performance than the other samples (Figure\xa0). P2/O3‐LFMO retained 158.7 mAh g–1 capacity after 60 cycles, showing 83.5% capacity retention compared to the capacity of the 6th cycle, which is significantly higher than the capacity retention of P2‐FMO (5.4%) and P2‐LFMO (6.5%). Under a higher current density of 50\xa0mA g−1 (Figure , Supporting Information), P2/O3‐LFMO also performed excellent cycling stability, reaching 99.9% capacity retention during 120 cycles in reference to the capacity of 6th cycle.\nWe measured the rate capability by ratcheting up the current density from 10 to 600\xa0mA g−1 (Figure\xa0). P2/O3‐LFMO compounds displayed outstanding rate performance, where the discharge capacity was preserved as much as 73 mAh g−1 when the current was increased to 60 folds (600\xa0mA g−1). Meanwhile, both P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO displayed less than 10 mAh g–1, as the current rate increased to higher than 200 and 400\xa0mA g−1, respectively. It should be noted that the capacity retention in these results is affected by both cycle stability and rate capability. Even with excluding the cyclic degradation as described in Figure , Supporting Information, P2/O3‐LFMO exhibited better rate performance than the other electrodes. This result is rather unexpected since the O3 phase often displays slower kinetics than the P2 phase in terms of the sodium ion migration.[] Our outcomes indicate that incorporating a marginal O3 phase did not deteriorate but instead improved the rate capability of the P2/O3‐LFMO electrode. We strongly suspect the increased rate capability of P2/O3‐LFMO is resulted from improvement in structural properties such as phase transition behavior and structure stability, even if the O3 phase may hinder the intercalation of sodium. The underlying mechanism of improved electrochemical performance by incorporating the O3 phase are discussed in the forthcoming sections.\nPrevious studies have reported that pure P2‐type layered structures are prone to structural degradation, on account of phase changes at the high potential range. Hence, we performed galvanostatic measurements with different cut‐off potentials (Figure\xa0), in order to determine the high potential stability. As shown in Figure\xa0, the initial specific capacity with cut‐off potential of 4.5V\xa0is more or less the same for three samples; however, when the cut‐off potential is set to 4.0\xa0V (Figure\xa0), the specific capacity was P2‐FMO > P2‐LFMO > P2/O3‐LFMO in its decreasing order. It indicates that less sodium ions were (de)intercalated in P2/O3‐LFMO at this potential range (1.5–4.0\xa0V); that is, the P2/O3‐LFMO has a higher redox potential. This result reflects the successful incorporation of Li since the substitution of transition metals with Li increases the oxidation state of transition metals and thus elevates the average redox potential.\nWhen the charge cut‐off voltage was increased to 4.2\xa0V, all samples exhibited increased specific capacities. Apparently, increment of the cut‐off voltage resulted in further extraction of sodium at high potential region. Therefore, capacity increment with raising the cut‐off voltage is noticeable in P2/O3‐LFMO which has lower sodium utilization below 4.2\xa0V.\nAs the charge cut‐off voltage was further increased to 4.5\xa0V, noteworthy changes were observed in the trends for capacity retention and voltage profile. We confirmed severe capacity decay for both P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO, implying that the stability of P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO was significantly diminished at the high voltage range of 4.2–4.5V. To our surprise, P2/O3‐LFMO compound consistently exhibited stable capacity even at higher cut‐off voltages. In the voltage range of 4.2–4.5\xa0V, we confirmed a gradual capacity increment up to 137.5 mAh g–1 during the initial few cycles. A proposed explanation for this observation is that the layer structure experiences gradual activation of redox reaction by further extraction of sodium without experiencing structure degradation.\nThe P2/O3‐LFMO compound still maintained stable capacity retention even after adjusting the voltage to 4.2\xa0V, preserving 84.5 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles. From these potential‐wise electrochemical measurements, it was confirmed that the capacity decay of the P2‐FMO and P2‐LFMO observed in Figure\xa0 is attributed to the high voltage operation. Furthermore, the result provides an insight that substitution of lithium and formation of biphasic structure can be a key to resolve electrochemical performance degradation at high voltage region. The phase transition behavior and structure stability at the high voltage range will be further analyzed and discussed in the later sections.\n\nIn Situ Synchrotron Powder X‐Ray Diffraction Analysis\nIn order to reveal the phase transition and identify the role of the biphasic structure and lithium substitution, we conducted in situ XRD analysis. Figure\xa0 displays in situ XRD patterns of P2‐FMO during the first cycle. The peaks derived from P2‐type layered structure — (002), (100), and (102) — are clearly identified at the initial state. The gradual shift of (100) and (102) peaks toward a high angle during the charging process indicates a decrease in lattice parameter a (=b), which reflects the oxidation of transition metals. The (002) peak at around 16° slightly shifted toward a low angle with the deinsertion of sodium. As deinsertion of sodium continues, however, its behavior changes in two aspects: the peak splits into two and its evolution begins at high voltage. As the voltage reached close to 4.5\xa0V, the (002) peak correlated with the P2‐type structure decreased significantly, while a new peak was observed around 17–18°. The occurrence of a new phase can be identified as the “Z” phase, corresponding with previous study.[] Phase transition of P2 to “Z” phase occurs by slab gliding in the layered structure. Similar to P2–O2 phase transition, the slab gliding in P2‐“Z” phase transition occurs randomly in two different directions, resulting in stacking faults as cycles are repeated. Therefore, this phase transition at a high voltage region can deteriorate the original crystal structure and electrochemical performances. This in situ XRD data agrees well with the abrupt capacity decay of the P2‐FMO after operating at high voltage (Figure\xa0). In addition, we also confirmed a peak around 37.2°, which reflects the formation of P'2‐type layered structure, at low voltage (i.e., highly sodiated) region. The P'2‐type structure is a distorted form of P2‐type layered structure and the formation of P'2‐type structure provides the solid evidence of undergoing Jahn–Teller distortion by Mn3+.[] The P2‐“Z” phase transition at high voltage region and the formation of distorted structure at low voltage region potentially resulted in low cycling performance of the P2‐FMO compound.\nThe in situ XRD patterns of P2/O3‐LFMO (Figure\xa0) confirmed the coexistence of P2 and O3 phases at the pristine state: in addition to the aforementioned P2 peaks, (003) and (104) peaks for the O3 phase were clearly observed. Notably, in contrast to the P2‐FMO case, we could not find any indications of a new phase such as O2‐, OP4, or “Z” phases in the entire potential range. While the peak intensities of the P2 phase were decreased in charging, they restored during the discharge process, demonstrating the reversible nature of the biphasic structure. To further confirm the phase stability of P2/O3‐LFMO, in situ XRD analysis was continued to consecutive cycle. Again, there was no indication of phase transition of P2 phase at both high voltage ad low voltage regions. Our result suggests that the stability window of P2‐type layered structure in P2/O3‐LFMO was widened, which is in accordance with previous studies where substitution of lithium stabilized P2‐type layered structure over wide potential range.[] The absence of new peaks corresponding to the “Z” phase implies that the gliding of the transition metal layer has been prevented at the charged state. Also, the absence of the P'2 phase at the discharged state indicates that the Jahn–Teller active species, such as Mn3+ were disappeared. As discussed in the previous section, substitution of Mn with Li increases the oxidation state of remaining Mn to 4+, decreasing the number of the Mn3+ at deeply discharged state.\nFor the O3‐phase in the P2/O3‐LFMO, the corresponding (104) peak shifted to higher angle during initial charge process, indicating deintercalation of sodium and oxidation of transition metals. The peak intensity deceased as voltage increased, making it difficult to determine phase transition behavior of the O3 phase at high voltage region. Notably, previous reports have recognized that the lithium substitution in the O3 phase could minimize the O3‐P3‐O'3 phase transition which occurs at the high voltage region.[] Based on the previous reports, we suspect that the lithium substitution in the P2/O3‐LFMO could minimize the phase instability of the O3 phase. The (104) peak of the O3 phase was restored during discharge in the low voltage region (<2.0\xa0V) with reversible peak shift. The (104) peak showed similar peak shift and intensity change in the consecutive cycle as well. The reversible changes of the O3 phase imply that the O3‐type structure also participates in the intercalation of sodium ion and that the biphasic structure was stable throughout cycling. In the case where sodium content is high, the O3 phase in the biphasic structure could function as a sodium ion reservoir at the low voltage region.[] The in situ XRD verifies reversible shift of (104) peak at low voltage region, supporting that O3 phase may potentially accommodate sodium ions. As a result, the O3 phase prevented the formation of the distorted P'2 phase by accommodating sodium ions instead of the P2 phase at the low voltage region. Overall, we predict a cooperative role of the O3 phase in intercalating within the biphasic structure, specifically minimizing the structure distortion at low voltage regions, which would be the cause of additional structural stability of P2/O3‐LFMO.\n\nDensity Functional Theory Calculations of Layered Structure with Lithium\nOur findings in the in situ XRD analysis highlight the excellent structural stability of P2/O3‐LFMO at high potential range. This observation is in line with the potential‐wise electrochemical data (Figure\xa0), which suggests the enhancement of cycle stability at the high potential region by the Li substitution. In order to understand how lithium substitution regulates the transition metal ordering at a highly charged state, we performed DFT calculations and investigated correlation with Na–Li distance.\nAs in P2/O3‐LFMO case, when Na‐ions are in the interlayer space, they experience electrostatic repulsion from the neighboring cations in the transition metal layer. Therefore, it is anticipated that the Na‐ions prefer to be placed near the Li‐ions rather than the higher‐valanced transition metals. In this direction, we calculated the total energy of the system and compared with the distance between Na and Li (Figure\xa0). The obtained result exhibits a tendency that the closer the Na–Li distance is, the more stable the system energy is at a highly charged state (x\xa0= 0.16 at NaxMO2). The most stable atomic structure, corresponding to the result marked by arrow, is displayed in Figure\xa0, where the Li in the transition metal layer and Na in the interlayer are closely located with each other, forming Na–vacancy–Li and Na–Li–Na pairs. This pairing of monovalent ions across the transition metal layer is commonly observed in the layered‐type metal oxides.[] It can be seen in a way that the Li‐ions in the transition metal layer anchor the Na‐ions, preventing the depletion of Na in the interlayer. In consideration of the phase transformation to the “Z” phase at high voltage region, which is accompanied by a gliding of the transition metal layers after the depletion of interlayer Na‐ions, the anchoring of Na‐ions by the substituted Li is advantageous for retaining the original crystal structure. Furthermore, as identified by the neutron diffraction and DFT calculations, the substituted Li‐ions generate a honeycomb ordering in the transition metal layer. This specific ordering makes the Li‐ions and thereby the anchored Na‐ions dispersed uniformly within the structure; therefore, gliding of transition metal layer could be diminished effectively. Our findings suggest that the pairing of monovalent ions along with ordered distribution of Li in the transition metal layer is the key to preventing phase transformation and stabilizing layered structure.\nThe formation of cation ordering can also be inferred from the voltage profile. Figure\xa0, are discharge voltage profiles of the P2‐FMO and P2/O3‐LFMO, respectively, taken from the potential‐wise electrochemical measurement in Figure\xa0. In the P2‐FMO sample, the discharge profiles were similar under different cut‐off potentials, suggesting that the discharge reaction is identical regardless of the cut‐off potential. On the other hand, the voltage profile of the P2/O3‐LFMO showed noticeable change when the cut‐off potential was 4.5 V: The overall voltage profile was extended with increasing the cut‐off potential, while the discharge voltage between 3.0 and 4.5\xa0V was decreased compared to the lower cut‐off potential cases as denoted with an arrow in Figure\xa0. The change in discharge voltage can be further confirmed by comparing the dQ/dV plot (Figure , Supporting Information). Since the voltage is the free energy difference between charged and discharged phases, a relatively lower output voltage indicates that the charged phase becomes stable. It can be stated that the cation ordering, which stabilizes the desodiated phase as shown in Figure\xa0, possibly lowered the cell voltage as observed in Figure\xa0.\nAs discussed in the previous section, the high initial charge capacity of P2/O3‐LFMO exceeds the capacity that could be explained by the transition metal oxidation reaction of Na0.67Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2, suggesting the possibility of charge compensation by oxygen redox.\nFigure\xa0 shows averaged net magnetic moments and density of states (DOS) of the P2/O3‐LFMO model structure (NaxLi1/6Fe1/6Mn2/3O2) with varying sodium content (x). At a high sodium content (from x\xa0= 1.0 to 0.67 in Figure\xa0), the magnetic moment of Mn was altered from 3.54 to 3.12 during the dissociation process, indicating that Mn plays a major redox center at this stage. The disappearance of the occupied Mn states near the Fermi level after charging from x\xa0= 1.0 (Figure\xa0) to x\xa0= 0.67 (Figure\xa0) consistently demonstrate the oxidation of Mn. In the intermediate charging stage (from x\xa0= 0.67 to 0.16), O and Fe lose their electrons as evidenced by the evolved unoccupied states of O and Fe (arrow in Figure\xa0) as well as significant net moment changes from 4.29 to 3.43(Figure\xa0). During this stage, the variation of the net moment of O (decrease by 0.17) is smaller than that of Fe (decrease by 0.86); however, the contribution of O to the redox process is higher than that of Fe due to its larger number of atoms per formula unit (i.e., multiplicity). At a deeply charged state with low sodium content (from x\xa0= 0.16 to 0.0), the net moment of O was further decreased (enlarged in negative), but the net moments of Mn and Fe were rather increased. This suggests that the majority (up) spin electrons moved from O to Mn and Fe. Such charge compensation phenomena can be examined with more details using the DOS analysis. On the charging from x\xa0= 0.16 (Figure\xa0) to x\xa0= 0.0 (Figure\xa0), the unoccupied states of Mn and Fe near the Fermi level were almost unchanged, while only the unoccupied up‐spin state of O was increased by ≈44%. It indicates that the up‐spin electrons were transferred from O to Mn and Fe, decreasing the net moment of O and increasing the net moment of Mn and Fe. These results suggest that the oxygen redox is contributing to the electrochemical reaction of P2/O3‐LFMO, providing possible explanation for its high initial charge capacity.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Stoichiometric amounts of the precursors were thoroughly mixed by ball‐milling and dried to obtain homogeneous mixture of precursor powder. The mixed precursors were then formed into pellets with diameter of 14\xa0mm. The pellets were heat‐treated in a box furnace in air condition, at 800 °C for 24hr. After heat‐treatment, the pellets were ground into fine powders and kept in a glove box with an inert Ar atmosphere. The sample without Li substitution was synthesized with the same precursors.\nAn electrode slurry was prepared by mixing the as‐synthesized active material, carbon (super P), and a (PVDF, Sigma–Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) binder in mass ratios of 80:10:10. N‐Methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (Sigma–Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as the solvent for the electrode slurry and the mixture was thoroughly mixed in a mortar. The slurry was cast on Al foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. The dried electrode was roll‐pressed before assembling into a half cell.\nCR2032 coin cells were assembled in an Ar‐filled glove box, with a glass fiber filter (Whatman, grade GF/D) as a separator, Na metal as the counter electrode, and 1 m NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1/1, v/v) with 2 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed with a WBCS3000 cycler (Wonatech) under CCCV mode. Cycle tests under constant current were conducted with 10 or 50 mA\xa0g−1 of current density. Rate capability was performed under 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mA\xa0g−1 of current density for five cycles each, and then was repaired to current density of 50 mA\xa0g−1.\nHigh‐resolution synchrotron powder X‐ray diffraction (SPXRD) data for the samples were obtained using the 9B‐HRPD beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Pohang, Republic of Korea. SPXRD data were collected at a wavelength of 1.5167 Å in the 2θ range 10° to 130.5°, with a step size of 0.01° or 0.005°. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data were obtained using the high‐resolution powder diffractometer Echidna, operated by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Australia. The NPD data were collected at a wavelength of 2.4395 Å over the 2θ range 20° to 150°, with a step size of 0.05°.

The Hubbard U‐correction in the rotationally invariant form was used to address the self‐interaction energy.[] The effective single parameters of 5.3 and 3.9\xa0eV were used for Fe and Mn, respectively.[] The geometry optimization process was conducted with the convergence criteria of 10−7 and 0.02\xa0eV A−1 for electronic and ionic steps, respectively. The experimentally refined crystal structure was used as an input geometry and it was expanded to 2 × 2 × 1 supercell to explore the sodium‐ion ordering at charged states. All possible sodium‐ion configurations were generated and sampled on the basis of the Ewald summation of the system.

In situ synchrotron XRD data for the operating batteries were obtained at the 3D‐XRS and 6D‐C&S beamline of PAL at a wavelength of 1.0334 Å. 2D patterns were converted to 1D XRD patterns with the Fit2D program. For in situ observations of battery cells, modified CR2032 coin cells with holes in the center covered with polyimide films were used. A LaB6 standard reference material (NIST SRM 660c, Sigma–Aldrich) was used for calibration. Diffraction data were collected every few minutes while the in situ cell was cycled under a current density of 25\xa0mA g−1 with an SP‐200 potentiostat (Biologic) in constant charge mode during charge and discharge processes.

N‐Methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (Sigma–Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as the solvent for the electrode slurry and the mixture was thoroughly mixed in a mortar. The slurry was cast on Al foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. The dried electrode was roll‐pressed before assembling into a half cell.\nCR2032 coin cells were assembled in an Ar‐filled glove box, with a glass fiber filter (Whatman, grade GF/D) as a separator, Na metal as the counter electrode, and 1 m NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1/1, v/v) with 2 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed with a WBCS3000 cycler (Wonatech) under CCCV mode. Cycle tests under constant current were conducted with 10 or 50 mA\xa0g−1 of current density. Rate capability was performed under 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mA\xa0g−1 of current density for five cycles each, and then was repaired to current density of 50 mA\xa0g−1.\n\nMaterials Characterization\nHigh‐resolution synchrotron powder X‐ray diffraction (SPXRD) data for the samples were obtained using the 9B‐HRPD beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Pohang, Republic of Korea.

The Hubbard U‐correction in the rotationally invariant form was used to address the self‐interaction energy.[] The effective single parameters of 5.3 and 3.9\xa0eV were used for Fe and Mn, respectively.[] The geometry optimization process was conducted with the convergence criteria of 10−7 and 0.02\xa0eV A−1 for electronic and ionic steps, respectively. The experimentally refined crystal structure was used as an input geometry and it was expanded to 2 × 2 × 1 supercell to explore the sodium‐ion ordering at charged states. All possible sodium‐ion configurations were generated and sampled on the basis of the Ewald summation of the system. Electrostatically, the most stable 20 cases were used to figure out the ground state structure, and more unstable 20 cases were additionally compared to identify the correlation between electrostatic energy and total energy of the system.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, sodiophilic Sn/SnO2‐C nanoparticles@graphene (i.e., Sn/SnO2‐C@G) hybrid was coated on the surface of Cu foil via the conventional slurry‐casting method, which was fabricated using Sn/SnO2‐ZIF‐8@rGO (ZIF = zeolitic imidazolate framework, rGO = reduced graphene oxide) as the precusor (Figures  and , Supporting Information). The thickness of Sn/SnO2‐C@G electrode was ≈100 μm (Figure\xa0,), in which the diameters of Sn/SnO2‐C nanoparticles were ≈80−420\xa0nm (Figures  and , Supporting Information). Second, 5\xa0mAh\xa0cm−2 of Na was plated into Sn/SnO2‐C@G to fabricate Na‐NPs. Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed the Na‐NPs electrode with a thickness of ≈170\xa0μm exhibited nondendritic and silvery surface (Figure\xa0,). Third, an organic solution comprising SnTFSI salt was dropped onto Na‐NPs to form Sn@Na‐NPs (see the Experimental Section), accompanying with the color change from silver into dark brown and increased thickness approaching ≈210\xa0μm (Figure\xa0,). Taking use of the spontaneous redox reaction, Na‐NPs induced the decomposition of SnTFSI salt to form Sn and SnO2, thereby constructing conformal Sn‐Na alloy‐based SEI on the surface of Sn@Na‐NPs anode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, elemental mappings, and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS) displayed that Sn@Na‐NPs with diameters of ≈93\xa0nm included C, N, O, S, F, Na, and Sn, in which the content of Sn accounted for 13.89\xa0at% (Figure\xa0, and Figure , Supporting Information). X‐ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated there was a same diffraction peak located at 29.6° existing in both Na‐NPs and Sn@Na‐NPs, which was related to the (110) plane of metallic Na (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, i.e., JCPDS card 03‐0598). In contrast, the newly appeared two peaks in Sn@Na‐NPs anode were attributed to Sn (2θ\xa0=\xa030.8° and 32.2°, JCPDS card 04‐0673) (Figure ). The SEI composition of the Sn@Na‐NPs anode was analyzed by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Sn 3d spectrum was divided into two peaks, located at ≈484.6 and ≈486.7\xa0eV were indexed to Sn/Sn‐Na alloy and SnO2, respectively (Figure\xa0).[] As for C 1s spectrum, the four peaks with binding energies of ≈284.8, ≈286.5, ≈288.2, and ≈289.8\xa0eV were assigned to C\uf8ffC, R\uf8ffO\uf8ffNa, R\uf8ffCO\uf8ffNa, and R\uf8ffOCO2Na/Na2CO3/NaHCO3, respectively (Figure\xa0).[] The S 2p spectrum showed four peaks located at ≈167.0, ≈168.7, and ≈169.9/≈171.0\xa0eV could be identified as Na2SO3, Na2SO4, and FSI−, respectively (Figure\xa0).[] For the F 1s spectrum, the two obvious peaks were referenced to NaF (≈684.0\xa0eV) and FSI− (≈688.0\xa0eV), respectively (Figure\xa0).[] The Na 1s spectrum showed the peak at ≈1071.6\xa0eV was corresponded to Na+ (Figure\xa0).[] Based on the EDS, XRD, and XPS results, it could be concluded that the SEI of Sn@Na‐NPs anode was mostly made up of Sn‐Na alloy, Sn, SnO2, Na‐based inorganic salts (e.g., Na2CO3, NaHCO3, Na2SO3, Na2SO4, and NaF), and Na‐organic species (e.g., R\uf8ffO\uf8ffNa, R\uf8ffCO\uf8ffNa, R\uf8ffOCO2Na, and NaFSI).\n\nElectrochemical Performance and Postcycling Characterization of the Symmetric Sn@Na‐NPs Cell\nSymmetric cells were assembled to investigate the Na plating/stripping behavior. Figure  shows that the symmetric Sn@Na‐NPs cell exhibits good cycling stability at a current density of 10\xa0mA\xa0cm−2\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The phase transformation of the Sn foil anode was probed by in situ X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis during the discharge process (Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information). The thus‐obtained patterns featured peaks corresponding to the Sn foil anode, the polypropylene nanoporous membrane and glass fiber filter separator, and the Be window of the XRD holder. Figure , Supporting Information, shows the standard XRD patters of various sodiated Sn compounds. The peaks of crystalline Sn metal and Na\uf8ffSn intermetallic compounds are marked with arrows in Figure\xa0. The XRD peaks of the Sn foil anode prior to discharge (0 mAh g−1, red arrows in Figure\xa0) agree well with those of the β‐Sn (JCPDS #894\u2009898) peaks. Nevertheless, the intensity ratios of the peaks deviated from those of the reference, which was ascribed to texturing (preferential orientation) of the film from the rolling process used to prepare it.\nAfter a discharge of 20 mAh g−1, the intensity of the peak at 32.0° decreased, which reflects the (partial) disappearance of the preferred orientation. New peaks emerged at 27.7° and 34.0° (blue arrows in Figure\xa0) that were assigned to NaxSn with x\xa0<\xa01, although no reference corresponding to these positions was found. The new peaks persisted until a discharge of 100 mAh g−1, but they almost disappeared as the specific capacity increased to 200 mAh g−1. β‐NaSn peaks emerged at 31.8° and 34.6° (green arrows in Figure\xa0) at a specific capacity of 200 mAh g−1, and persisted to 300 mAh g−1. No peaks of other Na\uf8ffSn intermetallics appeared at this stage in the discharge process. At a specific capacity of 500 mAh g−1, the peaks of β‐NaSn had almost disappeared, and two strong peaks of Na2.25Sn appeared at 33.0° and 33.9° (purple arrows in Figure\xa0). As the position of this capacity (500 mAh g−1) is close to the end of the second plateau in Figure\xa0, we concluded that NaSn reacted with Na during the second plateau to afford Na2.25Sn, in good agreement with previous reports.[] After a discharge of 600 mAh g−1, which corresponds to the third plateau in Figure\xa0 of 0.04\xa0V, peaks of Na3.75Sn (at 31.92°, 33.38°, and 34.78°; navy arrows in Figure\xa0) and Na2.25Sn emerged. Subsequently, the peaks of the latter phase lost intensity, whereas those of the former phase persisted, in line with previous reports.[] Based on the above, the Sn foil anode reacted with Na to form NaSn, Na2.25Sn, and Na3.75Sn, which have theoretical capacities of 226, 508, and 847 mAh g−1, respectively.\nTo investigate the evolution of the anode morphology during the discharge process, we extracted the Sn anode from the Na/Sn cell at the positions marked by red arrows in Figure\xa0 and observed the front side of the anode (that is, the side contacting the separator) by macrophotography (Figure\xa0). The pristine Sn foil had a silvery‐white appearance with a metallic luster. The white metallic luster was lost after a discharge of 20 mAh g−1, but the disk shape and area did not change. The disk shape was retained as the specific capacity continued to increase, while the area increased. Figure , Supporting Information, shows the variation in the apparent area of the anode during the discharge process, revealing that the areal expansion was not proportional to the sodiation degree. Up to a discharge of 60 mAh g−1, the areal expansion was close to 0%; subsequently, it increased continuously until 700 mAh g−1, and was then stable at 93% until the end of the discharge process. Figure , Supporting Information, shows images of the back side of the anode (the surface contacting the current collector during discharge) after bending. Both sides of the pristine Sn anode had the same color and metallic luster. However, the back side of the Sn anode after a discharge of 20 mAh g−1 was golden with a metallic luster. After a discharge of 200 mAh g−1, the back side lost its metallic luster and became similar to the front side. This behavior implies that the initial sodiation in the first plateau progresses from the front side to the back side of the Sn anode and does not occur throughout the anode.\nTo understand anode expansion in detail, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to explore the changes in the Sn foil surfaces during the first electrochemical cycle (Figure\xa0). The surface of the pristine Sn foil anode exhibited traces of rolling, as shown in the low‐magnification SEM images. After a discharge of 20 mAh g−1, the surface of the Sn foil became covered by island‐like spherical protuberances (yellow arrows in Figure\xa0) with diameters of ≈1\xa0µm, as revealed by high‐magnification SEM. These protuberances probably reflect the expansion accompanying the conversion of Sn to NaSn, as the presence of a free surface would have caused expansion to occur perpendicular to the surface. Therefore, the initial expansion of the Sn foil anode probably occurred perpendicular to the surface, which could explain why no areal expansion was observed in Figure\xa0 or Figure , Supporting Information, during the initial stage of the discharge process.\nAt a discharge of 200 mAh g−1, the Sn foil surface was too rough to observe the traces of rolling by low‐magnification SEM imaging. In the high‐magnification images, the foil surface appears as if multiple wires of churro‐like shapes have been pulled out and bent at the end (red arrows in Figure\xa0). After a discharge of 400 mAh g−1, the entire surface was covered by V‐shaped wires (white arrows in Figure\xa0) that could be seen in both the low‐ and high‐magnification SEM images. The low‐magnification SEM image of the film after a discharge of 600 mAh g−1 shows that the Sn foil is composed of several zones with a size of a few hundred micrometers. The insides of these zones (called V‐shaped zones) comprised V‐shaped wires (white arrows in Figure\xa0), which were same shape as those at a specific capacity of 400 mAh g−1. Each V‐shaped zone was surrounded by a boundary (marked by the white dotted line in Figure\xa0), which could be formed by the connection and growth of the V‐shaped wires. The V‐shaped wires can be clearly observed in the high‐magnification image (white arrows in Figure\xa0). To identify the factors influencing the V‐shaped zones and their boundaries, we observed the etched pristine Sn foil anode by optical microscopy (Figure , Supporting Information). The optical microscopy images revealed that this foil was divided by etched grain boundaries with sizes of hundreds of micrometers. The boundaries between the V‐shaped zones probably correspond to the etched grain boundaries in the optical microscopy images.\nThe shape evolution that occurs during the discharge process is complex. However, from the above data, we propose the following sequence. Once the surface is covered by protuberances, sodiation occurs below the surface. Since the grain boundaries have an open structure, Na diffuses along the grain boundaries much faster than that in the bulk Sn lattice. It is plausible that Na\uf8ffSn compounds (NaxSn, x\xa0>\xa01) nucleate and grow at the grain boundaries. If two growing Na\uf8ffSn compounds meet at a grain boundary, they could produce the observed V‐shaped grains by compressive stress due to the volume expansion that occurs during sodiation, which might induce areal expansion. At the end of the discharge process, the churro‐like strands disappear but leave traces in the form of cracks. As the only crystalline phase observed by XRD corresponds to Na3.75Sn (Figure\xa0), the shape of Sn foil might be attributable to the formation of Na15Sn4 as the final sodiation product.\nFigure\xa0 presents the first‐charge curve of the Sn foil anode recorded at 0.01 C in a Na/Sn half‐cell. Despite the high probability of electrical contact loss during desodiation, this curve showed a capacity of 750 mAh g−1 without any voltage fluctuation and featured four plateaus at 0.14, 0.27, 0.52, and 0.67\xa0V.\nThe phase transformation of the Sn foil anode during the first‐charge was explored by in situ XRD (Figure\xa0). The peaks of Na3.75Sn as the final discharge product could be observed until a charge of 300 mAh g−1, which corresponds to the first‐charge plateau at 0.14\xa0V, while the peaks of Na2.25Sn were identified during charging to 500 mAh g−1, which corresponds to the second plateau at 0.27\xa0V. However, no peaks of β‐NaSn were observed during charging, even though this phase was observed during the discharge process. Considering previous results,[] the NaSn formed in the Sn foil anode might have a nanocrystalline or amorphous structure. Sharp peaks of crystalline Sn appeared during subsequent charging and persisted until the end of the charging process. The charge reaction was the reverse process of the discharge in Figure\xa0.\nAlthough we used a Sn foil anode herein, its first discharge/charge profile and phase transformations are very similar to those previously observed for anodes comprising Sn nano‐ and microparticles. However, the morphology variation of the Sn foil anode during charging is very different. Figure\xa0 shows the macrophotographs of Sn foil anode taken during the first charging process. At a charge of 200 mAh g−1, the anode appeared dense, hard, and dark, similarly to the fully discharged sample. After charging to 600 mAh g−1, the anode appeared as a round dark disk divided by visible cracks into pieces that were several hundred micrometers in size. After subsequent charging, the disk shape with divided pieces was still observed. Figure , Supporting Information, shows the evolution of the practical apparent area of the Sn foil anode during the first charge. In terms of size, the pristine state of the Sn foil anode was not recovered after the first charge because of visible cracks. Although the Sn anode was divided into pieces, a stable charge curve was obtained, which indicates that these pieces were electrically connected, that is, the anode was electrically connected in the vertical direction from the current collector.\nTo understand the anode cracking in detail, we used SEM to explore the changes in the Sn foil surfaces during the first electrochemical charging process (Figure\xa0,). The foil exhibited a porous structure with pores of <500\xa0nm,\xa0as shown in the high‐magnification SEM image. After charging to 400 mAh g−1, churro‐like wires appeared in the high‐magnification SEM images, similar to those at a discharge capacity of 200 mAh g−1 (Figure\xa0). After charging to 700 mAh g−1, the film surfaces were covered by protuberances with sizes of <1\xa0µm,\xa0similar to the morphology at a discharge capacity of 20 mAh g−1 (Figure\xa0). At the end of the charging process, the Sn foil had a dense and smooth surface. We could not find out any traces of the boundaries (shown by white dotted lines in Figure\xa0) in any of the low‐magnification SEM images taken during the charging process. However, the pieces in Figure\xa0 have a size similar to those of the V‐shaped zones in Figure\xa0. During the charging (desodiation) process, the V‐shaped zones might return to their original shape with volume contraction, thereby inducing visible cracking. Based on above data, we concluded that the Sn foil anode reversibly reacts with Na during the first cycle.\nThe discharge/charge curves of the Na/Sn half‐cell recorded at 0.01 C during three cycles are presented in Figure , Supporting Information. The three discharge plateaus observed during the first cycle were replaced with four discharge plateaus from the second cycle onward, based on the appearance of a new plateau at 0.45\xa0V. The first plateau of second discharge at 0.45\xa0V corresponds to the fourth plateau at 0.67\xa0V during charging, which relates to NaxSn with x\xa0<\xa00.5. The fourth plateau at 0.67\xa0V during charge curve and the first plateau of 0.45\xa0V during discharging are related to the division of the anode shown in Figure\xa0. Figure , Supporting Information, shows the cyclic voltammograms of Sn foil anode at a voltage scan rate of 0.01 mV\xa0s−1 which is well matched with the galvanostatic data of Figure , Supporting Information.\nFigure\xa0 shows the evolution of specific capacity upon cycling (100 cycles) of a Na/Sn half‐cell with a Sn metal foil anode at 0.1 C. The Sn foil anode exhibited initial discharge and charge capacities of 766 and 666 mAh g−1, respectively. After five cycles, the reversible capacity had increased to a maximum of 803 mAh g−1 and the coulombic efficiency stabilized at ≈100%. The anode comprised only Sn metal; nevertheless, a high reversible capacity of 692 mAh g−1 was achieved even after 100 cycles. Since the Sn foil anode did not contain a binder or conducting agent, the stable cycle life was an unexpected and notable phenomenon considering that pulverization occurred due to the volume change. The Sn foil anode delivered better capacity retention than the previous composite and free‐standing electrodes.[]\nThe corresponding charge/discharge curves for 100 cycles are shown in Figure\xa0. The initial over‐potential decreased during cycling, possibly because the Sn foil was concomitantly split into small Sn plates. The Na/Sn half‐cell was probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to observe changes in internal resistance, with the obtained Nyquist plots shown in Figure\xa0. Typically, Nyquist plots feature a semicircle at high frequencies, which is usually associated with charge transfer resistance (Rct), as well as a sloping straight line at low frequencies, which is attributed to Na+ ion diffusion into the active material. The Rct of the Sn foil anode was as high as 72 Ω before cycling but decreased to <1\xa0Ω after 10 cycles, which coincides with the previous results using microsized Sn powder and DME electrolyte.[]\nFigure\xa0 shows macrophotographs of the charged Sn foil anode taken after 1, 3, 5, 20, and 100 cycles. Contrary to the conventional belief, the widths of cracks present after the first cycle had decreased after the third cycle, and no cracks were observed from the fifth cycle onward. During repeated cycling, the Sn foil anode retained its circular shape, but the diameter increased. The apparent and real areas of Sn anodes were calculated by image analysis and are presented in Figure , Supporting Information. The apparent area of Sn foil increased from 28.27 to 82.79 mm2 after 100 cycles.\nFigure\xa0 shows SEM images of Sn anodes acquired during 100 cycles at 0.1 C. The change in the morphology of the Sn anode during cycling made it possible to consider the reason for its fractures. At the fifth cycle, small protuberances (diameter of <500\xa0nm)\xa0with spherical shape (white arrows in Figure\xa0) appeared on the surface. At the 20th cycle, larger (diameter of <2\xa0µm)\xa0spherical particles (red arrows in Figure\xa0) were connected to each other and with pores. Finally, a coral‐like 3D porous structure was observed at the 100th cycle. This behavior indicates that the anode density decreases upon cycling, which could also be responsible for the increase of area and disappearance of visible cracks. In a previous study,[] we observed the formation of a coral‐like 3D porous structure after 5000 cycles in a Sn composite anode with micrometer‐sized Sn particles, demonstrating that they underwent self‐healing after initial pulverization. Since this process can proceed both at the surface and inside the divided pieces, the area of the divided pieces is expected to increase as the foil merges into one piece.\nTo investigate the morphology change induced by sodiation, a sample that had been exposed to 100 cycles was subjected to two further cycles, discharged at the 103rd cycle, and observed by SEM (Figure\xa0\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, oligolayered Ti3C2Tx MXene was prepared from Ti3AlC2 by selective etching and delamination methods in diluted HF and TMAOH solution, respectively. Meanwhile, most –F terminal groups were replaced by concentrated –OH groups during the delamination process, exhibiting higher chemical activity. Subsequently, the freeze‐dried oligolayered Ti3C2Tx MXene was dispersed in ethylene glycol (EG), mixed thoroughly with antimony chloride (SbCl3) and l‐Cys·HCl under sonication. The electrostatic attraction induced covalent bonding between Sb3+ and concentrated terminal –OH groups of Ti3C2Tx MXene took place during the following solvothermal reaction (Figure , Supporting Information), forming interfacial covalent Ti‐O‐Sb bond, which greatly prevents oligolayered Ti3C2Tx MXene from restacking. Simultaneously, sustained‐released S2− ions bond with Sb3+ forming Sb2S3 nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on the surface of oligolayered Ti3C2Tx MXene.

Similar observations have also been made previously.[] To approximate this computationally, we have created a rough model containing curved carbon surfaces with a trough of 7.5 Å depth in between the two elevated carbon sheets to represent this roughness (Figure\xa0, with the full periodic model shown in Figure , Supporting Information). Whilst this is a significant simplification, it allows the lattice, defects, and their interactions with the EC molecule to be considered in isolation. As H‐terminated graphitic surfaces have previously been shown to be unstable in EC, these surfaces are not included in the current study (previously calculated in ref. [,].\n\nEC Adsorption\nTo assess the interaction of the carbon surfaces with the EC electrolyte, we performed DFT simulations to describe the EC‐surface binding interaction (Figure ). From the adsorption energies (Eads) calculated according to Equation\xa0() in Section\xa0, no strong interaction between an EC molecule and the model in Figure\xa0 could be found. For the rough models, a similar situation is observed. The strongest EC adsorption energy (−0.60\xa0eV) is obtained when the EC carbonyl oxygen sits 2.92 Å from the carbon lattice with the EC molecule aligned toward positions 5–7, that is, the less curved part of the model (Figure\xa0). When the EC molecule sits with the carbonyl oxygen toward one of the carbon planes, and the hydrogen tails toward the other, the adsorption is weaker (Figure\xa0). This indicates that the configuration of the EC molecule in relation to the carbon lattice influences the EC‐carbon interaction. The interaction of EC with a pristine basal plane is very weak, as shown by the low adsorption energy (−0.46\xa0eV, see Supporting Information for more details) obtained when the carbonyl oxygen is closest to the graphene surface. In the case of the rough model (Figure\xa0), the calculated adsorption energies (between −0.42 and −0.6\xa0eV) suggest slightly stronger interactions between the EC molecules and the carbon planes, yet they remain weak. Such a low level of EC adsorption should not lead to EC immobilization at these sites, nor hinder sodium from entering the HC anode, however, it is suggested that the curvature leads to reduced EC mobility, as compared to EC on the basal plane surface.\nTo assess the effect of surface roughness on EC mobility, a series of AIMD simulations of the EC‐carbon interface was conducted, whilst varying the trough depth (1–7.5 Å) of the rough model (Figure , Supporting Information). Interestingly, similar EC diffusion coefficients were obtained for all the rough model systems of different trough depths (6.41 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 1 Å, 9.49 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 2 Å, 9.62 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 5 Å, and 7.72 × 10−9 m2 s−1 for roughness 7.5 Å), suggesting a degree of model independence when the EC adsorption and diffusion is concerned for the roughness. For comparison, AIMD simulations are also performed for EC molecules on the basal plane interface. The same weakly interacting picture was observed although a slight rumpling of the graphene sheets was seen (Figure , Supporting Information). The calculations confirmed an EC diffusion coefficient of 1.98 × 10−8 m2 s−1 for the basal plane model, higher than those calculated with the rough model of different roughness (indicated by trough depth values). This agrees with the trend in adsorption energy in Figure\xa0, with the stronger interaction between EC and the rough models leading to more sluggish EC diffusion than on the basal plane. This observation further confirms that the SEI is expected to be thinner at the basal plane than on edge sites (assuming the higher mobility and lower adsorption energy of EC leads to less trapping and degradation of EC at the basal plane as compared to the rough models), which has previously been observed experimentally in graphite anodes for LIBs.[] In real HC anodes, significant defect and heteroatom concentrations have been identified. To understand the binding and vectors for breakdown, further consideration of the defect‐EC interaction is required.\n\nEC Adsorption at Defect Sites\nIn our previous work,[] defects have a marked impact on the adsorption characteristics and hence mobility of metal ions in HC. In this work, the effect of the previously considered defects on EC–HC interactions is characterized. A range of defects is considered, including an oxygen substitutional defect (OC), double substitutional oxygen defect (2OC), carbon vacancy (VC), and oxygen substitutional defect with carbon vacancy (OCVC). These defects are placed at different positions in the rough model, according to the seven lattice positions (P1–P7) labeled in Figure\xa0. In each case, P1 is at the offset surface and then at each lattice position until the other surface (trough) is reached (P7). Figure  shows the formation energy of each defect at each position.\nAs shown in Figure\xa0, the defect formation energy generally decreases as the surface top is approached, with either the defect at the surface top (P1) or directly below (P2) being the lowest energy configuration. This is in common with our previous results for HC defects at the curved surface models,[] indicating that the defects would be more likely at the surface top. Some small variations of the defect formation energy are observed with different lattice positions from P1 to P7. This is because the strain increases as the interface (i.e., surface top) is approached, and the interaction between adjacent graphene sheets is also largely absent with the layers being at a maximum separation of 10 Å.[] The same effect was observed for the models with a shallower trough (Figure , Supporting Information). The variations observed from the smooth trend for the OCVC and VC defects can be understood by considering the local strain environment as a function of defect position. This local strain reaches a maximum at P4 where a deviation from the ideal planar structure is at a maximum with a single C\uf8ffC aligned perpendicular to the surface. The introduction of the OCVC and VC defects at this position releases a significant portion of the strain via the relaxation of a 5‐membered ring (and a C‐dangling bond for the VC), resulting in two near planar rings.\nTo understand EC interaction with the defective models, the adsorption energy of an EC molecule in the defective rough models (with each defect at different lattice positions P1–P7) was calculated (as shown in Figure  and Figure , Supporting Information), in comparison to the EC adsorption energy on the basal plane (Figure , Supporting Information) and the curved surface (Figure , Supporting Information) with the same defects. Three distinct adsorption regimes are observed in Figure\xa0. In P1 and P2, the EC shows surface adsorption interaction with the edge of a single C‐sheet (giving similar adsorption energies and configurations seen for the abrupt surface, in Figure , Supporting Information). P3–P5 shows an intermediate binding behavior as the EC moves from single sheet surface adsorption toward intercalation‐like behavior, where the EC sits between two carbon sheets (just above the trough in Figure\xa0). Finally, the strongest interaction between the EC molecule and the defect is seen for defect sites P5–P7, which represents the intercalation of the EC molecule. There is a clear trend of EC‐carbon lattice interactions strengthening at sites away from the surface top. Interestingly, the EC interaction with the carbon lattice seems unaffected by the nature of the defect in most cases, where similar adsorption energies are shown for different defects. One clear difference is seen at P2 and P5, where EC shows stronger adsorption energy at OC and VC sites than on the 2OC and OCVC sites. The EC molecule on the abrupt surface shows a similar trend (Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information), with only the OC and 2OC defects showing any significant interaction with the EC molecule, but at very low adsorption energies (−0.38 and −0.33\xa0eV, respectively). For the OCVC and VC defect, a clear repulsive interaction is seen (1.02 and 0.77\xa0eV, respectively). For the defective basal plane surfaces, the EC is most strongly bonded to the 2OC defect (Eads\xa0=\xa0−1.39\xa0eV), and shows similar adsorption energy for the other defects (Eads,Oc\xa0=\xa0−0.61\xa0eV, Eads,OcVc\xa0=\xa0−0.54\xa0eV, and Eads,Vc\xa0=\xa0−0.52\xa0eV). Comparing these adsorption energies to those previously calculated for Na at the same defective basal planes,[] it is clear that Na adsorption is more energetically favorable than EC adsorption, apart from the 2OC defect. Therefore, one can speculate that no competition between Na and EC would be expected due to the much stronger affinity for Na storage at these defect sites. In the case of 2OC, the higher EC binding energy would lead to the potential blocking of Na adsorption sites, proportional to the 2OC defect concentration.\n\nAdsorption of the EC Breakdown Products at Defect Sites\nBreakdown mechanisms of EC have been investigated in previous computational work,[] which identified the lowest energy pathway as the dissociative EC → CO32–\xa0+ C2H4 (for convenience CO32− will henceforth be referred to as CO3).[] At the surface, the EC shows the most favorable binding at the 2Oc defect at the basal plane (Figure\xa0), although does not lead to breakdown (Figure , Supporting Information). In the absence of a clearly identified EC breakdown site involving the individual defects considered, it is reasonable to surmise that the binding followed by breakdown most likely occurs at extended O‐defect clusters. To explore the stability and binding of the most favorable breakdown products (CO3 and C2H4), the adsorption energy in the defective rough models (with each defect at different lattice positions P1–P7) is calculated (as shown in Figure , with optimized geometries shown in Figures  and , Supporting Information), in comparison to the adsorption energy on the basal plane and the curved surface with the same defects.\nAs shown in Figure\xa0, the EC breakdown product C2H4 shows very weak interaction with most of the defects, aside from the positional variations of the defects in the rough model moving from surface adsorption to intercalation. For CO3 on the basal plane, the magnitude of the binding at the 2OC site is similar to that of Na adsorption (−0.67\xa0eV),[] resulting in competition between Na and the fragments thereby reducing the effective Na capacity.\nThe CO3 fragment proves to be more reactive, showing much stronger adsorption energies (Figure\xa0) when compared to those of EC and C2H4 (Figures\xa0 and\xa0). This stronger interaction was observed to lead to the breakdown of CO3 to CO2 and an oxygen functional group at the defect site (a variety of breakdown sites and positions are possible as shown in Figure , Supporting Information), functionalizing the surface. Figure\xa0 shows the variation in adsorption energy, where on the P1 site (surface top) OC shows the same behavior as described for the abrupt surface (Figure , Supporting Information), with C\uf8feO added to the unsaturated C, opposite the two‐fold O (Figure ). This oxygen functional group is similar to the C\uf8feO motif identified to be energetically favorable at the abrupt surface in our previous work,[] indicating that this might be one of the origins of these functional groups in HC anodes. VC by contrast shows an intermediate behavior, with the CO3 bound to the VC via the unsaturated C and the O\uf8ffCO2 (Figure\xa0). As can be seen from Figure\xa0, this leads to distortion in the intramolecular C\uf8ffO bonds in the CO3 fragment, with elongation of the C\uf8ffO bonds at the O bonded to the surface carbon of 0.1 Å, and a contraction of the C\uf8ffO bond that is oriented away from the surface of 0.07 Å. The C\uf8ffO bonds to the carbon surface are noticeably longer than the carbon‐oxygen bond lengths obtained for Figure\xa0, which is also reflected in the weaker adsorption energy of CO3 at VC site P1 as compared to OC site P1 (Figure\xa0). In the intercalation regime, both the OC and VC show the addition of C\uf8feO to the unsaturated lattice C in positions P5–P7, coupled with the liberation of CO2 (Figure\xa0 (showing the position of the CO2 within the trough region), and Figure , Supporting Information). CO2 liberation was also observed for CO3 at VC on the basal plane (see Figure , Supporting Information), where the optimized structure showed a C\uf8feO added to the unsaturated vacancy‐C and CO2 moving away from the surface (>4 Å). A schematic representation of the different mechanisms is provided in Figure\xa0. OC and OCVC adsorption are significantly less favored with OCVC showing a repulsive interaction. Whilst the 2OC shows enhanced adsorption, the CO3 remains intact although moving toward the C‐surface. For the same defect and fragment on the abrupt surface, however, in the absence of a perpendicular C‐dangling bond, the O is added to an adjacent C, initially as C\uf8feO, which can then undergo relaxation to give the C\uf8ffO\uf8ffC. Hence, the O‐functionalization is added to both planar, and curved surfaces as previously described.[]\n\nAIMD Investigation of EC Binding and Breakdown\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that some sites can bind EC and C2H4 (2OC on the BP), and CO3. The breakdown of CO3 and the liberation of CO2 is spontaneous in systems with a number of unsaturated C‐bonds, provided either by the vacancy or OC defects. A disordered surface model is prepared to provide a high concentration of dangling bonds; for simplicity, only C‐dangling bonds are considered. Figure  shows the initial disordered interface and the same system after 25\xa0ps at 330 K (Figure\xa0). Some features of interest are immediately evident: H‐abstraction (Figure\xa0), O‐loss (Figure\xa0), surface EC binding (Figure\xa0), and EC dissociation (Figure\xa0). These configurations shown in Figure\xa0 point to the initial binding and breakdown modes of EC when presented with a high concentration of surface dangling bonds (unsaturated C‐atoms). It is worth mentioning that the role of roughness and further breakdown of the identified fragments is the subject of the ongoing investigation.\n\nExperimental Characterization\nFrom the above analysis, it is clear that in the majority of cases, these carbon surfaces would not trap EC or its fragments, but oxygen functionalization and occupation of possible Na sites are expected at the OC and VC defect sites. To validate these results, we studied experimentally two HC materials[] with different microstructures that were discharged in an EC‐based electrolyte, ST1000 and ST1500. ST1000 consists of graphitic pores with larger average spacing between the graphitic planes (3.76 Å from small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS)/wide‐angle X‐ray scattering (WAXS) measurements for ST1000 and 3.68 Å for ST1500), has a larger concentration of defects, and smaller average micropore diameter (1.75\xa0nm for ST1000 and 2.2\xa0nm for ST1500) than the ST1500 HC material. ST1500 furthermore has a more graphitic structure with larger basal plane (which are graphene‐like) domains and a larger graphitic layer stack thickness than ST1000.[] To obtain information on the depth profile of the SEI composition, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure ) were acquired for the unsputtered sodiated samples, and then after sequential removal (30 s intervals) of thin surface layers, to generate a composition depth profile shown in Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information.\nAfter sodiation of the electrodes (x\xa0= 0), the sp2 carbon peak in the C 1s spectra (Figure , Supporting Information) arising from the graphitic features of HC almost disappeared for both electrodes. This is an indication of a layer covering the surface of the HC, which could be linked to the decoration of HC surfaces at defect sites as observed from the computational results. As the etching time increases, the concentration of C\uf8feO decreases more rapidly in the ST1500 material (Figure\xa0). The ST1000 material is more defective than the ST1500[] (Figure\xa0). As seen from the C1s peak contributions (Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information), ST1000 has a higher degree of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO‐containing organic compound on the surface, therefore, it is expected to have a thicker SEI layer, confirming the simulation results presented here and also previously.[] It should be also considered that argon and oxygen form a strong donor–acceptor chemical bond, therefore, Ar+ sputtering might be causing the reduction of C\uf8ffO bonds and change the surface chemistry. Combining the computational and experimental insights into the EC‐carbon surface interaction, it could be shown that the presence of defects and curved motifs influence electrolyte breakdown and immobilization. Coupling these results to those of the sodiation of HC anodes, a series of materials considerations for the design of HC anodes could be made. HC materials, as stated in Section\xa0, are complex materials with a tunable structure, making them excellent for targeted materials design. The main structural motifs of HCs are graphene basal planes, graphitic pores with variable interlayer distance, and curved nanopores and surfaces. The results presented in this work show that the shape of the carbon motifs (basal plane vs rough surface) has a direct impact not only on the sodiation[] but also on the EC interaction. In general, the basal planes have higher defect formation energy than the curved motifs, indicating that the defect concentration under equilibrium conditions in the basal plane motifs would be lower.[] Oxygen defects and the formation of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO bonds were shown to lead to thicker SEIs and have previously been shown to give a significant contribution to the NIB I–V curve sloping regions.[] As noted previously for the sodiation of HC materials, oxygen heteroatoms are beneficial for the initial sodium storage but could contribute to irreversible capacity if present in significant concentrations due to their strong Na adsorption energies.[] The effect of these defects on EC adsorption is not as pronounced. Their interaction with the breakdown fragments of carbonates (especially CO3) can be significant as observed in Figure\xa0, which could lead to an increase in oxygen functional groups and CO2 outgassing.[] This could also explain why HC with a higher C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO concentration have thicker SEIs and should be considered when designing future HC anode materials. It is also clear from the work here that any undercoordinated HC site (i.e., that leads to an unsaturated carbon site) is a possible EC breakdown site, leading to increased defect concentration and the possibility of crosslinking (which has previously been observed for carbon vacancies in similar systems).[] Future studies will also show how other electrolyte molecules interact with these HC motifs, adding further materials design considerations. The challenge remains in linking the computationally optimized HC material to a synthetic route.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

To validate these results, we studied experimentally two HC materials[] with different microstructures that were discharged in an EC‐based electrolyte, ST1000 and ST1500. ST1000 consists of graphitic pores with larger average spacing between the graphitic planes (3.76 Å from small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS)/wide‐angle X‐ray scattering (WAXS) measurements for ST1000 and 3.68 Å for ST1500), has a larger concentration of defects, and smaller average micropore diameter (1.75\xa0nm for ST1000 and 2.2\xa0nm for ST1500) than the ST1500 HC material. ST1500 furthermore has a more graphitic structure with larger basal plane (which are graphene‐like) domains and a larger graphitic layer stack thickness than ST1000.[] To obtain information on the depth profile of the SEI composition, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure ) were acquired for the unsputtered sodiated samples, and then after sequential removal (30 s intervals) of thin surface layers, to generate a composition depth profile shown in Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information.\nAfter sodiation of the electrodes (x\xa0= 0), the sp2 carbon peak in the C 1s spectra (Figure , Supporting Information) arising from the graphitic features of HC almost disappeared for both electrodes. This is an indication of a layer covering the surface of the HC, which could be linked to the decoration of HC surfaces at defect sites as observed from the computational results. As the etching time increases, the concentration of C\uf8feO decreases more rapidly in the ST1500 material (Figure\xa0). The ST1000 material is more defective than the ST1500[] (Figure\xa0). As seen from the C1s peak contributions (Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information), ST1000 has a higher degree of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO‐containing organic compound on the surface, therefore, it is expected to have a thicker SEI layer, confirming the simulation results presented here and also previously.[] It should be also considered that argon and oxygen form a strong donor–acceptor chemical bond, therefore, Ar+ sputtering might be causing the reduction of C\uf8ffO bonds and change the surface chemistry. Combining the computational and experimental insights into the EC‐carbon surface interaction, it could be shown that the presence of defects and curved motifs influence electrolyte breakdown and immobilization. Coupling these results to those of the sodiation of HC anodes, a series of materials considerations for the design of HC anodes could be made. HC materials, as stated in Section\xa0, are complex materials with a tunable structure, making them excellent for targeted materials design. The main structural motifs of HCs are graphene basal planes, graphitic pores with variable interlayer distance, and curved nanopores and surfaces. The results presented in this work show that the shape of the carbon motifs (basal plane vs rough surface) has a direct impact not only on the sodiation[] but also on the EC interaction. In general, the basal planes have higher defect formation energy than the curved motifs, indicating that the defect concentration under equilibrium conditions in the basal plane motifs would be lower.[] Oxygen defects and the formation of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO bonds were shown to lead to thicker SEIs and have previously been shown to give a significant contribution to the NIB I–V curve sloping regions.[] As noted previously for the sodiation of HC materials, oxygen heteroatoms are beneficial for the initial sodium storage but could contribute to irreversible capacity if present in significant concentrations due to their strong Na adsorption energies.[] The effect of these defects on EC adsorption is not as pronounced. Their interaction with the breakdown fragments of carbonates (especially CO3) can be significant as observed in Figure\xa0, which could lead to an increase in oxygen functional groups and CO2 outgassing.[] This could also explain why HC with a higher C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO concentration have thicker SEIs and should be considered when designing future HC anode materials. It is also clear from the work here that any undercoordinated HC site (i.e., that leads to an unsaturated carbon site) is a possible EC breakdown site, leading to increased defect concentration and the possibility of crosslinking (which has previously been observed for carbon vacancies in similar systems).[] Future studies will also show how other electrolyte molecules interact with these HC motifs, adding further materials design considerations. The challenge remains in linking the computationally optimized HC material to a synthetic route.\n\n\nExperimental Section\n\nComputational Details\nAll DFT and AIMD simulations in this were carried out using the CP2K code.[] Based on previous studies of metal–ion interactions with different carbon models, the PBE functional[] and DFT‐D3 method with Becke–Johnson damping[] for the dispersion correction were selected.[] All calculations were performed at the Γ‐point with a plane wave cut‐off of 650 Ry and the TZVP‐SR‐MOLOPT[] basis set. All parameters were converged to 0.01 meV with respect to energy and 0.001\xa0eV Å−1 with respect to forces. The HC models contained 800 carbon atoms. For all HC models, bulk cell optimizations were first performed using a quasi‐Newton algorithm with BFGS Hessian updating scheme[] to fully relax the structure in terms of lattice parameters and ion positions, whereby the lattice parameters were kept fixed in the geometry optimizations for the defect studies. After the cell optimizations of the HC models, the lattice vectors were kept fixed for geometry optimizations (also performed using BFGS) of the defect systems and the molecule adsorption. The defects were considered in the dilute limit, with a single defect of each type per 800 atom HC surface model. This choice was to allow the individual defect–molecule (fragment) interaction to be understood in the absence of any defect–defect interaction. To study the interaction between EC (and its fragments) with the pristine and defective HC systems, the initial position of the molecule based upon the most favored basal plane geometry was used. The whole system was then allowed to relax in a geometry relaxation. Other initial molecule geometries were tested, with the same final geometry obtained.\nTo investigate the interaction of EC molecules with the different carbon surfaces, DFT geometry optimizations of a single EC molecule at the different carbon surfaces were then performed to calculate the adsorption energy (Eads).[]1Eads=EEC@carbon\xa0surface−EEC−Ecarbon\xa0surface\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{E_{{\\rm{ads}}}} = {E_{{\\rm{EC@carbon surface}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{EC}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{carbon surface}}}}}\\end{array}\\]Here, EEC@carbon surface is the total energy of EC adsorbed on the rough models, Ecarbon surface is the total energy of the rough models presented in Section 2.1, and EEC is the total energy of an isolated EC molecule in vacuum. Using this convention, a negative Eads indicated that the EC adsorption process was exothermic, and hence, energetically favorable. A positive Eads on the other hand would indicate that the process was endothermic, and hence, energetically unfavorable. The defect formation energy was calculated according to Equation\xa0().[]2Efdefect=Edefective+∑niµi−Ebulk\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{E_{\\rm{f}}^{{\\rm{defect}}} = {E_{{\\rm{defective}}}} + \\sum {{\\rm{n}}_{\\rm{i}}}{\\mu _{\\rm{i}}} - {{\\rm{E}}_{{\\rm{bulk}}}}}\\end{array}\\]\nIn Equation\xa0(), Efdefect$E_f^{{\\rm{defect}}}$ is the defect formation energy, Edefective is the total energy of the defective carbon model, Ebulk is the total energy of the pristine carbon model, ni is the number of species either added or removed in relation to the pristine model (i.e., oxygen or carbon), and µi is the chemical potential of oxygen and carbon, respectively, dependent on defect.\nThe AIMD simulations were conducted on the optimized carbon surfaces whilst in contact with the liquid phase EC (density = 1.32\xa0g cm−3)[] using an NVT ensemble at 300 K with a time step of 0.5 fs and a Nosé–Hoover thermostat.[] The interphase models were equilibrated for 10\xa0ps, whereafter a production run of 10\xa0ps was conducted.\nHC materials were synthesized by a “soft templating technique” at 200 °C, under self‐generated pressure, and using absolute ethanol as the solvent. Phloroglucinol (1,3,5‐benzentriol, C6H6O3) was used as a carbon precursor, and the triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 (poly(ethylene oxide)‐block–poly(propylene oxide)‐block–poly(ethylene oxide, PEO106PPO70‐PEO106) was used as the template. The bi‐functional (aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups) glyoxylic acid was employed to cross‐link phloroglucinol. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich and used as received. In a typical experiment, 0.82\xa0g phloroglucinol and 0.61\xa0g glyoxylic acid monohydrate were mixed with 1.61\xa0g Pluronic F127 and dissolved under stirring at room temperature in 40\xa0mL absolute ethanol. The obtained clear solution was transferred into 100\xa0mL Teflon inlets, which were placed in stainless steel autoclaves (Parr Instruments). The mixture was heated up to 80 °C for 4\xa0h to form the phenolic resin framework and the solvothermal treatment was subsequently done at 200 °C for 12\xa0h. The materials were then filtered, dried at 80 °C and further pyrolyzed at 1000 °C (ST1000) and 1500 °C (ST1500) with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and a dwell time of 2\xa0h under inert N2 atmosphere.\nElectrodes were made using an 85:5:10 weight ratio of active material, carbon black (Super P conductive, 99+%, Alfa Aesar), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder (Mw ≈ 250\u2009000, Sigma Aldrich) in water. The obtained slurry was coated in a 250\xa0µm layer on Al foil (conductive carbon coated, 18\xa0µm, MTI corporation) by a doctor blade and dried at room temperature for 24\xa0h and then at 100 °C for 2\xa0h under vacuum. The foils were cut to a given diameter (usually 13\xa0mm diameter) with a punch cutter. The electrolyte and half‐cell preparation were conducted in an argon‐filled glove box with H2O < 0.5\xa0ppm, and O2\xa0< 0.5\xa0ppm. The CR2032 coin cells were assembled with a sodium metal disc (1\xa0mm thick, sodium ingot, 99.8% metals basis, Alfa Aesar) as a counter electrode (CE), and an HC anode as the working electrode (WE). The loading of electrode active materials on the current collector ranged from 2.5–5\xa0mg cm−2. Whatman GF/B glass microfiber was used as a separator. A 1\xa0m electrolyte solution containing predried (80 °C overnight) sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6 Alfa Aesar, 99+%) in melted EC (EC, anhydrous 99%, Sigma Aldrich), was prepared by stirring until fully dissolved. Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed on a Land system in the potential range of 0.001–2.5\xa0V versus Na+/Na for half‐cell configuration. The discharge current rate was 30\xa0mA g−1 which corresponds to a cycling rate of C/10.\nXPS measurements were recorded on a system equipped with an Al (Kα) source operating at 2 × 10−9\xa0mbar base pressure at ambient temperature. The spot size was 400 µm2, and a flood gun was operating during acquisition. Atomic compositions of the pristine electrodes were obtained from the averaged spectra taken from three areas for each sample (13\xa0mm diameter). For ex situ sputtering measurements (taken from three areas for each sample), after the coin cell disassembly, the recovered electrodes were carefully washed several times with melted EC. Then the washed electrodes were dried for 6 h to fully evaporate the solvent and then transferred to the vacuum transfer container. Argon sputtering for the XPS depth‐profiling was carried out using ion beam energies of 500\xa0eV. The etching rate calibrated on the Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) surface was ≈0.05\xa0nm s−1. The quantitative analyses were performed using Casa XPS software. The binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons.\nThe binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons. Shirley background function was applied and subtracted from the data. The peaks were fitted using a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian peak shapes. C1s and O 1s spectra were analyzed. The binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons. Mean values for atomic percentage are presented in Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information, with mean ± SD given in Tables  and , Supporting Information.\n\nComputational Details\nAll DFT and AIMD simulations in this were carried out using the CP2K code.[] Based on previous studies of metal–ion interactions with different carbon models, the PBE functional[] and DFT‐D3 method with Becke–Johnson damping[] for the dispersion correction were selected.[] All calculations were performed at the Γ‐point with a plane wave cut‐off of 650 Ry and the TZVP‐SR‐MOLOPT[] basis set.

A 1\xa0m electrolyte solution containing predried (80 °C overnight) sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6 Alfa Aesar, 99+%) in melted EC (EC, anhydrous 99%, Sigma Aldrich), was prepared by stirring until fully dissolved. Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed on a Land system in the potential range of 0.001–2.5\xa0V versus Na+/Na for half‐cell configuration. The discharge current rate was 30\xa0mA g−1 which corresponds to a cycling rate of C/10.\nXPS measurements were recorded on a system equipped with an Al (Kα) source operating at 2 × 10−9\xa0mbar base pressure at ambient temperature. The spot size was 400 µm2, and a flood gun was operating during acquisition. Atomic compositions of the pristine electrodes were obtained from the averaged spectra taken from three areas for each sample (13\xa0mm diameter).

To validate these results, we studied experimentally two HC materials[] with different microstructures that were discharged in an EC‐based electrolyte, ST1000 and ST1500. ST1000 consists of graphitic pores with larger average spacing between the graphitic planes (3.76 Å from small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS)/wide‐angle X‐ray scattering (WAXS) measurements for ST1000 and 3.68 Å for ST1500), has a larger concentration of defects, and smaller average micropore diameter (1.75\xa0nm for ST1000 and 2.2\xa0nm for ST1500) than the ST1500 HC material. ST1500 furthermore has a more graphitic structure with larger basal plane (which are graphene‐like) domains and a larger graphitic layer stack thickness than ST1000.[] To obtain information on the depth profile of the SEI composition, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure ) were acquired for the unsputtered sodiated samples, and then after sequential removal (30 s intervals) of thin surface layers, to generate a composition depth profile shown in Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information.\nAfter sodiation of the electrodes (x\xa0= 0), the sp2 carbon peak in the C 1s spectra (Figure , Supporting Information) arising from the graphitic features of HC almost disappeared for both electrodes. This is an indication of a layer covering the surface of the HC, which could be linked to the decoration of HC surfaces at defect sites as observed from the computational results. As the etching time increases, the concentration of C\uf8feO decreases more rapidly in the ST1500 material (Figure\xa0). The ST1000 material is more defective than the ST1500[] (Figure\xa0). As seen from the C1s peak contributions (Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information), ST1000 has a higher degree of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO‐containing organic compound on the surface, therefore, it is expected to have a thicker SEI layer, confirming the simulation results presented here and also previously.[] It should be also considered that argon and oxygen form a strong donor–acceptor chemical bond, therefore, Ar+ sputtering might be causing the reduction of C\uf8ffO bonds and change the surface chemistry. Combining the computational and experimental insights into the EC‐carbon surface interaction, it could be shown that the presence of defects and curved motifs influence electrolyte breakdown and immobilization. Coupling these results to those of the sodiation of HC anodes, a series of materials considerations for the design of HC anodes could be made. HC materials, as stated in Section\xa0, are complex materials with a tunable structure, making them excellent for targeted materials design. The main structural motifs of HCs are graphene basal planes, graphitic pores with variable interlayer distance, and curved nanopores and surfaces. The results presented in this work show that the shape of the carbon motifs (basal plane vs rough surface) has a direct impact not only on the sodiation[] but also on the EC interaction. In general, the basal planes have higher defect formation energy than the curved motifs, indicating that the defect concentration under equilibrium conditions in the basal plane motifs would be lower.[] Oxygen defects and the formation of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO bonds were shown to lead to thicker SEIs and have previously been shown to give a significant contribution to the NIB I–V curve sloping regions.[] As noted previously for the sodiation of HC materials, oxygen heteroatoms are beneficial for the initial sodium storage but could contribute to irreversible capacity if present in significant concentrations due to their strong Na adsorption energies.[] The effect of these defects on EC adsorption is not as pronounced. Their interaction with the breakdown fragments of carbonates (especially CO3) can be significant as observed in Figure\xa0, which could lead to an increase in oxygen functional groups and CO2 outgassing.[] This could also explain why HC with a higher C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO concentration have thicker SEIs and should be considered when designing future HC anode materials. It is also clear from the work here that any undercoordinated HC site (i.e., that leads to an unsaturated carbon site) is a possible EC breakdown site, leading to increased defect concentration and the possibility of crosslinking (which has previously been observed for carbon vacancies in similar systems).[] Future studies will also show how other electrolyte molecules interact with these HC motifs, adding further materials design considerations. The challenge remains in linking the computationally optimized HC material to a synthetic route.\n\n\nExperimental Section\n\nComputational Details\nAll DFT and AIMD simulations in this were carried out using the CP2K code.[] Based on previous studies of metal–ion interactions with different carbon models, the PBE functional[] and DFT‐D3 method with Becke–Johnson damping[] for the dispersion correction were selected.[] All calculations were performed at the Γ‐point with a plane wave cut‐off of 650 Ry and the TZVP‐SR‐MOLOPT[] basis set. All parameters were converged to 0.01 meV with respect to energy and 0.001\xa0eV Å−1 with respect to forces. The HC models contained 800 carbon atoms. For all HC models, bulk cell optimizations were first performed using a quasi‐Newton algorithm with BFGS Hessian updating scheme[] to fully relax the structure in terms of lattice parameters and ion positions, whereby the lattice parameters were kept fixed in the geometry optimizations for the defect studies. After the cell optimizations of the HC models, the lattice vectors were kept fixed for geometry optimizations (also performed using BFGS) of the defect systems and the molecule adsorption. The defects were considered in the dilute limit, with a single defect of each type per 800 atom HC surface model. This choice was to allow the individual defect–molecule (fragment) interaction to be understood in the absence of any defect–defect interaction. To study the interaction between EC (and its fragments) with the pristine and defective HC systems, the initial position of the molecule based upon the most favored basal plane geometry was used. The whole system was then allowed to relax in a geometry relaxation. Other initial molecule geometries were tested, with the same final geometry obtained.\nTo investigate the interaction of EC molecules with the different carbon surfaces, DFT geometry optimizations of a single EC molecule at the different carbon surfaces were then performed to calculate the adsorption energy (Eads).[]1Eads=EEC@carbon\xa0surface−EEC−Ecarbon\xa0surface\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{E_{{\\rm{ads}}}} = {E_{{\\rm{EC@carbon surface}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{EC}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{carbon surface}}}}}\\end{array}\\]Here, EEC@carbon surface is the total energy of EC adsorbed on the rough models, Ecarbon surface is the total energy of the rough models presented in Section 2.1, and EEC is the total energy of an isolated EC molecule in vacuum. Using this convention, a negative Eads indicated that the EC adsorption process was exothermic, and hence, energetically favorable. A positive Eads on the other hand would indicate that the process was endothermic, and hence, energetically unfavorable. The defect formation energy was calculated according to Equation\xa0().[]2Efdefect=Edefective+∑niµi−Ebulk\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{E_{\\rm{f}}^{{\\rm{defect}}} = {E_{{\\rm{defective}}}} + \\sum {{\\rm{n}}_{\\rm{i}}}{\\mu _{\\rm{i}}} - {{\\rm{E}}_{{\\rm{bulk}}}}}\\end{array}\\]\nIn Equation\xa0(), Efdefect$E_f^{{\\rm{defect}}}$ is the defect formation energy, Edefective is the total energy of the defective carbon model, Ebulk is the total energy of the pristine carbon model, ni is the number of species either added or removed in relation to the pristine model (i.e., oxygen or carbon), and µi is the chemical potential of oxygen and carbon, respectively, dependent on defect.\nThe AIMD simulations were conducted on the optimized carbon surfaces whilst in contact with the liquid phase EC (density = 1.32\xa0g cm−3)[] using an NVT ensemble at 300 K with a time step of 0.5 fs and a Nosé–Hoover thermostat.[] The interphase models were equilibrated for 10\xa0ps, whereafter a production run of 10\xa0ps was conducted.\nHC materials were synthesized by a “soft templating technique” at 200 °C, under self‐generated pressure, and using absolute ethanol as the solvent. Phloroglucinol (1,3,5‐benzentriol, C6H6O3) was used as a carbon precursor, and the triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 (poly(ethylene oxide)‐block–poly(propylene oxide)‐block–poly(ethylene oxide, PEO106PPO70‐PEO106) was used as the template. The bi‐functional (aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups) glyoxylic acid was employed to cross‐link phloroglucinol. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich and used as received. In a typical experiment, 0.82\xa0g phloroglucinol and 0.61\xa0g glyoxylic acid monohydrate were mixed with 1.61\xa0g Pluronic F127 and dissolved under stirring at room temperature in 40\xa0mL absolute ethanol. The obtained clear solution was transferred into 100\xa0mL Teflon inlets, which were placed in stainless steel autoclaves (Parr Instruments). The mixture was heated up to 80 °C for 4\xa0h to form the phenolic resin framework and the solvothermal treatment was subsequently done at 200 °C for 12\xa0h.

The materials were then filtered, dried at 80 °C and further pyrolyzed at 1000 °C (ST1000) and 1500 °C (ST1500) with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and a dwell time of 2\xa0h under inert N2 atmosphere.\nElectrodes were made using an 85:5:10 weight ratio of active material, carbon black (Super P conductive, 99+%, Alfa Aesar), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder (Mw ≈ 250\u2009000, Sigma Aldrich) in water. The obtained slurry was coated in a 250\xa0µm layer on Al foil (conductive carbon coated, 18\xa0µm, MTI corporation) by a doctor blade and dried at room temperature for 24\xa0h and then at 100 °C for 2\xa0h under vacuum. The foils were cut to a given diameter (usually 13\xa0mm diameter) with a punch cutter. The electrolyte and half‐cell preparation were conducted in an argon‐filled glove box with H2O < 0.5\xa0ppm, and O2\xa0< 0.5\xa0ppm. The CR2032 coin cells were assembled with a sodium metal disc (1\xa0mm thick, sodium ingot, 99.8% metals basis, Alfa Aesar) as a counter electrode (CE), and an HC anode as the working electrode (WE). The loading of electrode active materials on the current collector ranged from 2.5–5\xa0mg cm−2. Whatman GF/B glass microfiber was used as a separator. A 1\xa0m electrolyte solution containing predried (80 °C overnight) sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6 Alfa Aesar, 99+%) in melted EC (EC, anhydrous 99%, Sigma Aldrich), was prepared by stirring until fully dissolved. Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed on a Land system in the potential range of 0.001–2.5\xa0V versus Na+/Na for half‐cell configuration. The discharge current rate was 30\xa0mA g−1 which corresponds to a cycling rate of C/10.\nXPS measurements were recorded on a system equipped with an Al (Kα) source operating at 2 × 10−9\xa0mbar base pressure at ambient temperature. The spot size was 400 µm2, and a flood gun was operating during acquisition. Atomic compositions of the pristine electrodes were obtained from the averaged spectra taken from three areas for each sample (13\xa0mm diameter). For ex situ sputtering measurements (taken from three areas for each sample), after the coin cell disassembly, the recovered electrodes were carefully washed several times with melted EC. Then the washed electrodes were dried for 6 h to fully evaporate the solvent and then transferred to the vacuum transfer container. Argon sputtering for the XPS depth‐profiling was carried out using ion beam energies of 500\xa0eV. The etching rate calibrated on the Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) surface was ≈0.05\xa0nm s−1. The quantitative analyses were performed using Casa XPS software. The binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons.\nThe binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons. Shirley background function was applied and subtracted from the data. The peaks were fitted using a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian peak shapes. C1s and O 1s spectra were analyzed.

To validate these results, we studied experimentally two HC materials[] with different microstructures that were discharged in an EC‐based electrolyte, ST1000 and ST1500. ST1000 consists of graphitic pores with larger average spacing between the graphitic planes (3.76 Å from small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS)/wide‐angle X‐ray scattering (WAXS) measurements for ST1000 and 3.68 Å for ST1500), has a larger concentration of defects, and smaller average micropore diameter (1.75\xa0nm for ST1000 and 2.2\xa0nm for ST1500) than the ST1500 HC material. ST1500 furthermore has a more graphitic structure with larger basal plane (which are graphene‐like) domains and a larger graphitic layer stack thickness than ST1000.[] To obtain information on the depth profile of the SEI composition, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure ) were acquired for the unsputtered sodiated samples, and then after sequential removal (30 s intervals) of thin surface layers, to generate a composition depth profile shown in Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information.\nAfter sodiation of the electrodes (x\xa0= 0), the sp2 carbon peak in the C 1s spectra (Figure , Supporting Information) arising from the graphitic features of HC almost disappeared for both electrodes. This is an indication of a layer covering the surface of the HC, which could be linked to the decoration of HC surfaces at defect sites as observed from the computational results. As the etching time increases, the concentration of C\uf8feO decreases more rapidly in the ST1500 material (Figure\xa0). The ST1000 material is more defective than the ST1500[] (Figure\xa0). As seen from the C1s peak contributions (Figure  and Tables  and , Supporting Information), ST1000 has a higher degree of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO‐containing organic compound on the surface, therefore, it is expected to have a thicker SEI layer, confirming the simulation results presented here and also previously.[] It should be also considered that argon and oxygen form a strong donor–acceptor chemical bond, therefore, Ar+ sputtering might be causing the reduction of C\uf8ffO bonds and change the surface chemistry. Combining the computational and experimental insights into the EC‐carbon surface interaction, it could be shown that the presence of defects and curved motifs influence electrolyte breakdown and immobilization. Coupling these results to those of the sodiation of HC anodes, a series of materials considerations for the design of HC anodes could be made. HC materials, as stated in Section\xa0, are complex materials with a tunable structure, making them excellent for targeted materials design. The main structural motifs of HCs are graphene basal planes, graphitic pores with variable interlayer distance, and curved nanopores and surfaces. The results presented in this work show that the shape of the carbon motifs (basal plane vs rough surface) has a direct impact not only on the sodiation[] but also on the EC interaction. In general, the basal planes have higher defect formation energy than the curved motifs, indicating that the defect concentration under equilibrium conditions in the basal plane motifs would be lower.[] Oxygen defects and the formation of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO bonds were shown to lead to thicker SEIs and have previously been shown to give a significant contribution to the NIB I–V curve sloping regions.[] As noted previously for the sodiation of HC materials, oxygen heteroatoms are beneficial for the initial sodium storage but could contribute to irreversible capacity if present in significant concentrations due to their strong Na adsorption energies.[] The effect of these defects on EC adsorption is not as pronounced. Their interaction with the breakdown fragments of carbonates (especially CO3) can be significant as observed in Figure\xa0, which could lead to an increase in oxygen functional groups and CO2 outgassing.[] This could also explain why HC with a higher C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO concentration have thicker SEIs and should be considered when designing future HC anode materials. It is also clear from the work here that any undercoordinated HC site (i.e., that leads to an unsaturated carbon site) is a possible EC breakdown site, leading to increased defect concentration and the possibility of crosslinking (which has previously been observed for carbon vacancies in similar systems).[] Future studies will also show how other electrolyte molecules interact with these HC motifs, adding further materials design considerations. The challenge remains in linking the computationally optimized HC material to a synthetic route.\n\n\nExperimental Section\n\nComputational Details\nAll DFT and AIMD simulations in this were carried out using the CP2K code.[] Based on previous studies of metal–ion interactions with different carbon models, the PBE functional[] and DFT‐D3 method with Becke–Johnson damping[] for the dispersion correction were selected.[] All calculations were performed at the Γ‐point with a plane wave cut‐off of 650 Ry and the TZVP‐SR‐MOLOPT[] basis set.

The materials were then filtered, dried at 80 °C and further pyrolyzed at 1000 °C (ST1000) and 1500 °C (ST1500) with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and a dwell time of 2\xa0h under inert N2 atmosphere.\nElectrodes were made using an 85:5:10 weight ratio of active material, carbon black (Super P conductive, 99+%, Alfa Aesar), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder (Mw ≈ 250\u2009000, Sigma Aldrich) in water. The obtained slurry was coated in a 250\xa0µm layer on Al foil (conductive carbon coated, 18\xa0µm, MTI corporation) by a doctor blade and dried at room temperature for 24\xa0h and then at 100 °C for 2\xa0h under vacuum. The foils were cut to a given diameter (usually 13\xa0mm diameter) with a punch cutter. The electrolyte and half‐cell preparation were conducted in an argon‐filled glove box with H2O < 0.5\xa0ppm, and O2\xa0< 0.5\xa0ppm. The CR2032 coin cells were assembled with a sodium metal disc (1\xa0mm thick, sodium ingot, 99.8% metals basis, Alfa Aesar) as a counter electrode (CE), and an HC anode as the working electrode (WE). The loading of electrode active materials on the current collector ranged from 2.5–5\xa0mg cm−2. Whatman GF/B glass microfiber was used as a separator. A 1\xa0m electrolyte solution containing predried (80 °C overnight) sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6 Alfa Aesar, 99+%) in melted EC (EC, anhydrous 99%, Sigma Aldrich), was prepared by stirring until fully dissolved. Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed on a Land system in the potential range of 0.001–2.5\xa0V versus Na+/Na for half‐cell configuration. The discharge current rate was 30\xa0mA g−1 which corresponds to a cycling rate of C/10.\nXPS measurements were recorded on a system equipped with an Al (Kα) source operating at 2 × 10−9\xa0mbar base pressure at ambient temperature. The spot size was 400 µm2, and a flood gun was operating during acquisition. Atomic compositions of the pristine electrodes were obtained from the averaged spectra taken from three areas for each sample (13\xa0mm diameter). For ex situ sputtering measurements (taken from three areas for each sample), after the coin cell disassembly, the recovered electrodes were carefully washed several times with melted EC. Then the washed electrodes were dried for 6 h to fully evaporate the solvent and then transferred to the vacuum transfer container. Argon sputtering for the XPS depth‐profiling was carried out using ion beam energies of 500\xa0eV. The etching rate calibrated on the Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) surface was ≈0.05\xa0nm s−1. The quantitative analyses were performed using Casa XPS software. The binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons.\nThe binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons. Shirley background function was applied and subtracted from the data. The peaks were fitted using a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian peak shapes. C1s and O 1s spectra were analyzed. The binding energies were corrected to the C 1s peak position at 284.8\xa0eV originating from surface hydrocarbons. Mean values for atomic percentage are presented in Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information, with mean ± SD given in Tables  and , Supporting Information.\n\nComputational Details\nAll DFT and AIMD simulations in this were carried out using the CP2K code.[] Based on previous studies of metal–ion interactions with different carbon models, the PBE functional[] and DFT‐D3 method with Becke–Johnson damping[] for the dispersion correction were selected.[] All calculations were performed at the Γ‐point with a plane wave cut‐off of 650 Ry and the TZVP‐SR‐MOLOPT[] basis set. All parameters were converged to 0.01 meV with respect to energy and 0.001\xa0eV Å−1 with respect to forces. The HC models contained 800 carbon atoms. For all HC models, bulk cell optimizations were first performed using a quasi‐Newton algorithm with BFGS Hessian updating scheme[] to fully relax the structure in terms of lattice parameters and ion positions, whereby the lattice parameters were kept fixed in the geometry optimizations for the defect studies. After the cell optimizations of the HC models, the lattice vectors were kept fixed for geometry optimizations (also performed using BFGS) of the defect systems and the molecule adsorption. The defects were considered in the dilute limit, with a single defect of each type per 800 atom HC surface model. This choice was to allow the individual defect–molecule (fragment) interaction to be understood in the absence of any defect–defect interaction. To study the interaction between EC (and its fragments) with the pristine and defective HC systems, the initial position of the molecule based upon the most favored basal plane geometry was used. The whole system was then allowed to relax in a geometry relaxation. Other initial molecule geometries were tested, with the same final geometry obtained.\nTo investigate the interaction of EC molecules with the different carbon surfaces, DFT geometry optimizations of a single EC molecule at the different carbon surfaces were then performed to calculate the adsorption energy (Eads).[]1Eads=EEC@carbon\xa0surface−EEC−Ecarbon\xa0surface\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{E_{{\\rm{ads}}}} = {E_{{\\rm{EC@carbon surface}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{EC}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{carbon surface}}}}}\\end{array}\\]Here, EEC@carbon surface is the total energy of EC adsorbed on the rough models, Ecarbon surface is the total energy of the rough models presented in Section 2.1, and EEC is the total energy of an isolated EC molecule in vacuum. Using this convention, a negative Eads indicated that the EC adsorption process was exothermic, and hence, energetically favorable. A positive Eads on the other hand would indicate that the process was endothermic, and hence, energetically unfavorable. The defect formation energy was calculated according to Equation\xa0().[]2Efdefect=Edefective+∑niµi−Ebulk\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{E_{\\rm{f}}^{{\\rm{defect}}} = {E_{{\\rm{defective}}}} + \\sum {{\\rm{n}}_{\\rm{i}}}{\\mu _{\\rm{i}}} - {{\\rm{E}}_{{\\rm{bulk}}}}}\\end{array}\\]\nIn Equation\xa0(), Efdefect$E_f^{{\\rm{defect}}}$ is the defect formation energy, Edefective is the total energy of the defective carbon model, Ebulk is the total energy of the pristine carbon model, ni is the number of species either added or removed in relation to the pristine model (i.e., oxygen or carbon), and µi is the chemical potential of oxygen and carbon, respectively, dependent on defect.\nThe AIMD simulations were conducted on the optimized carbon surfaces whilst in contact with the liquid phase EC (density = 1.32\xa0g cm−3)[] using an NVT ensemble at 300 K with a time step of 0.5 fs and a Nosé–Hoover thermostat.[] The interphase models were equilibrated for 10\xa0ps, whereafter a production run of 10\xa0ps was conducted.\nHC materials were synthesized by a “soft templating technique” at 200 °C, under self‐generated pressure, and using absolute ethanol as the solvent. Phloroglucinol (1,3,5‐benzentriol, C6H6O3) was used as a carbon precursor, and the triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 (poly(ethylene oxide)‐block–poly(propylene oxide)‐block–poly(ethylene oxide, PEO106PPO70‐PEO106) was used as the template. The bi‐functional (aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups) glyoxylic acid was employed to cross‐link phloroglucinol. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich and used as received. In a typical experiment, 0.82\xa0g phloroglucinol and 0.61\xa0g glyoxylic acid monohydrate were mixed with 1.61\xa0g Pluronic F127 and dissolved under stirring at room temperature in 40\xa0mL absolute ethanol.

In particular, if the Fermi level enters into the conduction band of TiO2 near the interface, the conduction band will become degenerate with a very high concentration of electrons. The 2D electron gas (2DEG)–like electron accumulation can generate a strong electrostatic field near the interface. The low‐work‐function metallic TiC is chosen for this work since it has a cubic structure with the lattice parameter (a\xa0= 0.432\xa0nm) very close to that of anatase TiO2 (tetragonal, a\xa0= b\xa0= 0.378\xa0nm, c\xa0= 0.951\xa0nm). Moreover, the work function of TiC is sufficiently low (ϕ\xa0= 4.1\xa0eV),[] even lower than the electron affinity of the anatase TiO2 (χTiO2\xa0= 5.1\xa0eV),[] as shown in Scheme . It is noted that even if the TiC is partially nitrided, that is, TiCxN1–x, the inequality ϕ\xa0<\xa0χTiO2 can always be implemented.[] To simplify the estimate, we just let x\xa0= 1 for TiCxN1–x. Upon contact, the Fermi level at the interface is located at 1.0\xa0eV above the conduction band minimum, as shown in Scheme\xa0. The degenerate electron concentration n0 in the conduction band can be expressed as1n0=2mn∗3/22π2ℏ3∫∞EcE−EC1/21+expE−EFkBTdE=NC2πF1/2EF−ECkBTwhere mn∗ is the effective mass of electron (=0.094 m0 for anatase TiO2,[] m0 is the rest mass of an electron), ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, EC is the conduction band minimum, EF is the Fermi level, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, NC is the effective densities of states in the conduction band, and F1/2 is the Fermi integral of 1/2 order. Equation\xa0() gives the value for n0 as high as 1.46 × 1020 cm−3 (see Supporting Information for detailed calculation). The thickness (W) of space charge layer is typically 3\xa0nm,[] but the electron concentration is the highest at the place closest to the interface. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that all (or at least most of the) electrons are confined within the thin layer of the thickness of δ\xa0≈ 1\xa0nm near the interface (Scheme\xa0). In this way, the electric field strength in the space charge region can be estimated as ε\xa0= 1.03 × 107\xa0V cm−1 (≈1\xa0V nm−1, see Supporting Information for detailed calculation). Such an electric field is strong enough to significantly reduce the diffusion barrier of Na+ in TiO2, which will be discussed in detail later. As a result, the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 heterostructure has a markedly improved performance. The specific capacity of the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrode reaches 312.3 (0.1 C) and 173.7 mAh g−1 (10 C), outperforming most of the reported TiO2‐based heterostructure SIB negative electrodes (Scheme\xa0).\nThe microstructure of the plasma‐treated TiO2 nanoparticles was studied using advanced electron microscopy. TiO2 particles with a size of about 15–50\xa0nm can be seen under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure\xa0), which is different from the original TiO2 particles with the uniform size of 25\xa0nm in diameter (Figure , Supporting Information). Many TiO2 particles smaller or larger than 25\xa0nm can be found everywhere in the TEM images (Figure , Supporting Information). Furthermore, the TiO2 particles are decorated with many ultra‐fine nanoparticles, which are TiCxN1–x particles formed by the reaction of carbon and nitrogen species in the decomposition products of urea (NH2CONH2\xa0→ HNCO + NH3) with TiO2. In the high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image shown in Figure\xa0, the inter‐planar spacing of 0.35\xa0nm of the lattice fringes is assigned to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. In addition, the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.238\xa0nm can also be seen in some HRTEM images (Figure , Supporting Information), which corresponds to the spacing of the (004) plane of anatase TiO2. The ultrafine TiCxN1–x particles with a diameter of about 1–3\xa0nm attached to TiO2 are marked by black arrows in Figure\xa0. The (101), (004), (200), and (105) diffraction rings of anatase TiO2 can be distinguished in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure\xa0).\nFigure\xa0 shows the Scanning transmission electron microscopy–high angle annular dark‐field imaging (STEM‐HAADF) image of a TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 heterostructure viewed along the (010) direction of anatase TiO2. In this atomic‐resolution image, the inter‐plane spacing of 0.35\xa0nm of (101) plane and 0.38\xa0nm of (100) plane can be clearly differentiated for the anatase TiO2. A TiCxN1–x particle at the upper right corner has a lattice fringe spacing of 0.21\xa0nm, which corresponds to the (200) crystal plane of TiCxN1–x. It is noted that the (200) plane of TiCxN1–x is parallel to the (100) plane of anatase TiO2, and their lattice parameters are close to each other (TiO2 with space group of I41/amd, a\xa0= b\xa0= 0.378\xa0nm; TiCxN1–x with space group of Fm3m, a\xa0= 0.428\xa0± 0.4\xa0nm). The stoichiometric value x of TiCxN1–x is difficult to identify since the lattice parameters of TiC (0.432\xa0nm) and TiN (0.424\xa0nm) are very close. But x is surely neither 1 nor 0, since carbon and nitrogen are well dispersed in the heterostructure as revealed by the elemental mapping images (Figure\xa0) of the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 particles (Figure\xa0). This result also confirms that nitrogen is indeed doped in TiO2. Considering the TiCxN1–x particle to be small enough to accommodate the lattice mismatch, it can be concluded that the TiCxN1–x particles are epitaxially grown on the anatase TiO2 without significant dislocations. The TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 heterostructure is sketched in Figure\xa0. The epitaxial TiCxN1–x on N‐TiO2 is particularly important since the interfacial state and Fermi level pinning can be essentially avoided.\nSuch complex processes, production of TiCxN1–x, epitaxial growth of heterostructures, and nitrogen doping, are completed in the plasma at the same time within 5 min, which reflects the excellent ability of the plasmas to induce metastable hybrid phases that are impossible for conventional thermochemical reactions. By calculating the change of Gibbs free energy, it is found that the forward proceeding of the reversible reaction TiO2(s) + 3C(s)‐TiC(s) + 2CO(g) at low pressure (10−3–1\xa0bar) requires a temperature over 1000 °C.[] The coexistence of TiC and TiO2 in a low‐temperature system indicates that the reversible reaction is frozen in a metastable state. In this case, a metastable hybrid‐phase system is formed, that is, the total Gibbs free energy of the system is at a local minimum rather than at the lowest possible minimum. This is due to the essentially non‐equilibrium characteristics of the plasma, and is also the result of the conductive TiC phase absorbing microwaves and becoming a hot spot to accelerate the local reaction process. In our past studies, the ability of plasmas to induce metastable hybrid phases has also been observed.[] In addition, the plasma accelerated other reaction kinetics. The size of TiO2 nanoparticles becomes more non‐uniform after the plasma processing, suggesting the occurrence of Ostwald ripening. Specifically, Ti and O atoms are likely to be removed from the surface of the nanoparticles by the plasma exposure, and then redeposit on the larger nanoparticles at the expense of the smaller ones, as illustrated in Figure\xa0. The Ostwald ripening of TiO2 nanoparticles has been reported in wet chemical synthesis, but it took as long as tens of hours to complete,[] which is in sharp contrast to the plasma‐driven process that occurs on a time scale of minutes. The formation of TiCxN1–x also validates the effects of Ostwald ripening—some of the Ti radicals react with carbon and nitrogen‐containing free radicals in the plasma to form TiCxN1–x. Moreover, we speculate that Ostwald ripening plays a crucial role in the incorporation of N atoms into TiO2. Indeed, the plasma exposure may increase the surface energy by peeling off the reconstructed surfaces of TiO2 nanoparticles, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the N atom entry.\nThe crystal structures and phases of the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrode are analyzed by X‐ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Figure\xa0. Strong diffraction peaks at 43.26, 50.38, and 74.06° correspond to diffraction of (111), (200), and (220) planes of copper (PDF No.04‐0836), which are derived from the copper current collector of the electrode. In addition to Cu, the anatase TiO2 phase and a small amount of TiCxN1–x phase can be identified. The peaks at 25.24, 37.76, 48.00, 53.94, 55.00, and 62.54° correspond to diffraction of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) planes of anatase TiO2 (PDF No. 21–1272), respectively. Furthermore, the diffraction peak at 41.42° corresponds to the (200) plane of TiCxN1–x. Limitations of analysis are further discussed in the Supporting Information.\nThe chemical states and elemental bonding states of TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 were further investigated by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the XPS survey scan, the peaks at 458.01, 529.91, 284.72, and 395.98\xa0eV correspond to the core level emission of Ti 2p, O 1s, N 1s, and C 1s, respectively, as shown in Figure\xa0. The atomic percentage (at.%) of nitrogen in the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 is about 5.99 at.%. The carbon is mainly from the thermal carbonization of PVDF in the electrode and the decomposition of urea. The high‐resolution spectrum of C 1s contains 4 deconvolution peaks, C\uf8ffTi (281.43\xa0eV), C\uf8ffC (284.29\xa0eV), C\uf8ffN (287.20\xa0eV), and C\uf8ffO (288.87\xa0eV)[] (Figure\xa0), of which the weak C\uf8ffTi component reveals the formation of TiCxN1–x.\nThe high‐resolution spectrum of N 1s electron has three deconvolution peaks, among which the sub‐peak at 399.5\xa0eV belongs to the C\uf8ffN bond, in agreement with the result of C 1s spectrum.[] The doping of N atoms in the TiO2 lattice will increase the electron concentration of N and decrease the binding energy, which corresponds to interstitial doped \uf8ffO\uf8ffTi\uf8ffN (395.6\xa0eV) and substitutional doped Ti\uf8ffO\uf8ffN (396.3\xa0eV) states[] (Figure\xa0). About 66.2% of N atoms are incorporated in TiO2 as estimated by the three components of N 1s emission. The emission associated with Ti 2p electrons has two spin‐orbit splitting peaks at 458.4 and 464.1\xa0eV, corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 states, indicating that the Ti element in the sample is mainly fully oxidized Ti4+ (Ti‐O).[] The broadening of the two peaks at the low‐energy slopes indicates that the electron density around Ti has increased, which is usually considered as a sign of oxygen vacancies.[] The deconvolution peaks at 456.8 and 462.5\xa0eV correspond to the Ti\uf8ffN\uf8ffO bond,[] and the other components at 455.1 and 460.8\xa0eV correspond to the Ti\uf8ffN bond[] (Figure\xa0). The high‐resolution spectrum of O 1s electron emission indicates two sub‐peaks at 529.8 and 530.9\xa0eV (Figure\xa0), corresponding to lattice oxygen (Ti\uf8ffO\uf8ffTi) and oxygen vacancies (N\uf8ffTi\uf8ffO).[]\nThe electron valence band structure of TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 can be revealed by XPS valence bands, as shown in Figure\xa0. The top of the valence band of TiO2 is 2.53\xa0eV below the Fermi level, indicating an n‐type and self‐doping by native oxygen vacancies. After the plasma treatment, the valence band edge shifts to 2.21\xa0eV (Fermi level position in Scheme\xa0) with a band tail extending to 0.89\xa0eV. Nitrogen is an acceptor impurity in TiO2, which reduces the Fermi level. The valence band tail is derived from N 2p electrons.[] Clearly, nitrogen doping can increase the work function of TiO2 and hence the concentration of the degenerate electrons at the interface when forming a heterojunction, as predicted by Equation\xa0(). Particularly, there is a weak band at the Fermi level for TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 as marked by an arrow in Figure\xa0. The non‐zero density of states at the Fermi level is an indication of metallic character of TiCxN1–x originated from Ti 3d free electrons.[] The XPS results confirmed the successful N doping, the resulting oxygen vacancies in TiO2, and the formation of TiCxN1–x.\nThe electrochemical performances of TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrodes have been studied, in comparison with the results using the reference TiO2 electrodes. First, the galvanostatic charge‐discharge in the potential range of 0.01–3.0\xa0V (vs Na+/Na) at a rate of 0.1 C (1 C = 335.5 mAh g−1) was tested, of which the curves in the second cycle are displayed in Figure\xa0. The discharge specific capacity of TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 in the 2nd cycle is 388.8 mAh g−1, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of TiO2 (335.5 mAh g−1), while that of the pristine TiO2 is only 293.5 mAh g−1. The increase in specific capacity may be caused by active oxygen vacancies in doped TiO2 and the resulting Ti3+.[] Figure\xa0 compares the rate performances of the pristine TiO2 and TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrodes. The discharge specific capacities of the pristine TiO2 electrode reach 287.2, 228.2, 196.6, 177.2, 134.3, and 114.4 mAh g−1 at the rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 C, respectively. At the same rates, the specific capacities of TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrode increase to 358.0, 312.0, 265.3, 245.5, 225.8, 195.7, and 173.7 mAh g−1, respectively. After the deep charge and discharge, the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrode maintained a reversible capacity of 312.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, which was 87.8% of the initial value, showing excellent capacity retention.\nSubsequently, the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrode was subjected to 600 cycles of charge and discharge at a rate of 10 C, as shown in Figure\xa0. The capacity of the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrode was maintained at 171.1 mAh g−1 after 600 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 98.7% and a coulombic efficiency of 100%. The pristine TiO2 electrode had a capacity of 106.6 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles, with a capacity retention of 94.7%. The above results confirm the positive effects of N doping and TiCxN1–x ultrafine nanoparticles on improving the specific capacity, charge‐discharge kinetics, and long‐term cycle stability of TiO2 electrodes. Our results are among the top tier results for the recently reported TiO2 based SIB anodes; the corresponding comparison is provided in Scheme\xa0 and Table , Supporting Information.\nTo further reveal the effect of electric field at the heterointerface on the Na+ ion migration, the electrodes were tested with cyclic voltammetry (CV) at the increasing scan rate from 0.2 to 10\xa0mV s−1. The CV curves are shown in Figure\xa0. With the increase of the scan rate, the redox current of TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 and TiO2 gradually increased, and the redox overpotential increased as well. At any scan rate v, the current on the electrode is composed of a diffusion‐controlled Faradaic current for Na+ ion insertion/extraction and a capacitive current. The Faradaic current at the redox peak (idiff) scales linearly with v1/2, which can be expressed as2idiff=0.4463F3RT1/2n3/2AD1/2C∗v1/2where C* is the reactant concentration at the surface of the electrode material, R is the molar gas constant, D is the diffusion coefficient, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrode reaction, A is the surface area of the electrode materials, F is the Faraday constant, R is the molar gas constant, and T is the temperature.[] The capacitive current at the redox peak (icap) is proportional to v,3\u2009icap=\u2009ACdvwhere Cd is the capacitance. These expressions (Equations\xa0() and ()) show that idiff and icap are not explicit functions of the electric potential. Following the procedure described in ref. [], icap and idiff at any redox peaks can be differentiated, as shown in Figure\xa0. It should be noted that the popular procedure proposed by Dunn et\xa0al. cannot be applied appropriately here, since significant peak shifts are observed.[] On the other hand, the method adopted from ref. [] works well; indeed, as shown in Figure , Supporting Information, the oxidation icap of both TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 and TiO2 present clear linear dependency on v.\nThe kinetics of Na+ ion transport in electrodes can be investigated by analyzing the variations of idiff. Linearly fitting the oxidation idiff versus v1/2, the Na+ ion diffusion coefficient D can be compared, as suggested by Equation\xa0() (idiff\xa0∝ D1/2v1/2). The resulting slopes corresponding to the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 (1.59) and the TiO2 (0.68) electrodes convey that the diffusion coefficient of the former is 5.5 (=(1.59/0.68)2) times that of the latter (Figure\xa0). The hopping diffusion in solids is quantified with a diffusion coefficient4D\u2009=D0\u2009exp−EAkBTwhere D0 is a pre‐exponential factor, EA is the apparent activation energy, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Therefore, a 5.5‐fold increase in the diffusion coefficient indicates a 1.7‐fold decrease in EA.\nNow we can discuss how the built‐in electric field at the heterointerface affects the transport of Na+ ions. In the reported hopping diffusion studies, Na+ moved along the c‐axis of a bulk anatase TiO2 unit cell by a distance of 1/2 c\xa0= 0.48\xa0nm (Figure\xa0), experiencing a hopping barrier of 0.56\xa0eV (Figure\xa0).[] As mentioned above, the electric field strength at the heterointerface is as high as 1\xa0V nm−1, which will cause the hopping barrier to tilt substantially. The electric field reduces the barrier by 0.24\xa0eV [=1/2 × (0.48\xa0nm) × (1\xa0V nm−1)], and the tilted barrier height is 0.32\xa0eV (Figure\xa0). Therefore, the diffusion barrier at the heterointerface is 1.75 (=5.6\xa0eV/3.2\xa0eV) times lower than that of bulk TiO2, which is almost identical to the experimental result. Additionally, the charge transfer resistance [diameter of the semicircle of the Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plot] of the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 is much smaller than the pristine anatase TiO2 (Figure\xa0), confirming that the charge transfer kinetics has indeed been improved by the heterointerface and the nitrogen doping. The higher slope of the oblique portion in the Nyquist plot in the low‐frequency range corresponding to the TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 electrode compared to the TiO2 electrode evidences the faster diffusion in the heterostructure.\nBased on the above results, some generic guidelines for designing high‐performance heterostructured electrodes can be formulated. First, the active part of the heterostructure must be electron accumulating rather than depleting, otherwise it will repel cations instead of attracting, thus substantially impeding ion transport in the host electrode material. Second, to achieve an electric field that can significantly reduce the diffusion barrier, the concentration of the accumulated electrons must be high enough. For example, trying to make a degenerate layer at the active side of the heterogeneous interface is a feasible way to achieve this requirement. Finally, to ensure the energy band engineering of the interface, it is necessary to construct a high‐quality, ideally flawless interface. Otherwise, the effects of unknown interface features may become difficult to predict.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The “many‐birds” of the plasma “stone” include the simultaneous epitaxial growth of the heterostructure, interface energy‐band engineering, and N‐doping. The preparation of the anatase TiO2 electrode followed the established process. The slurry for electrodes were prepared with anatase TiO2 nanopowder (0.2\xa0g, Aladdin, purity >\xa099.8%, 25\xa0nm), acetylene black (0.025\xa0g), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 0.025\xa0g) by vigorous stirring in N‐methylpyrrolidone (NMP, 1\xa0mL). The slurry was coated on copper foil and vacuum dried at 100\xa0°C for 12 h to obtain TiO2 electrodes.\nThe realization of the epitaxial growth of heterostructure, interface energy‐band engineering, and N‐doping relied on the non‐equilibrium character of the plasma, as well as the proprietary design of the plasma reactor and the process. The as‐obtained TiO2 electrode was placed in a quartz reactor coupled with a rectangular microwave waveguide. After the reactor was evacuated, 10 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) of argon were flown in. The urea was heated to 120\xa0°C to make it sublime upstream of the TiO2 electrode. The power of the microwave source was turned up to 500 W to ignite the plasma, and then H2 (100 sccm) gas was introduced. The temperature in the reactor was about 500\xa0°C as measured by an infrared thermometer. The plasma process was maintained for 5 min, then the sample was cooled in Ar flow after turning off the plasma.\nThe crystallographic phases of the samples were investigated with XRD (Bruker D8 Advance A25) using Cu Ka radiation with a scan rate of 4° min−1. The structure and morphology of the nanomaterials were examined by TEM, HRTEM (TEM, JEOL JEM‐2100f). STEM‐HAADF was conducted on a Themis Z (FEI, Titan Z G3, 300\xa0kV). XPS was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi XPS.\nThe electrodes were assembled into CR2016 coin cells with the metal Na as the counter and reference electrode, glass fiber (Whatman GF/D, 19\xa0mm in diameter) as the separator, and NaClO4 1 m in a mix of ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (volume ratio of 1:1) with 5\xa0vol.% fluoroethylene carbonate as the electrolyte. The mass of the material loading on an electrode was obtained by weighing N electrodes, subtracting the mass of N pieces of current collectors, and then divided by N. The mass of active material on an electrode = the material loading on an electrode × 0.8. The specific capacity was the measured capacity divided by mass of active material on an electrode. EIS (frequency ≈10−3–106\xa0Hz) and CV (scan rate 0.2–20\xa0mV s−1) were performed on a CHI660E electrochemistry workstation.

The slurry was coated on copper foil and vacuum dried at 100\xa0°C for 12 h to obtain TiO2 electrodes.\nThe realization of the epitaxial growth of heterostructure, interface energy‐band engineering, and N‐doping relied on the non‐equilibrium character of the plasma, as well as the proprietary design of the plasma reactor and the process. The as‐obtained TiO2 electrode was placed in a quartz reactor coupled with a rectangular microwave waveguide. After the reactor was evacuated, 10 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) of argon were flown in. The urea was heated to 120\xa0°C to make it sublime upstream of the TiO2 electrode. The power of the microwave source was turned up to 500 W to ignite the plasma, and then H2 (100 sccm) gas was introduced. The temperature in the reactor was about 500\xa0°C as measured by an infrared thermometer. The plasma process was maintained for 5 min, then the sample was cooled in Ar flow after turning off the plasma.\nThe crystallographic phases of the samples were investigated with XRD (Bruker D8 Advance A25) using Cu Ka radiation with a scan rate of 4° min−1. The structure and morphology of the nanomaterials were examined by TEM, HRTEM (TEM, JEOL JEM‐2100f). STEM‐HAADF was conducted on a Themis Z (FEI, Titan Z G3, 300\xa0kV). XPS was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi XPS.\nThe electrodes were assembled into CR2016 coin cells with the metal Na as the counter and reference electrode, glass fiber (Whatman GF/D, 19\xa0mm in diameter) as the separator, and NaClO4 1 m in a mix of ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (volume ratio of 1:1) with 5\xa0vol.% fluoroethylene carbonate as the electrolyte. The mass of the material loading on an electrode was obtained by weighing N electrodes, subtracting the mass of N pieces of current collectors, and then divided by N. The mass of active material on an electrode = the material loading on an electrode × 0.8. The specific capacity was the measured capacity divided by mass of active material on an electrode. EIS (frequency ≈10−3–106\xa0Hz) and CV (scan rate 0.2–20\xa0mV s−1) were performed on a CHI660E electrochemistry workstation. Charge‐discharge tests were carried out in a voltage range of 0.01 to 3\xa0V versus Na/Na+ with a LAND battery tester (Wuhan, China).\n\nMaterials Synthesis\nThe “many birds with one stone” synthesis of TiCxN1–x/N‐TiO2 heterostructure was completed by a one‐step urea plasma treatment within only 5 min.

The interlayer distances of all the samples calculated based on XRD results were listed in Table  for comparison. The MoS2 produced by the hydrothermal process showed a sharp (002) peak at 14.34° consistent with an average interlayer distance at 0.62\xa0nm calculated by the Bragg equation. There was no shift for the first peak of E‐MoS2‐1's pattern, indicating the addition of [BMIm]Ac alone could not expand the interlayers of MoS2. In addition, the extra sharp peaks at 32.13°, 35.01°, 48.51°, and 84.02° represented the existence of crystalline MoO3, while the extra sharp peaks of 64.13° and 75.51° suggested crystalline Mo2N, which were reaction products of [BMIm]Ac and MoS2. By comparing the results of Table\xa0, the interlayer distance of MoS2 apparently increased with increased mass ratio of MCC to [BMIm]Ac. Cellulose oligomers derived from the degradation of MCC during the calcination inserted into MoS2 interlayers leading to the expansion of MoS2 interlayers. With the addition of more MCC, and the oligomer concentration kept increasing which was attributed to the enhanced expansion of MoS2 interlayers. As a result, the first diffraction peak gradually shifted from 14.34° to 8.98° corresponding to the interlayers kept being expended from 0.62 to 1.01\xa0nm. No significant further shifting could be observed by increasing the mass ratio of MCC to MoS2 over 0.6 or changing the reaction temperature. In the XRD pattern of E‐MoS2‐9, all diffraction peaks became sharp and the peaks at 35.87°, 44.15°, 60.14°, and 72.79° reappeared suggesting a high crystallinity for MoS2, which was attributed to the highest reaction temperature. For imaging the morphology of MoS2, a high‐resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was used. The average interlayer distances of MoS2, E‐MoS2‐2, E‐MoS2‐3, E‐MoS2‐4, E‐MoS2‐5, and E‐MoS2‐6 were calculated to be 0.62, 0.66, 0.75, 0.84, 0.92, and 1.01\xa0nm, respectively, as displayed in Figure\xa0. By comparing the Table\xa0 and Figure\xa0, the results of calculated by HRTEM were highly consistent with those measured by XRD. Remarkably, controllable expansion of MoS2 interlayers could be achieved by controlling the mass ratio of MCC to [BMIm]Ac. It was also important to note that the HRTEM images demonstrated that MoS2 progressively tended to be disordered as the interlayer distance increased, which corresponded to a gradually widened XRD diffraction peaks.\nTo illustrate the mechanism of MoS2 interlayer expansion, a schematic illustration was shown in Figure . Since cellulose was initially dissolved in [BMIm]Ac, its intermolecular hydrogen bonds have been destroyed, which induced the MCC to break easily into oligomers. Then [BMIm]Ac with strong permeability penetrated into the MoS2 interlayers with the oligomers. The thermally stable imidazole rings of [BMIm]Ac then attracted the oligomers in the MoS2 interlayers for carbon recombination during the pyrolysis process. The more cellulose was added, the more oligomers were produced to insert the MoS2 interlayers, allowing for controllably expanding MoS2 interlayers. However, it became urgent to know the optimal interlayer distance of MoS2 for sodium storage. Herein, DFT was used to supply fundamental calculations for revealing an optimal range. The adsorption energy (Eads) for sodium ion, was calculated using Equation\xa0()1Eads=Eion+surface−Esurface−Eion\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{E_{{\\rm{ads}}}} = {E_{{\\rm{ion + surface}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{surface}}}} - {E_{{\\rm{ion}}}}}\\end{array}\\]where Esurface was the energy of the two‐layer MoS2, Eion represented the energy of Na+, and Eion+surface represented the adsorbed system total energy. The intrinsic MoS2 (0.62\xa0nm) to Na+ adsorption energy was −1.15\xa0eV, showing a weak adsorption capacity (Figure\xa0). As the interlayer distance grew, the adsorption energy steadily rose as well. The adsorption reached the strongest following to decrease when the layer spacing expanded to 0.8\xa0nm (−2.66\xa0eV), and Na+ was in the middle of the upper and lower layer of MoS2. Na+ adsorbed on the lower MoS2 layer surface at 1.01\xa0nm distance, and the adsorption energy tended to be constant. According to the reported literature, the sodiation of MoS2 could be attributed to intercalation Equation\xa0() and conversion Equation\xa0()[]2MoS2+xNa++xe−↔NaxMoS2\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{\\rm{Mo}}{{\\rm{S}}_2} + x{\\rm{N}}{{\\rm{a}}^ + } + x{{\\rm{e}}^ - } \\leftrightarrow {\\rm{N}}{{\\rm{a}}_x}{\\rm{Mo}}{{\\rm{S}}_2}}\\end{array}\\]3NaxMoS2+(4−x)Na++4e−↔Mo+2Na2S\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{{\\rm{N}}{{\\rm{a}}_x}{\\rm{Mo}}{{\\rm{S}}_2} + \\left( {4 - x} \\right){\\rm{N}}{{\\rm{a}}^ + } + 4{{\\rm{e}}^ - } \\leftrightarrow {\\rm{Mo}} + 2{\\rm{N}}{{\\rm{a}}_2}{\\rm{S}}}\\end{array}\\]\nThe stronger adsorption energy the sodium ions for the intercalation, the more favorable the sodium ions adsorbed on the MoS2 interlayers for the conversion reaction. An optimal range of MoS2 interlayer distance for sodium storage was calculated to be between 0.80 and 1.01\xa0nm. However, the formation of NaxMoS2 was irreversible at the first intercalation process.[] It would be anticipated that an average distance at 1.01\xa0nm for MoS2 would provide a higher capability of reversible sodium storage.\nThe E‐MoS2‐9 as SIBs anode showed superior specific capacity, but it was unsatisfactory for cycling stability (Figure , Supporting Information). PC was used to load the interlayer‐expanded MoS2 for improving structural stability and the process was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) in Figure  and HRTEM in Figure\xa0, respectively. It was unambiguous that the MoS2 nanoparticles synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction showed uniform morphology, appearing as separated nanosheets with a diameter range of 90–110\xa0nm (Figure\xa0). The FESEM image in Figure\xa0 revealed a characteristic porous structure of PC. But the porous structure of PC@MoS2‐1 was almost undetectable, demonstrating that the pores of PC were filled by MoS2 as seen in Figure\xa0. After reacting with [BMIm]Ac and MCC, the MoS2 and the pores of PC could not be seen on the surface of PC@MoS2‐4 as demonstrated in Figure\xa0 where the MoS2 was coated by the carbon derived from [BMIm]Ac and MCC, leading to considerable reduction in surface area, which favored the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.[] The lattice morphology of MoS2 prior to the modification by [BMIm]Ac and MCC can be seen through the HRTEM images of Figure\xa0. The HRTEM image of Figure\xa0 also supported that the PC was porous before loading the MoS2. Figure\xa0 showed that the MoS2 with an average interlayer distance at 0.62\xa0nm has been successfully synthesized on PC by the hydrothermal reaction. After the modification by [BMIm]Ac and MCC, the MoS2 showed obvious expanded interlayers by cellulose oligomers intercalating the interlayers, as shown in Figure\xa0. Meanwhile, MCC was induced by [BMIm]Ac to form a coating layer, preventing the MoS2 from contacting with electrolytes. Instead of a sharp (002) peak, PC@MoS2‐4 showed broader diffraction peaks at 8.98°, corresponding to the expansion of the MoS2 interlayer distance to 1.01\xa0nm in Figure  (Supporting Information). PC@MoS2‐6, PC@MoS2‐3, and PC@MoS2‐5 showed the same interlayer distance with PC@MoS2‐4 in Figure  (Supporting Information), demonstrating the reliability of the approach to modify MoS2 by oligomer intercalation. In Figure  (Supporting Information), there was a significant decrease in the frequency gap (the E12g and A1g mode, ∆k) for PC@MoS2‐4 to MoS2, indicating reduction in the number of stacking layers for MoS2.[] ID/IG value indicated the ordering proportion of the carbon material and higher values implied more defects and a lower degree of graphitization of the carbon. In Figure  (Supporting Information), PC@MoS2‐4, PC@MoS2‐6, PC@MoS2‐3, and PC@MoS2‐5 had ID/IG values of 1.62, 1.67, 1.60, and 1.64, respectively, demonstrating the addition of [BMIm]Ac leading to more ordered carbon structure. Energy‐dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) element distribution of PC@MoS2‐4 showed C, Mo, S, N, O, and N were homogeneously distributed in the composite. It could be ascribed to the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) added during the hydrothermal process enabled MoS2 to form uniformly over the solid matrix.[]\nTo further illustrate the MoS2‐loaded carbon composite, Figure\xa0 demonstrated the synthesis process of PC@MoS2‐4. First, the synthesized MoS2 grew uniformly on the surface of the PC and filled in the pores to form the PC@MoS2‐1. Then, the PC@MoS2‐1 was calcinated after being mixed with [BMIm]Ac and MCC. In this process, the cellulose was decomposed into oligomers and inserted into the MoS2 interlayers. At the same time, MCC was induced by [BMIm]Ac to form a carbon layer coating the interlayer‐expanded MoS2. PC@MoS2‐4 was then produced with its surface covered by the carbon derived from [BMIm]Ac and MCC. N2 absorption–desorption isothermal curve characterized the change of surface area and the state of pores. In Figure\xa0, PC@MoS2‐4, PC@MoS2\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, Mo6+ ions, which surrounded by the surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), react with thioacetamide (TAA) to form MoS2@PVP network precursor in the facile hydrothermal progress. The PVP effectively prevents the aggregation of MoS2 and serves as carbon source precursor. After annealing in the N2, PVP transforms into the carbon network framework with S and N doping, in which the few‐layered MoS2 are embed. The S and N doping promise the high conductivity of the carbon network, providing a fast electron transport highway.\nThe morphologies of the as‐built MoS2@NSC hybrids were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The MoS2@NSC composites show connective nanoparticles with the size of 20–30\xa0nm (Figure\xa0). In contrast, the commercial MoS2 presents stacked chunk in the range of 3–5\xa0µm (Figure , Supporting Information). Figure\xa0 further confirms the interconnected networks of MoS2@NSC. The single primary MoS2@NSC nanoparticle is constructed by numerous lamellar MoS2 and NSC substrate. The MoS2 is embedded in the NSC network, which promises the electron fast transport. The high‐resolution TEM (HRTEM) image illustrates that the MoS2 is mainly one to three layers (Figure\xa0) with expanded interlayer spacing such as 0.76 and 0.85\xa0nm, which is larger than theoretical value of MoS2 (0.62\xa0nm) (Figure\xa0). The enlarged interlayer spacing can be ascribed to the introduction the surfactant PVP, which prevents the aggregation between adjacent layers during the growth of MoS2 crystals. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern displaying a series of diffuse rings combined with its radius indicates that the as‐prepared MoS2 is polycrystalline (Figure\xa0). In addition, the energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectrometer elemental mapping reveals that the MoS2 and heteroatom nitrogen are uniformly distributed into the MoS2@NSC network (Figure\xa0).\n\nPhase Composition and Surface Chemical State Analysis of MoS2@NSC Composites\nThe crystal structure of as‐made MoS2@NSC composites was further examined by X‐ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD pattern shows that all diffraction peaks can be perfectly matched with the 2H phase MoS2 (pair distribution function# 75‐1539), showing the successful synthesis of MoS2 (Figure ). Moreover, it is worth noting that the very weaker (002) characteristic peak of MoS2@NSC nanonetwork than MoS2 bulk (Figure , Supporting Information) indicates that it has a few‐layered structure features,[] which echoes the TEM test results (Figure\xa0). The surface chemical components and elemental valence stats of the MoS2@NSC network and commercial MoS2 bulk are identified via X‐ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis (Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information). Their characteristic diffraction peaks appear at the same locations and in similar shapes as shown in the survey XPS spectra (Figure , Supporting Information). For the MoS2@NSC nanocomposites, the pair of strong peaks at 229.4 and 232.5\xa0eV are attributed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of tetravalent molybdenum in MoS2, respectively (Figure\xa0).[] Furthermore, the two remaining peaks at 226.6 and 235.6\xa0eV can boil down to S 2s and hexavalent molybdenum, respectively, which is the same as the commercial MoS2 peak position (Figure , Supporting Information).[] For S 2p spectrum (Figure\xa0), the two distinct peaks located at 162.2 and 163.4\xa0eV can be assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of negative divalent sulfur in MoS2,[] respectively, which is also consistent with commercial MoS2 (Figure , Supporting Information). Moreover, there also have two additional weak peaks at 164.5 and 161.2\xa0eV related to S\uf8ffC bonds compared with commercial MoS2 (Figure , Supporting Information), indicating that some sulfur is doped into the carbon matrix.[] For the C 1s spectrum (Figure\xa0), the peaks at 284.6, 285.2, 286, 287, and 288.7\xa0eV can be ascribed to C\uf8ffC/C\uf8feC, C\uf8ffS/C\uf8ffS\uf8ffMo, C\uf8ffN, C\uf8feO, and O\uf8ffC\uf8feO, respectively.[] The presence of C\uf8ffN and C\uf8ffS bonds indicates that heteroatom nitrogen and sulfur are also doped into the carbon matrix.[] The N species doped on carbon can be further subdivided into pyridinic N at 398.8\xa0eV and quaternary N at 401.4\xa0eV through the N 1s fine spectrum (Figure\xa0).[] Additionally, the high peak at 395.3\xa0eV is categorized as Mo 3p. The sp2 hybridized pyridinic N and graphitic N boost conductivity of the carbon network.[] The diffraction peaks at 531.6 and 533.8\xa0eV can be classified into C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO respectively, which is the result of a few amount of adsorbed oxygen on the sample surface (Figure\xa0).\nThe weight content of carbon in the MoS2@NSC composites was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The MoS2@NSC network undergoes two transformation processes of carbon to CO2 and MoS2 to MoO3 under air atmosphere.[] The weight losses of the MoS2@NSC composites is 35.2%, and the carbon content is calculated to be 27.9\xa0wt% (Figure , Supporting Information). The specific surface area and pore structure of the as‐built MoS2@NSC composites were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption technique. The MoS2@NSC network exhibits a type IV isotherm curve, indicating its own mesoporous structure. In addition, a large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area of 64.3\xa0m2\xa0g−1 is also exhibited, which means that the electrode and the electrolyte have sufficient active contact area (Figure , Supporting Information). Moreover, the pore diameters are mainly distributed at 23.2\xa0nm belonging to mesoporous, which facilitates the transport of Na+ (Figure , Supporting Information).\n\nComparison of Sodium Storage Behavior of MoS2@NSC in Ether‐Based and Ester‐Based Electrolyte\nThe electrochemical properties of the as‐built MoS2@NSC complex in ether‐based and ester‐based electrolyte are investigated as shown in the Figure . The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements are tested to reveal the different of electrochemical mechanism of the MoS2@NSC networks in the different electrolyte at 0.5\xa0mV\xa0s−1 (Figure\xa0). Figure\xa0 shows the CV curves of MoS2@NSC in initial four cycles with the ether‐based electrolyte. During the first cathodic scanning process, the irreversible cathodic peak at around 0.2\xa0V can be ascribe the formation of SEI film derived from decomposition of electrolyte. The following CV curves tend to overlap well, suggesting good electrochemical reversibility. The cathodic peaks at 1.6, 0.76, and 0.34\xa0V can be boil down to Na+ insertion into 2H‐MoS2, 2H‐NaxMoS2 transformation into 1T‐NaxMoS2 and decomposition of 1T‐NaxMoS2 into Mo and Na2S, respectively.[] Correspondingly, three oxidation peaks at 0.37, 0.88, and 1.8\xa0V in the anodic reaction process correspond to generation from Mo and Na2S to 1T‐NaxMoS2, phase change from 1T‐NaxMoS2 to 2H‐NaxMoS2, and further conversion from 2H‐NaxMoS2 to 2H‐MoS2.[] In addition, the cathodic peak at 0.03\xa0V and the anodic peak at 0.07\xa0V correspond to the insertion and deinsertion of solvated Na+ in NSC, respectively.[] In contrast, MoS2@NSC displays different CV curve shapes (Figure\xa0) in the ester‐based electrolyte. In the original cathodic process, the three peaks at 1.89, 0.83, 0.29, and near 0.01\xa0V, which can be ascribed to the insertion of Na+ into the 2H‐MoS2, the further conversion of NaxMoS2 from 2H phase to 1T phase, the SEI film formation, and the further conversion of 1T‐NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S, respectively.[] During the initial anodic process, the oxidation peak at 0.9 and 1.84\xa0V can be ascribed to the oxidation of the Mo and Na2S to 1T‐NaxMoS2 and MoS2, respectively.[] Highly coincident CV curves in the following cycles imply the outstanding reversibility of Na+ (de)sodiation in the MoS2@NSC electrode.\nFigure\xa0 shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles of MoS2\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, the ZIF‐67 particle with dodecahedral structure is synthesized as a sacrificial template.[] Following that, the sulfur source was added, and the homogeneous mixture was then transferred into an autoclave. The product was rinsed several times by water and ethanol. The NiCo2S4 was finally collected after drying in vacuum oven.\nThe typical X‐ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as‐synthesized NiCo2S4 matches well with the pattern of standard NiCo2S4 (JCPDS NO. 20–0782) (Figure ). Several main diffraction peaks located at 16.34°, 26.83°, 31.58°, 38.31°, 47.41°, 50.46°, and 55.33° are well indexed to (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes, respectively. No other residual or impure phases were detected in the XRD patterns, indicating the high purity of the prepared NiCo2S4 sample. The crystal structure of spinel‐structured NiCo2S4 with Fd3m space group was also indicated in the inset of Figure\xa0. The Raman vibration peaks located at 181 cm−1, 462 cm−1, 509 cm−1, and 653 cm−1 corresponding to the F2g, E2g, F2g, and A1g modes of the NiCo2S4 (Figure , Supporting Information), which is consistent with the previous work.[] In addition, as shown in the field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure\xa0; Figure , Supporting Information), the as‐prepared NiCo2S4 nanocages have a uniform shape of dodecahedron with an average particle size of about 400–600\xa0nm. According to the high‐resolution TEM image of NiCo2S4 (Figure\xa0), the interatomic distances of a selected area were determined to be 0.53 and 0.28\xa0nm, standing for the interplanar distances of the (111) and (311) planes of the spinel NiCo2S4 structure, respectively. The oxidation state and atomic environment have been studied through X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure , Supporting Information. The survey spectrum evidenced the uniform distribution of Ni, Co, and S throughout the NiCo2S4 sample (Figure , Supporting Information), which is consistent with the energy dispersive spectrometry results in Figure\xa0. In the high‐resolution Ni 2p spectrum, the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 can be deconvoluted into two peaks. Specifically, the peaks centered at 853.5 and 875.3\xa0eV can be ascribed to Ni2+, while the peaks located at 856.7\xa0eV and 880.6\xa0eV can be attributed to Ni3+, respectively. Two shake‐up satellite peaks indicate that the majority of Ni element in the final product is Ni2+ cations, which is in good agreement with that of NiCo2S4.[] For the Co 2p spectrum (Figure , Supporting Information), it shows two distinct doublets located at a low energy band (around 784.0\xa0eV, Co 2p3/2) and a high energy band (around 800.0\xa0eV, Co 2p1/2), respectively. The difference of binding energy between the two doublets is over 15.0\xa0eV, suggesting the co‐existence of Co2+ and Co3+. Figure , Supporting Information, depicts the spectrum of S 2p region, where the binding energy located at 161.6\xa0eV and 162.7\xa0eV are corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.\nThe electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 was investigated in two different electrolytes: a) 1.0\xa0m sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (1.0\xa0m NaClO4‐EC/DEC + 5% FEC), and b) 1.0\xa0m sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3) in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐DEGDME), where Na foils are used as the counter electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of NiCo2S4 in different electrolytes were initially examined at a scan rate of 0.2\xa0mV s−1 from 0.01 to 3.0\xa0V versus Na+/Na (Figure , Supporting Information). In the electrolyte of 1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐DEGDME, two peaks located at 0.95 and 0.69\xa0V can be observed in the first scan and ascribed to the formation of the SEI layers and sodiation process. In the second cathodic scan, there are several peaks detected in the range between 1.0 and 0.5\xa0V, corresponding to the formation of different discharge products (i.e., Ni, Co, and Na2S),[] while prominent oxidation peaks at around 1.75\xa0V can be assigned to the formation of metal sulfides. The NiCo2S4 sample in ester‐based electrolyte presents CV behavior with similar shapes to those in ether‐based electrolyte, but with different voltage values and inferior reversibility during the scans. Galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of NiCo2S4 in the selected cycles at a current rate of 50\xa0mA g–1 were presented in Figure . In the ether‐based electrolyte (Figure\xa0), NiCo2S4 delivers a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 83.7%, and the voltage profiles are almost overlapped in the following cycles, indicating a superior cycling stability. In contrast, a much lower initial Coulombic efficiency of 54.1% is observed when use the ester‐based electrolyte (Figure\xa0), implying more severe parasitic reactions occur for NiCo2S4 in ester‐based electrolyte. The rate capability of NiCo2S4 was further evaluated to further show the performance difference in those two kinds of electrolytes (Figure , Supporting Information). With ether‐based electrolyte, the NiCo2S4 anode showed the best rate performance with 619.8, 575.5, 535.1, 507.1, 494.8, and 492.1\xa0mA h g−1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 800, and 1000\xa0mA g−1, respectively. The reversible capacities of NiCo2S4 were about 4 times higher than that in ester‐based electrolyte at corresponding current densities. In addition, to further prove the functionality of the selected 1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐DEGDME electrolyte, another ester electrolyte was selected (1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐EC/DEC + 5% FEC, Figure , Supporting Information). In the 1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐EC/DEC + 5% FEC electrolyte, the NiCo2S4 demonstrates inferior capacities and rate performance when compared with that in the electrolyte of 1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐DEGDME electrolyte. Obviously, the excellent electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 electrodes gained in SIBs is dominantly influenced by the ether‐based electrolyte. The reaction kinetics of Na+ storage in NiCo2S4 electrode in two electrolytes was further investigated. Figure , Supporting Information, shows the CV curves collected at different scan rates. Obviously, the NiCo2S4 electrode in ether‐based electrolyte exhibits smaller polarization compared with that in ester‐based electrolyte. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was used to study the interfacial properties and internal resistances of NiCo2S4 electrode in both ester and ether‐based electrolytes (Figure , Supporting Information). At the open circuit voltage, charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the NiCo2S4 electrode in ether‐based electrolyte (about 14.5 Ω, Table , Supporting Information) is much lower than that in the ester‐based electrolyte (about 595.0 Ω, Table , Supporting Information). However, the overall resistance on NiCo2S4 electrodes in ester‐based electrolyte continuously increased during cycling, while the EIS curves for NiCo2S4 electrodes in ether‐based electrolyte almost overlapped for each cycle, demonstrating the excellent transfer kinetics in the ether‐based electrolyte.\nIn order to further understand the electrochemical reaction processes in different electrolytes, the NiCo2S4 electrodes after 50 continuous cycles were examined by Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Specifically, the electrode cycled in ether‐based electrolyte showed typical FTIR peaks of the binder and the separator, while the electrode cycled in ester‐based electrolyte showed additional peaks, which were probably attributed to the SEI film components including Na2CO3 (886.8\xa0cm−1), ROCO2Na (1071.4\xa0cm−1), (CH2OCO2Na)2 (at 1482 and 1071\xa0cm−1), and EC solvent (≈1770\xa0cm−1), etc.[] This result reveals that the ester solvent suffers from a more severe decomposition than the ether solvent. In order to further understand the chemical property and depth profile of the SEI layer formed in 1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐DEGDME electrolyte, XPS analysis was conducted and shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure , Supporting Information. In the C 1s spectra, the peaks at 286.2\xa0eV (C\uf8ffO\uf8ffC bonds) and 288.6\xa0eV (C\uf8feO bonds) are assigned to polyether with the ether‐based electrolyte. No peaks can be indexed to the O\uf8feC\uf8ffO bond, indicating the absence of byproducts formed in ester‐based solvent such as Na2CO3 and ROCO2Na. The peaks at 531.7\xa0eV (C\uf8feO) and 532.9\xa0eV (C\uf8ffO) in the O 1s spectra further prove the existence of organic species derived from the solvent decomposition. The fitting results of F 1s feature consist of two peaks at 684.5 (Na\uf8ffF) and 688.7\xa0eV (\uf8ffCF2\uf8ff), representing the formation of inorganic/organic fluoride compounds.[] The SEI layer with such inorganic compounds should be robust enough to prevent the continuous decomposition of electrolyte, and thus, forming a thin SEI layer in the ether‐based electrolyte. Moreover, the contact angle test (Figure , Supporting Information) shows that the interface formed in ether‐based electrolyte has a much smaller contact angle (4.6°) than that in ester‐based electrolyte (14.0°). It implies that the interface formed in ether‐based electrolyte has a superior wettability, which can facilitate the charge transfer kinetics on the interface, and therefore improve the electrochemical performance.[] The thickness of the formed SEI layer was further confirmed by SEM images. As shown in Figure , Supporting Information, the cross‐section SEM image clearly displays the electrode layer with a thickness of 4.0\xa0µm prior to cycling. When cycling in ester‐based electrolyte, the thickness of the electrode gradually changes from 8.0\xa0µm (the 1st cycle) to 12.0\xa0µm (the 30th cycle). In contrast, when cycling in ether‐based electrolyte at a similar current density, the electrode thickness only changes from 6.0\xa0µm (the 1st cycle) to 9.0\xa0µm (the 30th cycle). In the ether‐based electrolyte, a thinner electrode layer was achieved due to the unique inorganic/organic SEI layer, and consequently suppress side reactions at the interface. These results agree well with the aforementioned FTIR and XPS observations. Therefore, the ether‐based electrolyte could not only provide effective charge transfer pathways, but also suppress the interfacial side reactions.[]\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were subsequently employed to explore the working mechanism of the electrolyte. It was reported that the solvated structures with a lower LUMO energy would be preferentially reduced, indicating worse electrochemical stability of this electrolyte.[] Figure  indicates that the LUMO energy of DEGDME (−0.58\xa0eV) is much higher than those of EC (−0.74\xa0eV) and DEC (−0.62\xa0eV), indicating a much higher anti‐reduction ability of DEGDME.[] Furthermore, when specific sodium salts are interacted with the solvent molecules, the LUMO energies are obviously tuned to be decreased in both electrolytes. However, the ether‐based electrolyte still has much higher stability than that in ester electrolyte systems, suggesting that the appropriate solvent should be coupled with a suitable sodium salt with a higher LUMO energy to achieve optimal stability against the reductive decomposition of the electrolyte and formation of the SEI during the electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, during repeated charge and discharge processes, the potential at the electrode–electrolyte interface should also be changed significantly. In this context, the oxidation of the electrolyte should also be considered. Figure\xa0 also showed that the HOMO energy of DEGDME:NaCF3SO3 decreases obviously, while that of EC:DEC:NaClO4 increases significantly. The opposite behavior not only leads to a much smaller HOMO‐LUMO gap for EC:DEC:NaClO4 but also reduces its stability against electrochemical oxidation at the interfaces. Therefore, it can be expected that the successive decomposition of ether‐based electrolyte (NaCF3SO3‐DEGDME) should be slight and this will finally result in thinner SEI layers on the electrode surface, which is beneficial to the electrochemical performance.\nDespite the much larger HOMO‐LUMO gap of DEGDME:NaCF3SO3 that can help prohibit the electron transfer through the electrolyte, the diffusion dynamics of Na+ in different electrolytes also affect the impedance of the batteries significantly and therefore their electrochemical performances. To evaluate this effect, we also performed additional calculations using the molecular dynamics method to calculate the molecular motions in those two electrolytes (Figure\xa0). Figure\xa0 showed that the mean square displacement (MSD) of Na+ in DEGDME electrolyte is much larger than that in EC: DEC electrolyte. According to the relationship between the MSD and evolution time, it can be calculated that the diffusion coefficients of Na+ in DEGDME and EC:DEC electrolytes are 7.768\xa0×\xa010−6 and 4.483\xa0×\xa010−7 cm2 s−1, implying that the diffusion kinetics of Na+ in DEGDME is much faster than in EC:DEC electrolyte. Obviously, all the calculation results indicate that the ether‐electrolyte can form a better solvation structure, which is more suitable for the NiCo2S4 in SIBs.\nIt can be concluded that when using the ether‐based electrolyte (1.0\xa0m NaCF3SO3‐DEGDME), the NiCo2S4 electrode exhibits high initial coulomb efficiency, excellent cycling stability, reduced electrochemical polarization, and rapid sodium ion migration. Figure\xa0 schematically illustrates the potential mechanism during the Na plating/stripping process. When plating, the Na+ ion flux in the liquid electrolyte moves toward the substrate under the electric field, electrolyte decomposition may continuously occur, leading to the reformation of the SEI film. This may further result in battery failure once the electrolyte is exhausted.[]\nIt should be noted that the cutting‐off voltage also plays a key role in achieving good cyclability. Although ether‐based electrolyte has been applied, the capacity of NiCo2S4 electrode seriously fades from 600 to less than 100\xa0mA h g−1 within 40 cycles at 50\xa0mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0.1–3.0\xa0V (Figures ,\xa0, Supporting Information). This can be attributed to the huge volume change caused by the conversion‐type reaction. However, the electrochemical performance has been significantly enhanced by tuning the cut‐off voltage to 0.4\xa0V (Figure ). Even after 50 continuous cycles, the CV curve of the NiCo2S4 electrode demonstrates obvious redox peaks in the voltage window of 0.4–3.0\xa0V (Figure , Supporting Information). Although the specific capacity of NiCo2S4 electrode has dropped about 100\xa0mA h g−1 in the working window of 0.4–3.0\xa0V when compared with that in 0.01–3.0\xa0V, the cycling stability has been dramatically increased with a high ICE value of 96.2% (Figure\xa0). Even after 200 cycles at a current density of 50\xa0mA g−1, the NiCo2S4 electrode can deliver a reversible capacity of 380.4\xa0mA h g−1 (Figure\xa0). Compared with that in the working window of 0.01–3.0\xa0V, the capacity output and rate performance can be further improved. As shown in Figure\xa0, the capacities of the NiCo2S4 electrode in SIBs at various current densities, ranging from 100 to 5000\xa0mA g−1 are 429.5, 389.4, 362.2, 343.3, 310.4, and 215.4\xa0mA h g−1. With the optimization of electrolyte and working window, the NiCo2S4 electrode exhibits superior rate performance when compared with the reported sulfide anodes for SIBs (Figure\xa0).[] To further assess the cycling durability at higher current density, the NiCo2S4 electrode was subjected to long‐term cycling, as shown in Figure\xa0. After a short activation process at 100\xa0mA g−1, 341.7\xa0mA h g−1 could be retained after continuous 250 cycles at 200\xa0mA g−1, accompanied by ≈100% Coulombic efficiency, which implying that the NiCo2S4 electrode contains comparable or higher electrochemical properties than many other cobalt/nickel sulfide‐based anode materials in SIBs (Table , Supporting Information). Furthermore, the EIS result (Figure , Supporting Information) obtained under different cycle state in the working window of 0.4–3.0\xa0V confirmed that the NiCo2S4 electrode displays a smaller charge transfer resistance (27.6 Ω), which indicates the superior ionic transfer kinetics, when compared with that in the working window of 0.01–3.0\xa0V.\nThe remarkable sodium storage behavior of the NiCo2S4 electrode in the 0.4–3.0\xa0V voltage window can be further understood by kinetic behavior analysis. The CV profiles recorded at various scan rates (from 0.2 to 5.0\xa0mV s−1) is shown in Figure , Supporting Information. With the increase of the scan rate, the CV curves display a similar shape with 4 dominant redox peaks, indicating the high reversibility of the NiCo2S4 electrode. As revealed in Figure , Supporting Information, the slopes of intensities (denoted as the b‐value) of the cathodic peaks in NiCo2S4 electrode for SIBs were calculated to be around 0.62 for peak 1 and 0.97 for peak 2, while the anodic peak were calculated to be 0.81 for peak 2 and 0.71 for peak 4 (calculation method in experiment detail), making it manifest that the current originates from a pseudocapacitive dominated mechanism.[] The quantitatively separated contributions of the capacitive part increased from 53.82% at 0.2\xa0mV s−1 (Figure ) to the maximum value of 84.84% at 5.0\xa0mV s−1 in SIBs.\nTo determine the phase transformation mechanism of the NiCo2S4 electrode during initial sodiation and desodiation, in situ XRD and DFT calculations were obtained. Here, the DFT calculation was used to predict the possible intermediates during the charging/discharging process. Table , Supporting Information, listed the most possible reaction product, which is mainly based on previous literature reports. The computational models were shown in Figure\xa0, while the average voltages were calculated according to Equations (1‐2), Supporting Information, and the total energies of different materials calculated via VASP are summarized in Tables ,\xa0, Supporting Information. The theoretical results show that the energy required for the insertion of 0.5 Na+ into the interstitial sites of the NiCo2S4 lattice is 0.074\xa0eV per formula unit (PFU), while the decomposition of NaxNiCo2S4 into Ni, Co, and Na2S is highly exothermal with reaction energy of about −9.444\xa0eV/PFU, corresponding to an average discharge plateau at 1.18\xa0V. This result is consistent with the observed redox peaks in CV and discharge platform in charge/discharge curve and indicates that the conversion mechanism is dominant over the insertion mechanism. After the initial discharge process, Ni, Co, and Na2S can be converted into different products, making the overall reactions reversible. Our calculation further suggested that one of the discharge product Co can be converted into CoS and CoS2 at very close voltage plateaus at 1.27 and 1.28\xa0V, while Ni is converted into NiS at 1.22 and into NiS2 at 1.38\xa0V, respectively. The two distinguished potentials can explain the possible existence of intermediate formation (NiS2). As shown in Figure\xa0, the peak that indexed to the (311) crystal face of NiCo2S4 was gradually disappeared at the end of the discharge process, while the peaks located at the range 38.8–39.1°, 46.5–50.0°, and 58.5–59.08° related to the conversion of Na2S, Co, and accompanied by some metal sulfides (Ni3S4/Co3S4). This result is consistent with the HRTEM observation (Figure , Supporting Information), which further indicates that the incomplete conversion reaction existed during the first discharge process. During the first charge process, Ni, Co, and Na2S can be converted into intermediate products. According to the in situ XRD pattern and HRTEM observation, the NiS2, CoS, and NiS are the main product in the charge process.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

On the natrophilic substrate, sodium will have a high nucleation rate and like to give a uniform sodium layer upon plating (Figure\xa0). On the contrary, the lower nucleation rate on the sodium repellent substrate will result in uneven sodium plating and islands (Figure\xa0). Upon application of a voltage, the uniform sodium layer and the sodium islands would lead respectively to a uniform and an uneven electric field distribution (right hand column of Figure\xa0, as determined with the COMSOL Mutiphysics simulation). The uneven electric field on the sodium repellent substrate would cause preferential sodium disposition on the islands, which eventually bring about dendrite formation and thus is highly unfavorable for battery applications.[]\nIn consideration of these key factors, 3D natrophilic Ag@C substrate was fabricated via a facile thermal evaporation deposition method as visualized in Figure . Morphology and microstructure of the pristine carbon cloth and its silver coated layer were studied with SEM. As shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure S1a, Supporting Information 3D carbon cloth is woven with smooth carbon nanofibers, which provides open channels for Na ions and electrons accessibility. After silver deposition, the carbon cloth is decorated with a high density of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with uniform distribution (Figure\xa0; Figure S1b, Supporting Information). EDX mapping of the pristine carbon cloth and silver coated carbon cloth are shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure S1c, Supporting Information respectively. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) peaks from face‐centered cubic silver can be clearly observed on the silver‐coated sample (Figure\xa0). This natrophilic 3D Ag@C substrate is largely expected to smooth Na ion plating/stripping, improve redox kinetics, and electrode chemistry.[]\n\nElectrochemical Analysis of the Na Ion Deposition\nFigure  and Figure S2, Supporting Information summarize the deposition voltages profiles and galvanostatic cycling lives of the Na||Ag@C, Na||C half‐cells with 1 m NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC) containing 5\xa0wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). It is reasonably concluded that the large part of capacity is delivered by Na plating/stripping rather than other intercalation reaction in the Ag@C and carbon cloth matrix (Figure S2a–d, Supporting Information).[] Upon cycling, the almost overlapping voltages curves (Figure\xa0) indicate stable Na ion plating/stripping for the first three cycles. Notably, only a slight increase of voltage hysteresis appears for Na ion deposition at the current densities ranging from 1 to 3\xa0mA cm−2 with a capacity of 2 mAh cm−2. Long‐term cycling measurements of these cells were then undertaken to assess the capability and stability retention. As shown in Figure\xa0, these cells demonstrate excellent Na ion plating/stripping stability at 1, 2, and 3\xa0mA cm−2 after 100\xa0cycles, respectively. Additionally, an extended 500 deep cycling profiles is presented in Figure\xa0, which exhibit no obvious potential shifts and more promising Na ion deposition kinetics among various strategies (Table S1, Supporting Information). In stark comparison, as shown in Figure\xa0S3a–d, Supporting Information, pristine carbon cloth substrate shows much poorer Na ion plating/stripping stability. For one thing, lager voltage hysteresis occurred for Na ion deposition at the current densities ranging from 1 to 2\xa0mA cm−2 (Figure S3a, Supporting Information). As the current density increased to 3\xa0mA cm−2, it is reasonable to conclude that cells become unworkable (Figure S3a, Supporting Information). Figure\xa0S3b–d, Supporting Information also shows severe potentials fluctuations at 1, 2, and 3\xa0mA cm−2 over 80 cycles. All these analyses confirm that the AgNPs decoration on the carbon cloth is beneficial for stable Na ion plating/stripping.\nIn support of above statement, we then investigated the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and CE of Na ion plating/stripping. Figure  shows EIS curves of the Ag@C substrate at 1, 2, and 3\xa0mA cm−2 (2 mAh cm−2) after 1, 10, 50, and 100 cycles. It is obvious that there exits only a limited change in the EIS profiles for these cells. RSEI and Rct of the equivalent circuit were determined by fitting the corresponding EIS curves and listed in Table S2, Supporting Information. The most important observation is that after the AgNPs deposition, both RSEI and Rct are much smaller and much more stable upon cycling. These suggest that cells with the Ag@C substrate own better interface stability and charge transfer dynamics. By contrast, cells with pristine carbon cloth substrate demonstrate inferior stability (Figure S4–c and Table S2, Supporting Information).\nCE is another quantifiable indicator accounting for the reversible Na ion deposition process. Intriguingly, the Na||Ag@C cell shows a gradual increase of CEs from ≈96% to ≈99% in just five cycles (Figure\xa0), which may be tentatively ascribed to the building of complete SEI. Upon subsequent cycles, Na||Ag@C cell preserves high CE at 1, 3\xa0mA cm−2 over 100 cycles and 2\xa0mA cm−2 over 500 cycles (Figure\xa0), again attesting to the remarkable stability of the Na deposition on the Ag@C substrate in ester‐based electrolyte. On the contrary, cells with pristine carbon cloth show severe erratic fluctuations of CE (Figure S4d–f, Supporting Information), which can be attributed to the low‐quality SEI and sodium dendrite growth upon cycling.[]\n\nSodium‐Ion Plating/Stripping Mechanism Analyses\nFor clarifying the stability of Na plating/stripping with Ag@C substrate, it is instructive to explore Na deposition kinetics. We initially study affinity between Na atoms and Ag@C substrate via DFT simulation. Specifically, as shown in Figure S5a,b, Supporting Information, (100), (110), and (111) crystallographic surface of Ag (grey color) and Na (golden color) metal were first constructed. Optimized binding energies of a Na ad‐atom (green color) on (111), (110), and (100) surfaces of Ag are −1.68, −1.72, and −1.53\xa0eV respectively, while corresponding values on Na surfaces are only −0.62, −0.68, and −0.81\xa0eV (Figure S5c, Supporting Information). These clearly show that Na atoms prefer to bind with Ag particles and the Ag@C substrate can thus provide natrophilic surfaces to enable uniform and stable sodium plating. On account of above modeling results, a matching Ag/Na interface is established to further illustrate Na ion plating dynamics via AIMD calculation. Figure  shows the four snapshots (0, 5, 10, and 20\xa0ps) with 216 Ag and 64 Na atoms. Upon heating at 400 K, it is evident that the Na atoms progressively diffuse into the silver surface, forming a Na–Ag network at the surface of silver. After 20\xa0ps, it is found that almost all Na ions were inclined to spread upon the surface of silver (Figure\xa0) without forming any Na–Ag alloy since all the typical diffraction peaks belong to cubic silver and cubic sodium metal (Figure S6, Supporting Information), thus greatly benefiting Na ion redox kinetics and eliminating morphological instability. In parallel, DFT calculations (Figure S7, Supporting Information) show that the bind energy of a Na atom on a C (001) surface is only −0.52\xa0eV, which is considerably smaller than the Na–Na binding energies (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, AIMD results (Figure S8, Supporting Information) indicate that Na atoms tend to move away from the carbon surface, rather than creating a mixed Na–C layer.\nWith the above understanding, we investigate morphological evolution of the Ag@C and pristine carbon cloth substrates upon extended Na plating/stripping cycling. As shown in Figure\xa0, after 100 cycles at 1, 2, and 3\xa0mA cm−2 with a capacity of 2 mAh cm−2, the Ag@C substrates depict similar smooth morphologies with no apparent agglomeration of large sodium particles. Elemental Na, C, Ag, Na, O, and F mapping images of cycled Ag@C anode at 2\xa0mA cm−2, 2 mAh cm−2 (Figure S9, Supporting Information) further affirm above results. This morphology features result in smooth electric field distributions, stable reaction interface, and reversible Na atoms plating/stripping. For comparison, SEM and elemental mapping images of the cycled pristine carbon cloth are shown in Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information. It can be observed that sodium particles of hundreds micron sizes were randomly dispersed on the carbon cloth substrates, and these agglomerates may further catalyze sodium dendrite growth and morphological deterioration, hence contributing to the cells’ failure. High‐resolution X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of C 1s, Na 1s, Ag 3d, and F 1s for cells (after 100 cycles) with the Ag@C and the pristine carbon cloth substrates at a current density of 2\xa0mA cm−2 are shown in Figure S12, Supporting Information. It is clear that both the Na 1s (1073.8\xa0eV) and the F 1s (686.4\xa0eV) spectra (Figure S12b–f, Supporting Information) demonstrated strong NaF signals for both substrates, which can be attributed to the effective reduction of FEC. Importantly, NaF protective layer is considered to be thermodynamically stable against Na metal and avoid continuously unwanted side reactions which sacrifice Na ion redox kinetics. Composition of the C 1s spectrum is rather complicated, consisting of C\uf8feC (282.1\xa0eV), C\uf8ffO (287.1\xa0eV), ROCH2ONa (288.8\xa0eV), Na2CO3 (290.8\xa0eV) and C\uf8ffFx (292.3\xa0eV) bonds (Figure S12a,d, Supporting Information). These C‐containing products can be stemmed from decompositions of PC and/or FEC. Two well‐separated peaks located at 367.7 and 373.9\xa0eV correspond to the binding energies of Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2, respectively (Figure\xa0S12c, Supporting Information). Additionally, peak locations and distance are quiet distinct from pure metallic Ag, possibly attributing to the Na–Ag interaction. All these interfacial chemistry analyses agree well with the DFT results, confirming that the non‐planar natrophilic Ag@C substrate can markedly facilitate Na ion deposition dynamics, interface, and morphological stabilities.\n\nAnode‐Free Sodium‐Metal Full Cells\nTo confirm the advantages of the Ag@C substrate as “anode‐free” SMA, we prepare a full battery by paring with a Prussian white (PW) cathode. PW, featuring ease of preparation, high specific capacity, and acceptable Na ion mobility (Figure S13, Supporting Information), was viewed as an ideal cathode for SIBs.[] Detailed microstructure characterizations of the as‐synthesized PW are shown in Figures S14 and S15, Supporting Information. Rietveld refinement XRD results (Figure S14a, Supporting Information) suggest that the well‐crystallized PW possesses the monoclinic structure with P21/n space group (a\xa0= 10.1127 Å, b\xa0= 7.3826 Å, c\xa0= 6.9711 Å, α\xa0= γ\xa0= 90°, β\xa0= 90.6°). Three characteristic Raman peaks (Figure S14b, Supporting Information) lied in 2073.8, 2114.2, and 2161.9 cm−1 were assigned to the FeII‐CN‐MnII, FeII‐CN‐MnIII, and FeIII‐CN‐MnII.[] A typical SEM image (Figure S14c, Supporting Information) clearly shows that as‐synthesized PW owns the typical cubic shape with dimensions of 100–200\xa0nm, as testified by the uniform distribution of Mn, Fe, K, C, and N presented in the elemental mapping images (Figure S15, Supporting Information).\nAfterward, “anode‐free” sodium metal full batteries were fabricated to carry out performance and electrochemical analysis. Figure  shows schematic constructions of anode‐free SMB, where active Na+ ions are totally accommodated in the PW cathode. In Figure\xa0, dQ/dV curve exhibits two conspicuous peaks, which can be ascribed to FeII/ FeIII and MnII/ MnIII redox. As shown in Figure\xa0, nearly overlapping voltage‐capacity profiles for the first 3 cycles of the full cell demonstrate remarkable electrochemical reversibility and stability. Meanwhile, the cell is able to deliver an initial specific charge/discharge capacity of 136/128 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, realizing an acceptable initial CE of 94.1%. Moreover, at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C rates (Figure\xa0; Figure S16, Supporting Information), the cell yields highly reversible capacities, respectively, of 110, 104, 95, 75, and 52 mAh g−1. After recovering back to the 0.1 C rate, the cells still retain a considerable capacity of 122\xa0mA h g−1, indicating the appreciable rate performance of this “anode free” SMB. More importantly, the cells cycled at 0.5 C rate show good cycling stability with a capacity retention of ≈56% after 800 cycles, corresponding to a relative slow capacity decay of 0.055% per cycle (Figure\xa0). Although these cells exhibit relative inferior capacity retention than those with pure Na metal anode in the initial 250\xa0cycles (≈0.0055% loss per cycle), PW||Na cells suddenly lost its functionality after 250 cycles (Figure S17, Supporting Information). It can therefore be concluded that anode properties are the main reason for these full cells’ capacity degradation and failure. Compared with the Ag@C substrate, we also analyzed electrochemical performance of an “anode‐free” SMB metal cell with a pristine carbon cloth substrate upon the same testing conditions. It was worth noting that the dQ/dV profile of the full cell with a carbon cloth substrate show larger voltage polarization, indicating inferior interfacial charge‐transfer kinetics (Figure\xa0S18a, Supporting Information). For the first three voltage profiles, we found a distinct decrease of capacity from 127 to 121 mAh g−1 (Figure\xa0S18b, Supporting Information). Even worse, the capacity values reduces rapidly from 108\xa0mA h g−1 at 0.1 C to 5 mAh g−1 at 5 C rate (Figure\xa0S18c, Supporting Information), suggesting much inferior Na ion redox dynamics without the silver treatment. Apart from poor rate capability, the cell with the pristine carbon cloth cycled at 0.5 C rate also shows low capacity retention of ≈42% over 200 cycles, giving rise to a marked capacity decay of 0.29% per cycle (Figure S18d, Supporting Information). Finally, an Ag@C electrode sheet with ≈1\xa0cm diameter in its fully charged state (i.e., sodium loaded) and a small piece (size 0.6\xa0cm\xa0× 0.3\xa0cm\xa0× 0.1\xa0cm) of sodium metal were put into water to assess the safety as shown in the supported video. It was clearly that sodium metal reacts vigorously with water, while no obvious reaction can be observed on the sodium loaded Ag@C substrate. This suggests that the present design does deliver a much safer anode system comparing to using a real SMA. All these encouraging electrochemical analyses strengthen the great potential of Ag@C substrate for construction of the advanced “anode‐free” SMB.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

XRD and SEM of the samples with varying Zn contents are shown in Figs. 1 and S1. From the XRD results, it can be seen that all the materials match the standard card (PDF#00-054-0894) of the P2-type structure, space group P63/mmc well. After Zn doping, the peaks do not change much and still remain sharp, indicating that the samples are well crystalline. When the amount of zinc doping is low, no additional impurity peaks are present. When the Zn content is higher than 0.15, additional peaks appear, which can be attributed to the formation of ZnO (PDF#36–1451). The XRD Rietveld refinement patterns suggest that the zinc ions are located in the transition-metal oxide layer (Fig. S2 and Table S1). SEM images of different samples show mere difference of the prepared materials (Fig. S1), the particle size of the prepared samples is around 2–5\xa0µm with typical layered structure [71], and it demonstrates that a small amount of Zn doping has no significant effect on the morphology of the material.\nThe electrochemical performance of the pristine sample (L-Zn-0-900) with low charge cut-off voltage (2.0–4.0\xa0V) was firstly investigated. Figure S3a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of L-Zn-0-900 during the first three cycles at a scan rate of 0.1\xa0mV\xa0s−1. The curves are highly overlapped, demonstrating that L-Zn-0-900 presents outstanding cycle performance in this voltage range. The peaks in 2.0–2.5\xa0V are assigned to the redox reaction of Mn3+/Mn4+, while the peaks in 2.5–4.0\xa0V are assigned to the redox reaction of nickel metal [72]. Figure S3b shows the charge-discharge profiles of the first cycle of L-Zn-0-900 in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0\xa0V at 17\xa0mA\xa0g−1. The plateaus match the redox peaks in the CV curves in Fig. S2a well. When the material is cycled with the current density of 170\xa0mA\xa0g−1 between 2.0 and 4.0\xa0V, the initial discharge capacity is 77.9 mAh g−1 (Fig. S3c). After 500 cycles, the discharge capacity still retains 62.0 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention approaches to 79.6%. Figure S3d shows the rate performance of L-Zn-0-900. The discharge capacity at 34, 85, 170, 340, 850, and 1700\xa0mA\xa0g−1 are 79.2, 77.4, 75.8, 72.8, and 58.6 mAh g−1. These results demonstrate that L-Zn-0-900 exhibits good cycle stability and rate performance in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0\xa0V.\nTo depict the influence of Zn doping at high voltage, the electrochemical performance of materials with different Zn doping content were evaluated in the voltage range of 2.5–4.2\xa0V and the results are shown in Fig.\xa02. At 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1, when L-Zn-0-900 is charged to 4.18\xa0V, a long plateau appears, which is assigned to phase transition from P2 to O2 [72]. Figure\xa02a shows the charge-discharge profiles of the materials with different Zn content. Compared to L-Zn-0-900, the curves of L-Zn-0.05-900 do not change much and the same phase transition plateau exists. When the Zn content is further increased to 0.1, a substantial change is observed. The plateau at\u2009~\u20094.2\xa0V lowers to\u2009~\u20094.0\xa0V and becomes slope-like during the charging process. This change is conducive to the reversible intercalation of sodium into the cathode, and is also considered to be beneficial to the cycle life [73]. The initial discharge capacity of L-Zn-0.1-900 is 94.1 mAh g−1, much higher than that of L-Zn-0-900 (72.4 mAh g−1). For the L-Zn-0.15–900 and L-Zn-0.2-900 samples, the plateaus at higher voltage are not obvious, and the discharge capacity of the first cycle is 89.1 mAh g−1 and 72.4 mAh g−1, respectively. The lower discharge capacity compared to that of L-Zn-0.1-900 is due to excessive Zn doping, which reduces the amount of Ni in redox reaction. In addition, the average discharge voltage, which is one of the most important parameters for measuring the energy density, elevates after zinc doping. The average discharge voltage of L-Zn-0-900 at a current density of 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1 is 3.23\xa0V. The average discharge voltage of L-Zn-0.05-900, L-Zn-0.1-900, L-Zn-0.15–900, and L-Zn-0.2-900 is 3.62, 3.64, 3.67, and 3.67\xa0V, respectively. The cycle performance with the current density of 170\xa0mA\xa0g−1 was further investigated, as shown in Fig.\xa02b. L-Zn-0.1-900 exhibits the highest initial discharge capacity of 87.9 mAh g−1 and highest capacity retention (78.4% after 500 cycles). In contrast, the capacity of L-Zn-0-900 is only 43.4 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles, with a capacity retention of 60.8%. For L-Zn-0.05-900, a capacity of 53.6 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles is achieved with a capacity retention of 70.4%. As the Zn content exceeds 0.1, the cycle performance deteriorates, and the capacity of L-Zn-0.15–900 decreases to 58.3 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles, while the capacity retention decreases to 71.5%. The performance of L-Zn-0.2-900 is even worse, the capacity is 33.8 mAh g−1 and the capacity retention is 49.3% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, L-Zn-0.1-900 presents excellent rate performance (Fig.\xa02c). In the voltage range of 2.5–4.2\xa0V, the discharge capacity of L-Zn-0-900 is just 28.8 mAh g−1 at 3.4 Ah g−1. When the current density back to 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1, the discharge capacity is only 61.4 mAh g−1. By contrast, L-Zn-0.1-900 can deliver 47.5 mAh g−1 even at 3.4 Ah g−1 and 84 mAh g−1 when the current density returns to 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1, indicating outstanding rate capability. The charge-discharge profiles of L-Zn-0-900 and L-Zn-0.1-900 for different cycle at 170\xa0mA\xa0g−1 are shown in Fig. S4. As the cycle number increases, the curves for L-Zn-0.1-900 maintain a relatively good overlap, while the capacity for L-Zn-0-900 decreases rapidly. Based on the aforementioned results, L-Zn-0.1-900 sample presents the best the electrochemical performance among the doping materials, thus the following modification is focused on Na0.7Ni0.35-xMn0.65ZnxO2 with x\u2009=\u20090.1.\nPrevious research has shown that when the synthesis temperature is not high enough, Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 remains thermodynamically stable in the P3 phase, while when calcined at higher temperatures the material would remain stable in the P2 phase [17, 56,57,58, 74]. An appropriate increase in temperature might improve the electrochemical performance of P2-type layered oxides. In this context, Na0.7Ni0.25Mn0.65Zn0.1O2 was synthesized at different calcination temperatures in the range between 900 and 1000\xa0°C, followed by liquid nitrogen cooling; the samples are denoted as L-Zn-0.1-T, in which T presents the calcination temperature. In addition, the cooling rate impacts on the structural deficiency, and the capacity would be influenced. Thus sample with natural cooling was prepared as well, which is denoted as N-Zn-0.1-T. Optimized calcination temperature of the natural cooling sample was set based on the performance evaluation of the samples with liquid nitrogen cooling.\nThe XRD patterns of the materials synthesized at different temperature and with different cooling methods are shown in Fig.\xa03a. It can be seen that all the materials match the standard card (PDF#00-054-0894) of the P2-type structure. When the calcination temperature increases to 950\xa0°C, trace of impurity (NiO)0.75(MnO)0.25 (PDF#78-0425) is observed for both L-Zn-0.1-950 and N-Zn-0.1-950. When further increasing the calcination temperature to 1000\xa0°C, the signal of impurity (NiO)0.75(MnO)0.25 is obvious. In addition, for N-Zn-0.1-950, the (002) peak is enhanced, indicating a preferential lateral crystallization orientation along (002) plane. The SEM images of the samples prepared with various calcination temperatures and different cooling methods are shown in Fig.\xa03b–e. L-Zn-0.1-900 and L-Zn-0.1-950 exhibit smaller particle size of\u2009~\u20093\xa0µm. For L-Zn-0.1-1000, it presents layered morphology and the particle size increases to 5–7\xa0µm. For N-Zn-0.1-950, similar layered morphology can be observed, and the particle size is\u2009~\u20098\xa0µm. The particle size of N-Zn-0.1-950 is larger than that of L-Zn-0.1-950, which should be attributed to the crystal growth with slow cooling rate during the natural cooling.\nThe galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles at 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1 of materials synthesized at different temperature and with different cooling methods are shown in Fig.\xa04a. The cells were cycled at a current density of 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1 in the voltage range of 2.5–4.2\xa0V. The L-Zn-0.1-900 delivers an initial discharge capacity of 94.1 mAh g−1. And L-Zn-0.1-950 shows a similar initial discharge capacity of 92.5 mAh g−1. For L-Zn-0.1-1000, it has the highest initial discharge capacity of 120 mAh g−1. And N-Zn-0.1-950 exhibits a discharge capacity of 84.6 mAh g−1, which is slightly lower than that of L-Zn-0.1-950. L-Zn-0.1-950 presents smaller particle size, in addition, oxygen deficiency might be introduced during the quick liquid nitrogen cooling process, and thus L-Zn-0.1-950 delivers slightly higher capacity than N-Zn-0.1-950. For all the samples, three charge plateaus can be observed, which is attributed to the sequential oxidation of nickel element [41, 73].\nThe cycle performances of the materials prepared with different calcination temperatures and cooling methods at 170\xa0mA\xa0g−1 are shown in Figs.\xa04b and\xa0S5. L-Zn-0.1-900 and L-Zn-0.1-950 exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 87.9 and 91 mAh g−1, respectively. The discharge capacity of L-Zn-0.1-900 after 500 cycles is 68.9 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention is 78.4%, the capacity is 56.7 mAh g−1 with a capacity retention of 64.5% over 1000 cycles. At the same current density, L-Zn-0.1-950 shows a slightly higher discharge capacity (72.7 mAh g−1) and capacity retention (79.9%) over 500 cycles. The capacity of L-Zn-0.1-950 after 1000 cycles is 60 mAh g−1, and capacity retention is 65.9%. For the L-Zn-0.1-1000 sample, it shows the highest initial discharge capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1, but it decreases rapidly as the cycle number increases. After 500 cycles, the discharge capacity is only 53.8 mAh g−1, which is 51.1% of the first cycle. As for N-Zn-0.1-950, though it delivers a relatively low initial discharge capacity of 77.3 mAh g−1, it presents excellent cycle stability; a capacity of 68.9 mAh g−1 with a capacity retention of 89.1% is achieved over 500 cycles. After 1000 cycles, the discharge capacity is 64.9 mAh g−1, which is 84.0% of the first cycle. The cycle performance of N-Zn-0.1-950 is superior to those reported in literature, as shown in Table S2.\nThe rate performance of the materials is shown in Fig.\xa04c. and the charge-discharge profiles of N-Zn-0.1-950 at different current densities is shown in Fig.\xa04d. L-Zn-0.1-950 exhibits the best rate performance; the discharge capacity at 34, 68, 85, 170, 340, 850, 1700, 2550, and 3400\xa0mA\xa0g−1 is 93.6, 89.3, 87.2, 83.5, 79.6, 72.6, 65.7, 60.8, and 54.7 mAh g−1. It can still deliver a capacity of 87.6 mAh g−1 when the current density returns back to 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1. The rate performance of L-Zn-0.1-900 and N-Zn-0.1-950 are slightly worse than that of L-Zn-0.1-950, especially at high currents density. The discharge capacity of L-Zn-0.1-900 and N-Zn-0.1-950 is 91.1 and 86.2 mAh g−1 at 34\xa0mA\xa0g−1, 82.2 and 77.7 mAh g−1 at 170\xa0mA\xa0g−1, 60.3 and 55.1 mAh g−1 at 1700\xa0mA\xa0g−1, 48.2 and 43.1\xa0mA\xa0g−1 at 3400\xa0mA\xa0g−1. For the L-Zn-0.1-1000 sample, the discharge capacity is the highest at low current density. However, the capacity decreases rapidly as the current density increases. When the current density is 340\xa0mA\xa0g−1, the discharge capacity of L-Zn-0.1-1000 is 89.9 mAh g−1, still higher than the other three materials. But as the current density is further increased, its capacity rapidly decreases to 48.4 mAh g−1 at 1700\xa0mA\xa0g−1, and is only 12.7 mAh g−1 at 3.4 Ah g−1, which is much lower than other samples. The aforementioned results show that L-Zn-0.1-1000 sample presents the highest initial capacity, while it suffers rapid capacity fading over cycling and poor rate performance. In contrast, N-Zn-0.1-950 presents excellent cycle performance. L-Zn-0.1-1000 sample with the highest calcination temperature would present more oxygen release and oxygen deficiency [36, 75], which might result in poor structural stability and rate performance. For N-Zn-0.1-950, the excellent cycle performance might result from the preferential orientation of (002) plane, which maintains good structure stability during cycling.\nIn order to further investigate the reason for the high capacity retention of N-Zn-0.1-950, in situ XRD investigation is performed, and the results are shown in Fig.\xa05. According to previous reports, the Na-Ni-Mn-O system gradually transforms from P2 phase to O2 phase when it is charged up to\u2009~\u20094.2\xa0V, which is the main reason for the poor capacity retention [76, 77]. Before charging, N-Zn-0.1-950 exhibits a typical P2 phase, with a diffraction peak at about 15° and 32°, corresponding to the (002) and (004) crystal faces, respectively [78]. The intensity of the (002) peak is reduced. This might be due to the cell used during in situ XRD operation, at low angles, the beam is slightly hidden or the beam width is a bit larger than the size of the electrode [79]. As the voltage increases, the peaks of (002) and (004) faces shift to the low angle, indicating the expansion of the c-axis and the contraction of the ab-plane. When the voltage increases to 4.1\xa0V, the peak of the P2 phase becomes weak, followed by the emergence of (002) and (004) faces of the OP4 phase located at 16.5° and 33.5°, respectively [80]. This indicates that the sample transforms from P2 phase to OP4 phase when the charge voltage is higher than 4.1\xa0V. Afterwards the P2 phase completely transits into the OP4 phase at 4.2\xa0V. The phase transition (P2\u2009→\u2009OP4) may be related to the sliding of the plate, which is attributed to the thermodynamic instability of the prismatic sites without sodium ions, and the formation of the OP4 phase would reduce structural change compared to the P2-O2 phase transition, thus contributing to the high structural stability of the material [71]. Upon discharge, the characteristic peaks of the OP4 phase get weak, and the characteristic peaks of the P2 phase reappear at 4.1\xa0V. The (002) and (004) peaks move to high angles as the voltage decreases. When discharged to 2.75\xa0V, the intensity and position of the characteristic peaks are similar to that of the material before cycling, indicating that the P2\u2009→\u2009OP4\u2009→\u2009P2 phase transition is highly reversible, which contributes to the excellent cycle performance of N-Zn-0.1-950.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Na2CO3 (≥\u200999.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), NiO (≥\u200999%, Sigma-Aldrich), Mn2O3 (≥\u200999%, Beijing Innochem Science & Technology Co., Ltd), and ZnO (≥\u200999%,\u2009≤\u2009100\xa0nm, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in stoichiometric ratio. The mixture was transferred into an agate mortar with anhydrous ethanol and milled. Then the powder was calcined at 900, 950, or 1000\xa0°C for 16\xa0h in muffle furnace. Two different cooling methods were used after calcination, one is natural cooling and another is liquid nitrogen cooling. For the latter, the materials were naturally cooled to 300\xa0°C and then using liquid nitrogen for rapid cooling. The samples are denoted as N-Zn-x-T and L-Zn-x-T, respectively, in which x represents the zinc content and T represents calcination temperature. The resulting samples stored in Ar-filled glove box to avoid reaction with water in air.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe active materials, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed at a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was spread on Al foil and dried in a vacuum overnight. The mass loading of the active material is around 1.4\xa0g\xa0cm−2. Sodium metal is the counter electrode, and a Whatman GF/F glass fiber is the separator. The electrolyte was 1.0\xa0M NaClO4 in a solution composed of EC: PC (with volume ratio of 1:1). All cells are assembled in a glove box filled with argon. The coin cells (CR2025) of galvanostatic charge/discharge were investigated at various rates (1C\u2009=\u2009170 mAh g−1) using a Land Test System (CT2001A). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E (Chenhua, Shanghai).\n\nMaterials characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to characterize the structures on a Smart lab (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ\u2009=\u20091.5406\xa0Å). Rietveld refinement was performed using the Total pattern analysis solutions (TOPAS).

Na2CO3 (≥\u200999.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), NiO (≥\u200999%, Sigma-Aldrich), Mn2O3 (≥\u200999%, Beijing Innochem Science & Technology Co., Ltd), and ZnO (≥\u200999%,\u2009≤\u2009100\xa0nm, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in stoichiometric ratio. The mixture was transferred into an agate mortar with anhydrous ethanol and milled. Then the powder was calcined at 900, 950, or 1000\xa0°C for 16\xa0h in muffle furnace. Two different cooling methods were used after calcination, one is natural cooling and another is liquid nitrogen cooling. For the latter, the materials were naturally cooled to 300\xa0°C and then using liquid nitrogen for rapid cooling. The samples are denoted as N-Zn-x-T and L-Zn-x-T, respectively, in which x represents the zinc content and T represents calcination temperature. The resulting samples stored in Ar-filled glove box to avoid reaction with water in air.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe active materials, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed at a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was spread on Al foil and dried in a vacuum overnight. The mass loading of the active material is around 1.4\xa0g\xa0cm−2. Sodium metal is the counter electrode, and a Whatman GF/F glass fiber is the separator. The electrolyte was 1.0\xa0M NaClO4 in a solution composed of EC: PC (with volume ratio of 1:1).

The coin cells (CR2025) of galvanostatic charge/discharge were investigated at various rates (1C\u2009=\u2009170 mAh g−1) using a Land Test System (CT2001A). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E (Chenhua, Shanghai).\n\nMaterials characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to characterize the structures on a Smart lab (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ\u2009=\u20091.5406\xa0Å).

Na2CO3 (≥\u200999.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), NiO (≥\u200999%, Sigma-Aldrich), Mn2O3 (≥\u200999%, Beijing Innochem Science & Technology Co., Ltd), and ZnO (≥\u200999%,\u2009≤\u2009100\xa0nm, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in stoichiometric ratio. The mixture was transferred into an agate mortar with anhydrous ethanol and milled. Then the powder was calcined at 900, 950, or 1000\xa0°C for 16\xa0h in muffle furnace. Two different cooling methods were used after calcination, one is natural cooling and another is liquid nitrogen cooling. For the latter, the materials were naturally cooled to 300\xa0°C and then using liquid nitrogen for rapid cooling. The samples are denoted as N-Zn-x-T and L-Zn-x-T, respectively, in which x represents the zinc content and T represents calcination temperature. The resulting samples stored in Ar-filled glove box to avoid reaction with water in air.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe active materials, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed at a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was spread on Al foil and dried in a vacuum overnight. The mass loading of the active material is around 1.4\xa0g\xa0cm−2. Sodium metal is the counter electrode, and a Whatman GF/F glass fiber is the separator. The electrolyte was 1.0\xa0M NaClO4 in a solution composed of EC: PC (with volume ratio of 1:1). All cells are assembled in a glove box filled with argon. The coin cells (CR2025) of galvanostatic charge/discharge were investigated at various rates (1C\u2009=\u2009170 mAh g−1) using a Land Test System (CT2001A). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E (Chenhua, Shanghai).\n\nMaterials characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to characterize the structures on a Smart lab (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ\u2009=\u20091.5406\xa0Å). Rietveld refinement was performed using the Total pattern analysis solutions (TOPAS). The surface morphology is obtained via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom ProX).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Na2CO3 (≥\u200999.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), NiO (≥\u200999%, Sigma-Aldrich), Mn2O3 (≥\u200999%, Beijing Innochem Science & Technology Co., Ltd), and ZnO (≥\u200999%,\u2009≤\u2009100\xa0nm, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in stoichiometric ratio. The mixture was transferred into an agate mortar with anhydrous ethanol and milled. Then the powder was calcined at 900, 950, or 1000\xa0°C for 16\xa0h in muffle furnace. Two different cooling methods were used after calcination, one is natural cooling and another is liquid nitrogen cooling. For the latter, the materials were naturally cooled to 300\xa0°C and then using liquid nitrogen for rapid cooling. The samples are denoted as N-Zn-x-T and L-Zn-x-T, respectively, in which x represents the zinc content and T represents calcination temperature. The resulting samples stored in Ar-filled glove box to avoid reaction with water in air.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe active materials, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed at a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was spread on Al foil and dried in a vacuum overnight. The mass loading of the active material is around 1.4\xa0g\xa0cm−2. Sodium metal is the counter electrode, and a Whatman GF/F glass fiber is the separator. The electrolyte was 1.0\xa0M NaClO4 in a solution composed of EC: PC (with volume ratio of 1:1). All cells are assembled in a glove box filled with argon. The coin cells (CR2025) of galvanostatic charge/discharge were investigated at various rates (1C\u2009=\u2009170 mAh g−1) using a Land Test System (CT2001A). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660E (Chenhua, Shanghai).\n\nMaterials characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to characterize the structures on a Smart lab (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ\u2009=\u20091.5406\xa0Å). Rietveld refinement was performed using the Total pattern analysis solutions (TOPAS). The surface morphology is obtained via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom ProX).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

We observed MoTe2 nanorods in the MTH samples, which smaller particle sizes in one-dimensional structures can enhance the surface area associated with Na-ion diffusion in the electrolyte and provide the short diffusion length, which leads to good capacity. However, it is evident noticed from the Fig.\xa02(a, b, c) that the uniform distribution of nanorods is not there in the sample, which may lead to low capacity and poor cycling stability. On the other end, it can be observed that the uniform distribution of the MoTe2 nanoparticles synthesized by electrodeposition. Figure\xa02 (d, e) shows the nano needle-like structure of tellurium nanoparticles electro-deposited on the Mo-coated aluminium substrate. After annealing, morphology changed drastically. Tellurium nano needle-like structure converts into uniformly distributed MoTe2 nano blocks with a sharp layered structure, which can facilitate the sodium ion insertion during the charging-discharging process and provide a smooth path for the sodium ion storage mechanism. These layered nano blocks have a high surface area, which helps in intercalation-deintercalation of Na+ ions into the layers of molybdenum tellurides. The elemental mapping of the MTH and MTE shows the all-over distribution of Mo and Te, discussed in detail in the supplementary information in Fig. S (1,2).\nPhotons scatter at different energies due to vibrational modes (phonons) in a sample, while interacting with the light in a Raman spectrometer. The resulting Raman spectra reveal lattice vibrations and the crystal structure of the material. Raman spectroscopy of the materials synthesized by electrodeposition and hydrothermal, distinct vibrational modes that confirm the successful formation of the 1T’ phase of molybdenum telluride. The signature peaks of Tellurium can be seen at 123\xa0cm⁻¹ and 142\xa0cm⁻¹ in Fig.\xa03(a), which confirms that the electrodeposition of Te nano-needles has been successfully completed on the Mo-coated Al substrate. It can be clearly observed from the Raman that conversion of MoTe2 occurs after giving an annealing temperature of 450\xa0°C for 1\xa0h. We also compared MoTe2 synthesized by hydrothermal and electrodeposition in Fig.\xa03(b). Here, we observe that the distinct peaks of 1T′-MoTe2, including Au (106.1\xa0cm−\u20091), Ag (122.5\xa0cm−\u20091), Bg (152.3\xa0cm−\u20091), Bg (195.1\xa0cm−\u20091), and Ag (275. 2\xa0cm−\u20091) are indicative of sample [17]. The Ag vibrational modes are attributed to symmetric vibrations and Bg modes of vibrations are attributed to anti-symmetric vibrations. These modes of vibrations correspond to the 1T′-MoTe2 phase present in both samples.\nX-ray diffraction profiles help to examine the crystallographic features, structural properties, and information about the phase of the transition metal chalcogenides. As per Fig.\xa03(c, d), we can see XRD patterns of the MoTe2 synthesized by hydrothermal and electrodeposition is matching with the JCPDS-71-2157, which corresponds to the 1T’ phase of MoTe2. The crustal structure of the 1T’- phase of MoTe2 is monoclinic. The layers of 1T’- phase of MoTe2 are linked together by van der Waals interactions and can be exfoliated into thin 2D layers.\nThis XRD result confirms the successful conversion of MoTe2 in the 1T’ phase from the electrodeposited tellurium on Mo-coated aluminium after annealing at 450\xa0°C for 1\xa0h in the Ar atmosphere. This shows the prominent lattice plane of (012). MTH was synthesised at 200\xa0°C for 48\xa0h and 60\xa0h. But both are giving the same phase formation, thus we here discuss about the results of 48\xa0h only. It has a prominent crystallographic plane of (103). Here, it can be observed that the FWHM of all peaks is too small, which suggests the highly crystalline nature of the material. The prominent crystallographic planes in both samples are different, which may lead to different morphologies, which results into different electrochemical performances. Thus, from Raman spectroscopy, FESEM images and XRD patterns, it can be concluded that 1T’- MoTe2 have successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method as well as electrodeposition. The film synthesized by electrodeposition is highly crystalline and uniformly distributed with structural stability and high surface area, which may result into smooth Na-ion diffusion and facilitate the intercalation-deintercalation mechanisms. As compared to MTE, the samples synthesized by hydrothermal may not provide good cycling stability and high capacity due to the non-uniform structure of the material.\n\n3.1 Electrochemical studies\nThe electrochemical performances of the Na-ion battery in a half-cell configuration using molybdenum ditelluride electrodes synthesized by hydrothermal and electrodeposition have been investigated. The schematic diagram of the Na-ion coin cell assembly is discussed in supplementary information in Fig. S (3). The cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates is elaborated in supplementary information in Fig. S (4). The CV at different scan rates shows two reduction peaks co-relate to the alloying and de-alloying phases of Na2Te in the material. The two reduction peaks attributed to Na-ion intercalation in the MoTe2 matrix and oxidation peaks correspond to the de-intercalation of Na-ion from the MoTe2 lattice [19]. Figure\xa04(a) shows the comparison of galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles between MTE and MTH electrodes for 50 cycles at 0.05\xa0A g−\u20091 current rate in a voltage range of 0.1\xa0V to 2.5\xa0V. In the initial cycle, the MTH electrode showed 380 mAh g−\u20091 capacity; this was stabilized at about 277 mAh g−\u20091 capacity after 50 cycles, thereby displaying 72.8% retention of capacity. Whereas the MTE electrode shows 425 mAh g−\u20091 capacity in the 1st cycle, that stabilised around 355 mAh g−\u20091 capacity after 50 cycles, thereby delivering 84.5% capacity retention. Here, from Fig.\xa04(a), it is observed that MTE is giving high-capacity with high-capacity retention after 50 cycles. Whereas, MTH is giving low capacity with poor capacity retention. Thus, it can be concluded that the MTE electrode has better cycling stability and high capacity because of its uniformly distributed layered nano blocks-like morphology and pure stable structural properties as compared to MTH electrodes. Thus, a uniform and stable structure provides a better path to intercalate into the layers of molybdenum ditelluride, which results into an enhancement in charge-discharge capacity.\nFurther to analyse electrochemistry MTH and MTE, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was analysed as per Fig.\xa04(b). The high-frequency range of the EIS data shows a semi-circle, which corresponds to charge transfer resistance at electrode-electrolyte interphase RCT and the low-frequency range shows linear slop describing about the diffusion of sodium-ion into the layers of molybdenum ditelluride, which corresponds to Warburg impedance. By fitting the EIS data to the equivalent circuit, which is illustrated in Fig.\xa04(b), the values computed of charge transfer resistance RCT of MTE and MTH, are 78 Ω and 236 Ω, respectively. Here, it is concluded that the electric conductivity of the MTE is more than the MTH electrode, which may result into low-capacity values. The unique and uniform structure of the MTE provides conducting and stable diffusion of Na+ ions on the electrode surface, leading to low charge transfer resistance resulting into high capacity and high cycling stability. Thus, it can be said that MTE has better morphology.\nGCD was performed to examine the cycling performance of the MTE electrode for 100 cycles at 0.1\xa0A g−\u20091 current rate in the potential range of 0.1\xa0V to 2.5\xa0V as displayed in Fig.\xa04(c). MTE electrode gives 348 mAh g−\u20091 capacity in initial cycles, which stabilized around 299 mAh g−\u20091 after 100 cycles. Thus, the MTE shows 85.98% of capacity retention after 100 cycles. The I.C.E. of the MTE electrode is 78%, in the 1st cycle, which may be because of unstable SEI layer, conversion and electrolyte decomposition in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the C.E. showed a significant improvement of 90%, which improved after 10 cycles to 99%. A stable SEI layer formation may be the reason behind the enhancement of Coulombic efficiency. Galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles having graph of specific capacity Vs. voltage are shown in the supplementary information Fig. S (5). The working potential at around 0.31\xa0V shows a plateau region that may attributed to SEI layer formation and conversion of MoTe2 in the initial cycle. The working potential becomes stable after the first cycle around 1.5\xa0V corresponding to the intercalation of MoTe2 during sodiation and desodiation. Thus, it is concluded here that the MTE electrode shows excellent cycling stability of the material because of the stability and uniformity in structure.\nThe rate performance of the MTE electrode has been examined for 5 cycles at 0.05\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.1\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.2\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.5\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.8\xa0A g−\u20091 and 1\xa0A g−\u20091 current rates as illustrated in Fig.\xa04 (d). The MTE electrode gives a stable capacity of around 352 mAh g−\u20091, 298 mAh g−\u20091, 235 mAh g−\u20091, 165 mAh g−\u20091, 135 mAh g−\u20091, 115 mAh g−\u20091 at 0.05\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.1\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.2\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.5\xa0A g−\u20091, 0.8\xa0A g−\u20091 and 1\xa0A g−\u20091 current rates, respectively. The MTE electrode shows capacity retention of 95% at 0.05 Ag−\u20091 current rate after running on higher current rates. Even though MoTe2 has a capacity of 305 mAh g−\u20091 (theoretical) (estimated using four mol of sodium ions for one mole of MoTe2) [19], the interfacial Na+ storage and the Na2Te alloy’s production might be the cause of the additional specific capacity found at 0.05\xa0A g−\u20091.\nFigure\xa04(e) shows the EIS of the MTE electrode before and after 100 cycles. The RCT was analysed, which is between the electrolyte and molybdenum ditelluride surface. The value of RCT before CD was 78 Ω, which increased to 276 Ω after 100 cycles. The increment in RCT occurs because of the unstable SEI layer formation between the electrode-electrolyte surface and electrolyte degradation during the sodiation/desodiation process, which results in a decrement in the conductivity of the materials, which leads to a decrement in capacity. Thus, from the primary electrochemical data, it can be concluded that uniform-layered MoTe2 can be effectively used as a negative electrode.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The solution for the hydrothermal reaction was prepared by using 8 mM sodium molybdate dihydrate (NaMoO4, 2H2O), 16 mM tellurium metallic powder, and 12 mM sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Firstly, it is required to make 12 mM NaBH4 solution in 5 ml de-ionised water, then add 16 mM tellurium powder while stirring in the ice bath until the solution becomes clear. Meanwhile, solution of 8 mM NaMoO4, 2H2O is to be made into 30 ml of de-ionised water. Then mix both solutions with the help of stirring and transfer them to the 50 ml Teflon liner. The final solution in the liner should be placed into the autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 48 h. [18] Further, it was cleaned with water and dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The prepared product was named as MTH is going to be used as an active material for slurry making for electrode preparation to fabricate the Na-ion coin cell.\nElectrodeposition is an easy, scalable, and cost-effective method for synthesising nanoparticles, which helps to get well-defined morphologies. Molybdenum-coated aluminium foil was used as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. Molybdenum coating on aluminium foil has been done by a Radio-Frequency Sputtering system (RF sputtering) of the thickness around 50\xa0nm [24]. Tellurium oxide is used as a tellurium precursor. Tellurium oxide is insoluble in water. Acidic medium was used to dissolve TeO2. Thus, electrolyte was prepared using 20 mM TeO2 and 1 mM nitric acid. As demonstrated in Fig.\xa01, it can be observed the reduction peak of the tellurium around −\u20090.2\xa0V from the cyclic voltammetry curve. The chronoamperometry technique was used for electrodeposition of tellurium nanoparticles on the molybdenum-coated aluminium substrate at -0.2\xa0V for 900\xa0s at room temperature. The electrodeposition of tellurium is following the chemical reaction mentioned below,\nAfter electrodeposition of Te nanoparticles on Mo-coated Al foil, the sample was annealed at 450\xa0°C for 1\xa0h in an Ar atmosphere in an MTI furnace. Thus, Molybdenum Telluride is synthesized using Electrodeposition named as MTE, which will be used directly without a binder-free negative electrode for Na+ batteries.\n\n2.2 Characterisation of molybdenum ditelluride\nTo characterise MoTe2 samples obtained by both electrodeposition and hydrothermal method by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) Ultra-55 model from Carl Zeiss company for morphological properties of the sample. Raman Analysis was done from Renishaw company model inVia for compositional study of the material. X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) X’Pert PRO model from PANalytical B.V. is used for structural properties of the materials.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical cell preparation\nFor the electrochemical testing of molybdenum ditelluride as a negative electrode material, Na-ion fabricated CR-2032 coin cells. The MTE sample is used as a binder-free electrode directly. Initially, the MTH samples were ground up into a fine powder to create a slurry to construct negative electrodes. These particles were subsequently combined with a binder known as PVDF and carbon black in a weight ratio of 80:10:10. The dissolving solvent for the mixture was NMP. The slurry that resulted was magnetically stirred for 12\xa0h. An etched aluminium foil with a thickness of 15\xa0μm was then coated with the prepared slurry. The coating procedure was conducted using a doctor’s blade. The coated negative electrodes were subsequently vacuum-dried at 60\xa0°C overnight. Our electrolyte consisted of 1\xa0M NaClO4 dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DC). Whatman GF/D fibre is used as a separator in Na+ ion batteries. Moisture and oxygen concentrations were maintained at or below 0.1 ppm during the assembly and disassembly of the coin cells in a glove box with an Ar atmosphere. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests and cyclic voltammetry experiments were done in the BT lab. To conduct measurements of the rate capability and galvanostatic charging discharging performance the Neware instrument is used.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The α-Mn2O3 homogeneous spherical particle was achieved from agglomerated EMD particles. The resultant product was microwaved to obtain one-dimensional\xa0α-MnO2 nanorods. Finally, the 1D-α-MnO2/OLC composite was developed in which OLC nanoparticles were encased α-MnO2 nanorods, which is advantageous for rapid ion transport during the electrochemistry process and has an effect on the structural stability of the composite.\nFigure\xa02a depicts the wide scan XPS spectrum of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite recorded from zero to 1300\xa0eV. Only Mn, O, and C signals can be seen, indicating the sample purity. The calculated atomic percentage of the elements of α-MnO2 are O 1\xa0s (54.3%), Mn 2p (27.1%), and C 1\xa0s (18.6%), while O 1\xa0s (9.7%), Mn 2p (4.8%), and C 1\xa0s (85.5%) for α-MnO2/OLC composite. The carbon signal in the α-MnO2/OLC composite shows quite intense and most likely arises from the carbon present in the composite. The Mn 2p spectrum for α-MnO2 is illustrated in Fig.\xa02b, and it consists of two major splitting peaks appearing at 642.6\xa0eV and 654.1\xa0eV, corresponding to Mn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbits, with the spin energy separation of 11.5\xa0eV, while Mn 2p spectrum for α-MnO2/OLC composite (Fig.\xa02c) involves two doublets at 642.3\xa0eV (Mn 2p3/2) and 653.8\xa0eV (Mn 2p1/2), with the energy difference of 11.5\xa0eV. The energy difference values of both materials indicate the presence of a 4+ oxidation state of Mn metal [1, 65]. It is difficult to arrive at a firm conclusion of the Mn oxidation state from the Mn2p spectra because the splitting energy gap always differs for the different valence state; therefore, it is more essential to evaluate the Mn 3\xa0s spectra to determine the oxidation state of Mn. The Mn 3\xa0s spectrum of both materials is exemplified in Fig.\xa02d and evolves two doublet peaks located at 84.3\xa0eV and 88.9\xa0eV and 83.9\xa0eV and 88.7\xa0eV, with energy splitting gap of 4.6\xa0eV and 4.8\xa0eV for α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite, respectively. This result clearly indicates that both materials consume mainly Mn4+ and with some Mn3+ oxidation state of Mn [66,67,68]. Figure\xa02e depicts the C1s spectrum of α-MnO2/OLC composite; the strongest peak at 284.8\xa0eV ascribed to the C–C bonds encapsulated from the OLC in the composite, while the other peaks at 285.8\xa0eV and 287.5\xa0eV are assigned to C–O and O–C=O corresponding to the presence of some oxygen-containing functional groups in the organic matrix and from a trace amount of carboxyl in the hybrid samples. O 1\xa0s spectrum of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite (Fig.\xa02f, g) shows three different peaks at 529.8\xa0eV, 531.3\xa0eV, and 533.3\xa0eV and 529.6\xa0eV, 531.2\xa0eV, and 533.3\xa0eV. The main peak at\u2009~\u2009529.8\xa0eV corresponds to metal oxide bonds, while the other peaks at 531.3\xa0eV and 533.3\xa0eV attributed to hydroxide and water (C–O, C=O, OH), which are good agreement with reported literature [69, 70].\nFigure\xa02h depicts the X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) of all the samples (α-MnO2, α-MnO2/OLC, and OLC) synthesized by microwave irradiation method. XRD reveals that all the diffraction peaks of the α-MnO2\xa0and α-MnO2/OLC composite are well indexed to the tetragonal Hollandite-type structure of α-MnO2\xa0with the space group 14/m (87), in which the MnO6 octahedra are linked to form double zigzag chains along the c-axis by edge-sharing. These double chains then share their corners with each other forming approximately square tunnels parallel to the c-axis, as shown in the inset of Fig.\xa02i [65, 71]. No characteristic peaks were observed related to\xa0impurities\xa0in the XRD pattern, suggesting a pure phase of α-MnO2 crystal structure. The XRD pattern of OLC is co-plotted with α-MnO2 which shows two significant peaks at 25° and 43.78° associated with the (002) and (111) planes of OLC revealing the existence of graphitic carbon [41, 72, 73]. Including OLC in α-MnO2 matrix certainly modifies the original parameters of the later due to the structural deformations of OLC. This can be confirmed by refining the XRD patterns of the pure and compared with the composite α-MnO2 samples (Fig.\xa02i). Though lattice parameters shows similar values, crystallite size of the composite sample is smaller than that of the pristine which is completely due to the addition of OLC [65]. The dense yet smaller nanoparticles greatly affect the crystal density and volume of the unit cell as shown in Table\xa01. This can be further understood by observing the peak shift and larger FWHM of α-MnO2/OLC composite than the pristine (Fig.\xa02h).\nTG–DTA study was performed to investigate the thermal stability and chemical composition of the α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC (Fig.\xa02j, k)\xa0composite under airflow. The α-MnO2\xa0and α-MnO2/OLC composites have a feeble weight loss that occurred at temperatures in the range of 150 to 220\xa0°C, which could be attributed to the physically absorbed water molecules from the materials owing to their hygroscopicity [74]. All types of manganese oxide sample possess multistage decomposition with respect to temperatures, and in the present samples apart from the initial weight loss, a major weight loss event is recorded at 550–630\xa0°C range. Transition at this temperature range is always associated with the formation of non-stoichiometric compositions such as MnOx or phase transformations such as Mn2O3 [75] due to the loss of oxygen atoms. Further weight loss events lead to the other phases like Mn3O4 which are not prominently seen here. However, OLC undergo decomposition at the similar temperature range indicating the poor thermodynamic stability of carbon at higher-temperature range. Overall, the pristine sample shows lesser weight loss (~\u20096%)\xa0compared to the α-MnO2/OLC composite (~\u200946%). As mentioned earlier, the reason for such a large amount of weight loss event must be corroborated to the existence of carbon in the α-MnO2 matrix. Calculating the percentages of weight loss events, the composite sample composes 46% of carbon and another 54% as α-MnO2\xa0and this data goes in line with the preparatory entries. Considering the pristine sample, the smallest weight loss observed is a positive attribute of this system which is better than weight loss reports available elsewhere [32, 76]. For each weight loss event, a corresponding endothermic reaction is seen in the DTA plot which infers the thermal decomposition reaction at the corresponding thermal ranges.\nThe morphological and EDX investigations of pristine and α-MnO2/OLC composite are shown in Fig.\xa03a–q. One-dimensional α-MnO2 dominates the morphology of the composite matrix, whereas the pristine OLCs are amorphous and extremely small to resolve in the composite sample. Figure\xa03a–d indicates the dimensions of the nanorods and the distribution of the agglomerated grains. Figure\xa03a exhibits the layered/onion-like morphology of MnO2 sample, while it is imperative to understand that rod-shaped particles/grains of MnO2 resemble concentric structure morphology collectively. Also, EMD often exhibits rod-shaped morphology in MnO2 samples which has been widely reported, while similar petal-like structures is observed [77,78,79]. However, dimensional analysis indicates the assorted sizes all over the matrix of pristine (Fig.\xa03a, b) and doped samples (Fig.\xa03c, d) which can be ascribed to the synthesis conditions. However, to estimate the existence of carbon samples in the samples, HRTEM analysis was performed and owing to the smaller size, and the carbon samples are not viewed legibly. Still, the settlement of amorphous carbon powders surrounding the α-MnO2 nanorods can be seen through the shadow regions, in Fig.\xa03e, f. The SAED pattern further confirms the purity of the α-MnO2 sample with the characteristic d-spacing and miller indices. Finally, the elemental distribution is viewed through mapping process which reveals the existence of Mn, O, C elements alone as shown in Fig.\xa03n–q.\nThe BET findings (not shown) infer that α-MnO2 exhibits a surface area of 42.2 m2/g, pore volume of 0.118 cm3/g, and a pore size of 13\xa0nm. Conversely, OLC-included α-MnO2 displays a surface area of 45.4 m2/g, pore volume of 0.123 cm3/g, and a pore size of 11.9\xa0nm. Surface area of 22.5 m2/g and 12\xa0nm pore size has been reported for nanorod-shaped α-MnO2 elsewhere which indicates the similarity of present findings in pore size [80]. A similar finding has been reported elsewhere with a lower surface area [81]. Overall, EMD-processed α-MnO2 exhibits larger surface area, while this is further large in the OLC-included sample. Both types of α-MnO2 present suitable characteristics for Na- and Zn-ion batteries, providing moderate surface areas enabling ion adsorption and pore volumes facilitating ion diffusion. Larger surface area and pore volume of OLC/α-MnO2 could facilitate the ion migration across the electrode and potentially boost battery performance. For supercapacitors necessitating high surface areas and pore volumes, both α-MnO2 samples exhibit favorable traits and the higher surface area of OLC-included α-MnO2 particularly shows the better electrochemical performance. It is important to note that mesopores of both samples facilitates the smoother charge transport kinetics across the electrode during electrochemical reactions and this is further beneficial in the SCs where surface reactions occur.\n\nElectrochemistry analysis\nCyclic voltammogram of the α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite electrodes is shown in Fig.\xa04a, b for the initial ten cycles. The redox peaks are found to be stable within a voltage window of 1.0–4.3\xa0V vs. Na/Na+. The electrodes exhibit a pair of redox peaks corresponding to Na+ insertion and de-insertion in the α-MnO2 crystal structure: (1) between 2.5\xa0V and 1.5\xa0V; (2) between 2.6\xa0V and 3.5\xa0V. However, the peak potential values of composite electrode are found to show minute shifting compared to the pristine which is due to the addition of OLC. In addition to the minute peak shift, peak current values are also improved in the composite sample which should be marked to the OLC contribution alone [77].\nThe first cycle voltage profiles of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite electrodes, at 500\xa0mA\xa0g−1, are shown in Fig.\xa04c. The α-MnO2 nanorods and α-MnO2/OLC composite exemplify a discharge plateau from 3.2 to 3.8\xa0V and 2.6 to 3.75\xa0V, respectively. The wide plateau area of the α-MnO2/OLC composite than the pristine α-MnO2 attributed to the increased electrochemical performance of this sample after the addition of OLC. The initial charge/discharge capacities of 192/230 mAh g−1 and 245/266 mAh g−1 are obtained for α-MnO2 nanorod and α-MnO2/OLC composite electrodes, respectively. The cycling performance of α-MnO2 nanorod and α-MnO2/OLC composite (Fig.\xa04d) depicts a rapid capacity decay up to initial 20 cycles (shown in Fig.\xa04d inset) and attains stability after the 20 cycles and maintained up to 500 cycles. The intercalation/deintercalation reactions at the working electrode contribute to the phase/spatial changes in the electrode material which induces structural vibrations initially. After the stable interface layer formation on the electrode surface, the material exhibits smooth redox reactions [78] and the same is ensured here. This interface formation enables the improved contact area and efficient percolation of the electrolyte into the electrode material. The α-MnO2 nanorods exhibit an initial capacity of 230 mAh g−1 and drop to 109 mAh g−1 at the 100th cycle and slightly reduced to 92 mAh g−1, and the capacity is maintained up to 500 cycle, whereas α-MnO2/OLC composite displays an increased initial capacity of 266 mAh g−1 and then drops to 139 mAh g−1 at the 100th cycle and the same capacity is maintained up to the 500th cycles (139 mAh g−1). Compared to pristine α-MnO2, α-MnO2/OLC composite exhibits a higher capacity and better cycling stability and this behavior is related to the OLC in the composite electrode. The active structural rearrangements of the α-MnO2 sample after OLC addition benefit more number of cation intercalation and facilitate the electrical conductivity along with rate capability. The overall capacity retention is 45.3% and 66.5% for α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite electrodes, respectively, after 500 cycles.\nFigure\xa04e infers the rate performances of the pristine and composite samples at different current densities (50, 100, 200, 500, and 700\xa0mA\xa0g−1). Increasing the current density induces rapid electrochemical kinetics in the system under analysis which obviously lessens the output capacity of the electrode materials. Table 2 indicates the current density and relative discharge capacities of the α-MnO2 and composite samples. It is worth to emphasize that the composite sample was able to deliver a discharge capacity 137 mAh g−1 at a current density 700\xa0mA\xa0g−1 after undergoing the deep cycles of 500 numbers at a slow scan rate 50\xa0mA\xa0g−1. This behavior is commendable than the rate performance of the pristine material and other reported electrodes [77, 82,83,84,85,86,87].\nIn order to investigate the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the electrode, EIS tests were conducted at open-circuit potential, after 2 cycles and after aging at a charge (4.3\xa0V) and discharge (1.0 V) and the Nyquist plots of the α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite are given in Fig.\xa04f, g, and h. The Nyquist plots (Z’ vs. Z’’) of all the composites were fitted using an electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) given in the inset of Fig.\xa04i, in which the dots represent the experimental data and the lines denote the calculated data. The Nyquist plots of all compositions consist of one or two semicircles in the high-mid frequency region, represented by surface resistance due to the SEI contribution (Rf) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) followed by an inclined line in the low-frequency region, represented by Warburg impedance (Ws). The Rct value of the α-MnO2/OLC composite electrode is (849.4), which is significantly lower than the value of α-MnO2 (1043.2), indicating that the α-MnO2/OLC composite has a faster charge transfer process. The morphology of the OLC can contribute to the better electron conduction during charge and discharge, and it is true that the charge transfer process of α-MnO2/OLC has improved in comparison with α-MnO2. However, prolonged cycles throw different behaviors in impedance patterns of both the samples. It is obvious to decrease in the SEI-related impedances after a few numbers of cycling due to the stable interlayer formation. When the number of cycles is increased to larger units, due to the structural transformations, overall cell resistance increases [88] and the same holds true in the present electrodes, in Fig.\xa04g, h.\nThe CV pattern of the α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite\xa0(Fig. 5a, b) electrodes shows the two pair of redox peaks, while the pristine sample’s oxidation peak is broadened by accommodating two peaks. The voltage window of the CV profile fits within the working range of aqueous electrolyte, 1.0\xa0V to 1.9\xa0V vs. Zn/Zn2+. The most probable water dissociation peaks such as H2 generation or O2 evolution are not initiated in both the samples which indicate the controlled redox behavior of the both α-MnO2 samples. The OLC-included α-MnO2 electrode is well refined in redox peaks along with improved peak current values. Further, comparatively, peak area is increased in the composite sample which could actively impact the specific capacitance of this sample. The peak potential values are recorded between 1.5 and 1.6\xa0V for oxidation reaction, while the reduction reaction is found at 1.4 to 1.2\xa0V. Comparing the peak positions, a small shift in peak potential is observed for the composite sample toward the smaller peak separation, while the pristine sample shows comparatively larger peak separation. A distance of\u2009~\u200959\xa0mV between the redox peaks is claimed to be perfect reversible electrochemical system, while smaller deviations in this value show a quasi-reversibility. Compared to the pristine, α-MnO2/OLC composites show closer redox peaks between 1.54 and 1.22\xa0V which indicates the improved electrochemical stability of the system due to the carbon addition. OLC acts as a buffer matrix to stabilize the α-MnO2 from its structural disintegrations and metal dissolution reactions and thereby better charge transfer kinetics is recorded. The steps involved in the redox reactions of α-MnO2 electrode with the Zn-based fellow components can be found from our previous report and other publications [35, 89, 90].\nThe voltage profiles of the α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite electrodes are shown in Fig.\xa05c, d which indicates two distinct voltage plateaus. Comparatively, the OLC-included matrix shows two distinct stable/flat regions, while the pristine sample shows comparatively inconsistent specific capacitance values. Such a phenomenon can be related to the heterogeneous reduction reactions at the electrode which directly implies the improved electrochemical kinetics of the pristine on the addition of OLC in the matrix. The charge–discharge capacity values are calculated at 500\xa0mA\xa0g−1 for 400 cycles. The composite sample shows a discharge capacity of 376 mAh g−1 at the 100th cycle which is similar to our earlier reports on MnO2/CNT electrode for ZIB systems [35]. The total specific capacity of α-MnO2 is 189 mAh g−1 at 172 cycles, and the combined specific capacity of α-MnO2/OLC is 476 mAh g−1 at 400 cycles (Fig.\xa05e and the inset image), with the corresponding capacity retention of 77.5% and 100%, respectively. It is imperative to include a buffer component such as OLC in the MnO2 matrix which truly unveils the charge storing potential of the electrode along with improving the electrical conductivity of the host.\nThe rate performance of the pristine and composite electrodes for different current densities (ranging from 700\xa0mA\xa0g−1 to 1400\xa0mA\xa0g−1) is shown in Fig. 5f which exhibits a decreasing trend in discharge capacity values for higher current densities. Again, pristine sample exhibits less stability for higher current density values, whereas the OLC inclusion in the α-MnO2 greatly influences both the capacity and stability. Already, the presence of Mn2+ in the electrolyte solution is a boon in improving the chemical kinetics of the Zn-ion batteries by suppressing the metal dissolution on cycling. Introducing OLC becomes an add-on to improve the stability and electrical conductivity, and hence, rate capability is also well pronounced here. This discussion can be corroborated to the capacity vs. stability results of these two electrodes where α-MnO2/OLC is superior in terms of both the parameters of the scale. The present capacity values are higher than the similar reports on α-MnO2 for aqueous ZIBs [91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98]. The high surface area supplemented by the OLC to α-MnO2 electrode shortens the ion diffusion pathway [35, 99,100,101,102] which enables the electrode to accommodate more number of Zn2+ ions in its structure. Further, high surface area increases the contact area between the electrode–electrolyte regions and this increases the stability of the composite electrode along with the capacity. These results can be correlated with the flat discharge profiles of the composite electrode compared to the pristine α-MnO2. These findings can be validated by analyzing the electrochemical impedance behavior of the samples during cycling studies. Nyquist plot consists of semicircles (surface and charge transfer resistance), and diffusion regions (Warburg impedance) show significant changes in both the electrodes, in Fig.\xa05g. Equivalent circuit which theoretically fits into the experimental results of the α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC is given as inset in Fig.\xa05g. The surface film (Rf) and charge transfer (Rct) resistance for α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC materials were 100, 168 (±\u20095) Ω and 52, 78 (±\u20091) Ω, for open-circuit voltage, 74, 104 (±\u20095) Ω and 35, 46 (±\u20095) Ω for after aging, respectively. The lower resistance values should be related to the OLC in the composite matrix due to the improved surface area and interface kinetics. These results agree with the galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry results.\nFigure\xa06 compares the electrochemical performances (cyclic voltammograms, charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite investigated using two-electrode system (symmetric electrodes) in 1\xa0M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Figure\xa06a shows the CV obtained for the α-MnO2 symmetric electrodes at various scan rates, cycled between 0 and 0.8\xa0V, and the curves sustain a semi-rectangular shape, relating to less capacitive behavior. The CV curves of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite recorded at different scan rates (5, 10, 25, 35, 50, 75, and 100\xa0mV\xa0s−1) exemplified in Fig.\xa06b, c cycled between 0 and 0.9\xa0V, and notably both electrodes exhibit rectangular shapes, corresponding to an ideal capacitive behavior, which reported elsewhere [103, 104]. The new electrochemical reaction imposes capacitive behavior in the sample; however, Faradaic property is also valid for this electrode when tested against battery systems. To be clearer, the electrolyte solution for testing SC properties of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite is Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The ionic radius of the Na+ cations is larger than the tunnel dimension of the α-MnO2. This size difference induces the surface reactions of the electrode rather than the penetration, and hence, SC application of the α-MnO2 is validated.\nThe specific capacitance of α-MnO2 (from 694 F g−1 at 5\xa0mV\xa0s−1 to 655 F g−1 at 100\xa0mV\xa0s−1) is significantly lower than that of α-MnO2/OLC composite (from 792 F g−1 at 5\xa0mV\xa0s−1 to 773 F g−1 at 100\xa0mV\xa0s−1) [105,106,107,108,109]. The improved electrochemical performances of α-MnO2/OLC composite could be attributed to the α-MnO2 nanorods and OLC, which could serve as channels for high charge transport and improve the electrical conductivity of α-MnO2. The nearly isosceles triangle shape of the charge/discharge curves in Fig.\xa06d, e also proves this, indicating good columbic efficiency calculated as between 90 and 97%. In addition, α-MnO2/OLC composite shows large current density than pristine and demonstrated better electrochemical reversibility and faster electron transfer kinetics due to the unique nanorod structure and OLC contribution. The homogenous OLC coating on the surface of α-MnO2 matrix prevents the dissolution of the oxide in the electrolyte [105, 106] as revealed in the following equation,\nFigure\xa06d, e depicts the charge/discharge curves of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite at different current densities (0.3–10 A g−1). It is found that all the charge/discharge curves demonstrate ideal capacitive behavior, due to its isosceles triangle shape. At all the current densities investigated (Fig.\xa06f), the composite exhibited better electrochemical performance compared to the pristine, achieving remarkable a maximum reversible specific capacity of 150 F g−1 at the current density 10,000\xa0mA\xa0g−1. Figure\xa06g portrays the cycling behavior of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite cycled at a constant current density of 500\xa0mA\xa0g−1 for 5000 cycles. The initial specific capacitance of α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC composite is 148 and 220 F g−1, respectively. α-MnO2 exhibits a specific capacitance of 150 F g−1 for 300 cycles with the capacity retention of nearly 100%, and then, the specific capacitance was gradually decreased to 108.5 F g−1 at the end of the 5000 cycles. Interestingly, the α-MnO2/OLC composite exhibits significantly increased specific capacitance of 230 F g−1 up to 1500 cycles (100% of initial specific capacitance was retained) and then the capacitance was declining slightly with cycling and maintained 218 F g−1 at the end of the 5000 cycles. The α-MnO2/OLC composite exhibits enhanced and stable specific capacitance with the highest capacitance retention of 98.5%, while 68% for α-MnO2 over 5000 cycles. The improved electrochemical capacitance and stability of the α-MnO2/OLC composite electrode over pure α-MnO2 could be attributed to carbon-facilitated electronic conduction and synergistic effects between OLC and α-MnO2, indicating that the α-MnO2/OLC composites can satisfy the demands of both high capacity and long cycle lifetime. Moreover, the high value reflects the effective ion migration even at a higher speed which is influenced by high surface area of nanorod composite with minimum diffusion length of ion accessibility. The measured specific capacitance and extraordinarily high capacitance retention seem to be higher than what is reported in the literature [39, 110,111,112,113,114,115,116]. Moreover, OLC-added α-MnO2 could improve the electron transport, increase the intrinsic conductivity of pristine and stabilize the interlayer to inhibit the collapse of the structure, effectively.\nTo further understand the electrochemistry of the electrodes, EIS was carried out, the EIS curves of pristine and composite electrodes are illustrated in Fig.\xa06h, i and the fitted equivalent electronic circuit is shown in inset of Fig.\xa06h. The enlarged Nyquist plots (Fig.\xa06i) of the electrodes show an unapparent semicircle in the high-frequency region belongs to the charge transfer resistance between the electrolyte and electrode surface. The steep slope line in the low-frequency region attributes to the Warburg resistance associated with ion diffusion resistance from the electrolyte into the electrode. The high-frequency intercept with the X-axis represents the combination of equivalent series resistance, and the electrode intrinsic and electrolyte resistance (Rs). The α-MnO2/OLC composite exhibits unapparent semicircle with the smaller arc diameter than that of pristine, indicating that low faradaic resistance and reduced charge transfer resistance [116]. The Rs values for the α-MnO2/OLC composite are extremely low (Rs\u2009=\u20090.47 Ω and 0.39 Ω) when compared to pristine α-MnO2 (Rs\u2009=\u20092.2 Ω and 1.13 Ω) for before and after cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the charge transfer resistance of α-MnO2/OLC composite (Rct\u2009=\u20091.6 Ω and 1.1 Ω) is lower than that of pristine α-MnO2 (Rct\u2009=\u20094.2 Ω and 3.2 Ω). This result indicates that α-MnO2/OLC composite exhibits improved conductivity compared to that of pristine α-MnO2. This could be attributed to the α-MnO2 nanorods and the synergistic effect between high surface area OLC and α-MnO2. Overall key performance of pristine and composite α-MnO2 is compared in Table\xa03 for readers’ sake. These properties promote efficient electron and ion diffusion and transmission, resulting in higher rate capability at high current density.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The α-Mn2O3 was dispersed in 8\xa0M H2SO4 solution for 5\xa0h using a magnetic stirrer. Then, the above solution was transferred into microwave tubes and processed for 20\xa0min at 1000 W and 280\xa0°C, constant temperature. The resultant microwaved solution was centrifuged and washed with distilled water several times until removes all the impurities and dried for 24\xa0h at 80\xa0°C.\n\nPreparation method of OLC from nano-diamond and α-MnO2/OLC composite\nOLC was produced from nano-diamond powder with a purity of 99% (purchased from Gelon LIB Co. LTD, China). The nano-diamond powder was added in a closed-lid cylindrical graphite crucible (30\xa0mm in diameter and 20\xa0mm in height) and thermally annealed at 1780\xa0°C for 3\xa0h in a water-cooled high-temperature vacuum furnace. For preparing α-MnO2/OLC composite, α-MnO2 nanorods and the appropriate amount of OLC were dispersed in 40\xa0mL of ethanol and distilled water in a beaker. Then, the beaker was placed in an ultra-sonication and magnetic stirrer for 4\xa0h, after which samples were washed by centrifugation with copies amounts of de-ionized water. Finally, the resultant powder was heated at 80\xa0°C overnight to obtain α-MnO2/OLC composite.\n\nMaterials characterization and techniques\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out on a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD system (Shimadzu) with monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.6\xa0eV). Binding energies were calibrated using the containment carbon (C 1\xa0s at 284.6\xa0eV). The spectra analysis was performed with the XPS Peak 4.1 program, and a Shirley function was used to subtract the background. Powder X-ray diffraction data were obtained using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer system operating at λ\u2009=\u20090.15405\xa0nm as a radiation source operating at 40\xa0kV and 30\xa0mA with Cu-Kα radiation and scan range between 10 and 70°. Thermal behavior of the pristine and composite samples was tested through TG–DTA analysis in inert atmosphere using PerkinElmer TGA 4000 Thermogravimetric Analyzer. Scanning electron microscope was imaged using LEO 1525 field emission scanning microscope (FE-SEM) with an acceleration voltage of 2.00\xa0kV. The transmission electron microscopes (TEM) were carried out by using a JEOL HRJEM–2100 microscopy using LAB6 filament as an electron source. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) were recorded with an EDX system (Oxford Instruments) at 5 different positions. The chemical composition was calculated using the AZtec energy analysis software (Oxford Instruments). The BET (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) measurements were performed out using a Micromeritics TriStar II instrument.\n\nElectrochemical characterization techniques\nThe electrode fabrication for SIB and ZIBs is as follows: The slurry was prepared using the mixture of active materials (α-MnO2 nanorods and α-MnO2/OLC composite), conducting acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) as a polymer binder in the ratio of 75:15:10 wt% for SIB and 75:15:10 wt% for ZIB. The slurry was coated onto cleaned and polished aluminum foil/nickel foam disks as the current collector and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80\xa0°C for 24\xa0h for SIB/ZIBs. The coated aluminum foil (mass loading of the electrodes are 3–4\xa0mg) was then cut into circular disks and kept inside the glove box filled with argon gas. The coin cells for sodium-ion batteries were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (MBraun-O2, H2O\u2009<\u20090.5\xa0ppm), while the coin cells for ZIBs were fabricated outside at room temperature. The electrolyte of 1\xa0M NaClO4 in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of EC: PC for SIBs and 1\xa0M ZnSO4 with the additive of 0.1\xa0M MnSO4 in distilled water for ZIB is used.\nThe sodium metal foil/zinc plate can be used as a reference/counter electrode, and the Celgard 2300 polypropylene-based membrane/fiberglass filter separator is used for SIBs and ZIBs. The assembled coin cells were aged for 12\xa0h prior to the electrochemical measurements. The galvanostatic cycling performances of the compound were carried out by using a MACCOR series 4000 tester. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for fresh and cycled cells were analyzed by using a Bio-Logic VMP3 potentiostat/galvanostat controlled by EC-Lab v10.40 software.\nElectrochemical measurements were performed on conventional two-electrode (full or symmetric cell) system configurations with α-MnO2 nanorods and α-MnO2/OLC composite as working and reference electrodes, respectively, and 1\xa0M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The active electrode materials (α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC), carbon black (CB) (PRINTEX XE-2-B, Degussa) as a conducting agent, and polyvinylidene fluoride powder (PVDF) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a binder were mixed uniformly using a pestle and mortar in the weight ratios of 80:15:5. A few ml of N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (C5H9NO) (NMP) (Reagent Plus, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added as a wetting agent to produce a homogeneous slurry. For two-electrode symmetric cells, such as coin-type cells (CR 2032) or Swagelok cells (MTI, Inc., USA), the slurry was applied using a spatula to a Ni foam with a 16\xa0mm diameter that served as a current collector (Celmet: thickness\u2009=\u20091.6\xa0mm, and mass loading range of 2–4\xa0mg\xa0cm−2), and dried at 90\xa0°C in a vacuum oven for 12\xa0h. A glass microfiber filter (Whatman GF/F) was then used as a separator. Prior to use, the Ni foam was cleaned by sonicating it for 30\xa0min in a 1\xa0M HCl solution and then washing it thoroughly with distilled de-ionized water. The procedure was repeated twice, and the Ni foam was dried overnight in a vacuum oven. Prior to testing, the cell was allowed to equilibrate for 6\xa0h. The electrochemical performances of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (GCPL), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out at room temperature. The tests were carried out on a computer-controlled multi-channel potentiostat/galvanostat Bio-Logic VMP3 operated by EC-Lab v10.40 software. The CV tests were carried out at scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mVs−1. The GCPL tests were performed at current densities ranging from 3 to 10 A g−1. EIS measurements were performed in the frequency range of 100\xa0kHz to 10\xa0mHz at an open-circuit voltage with an AC voltage amplitude of 5\xa0mV, and data were analyzed using the Z-fit tool.\nThe electrochemical properties of specific capacitance, energy density, and power density were calculated from a galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curve according to the following equations. The specific capacitance (Csp), maximum power density (Pmax), and specific energy density (Esp) for the full cells (symmetric devices) were evaluated from the slope of the charge–discharge curves using\xa0Eqs.\xa0(1)–(4).\nwhere\xa0i\xa0(A) is the applied current, ΔV\xa0(V)/Δt\xa0(s) is the slope of the discharge curve and\xa0m\xa0(g) is the total mass of both electrodes,\xa0C\xa0(F) is the calculated capacitance,\xa0V\xa0(V) is the maximum voltage obtained during charge, and\xa0Rs\xa0is the equivalent series resistance (ESR) [64].\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The α-Mn2O3 was dispersed in 8\xa0M H2SO4 solution for 5\xa0h using a magnetic stirrer. Then, the above solution was transferred into microwave tubes and processed for 20\xa0min at 1000 W and 280\xa0°C, constant temperature. The resultant microwaved solution was centrifuged and washed with distilled water several times until removes all the impurities and dried for 24\xa0h at 80\xa0°C.\n\nPreparation method of OLC from nano-diamond and α-MnO2/OLC composite\nOLC was produced from nano-diamond powder with a purity of 99% (purchased from Gelon LIB Co. LTD, China). The nano-diamond powder was added in a closed-lid cylindrical graphite crucible (30\xa0mm in diameter and 20\xa0mm in height) and thermally annealed at 1780\xa0°C for 3\xa0h in a water-cooled high-temperature vacuum furnace. For preparing α-MnO2/OLC composite, α-MnO2 nanorods and the appropriate amount of OLC were dispersed in 40\xa0mL of ethanol and distilled water in a beaker. Then, the beaker was placed in an ultra-sonication and magnetic stirrer for 4\xa0h, after which samples were washed by centrifugation with copies amounts of de-ionized water. Finally, the resultant powder was heated at 80\xa0°C overnight to obtain α-MnO2/OLC composite.\n\nMaterials characterization and techniques\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out on a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD system (Shimadzu) with monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.6\xa0eV). Binding energies were calibrated using the containment carbon (C 1\xa0s at 284.6\xa0eV). The spectra analysis was performed with the XPS Peak 4.1 program, and a Shirley function was used to subtract the background. Powder X-ray diffraction data were obtained using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer system operating at λ\u2009=\u20090.15405\xa0nm as a radiation source operating at 40\xa0kV and 30\xa0mA with Cu-Kα radiation and scan range between 10 and 70°. Thermal behavior of the pristine and composite samples was tested through TG–DTA analysis in inert atmosphere using PerkinElmer TGA 4000 Thermogravimetric Analyzer. Scanning electron microscope was imaged using LEO 1525 field emission scanning microscope (FE-SEM) with an acceleration voltage of 2.00\xa0kV. The transmission electron microscopes (TEM) were carried out by using a JEOL HRJEM–2100 microscopy using LAB6 filament as an electron source. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) were recorded with an EDX system (Oxford Instruments) at 5 different positions. The chemical composition was calculated using the AZtec energy analysis software (Oxford Instruments). The BET (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) measurements were performed out using a Micromeritics TriStar II instrument.\n\nElectrochemical characterization techniques\nThe electrode fabrication for SIB and ZIBs is as follows: The slurry was prepared using the mixture of active materials (α-MnO2 nanorods and α-MnO2/OLC composite), conducting acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) as a polymer binder in the ratio of 75:15:10 wt% for SIB and 75:15:10 wt% for ZIB. The slurry was coated onto cleaned and polished aluminum foil/nickel foam disks as the current collector and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80\xa0°C for 24\xa0h for SIB/ZIBs. The coated aluminum foil (mass loading of the electrodes are 3–4\xa0mg) was then cut into circular disks and kept inside the glove box filled with argon gas. The coin cells for sodium-ion batteries were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (MBraun-O2, H2O\u2009<\u20090.5\xa0ppm), while the coin cells for ZIBs were fabricated outside at room temperature. The electrolyte of 1\xa0M NaClO4 in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of EC: PC for SIBs and 1\xa0M ZnSO4 with the additive of 0.1\xa0M MnSO4 in distilled water for ZIB is used.\nThe sodium metal foil/zinc plate can be used as a reference/counter electrode, and the Celgard 2300 polypropylene-based membrane/fiberglass filter separator is used for SIBs and ZIBs. The assembled coin cells were aged for 12\xa0h prior to the electrochemical measurements. The galvanostatic cycling performances of the compound were carried out by using a MACCOR series 4000 tester. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for fresh and cycled cells were analyzed by using a Bio-Logic VMP3 potentiostat/galvanostat controlled by EC-Lab v10.40 software.\nElectrochemical measurements were performed on conventional two-electrode (full or symmetric cell) system configurations with α-MnO2 nanorods and α-MnO2/OLC composite as working and reference electrodes, respectively, and 1\xa0M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The active electrode materials (α-MnO2 and α-MnO2/OLC), carbon black (CB) (PRINTEX XE-2-B, Degussa) as a conducting agent, and polyvinylidene fluoride powder (PVDF) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a binder were mixed uniformly using a pestle and mortar in the weight ratios of 80:15:5. A few ml of N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (C5H9NO) (NMP) (Reagent Plus, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added as a wetting agent to produce a homogeneous slurry. For two-electrode symmetric cells, such as coin-type cells (CR 2032) or Swagelok cells (MTI, Inc., USA), the slurry was applied using a spatula to a Ni foam with a 16\xa0mm diameter that served as a current collector (Celmet: thickness\u2009=\u20091.6\xa0mm, and mass loading range of 2–4\xa0mg\xa0cm−2), and dried at 90\xa0°C in a vacuum oven for 12\xa0h. A glass microfiber filter (Whatman GF/F) was then used as a separator. Prior to use, the Ni foam was cleaned by sonicating it for 30\xa0min in a 1\xa0M HCl solution and then washing it thoroughly with distilled de-ionized water. The procedure was repeated twice, and the Ni foam was dried overnight in a vacuum oven. Prior to testing, the cell was allowed to equilibrate for 6\xa0h. The electrochemical performances of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (GCPL), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out at room temperature. The tests were carried out on a computer-controlled multi-channel potentiostat/galvanostat Bio-Logic VMP3 operated by EC-Lab v10.40 software. The CV tests were carried out at scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mVs−1. The GCPL tests were performed at current densities ranging from 3 to 10 A g−1. EIS measurements were performed in the frequency range of 100\xa0kHz to 10\xa0mHz at an open-circuit voltage with an AC voltage amplitude of 5\xa0mV, and data were analyzed using the Z-fit tool.\nThe electrochemical properties of specific capacitance, energy density, and power density were calculated from a galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curve according to the following equations. The specific capacitance (Csp), maximum power density (Pmax), and specific energy density (Esp) for the full cells (symmetric devices) were evaluated from the slope of the charge–discharge curves using\xa0Eqs.\xa0(1)–(4).\nwhere\xa0i\xa0(A) is the applied current, ΔV\xa0(V)/Δt\xa0(s) is the slope of the discharge curve and\xa0m\xa0(g) is the total mass of both electrodes,\xa0C\xa0(F) is the calculated capacitance,\xa0V\xa0(V) is the maximum voltage obtained during charge, and\xa0Rs\xa0is the equivalent series resistance (ESR) [64].\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

As shown, the main diffraction peaks of pristine and modified NMO are both Na2Mn3O7 (space group \\(\\overline{{\\text{P}}} 1\\), PDF No. 78-0193), suggesting that the cladding layer has a limited effect on the material [19, 29, 30]. The characteristic peaks of Al2O3 are basically invisible on the XRD patterns in the modified NMO@Al2O3 samples, which may be due to the low content of Al2O3 or the amorphous phase of Al2O3. Nevertheless, with increasing Al2O3 coating content, part of the diffraction peaks of the XRD pattern (Fig. S1) became weaken. It presumably due to the crystallinity of the NMO material is disrupted by the Al2O3 coating.\nFigure\xa02a shows a SEM image of the synthesized 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3. As shown in Fig.\xa02a, the 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 sample shows an irregular granular distribution with particles clustered together and a uniform particle distribution. Furthermore, according to the EDS mapping analysis, the elements Na, Mn, O and Al (Fig.\xa02b) are uniformly distributed in 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3, indicating the successful formation of an Al2O3 coated structure. Figure\xa02c shows the TEM image of the 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 samples. As observed in Fig.\xa02c, a layer of about 5\xa0nm coating appeared on the surface of the NMO samples, which indicates that Al2O3 was successfully encapsulated on the surface of the NMO samples. The HRTEM in Fig.\xa02d shows a lattice spacing of 0.24\xa0nm, which corresponds to the (102) lattice of Na2Mn3O7 in the XRD pattern [19, 29, 30].\nFor a more detailed study of the structural transformation of the modified NMO material, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were performed on pristine NMO and 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3. Figure\xa03 shows the whole XPS spectra of two samples as well as high-resolution spectra of Al2p, Mn2p and O1s. As shown in Fig.\xa03a, the positions of the individual characteristic peaks of the two samples did not change significantly, which indicates that the coating treatment did not change their internal structures. From the Al2p spectra in Fig.\xa03b, it can be seen that the modified NMO surface is abundant in Al–O bonds [31, 32], indicating that Al2O3 was successfully coated on the NMO material. The peaks of 637.7 eV and 649.5 eV correspond to Mn2p3/2 and Mn2p1/2, respectively, as shown in the Mn2p spectrum (Fig.\xa03c). It indicates the presence of mixed valence states (+\u20093,\u2009+\u20094) of Mn in both samples. As seen in the O1s spectrum of Fig.\xa03d, the peak at the high binding energy (530.5 eV) is O–Na bond, and the two peaks at the low binding energy (525\xa0eV, 527.1\xa0eV) are O–Mn bonds. Additionally, the modified NMO material showed Al–O bonds at the binding energy of 528.8 eV, which further indicated that Al2O3 was successfully capped on the NMO material [31,32,33]. This is also supported by the Al2p spectra in Fig.\xa03b.\nIn order to investigate the effect of Al2O3 coated layer on the electrochemical performance of NMO, the electrochemical performance of NMO@Al2O3 was investigated using coin cells. Figure\xa04a shows the discharge capacities of pristine NMO and 2.5 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% NMO@Al2O3 at 50\xa0mA\xa0g−1 (0.3C) with potential window of 1.5–4.6 V upon 50 cycles. Pristine NMO and 2.5 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt% NMO@Al2O3 show initial discharge capacities of 103.4 mAh g−1 and 153.9 mAh g−1, 115mAh g−1,144.7 mAh g−1, respectively. As expected, the NMO samples with Al2O3 coating shows a smaller capacity decay. After 50 cycles, the capacity retention of pristine NMO, 2.5 wt% NMO@Al2O3, 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3, 10 wt% NMO@Al2O3 are 31.6%, 41.5%, 62.2% and 43.7% respectively. That indicates that the Al2O3 coated layer improves the structural stability of the material, resulting in superior capacity retention. Figure\xa04b shows the discharge capacities of four samples at the current densities of 0.1C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 4C, 2C, 1C, 0.5C, 0.1C. As shown in Fig.\xa04b, 5\xa0wt% NMO@Al2O3 exhibits a superior rate performance compared to other materials. Most importantly, a high discharge capacity of 117.9 mAh g−1 is maintained when the current density is returned to 0.1C. It is possible that the Al2O3 coating isolates the material from the electrolyte, enhancing the structural stability of the material and further improving its rate performance. Consequently, the 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 has more distinguished cycling stability in addition to superior rate performance compared to other materials.\nFigure\xa04c shows the charge/discharge curves of 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 at different cycles in 50 mA\xa0g−1 with the potential window 1.5–4.6\xa0V. As can be seen from the voltage plateaus in the charge/discharge curves, both pairs of voltage plateaus are apparent, suggesting that the Al2O3 coating effectively mitigates the complex phase transition during cycling and stabilises the material structure. The initial coulombic efficiencies of 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 is above 100%, indicating that the number of sodium ions embeded in the crystal structure during the first charge and discharge are less than the number of sodium ions de-embedded in the crystal structure. It also can be seen that the charge/discharge curves of the first cycle are rather extraordinary, which suggests that the structural evolution basically occurred in the first charge/discharge [28, 34]. This phenomenon is also reflected in the following CV test. Figure\xa04d shows the CV curves of 5\xa0wt% NMO@Al2O3 at a scan rate of 0.1\xa0mV\xa0s−1. Multiple redox peaks are observed from the CV curves. On the cathodic scan, two distinct oxidation peaks appear at potentials of 2.3\xa0V and 4.25\xa0V. On the anodic scan, the first reduction peaks appear at 2.03\xa0V and 4.17\xa0V. The peaks at 2.3/2.03\xa0V is associated with the redox reaction of Mn3+/Mn4+, and the peaks at 4.25/4.17\xa0V correspond to the oxygen redox reaction and associated phase transition [28, 34].\nThe kinetic mechanism of Na+ is an important parameter determining electrochemical performance. To investigate the kinetic mechanism of Na+, CV tests were performed on the cell at different sweep rates to calculate the diffusion coefficient of Na+, and CV curves were obtained for different sweep rates (Fig.\xa05a). The relationship between peak current and sweep rate can be described by the equation i\u2009=\u2009avb, where the value of b reflects the sodium insertion and deinsertion behavior [35]. When b\u2009=\u20090.5, the charging and discharging process is controlled by Na+ diffusion; when b\u2009=\u20091.0, the process is controlled by pseudocapacitance [23]. The linear relationship between log(i) and log(v) in 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 is obtained as shown in Fig.\xa05b. The b-values for the peaks O1, O2 and R1, R2 are 0.61, 0.63, 0.78, 0.87 respectively, which implies that the electrochemical process is controlled by a combination of capacitive behaviour and ionic diffusion. The diffusion coefficients of Na+ were further derived by plotting i and v1/2. As shown in Table\xa01, the DNa+ range of 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 is 9.72\u2009×\u200910−14\u2009~\u20091.69\u2009×\u200910−13 cm2\xa0s−1, while the NMO is 6.73\u2009×\u200910−14\u2009~\u20094.45\u2009×\u200910−13 cm2\xa0s−1. The difference between the roles is not much, they are both in the same order of magnitude. It indicates that the electrochemically inert cover layer has no great effect on the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions, which also isolates the reaction with the electrolyte, resulting in a more stable material structure. This result is also confirmed by the following electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results (shown in Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. S3, the impedance of the 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 has not changed markedly during cycling, once again demonstrating the excellent material structural stability.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

NaCH3COO·3H2O, Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O were mixed according to the stoichiometry by thorough grinding in a mortar and pestle for about 1\xa0h. The homogeneous powder was then sintered in a muffle furnace at 600\xa0°C for 4\xa0h under the air atmosphere to obtain a dark brown NMO sample.\nSynthesis of Al2O3-coated Na2Mn3O7 (NMO@Al2O3) Stoichiometric Al(NO3)3·8H2O was dissolved in ethanol and stirred for dissolution. The prepared material NMO was added to the above suspension and stirred to dissolve thoroughly to obtain mixture. The mixture was naturally evaporated from the ethanol and the sample was dried at 80\xa0°C for 12\xa0h. The dried sample was annealed in air at 500\xa0°C for 5\xa0h to obtain 2.5 wt% NMO@Al2O3, 5 wt% NMO@Al2O3 and 10 wt% NMO@Al2O3 were prepared according to the appeal method.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe crystal structures of the materials were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, XRD-6100). The XRD data (the 2θ range of 10° to 80°) was obtained with a scanning rate of 2° min−1. The morphology and the distribution of sample particles were observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6610). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200S G2) was used to observe the internal microstructure and the interplanar distance. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS, JSM-6610) was used to confirm the distribution of each element in samples. The valences of each element in materials were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS, AXIS SUPRA+) test.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical performance test was carried out in CR2032 coin cells. The working electrode was made from a mixture of active material, conductive agent (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder prepared in a 7:2:1 weight ratio. The mass loading was approximately 1.5\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. The reference electrode was sodium metal and the septum was glass fiber. The electrolyte was 1\xa0M NaClO4 dissolved in ethylene/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC, 1:1 by volume with 5% FEC). Electrochemical performance test were carried out in a CT2001A battery test apparatus (LAND electronics) over a voltage range of 1.5–4.6\xa0V.

The XRD results show that ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5 and ZF-8 in the hexagonal lamellar structures belong to the P2-type P63/mmc space group. All diffraction peaks correspond to the standard card PDF#54–0894 [27] and there are no impurities NaF (PDF#70–2508) and ZnO (PDF#21–1486), indicating that all F− and Zn2+ have entered the lattice interior with the material synthesized well. However, the local magnified pattern shows that with the increase of Zn2+ and F− doping content, the peak at 15.96° gradually shifts to a lower angle, which corresponds to the leftward shift of the crystalline plane of (002), symbolizing that the intergranular spacing c on the crystalline plane of (002) increases. The peaks at 27.33° and 28.35° are related to the Na+/vacancy ordering, which will increase the diffusion barrier of Na+. It disappears after Zn/F doping, demonstrating the effective suppression of Na+/vacancy ordering, which further promote the diffusion of alkali metal ions.\nThe XRD refinement profiles of materials are showed in Fig.\xa01b–e to better investigate the effect of Zn/F co-doping on the crystal structure of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 [26]. The Rw values of all samples are less than 6%, indicating that the refinement results are within the acceptable error range. Detailed lattice data of ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5, ZF-8 can be obtained from Rietveld refinement software GSAS II (Table\xa01), where the lattice parameters of the pristine material are a\u2009=\u2009b\u2009=\u20092.8826\xa0Å, c\u2009=\u200911.1516\xa0Å and V\u2009=\u200980.250 Å3, while those of ZF-5 are a\u2009=\u2009b\u2009=\u20092.8881\xa0Å, c\u2009=\u200911.1556\xa0Å and V\u2009=\u200980.585 Å3, with c increasing significantly after doping, which also coincides with the left shift of the (002) peak and indicates Zn2+/F− is indeed doped into the lattice. This may be related to the different ionic radius of F− (1.33\xa0Å), O2− (1.40\xa0Å), Ni2+ (0.69\xa0Å) and Zn2+ (0.74\xa0Å). And the strong electronegativity of F enhances the overall chemistry bonding on a local scale, which causes the transition metal layer to shrink and the alkali metal layer spacing to increase [28,29,30]. P2-type oxide cathode materials undergo O2−/On− redox reactions at voltages above 4.15\xa0V, which can result in the loss of lattice oxygen and lead to irreversible capacity decay [31]. The enhancement of the overall bonding will inhibit the escape of O, thus improving the reversibility of the anionic redox reaction [32]. Compared with ZF-0, Zn/F co-doped cathode materials have longer Na–O bonds, which weakens the electrostatic repulsion between O2− and favours the movement of Na+ [33]. Figure\xa01f shows the crystal structures schematic of the ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples with the corresponding Na and TMO2 layer spacing labelled, which based on the Rietveld refinement method. Where the transition metal layers (TMO2, TM\u2009=\u2009Ni, Mn, Zn) consist of a stack of TMO6 octahedra shared along the c-axis edges, the cubic density of oxygen is stacked as an AB-BA array, and Na+ is distributed at the trigonal positions between the TMO2 layers [34]. Compared to ZF-0, ZF-5 shows an increase in the spacing of the Na layers and a decrease in the spacing of the TMO2 layers, which would lower the diffusion barrier of Na+, improving the stability of the lamellar structure. This result is consistent with previous literature [35].\nThe microscopic morphology and structure of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 and Zn/F co-doped materials are investigated by FE-SEM. The carbonate precursor (Fig.S1) has a diameter of 2–4\xa0µm and is composed of a secondary spherical structure formed by several primary plates stacked according to a specific orientation.The formation of the special morphology can be attributed to the influence of solvent polarity on the crystallization process. Specifically, the preferential growth of certain crystal surfaces leads to the eventual development of the nano flower morphology [36].The rough surface of the precursor exposes a multitude of active sites, which facilitates the diffusion of sodium ions during the sodium mixing process and mitigates the formation of high or low sodium phases. Figure\xa02a shows the micromorphology of ZF-5 as secondary spherical particle aggregated from hexagonal lamellar primary particles with a particle size of about 3\xa0μm. As shown in Fig.S2, the pore size of ZF-5 is about 5.7\xa0nm. The specific porous structure forms due to the release of CO2 gas from the decomposition of carbonates during calcination, which alleviates the internal stresses generated by the volume change under high voltage, reducing the generation of cracks during charge/discharge and improving the structural stability. Meanwhile, the spherical shape has a short diffusion distance which can effectively promote the transport of sodium ions [37]. In addition, the small specific surface area also reduces the contact with the electrolyte, further inhibiting the surface side reactions.\nBy SEM–EDS energy spectrum analysis of the ZF-5 sample, the elemental distribution is shown in Fig.\xa02. It can be seen that the elements Na, Ni, Mn, Zn, F and O are uniformly distributed in the ZF-5 sample, indicating that the hydrothermal method is successful in preparing materials with homogeneous elemental distribution.\nTransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) further reveals the microstructure of the material, as shown in Fig.\xa03. The TEM (Fig.\xa03a) shows that ZF-0 has a clear dotted lattice stripe (the magnified image of the white frame is shown on the upper right) with a stripe spacing of 2.07\xa0Å, which corresponds to the (103) crystallographic plane in Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, demonstrating that the material is highly crystalline. The TEM images of the ZF-5 sample are shown in Fig.\xa03b–c, and the lattice stripe spacing is calculated to be 2.43\xa0Å, which corresponds to the P2-type (101) crystal plane, indicating that the material is well synthesized. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results (Fig.\xa03d) reveal that the lattice type of ZF-5 belongs to P63/mmc in the hexagonal system, which is consistent with the XRD results.\nIn order to confirm and investigate the influence of Zn/F co-doping on the elements’ chemical valence of the cathode materials, ZF-0 and ZF-5 are characterized by XPS and the results are shown in Fig.\xa04. The XPS patterns of Ni element in the two materials are shown in Fig.\xa04a where four different peaks can be observed. The binding energies of 854.35\xa0eV and 871.93\xa0eV belong to the characteristic peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, while the binding energies of 871.93\xa0eV and 861.03\xa0eV are the satellite peaks of Ni. And the characteristic peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 can be divided into those representing Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively, where the binding energies of 854.17 and 871.59\xa0eV represent Ni2+ and those of 855.44 and 872.67\xa0eV represent Ni3+[38, 39]. Figure\xa04b shows the Mn 2p spectra and the corresponding fitted curves for ZF-0 and ZF-5 where the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 characteristic peaks are split into four peaks belonging to the valence states of Mn3+ and Mn4+. Binding energies of 641.46 and 653.26\xa0eV are Mn3+ and those with binding energies of 642.64 and 654.25\xa0eV are Mn4+ [40]. Additionally, the proportions of Ni2+, Ni3+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ in ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples are calculated separately, as shown in Table\xa02. We learned that the Ni2+ content in ZF-0 is 59.86%, while the Ni2+ content in ZF-5 increases to 62.7%, and the content of Mn3+ increases from 36.01% to 38.30%. Compared to ZF-0, ZF-5 has higher Ni2+ and Mn3+ content, which may be due to the substitution of F− for O2− induces the transition of high valence ions (Ni3+, Mn4+) to lower oxidation states (Ni2+, Mn3+) through charge balance [21]. Figure\xa04c shows the Zn 2p spectra of the materials, in which ZF-0 does not contain Zn element, while ZF-5 has two characteristic peaks at 1020.78 and 1044.09\xa0eV, belonging to Zn 2p3/2. Figure\xa04d shows the F elemental spectrum of the material, where the peak with binding energy of 688.91\xa0eV corresponds to the F 1\xa0s orbital. The above XPS results indicate that Zn/F is successfully doped into the interior lattice and adjusts the valence states of Ni and Mn, changing the single redox centre of Ni2+, allowing more Mn3+ to participate in the redox reaction and increasing the specific capacity [41].\nTo investigate the electrode responses during charge/discharge before and after modification, CV tests are carried out on all samples in the range of 2.0 to 4.5\xa0V. As shown in Fig.\xa05a–d, there is a cyclic voltammetry curve containing four pairs of redox peaks. Among them, 2.0/2.5\xa0V corresponds to the Mn4+/Mn3+ reaction, in which there is no obvious peak intensity for ZF-0, but the peak intensity is gradually increasing with the increase of the doping content, indicating that more Mn3+ participates in the redox reaction. 3.40/3.23\xa0V corresponds to the Ni3+/Ni2+ reaction and 3.70/3.60\xa0V corresponds to the Ni4+/Ni3+ reaction. It is noteworthy that the ZF-0 redox peak splits into two peaks around 3.7\xa0V, which is a Na+/ vacancy ordering phenomenon, increasing the diffusion barrier of Na+ and hindering the diffusion of Na+. However, with the doping of Zn/F, the split two redox peaks merge into a single peak, which effectively inhibits the Na+/vacancy ordering. The peak with voltage above 4.15\xa0V correlates to the charge compensation of lattice oxygen, which overflows the lattice to transform gaseous oxygen, leading to an increase in repulsion between adjacent oxygen layers. Consequently, to reduce system energy, the transition metal layer slips, with an irreversible P2-O2 phase transition [42]. The peak is extremely sharp on the ZF-0 sample, while the redox peak intensity is decreasing with the increase of doping content, which indicates that Zn/F co-doping inhibits the redox reaction of O2−/On−, thus reducing the chance of lattice oxygen detachment from the lattice. Finally, the first three circles of ZF-5 have better overlapping curves with excellent reversibility.\nTo explain how Zn/F modification affects the electrochemical properties of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, the electrochemical properties of all samples are analysed in depth. Constant-current charge/discharge curves for the first three cycles at 0.1 C(1 C\u2009=\u2009190 mAh g−1) are shown in Fig.\xa06a–d. It can be seen from the results that the initial specific discharge capacities for ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5 and ZF-8 are 146.57, 132.49, 137.13 and 143.28 mAh g−1, respectively. The initial specific capacity decreases and then increases with the doping amount, which is due to the fact that the substitution of the inactive metal Zn for the active Ni reduces the active ions involved in the redox reaction. However, an increase in F doping induces the production of more reactive ions (Mn3+, Ni2+) in lower valence states to participate in the redox reaction, allowing more Na+ to be de/embedded from the Na layer [21]. Furthermore, multiple charge/discharge plateaus appeared in the charging/discharging curves of ZF-0, where the plateaus below 4.0\xa0V corresponded to Na+ de/embedding processes exhibiting complex Na+/vacancy ordering, and the long plateaus above 4.15\xa0V corresponded to the P2-O2 phase transition, which is the main reason for the irreversible capacity decay[42]. In contrast, the charge/discharge curve of the Zn/F doped material is smoother than that of ZF-0, showing a sloping solid solution curve. This is attributed to the fact that the larger Zn–O bonding inhibits the irreversible reaction of lattice oxygen and suppression of the Na+/vacancy ordering by F doping. This result is consistent with the above XRD and CV results. It is noteworthy that the reversibility of the material is rather better despite the increase in the proportion of Mn3+. Because of the larger radius of Zn2+ than Ni2+, the smaller radius of F− than O2−, introduced lattice strain inherently increase the asymmetry of the crystal field, changing the stress distribution inside the crystal to reduce the risk of structural distortion and optimizing the electronic structure to make the transport of electrons in the crystal more efficient. Meanwhile, the strong electronegativity of F enhances the interaction between the transition metal ions and anions, suppressing the Jahn–Teller aberration as well as the solvation of the transition metal ions.\nFigure\xa06e shows the cycling performance of all the samples at 1 C. The coulomb efficiency of all samples is close to 100% except the first circle. The initial discharge specific capacities of ZF-0, ZF-2, ZF-5 and ZF-8 electrode materials are 131.87 mAh g−1, 125.31 mAh g−1, 134.47 mAh g−1\xa0and 144.34 mAh g−1, respectively. After 100 cycles, the discharge specific capacities are 15.24 mAh g−1, 88.99 mAh g−1, 110.37 mAh g−1 and 102.53 mAh g−1, respectively. Capacity retention is 11.56%, 71.00%, 82.08% and 71.03% in that order, where ZF-5 exhibits a relatively high initial discharge capacity and excellent cycle performance. Even at a current density of 2C(Fig. S3), ZF-5 can still maintain initial discharge capacity of 111.24 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention rate of 61.36% after 200 cycles. This is due to the induced effect of F− which promotes the increase of Ni2+ and Mn3+ content, thus more active ions participate in the redox reaction and contribute to the specific capacity. Moreover, Zn/F co-doping enhances the structural stability of the material and reduces the diffusion barrier of Na+. Figure\xa06f shows the rate capability of all samples. We can see that ZF-5 has a better rate capability than ZF-0. The discharge capacities of ZF-0 samples at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C and 5C are 146.57 mAh g−1, 121.58 mAh g−1, 102.29 mAh g−1\xa0and 89.88 mAh g−1, 62.45 mAh g−1 and 45.43 mAh g−1, respectively, while ZF-5 are 130.68 mAh g-1, 131.93 mAh g-1, 128.04 mAh g-1, 121.29 mAh g-1, 108.18 mAh g-1 and 94.71 mAh g-1, respectively. The capacity of ZF-0 decays sharply with the increase of current density, and the discharge specific capacity of 5C is only 31.02% of 0.1C. In comparison, the discharge specific capacity of 5C is 72.47% of 0.1C. When reaches 0.1 C again, the discharge specific capacity of the ZF-0 sample is only 95.19 mAh g−1, while the ZF-5 sample even exceeds the initial discharge specific capacity. This can be attributed to the full activation of the active ions after several charge/discharge tests, which prompts more Na+ to participate in the electrode reaction. The Zn/F co-doping enlarges the layer spacing, which results in a more stable crystal structure with a better rate performance. As known from the energy band theory, the high spin state of Mn3+ produces Jahn–Teller distortion, which reduces the crystal symmetry and leads to severe structural collapse during charge/discharge, disrupting the interior structure. The interaction of the transition metal atoms mainly depends on the bonding energy and the occupation of the d orbital, where the enhancement of bonding energy triggers a strong electron delocalization phenomenon, leading to a decrease in the energy of the whole system [14, 43]. The strong electronegativity of F as well as the larger bond energy of Mn-F (423\xa0kJ\xa0mol−1) than Mn–O (402\xa0kJ\xa0mol−1) enhance the overall chemical bonding of the Mn–O/F bond in the local range, which suppresses the Jahn–Teller effect and enhances the electrochemical properties of ZF-5 [44]. In summary, it is shown that ZF-5 has excellent cycling and rate properties, which can be attributed to the fact that excessive Mn3+ will weaken electron delocalization with the destabilization of structure as the doping increases [45]. An appropriate amount of Zn/F doping can synergistically modify to optimize the electrochemical properties of the material and suppress the unfavourable P2-O2 phase transition.\nElectrochemical impedance tests (EIS) are performed on ZF-0 and ZF-5 in the frequency range of 0.1\xa0Hz–100\xa0kHz before and after 100 cycles of 1 C and the results are depicted in Fig.\xa07. Figure\xa07a, b show the fitted Nyquist plots of ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples before and after cycling. In general, the Nyquist plot consists of an x-axis intercept corresponding to the ohmic resistance (Rs), two semicircles corresponding to the interfacial resistance (Rf) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the high frequency range, and a diagonal line corresponding to the Warburg impedance (W) in the low frequency range [46]. Among them, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) related to the reversibility of the electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface is mainly involved in the electrochemical reactions, which is an important parameter to explain the electrochemical properties of the materials [47]. The fitting results are shown in Table\xa03. The Rs values of ZF-0 and ZF-5 are similar before cycling, but the Rs value of ZF-0 is higher after cycling. The Rf and Rct values of the two samples before and after cycling differ considerably, with 156.3 and 415.9 Ω for the ZF-0 sample before cycling, while those of the ZF-5 material are 246.9 and 255.7 Ω, respectively. After 100 cycles, the Rf and Rct increased to 279.7 and 757.4 Ω for the ZF-0 material, contrary to the 251.8 and 529.6 Ω for the ZF-5 material. The changes in Rf and Rct (ΔRf and ΔRct) before and after cycling of the ZF-5 sample are ΔRf\u2009=\u200942 Ω and ΔRct\u2009=\u2009292.3 Ω, respectively, which are smaller than ΔRf\u2009=\u2009123.4 Ω and ΔRct\u2009=\u2009341.5 Ω of ZF-0 sample. This suggests that Zn/F co-doping stabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, inhibits the growth of the SEI membrane, and improves the diffusion kinetics of Na+, which is in agreement with the results of the electrochemical tests.\nFurthermore, based on Eqs. 1 and 2, the sodium ion diffusion coefficients (DNa+) of the ZF-0 and ZF-5 samples after 100 cycles of 1C can be calculated.\nIn Eq.\xa0(1), R represents the gas constant, T for the absolute temperature, A for the cathode’s surface area, n for the number of transferred electrons, F for the Faraday constant, C for the concentration of Na+, σ for the Warburg's constant [48].\nwhere the value of σ can be calculated from Eq.\xa0(2):\nIn Eq.\xa0(2), Z' denotes the impedance and ω denotes the angular frequency. σ value is the slope of the straight line calculated from Eq.\xa0(2), and the calculated results are shown in Table\xa03. The DNa+ of ZF-5 is 1.04\u2009×\u200910–11\xa0cm\xa0s−1, which is higher than the sample of ZF-0 (DNa+\u2009=\u20092.58\u2009×\u200910–12\xa0cm\xa0s−1). The sodium ion diffusion coefficients of the modified samples increase, indicating that Zn/F co-doping can reduce the diffusion barrier of sodium ions, accelerate the sodium ion migration rate, and effectively improve the electrochemical properties.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, the stoichiometric ratio of (CH3COOH)2Mn⋅4H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), (CH3COOH)2Ni⋅4H2O (99.9%, Aladdin Industries Corporation) and (CH3COOH)2Zn⋅2H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were weighed and dissolved in deionized water and ethanol to create a homogenous 0.2\xa0M solution (total metal ion concentration). Then, urea (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added as a chelating agent, with a molar ratio of 4:1 between urea and transition metal ions. The mixture was stirred for 1\xa0h and transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave with PTFE liner for 12\xa0h at 200\xa0°C.\nThe synthesized precursor was dissolved in ethanol and mixed with NaF, Na2CO3 (99.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) in a molar ratio of 1:0.75(considering the loss of sodium, an excess of 5% sodium source). The solution was stirred in a water bath with heat at 35\xa0°C and and dried overnight in an oven. The powder was precalcined at 400\xa0°C for 5\xa0h in an air atmosphere, and held at 900\xa0°C for 12\xa0h. P2-Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O2-xFx (x\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.05, 0.08, abbreviated as ZF-2, ZF-5, ZF-8) cathode materials were obtained. Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (ZF-0) was prepared by the same process as described above.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe crystal structures of all samples were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Corporation) with Cu-Kα radiation (k\u2009=\u20091.5406 A°). XRD patterns were acquired in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. Rietveld refinement was performed using the GSAS II software to obtain crystal structure parameters of the synthesized samples [25, 26]. Brunauer Emmet Teller(BET, ASAP2460) was used to study the pore size distribution. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, TESCAN MIRA3) was used to observe the morphology of the materials, while energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Bruker Quantax) was used to observe the elemental distribution of the samples. The lattice fringes of the samples were observed using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, JEOL JEMF200). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) was used to study the elemental valence states on the surface of the material.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe active material, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and carbon black were uniformly mixed and dissolved in Nmethyl-2 pyrrolidone (NMP) at a mass ratio of 80:10:10. The prepared positive electrode slurry was homogeneously coated on aluminium foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 90\xa0°C for 10\xa0h. The mass loading of the active substance on the aluminium foil was 1.6–1.8\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. The electrodes were cut into circular pieces of 12\xa0mm diameter.

First, the stoichiometric ratio of (CH3COOH)2Mn⋅4H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), (CH3COOH)2Ni⋅4H2O (99.9%, Aladdin Industries Corporation) and (CH3COOH)2Zn⋅2H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were weighed and dissolved in deionized water and ethanol to create a homogenous 0.2\xa0M solution (total metal ion concentration). Then, urea (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added as a chelating agent, with a molar ratio of 4:1 between urea and transition metal ions. The mixture was stirred for 1\xa0h and transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave with PTFE liner for 12\xa0h at 200\xa0°C.\nThe synthesized precursor was dissolved in ethanol and mixed with NaF, Na2CO3 (99.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) in a molar ratio of 1:0.75(considering the loss of sodium, an excess of 5% sodium source). The solution was stirred in a water bath with heat at 35\xa0°C and and dried overnight in an oven. The powder was precalcined at 400\xa0°C for 5\xa0h in an air atmosphere, and held at 900\xa0°C for 12\xa0h. P2-Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O2-xFx (x\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.05, 0.08, abbreviated as ZF-2, ZF-5, ZF-8) cathode materials were obtained. Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (ZF-0) was prepared by the same process as described above.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe crystal structures of all samples were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Corporation) with Cu-Kα radiation (k\u2009=\u20091.5406 A°). XRD patterns were acquired in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. Rietveld refinement was performed using the GSAS II software to obtain crystal structure parameters of the synthesized samples [25, 26]. Brunauer Emmet Teller(BET, ASAP2460) was used to study the pore size distribution. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, TESCAN MIRA3) was used to observe the morphology of the materials, while energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Bruker Quantax) was used to observe the elemental distribution of the samples. The lattice fringes of the samples were observed using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, JEOL JEMF200). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) was used to study the elemental valence states on the surface of the material.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe active material, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and carbon black were uniformly mixed and dissolved in Nmethyl-2 pyrrolidone (NMP) at a mass ratio of 80:10:10.

First, the stoichiometric ratio of (CH3COOH)2Mn⋅4H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), (CH3COOH)2Ni⋅4H2O (99.9%, Aladdin Industries Corporation) and (CH3COOH)2Zn⋅2H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were weighed and dissolved in deionized water and ethanol to create a homogenous 0.2\xa0M solution (total metal ion concentration). Then, urea (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added as a chelating agent, with a molar ratio of 4:1 between urea and transition metal ions. The mixture was stirred for 1\xa0h and transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave with PTFE liner for 12\xa0h at 200\xa0°C.\nThe synthesized precursor was dissolved in ethanol and mixed with NaF, Na2CO3 (99.8%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) in a molar ratio of 1:0.75(considering the loss of sodium, an excess of 5% sodium source). The solution was stirred in a water bath with heat at 35\xa0°C and and dried overnight in an oven. The powder was precalcined at 400\xa0°C for 5\xa0h in an air atmosphere, and held at 900\xa0°C for 12\xa0h. P2-Na0.75Ni0.23Mn0.67Zn0.1O2-xFx (x\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.05, 0.08, abbreviated as ZF-2, ZF-5, ZF-8) cathode materials were obtained. Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (ZF-0) was prepared by the same process as described above.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe crystal structures of all samples were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Corporation) with Cu-Kα radiation (k\u2009=\u20091.5406 A°). XRD patterns were acquired in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. Rietveld refinement was performed using the GSAS II software to obtain crystal structure parameters of the synthesized samples [25, 26]. Brunauer Emmet Teller(BET, ASAP2460) was used to study the pore size distribution. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, TESCAN MIRA3) was used to observe the morphology of the materials, while energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Bruker Quantax) was used to observe the elemental distribution of the samples. The lattice fringes of the samples were observed using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, JEOL JEMF200). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) was used to study the elemental valence states on the surface of the material.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe active material, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and carbon black were uniformly mixed and dissolved in Nmethyl-2 pyrrolidone (NMP) at a mass ratio of 80:10:10. The prepared positive electrode slurry was homogeneously coated on aluminium foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 90\xa0°C for 10\xa0h. The mass loading of the active substance on the aluminium foil was 1.6–1.8\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. The electrodes were cut into circular pieces of 12\xa0mm diameter. Additionally, the CR2032 button batteries were assembled in an argon ambient glove box using sodium metal sheet as negative electrode, 1\xa0M NaClO4 dissolved in ethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate/methyl carbonate (EC/DEC/EMC, 1:1:1 by volume, 5% FEC additive) as electrolyte and glass fibre (GF/D, Whatman) as diaphragm. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed using a NEWARE battery test system (CT4008) at a voltage range of 2.0 to 4.5\xa0V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed at room temperature using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (A20654), with CV tests measured at a scan rate of 0.1\xa0mV\xa0s−1. EIS profiles were measured with an input signal amplitude of 5\xa0mV over the range of 0.01 to 105\xa0Hz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Both samples exhibit similar diffraction peaks, which can be indexed in the monoclinic system with the space group C2/c. To determine the crystal structure of these phosphates, the Rietveld refinement method implemented in the FullProf software was employed, using the crystallographic parameters of Na₂Mn₂Fe(PO₄)₃ as the starting model [21]. A pseudo-Voigt function was first used to model the diffraction peak shapes throughout the refinement process. Subsequently, scale factors, background coefficients, 2θ zero corrections, lattice parameters, peak widths, and shape parameters were refined to establish a solid baseline for the structural model. Positional parameters were then refined to ensure an accurate representation of the distribution of elements within the crystal lattice. Specifically, Na atoms were refined over the 4e/4b Wyckoff sites, while Mn/Ni/Fe cations and P were distributed across the 4e/8f sites. Oxygen atoms were refined at the 8f site. This systematic approach enabled a precise fit between the observed and calculated diffraction patterns, as illustrated in Fig. 2, providing critical insights into the strong agreement between the profiles. The observed peaks were correctly indexed, and no extra peaks were detected. This is further validated by the low reliability factors obtained from the refinement process. The estimated lattice parameters and unit cell volumes are summarized in Table 1. Notably, the results indicate that increasing the partial substitution of Mn2+ by Ni2+ in Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3 correlates with a decrease in lattice parameters. This trend is supported by the shift of the corresponding diffraction peaks toward higher Bragg angles, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The variation in lattice parameters can be attributed to the differences in ionic radii between Mn2+(0.83\u2009Å) and Ni2+(0.69\u2009Å) ions, resulting in a contraction of the unit cell.\nThe size of crystallites in both compositions was determined using the Scherrer formula. This calculation involved measuring the full width at half maximum and the Bragg position of the most intense peaks in the respective XRD patterns. The average crystallite sizes were estimated to be around 58\u2009nm and 51\u2009nm for Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3 and Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3 compounds, respectively. Despite the close proximity of these values, a notable difference is observed, with Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3 exhibiting a slightly smaller crystallite size. This trend can be attributed to its more compact unit cell arrangement compared to Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3.\nThe SEM images obtained from the polished pellets sintered at 850\u2009°C for 6\u2009h were examined, and the results are shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The morphology of both prepared samples was observed to be predominantly spherical, exhibiting a polydisperse diameter distribution, as highlighted by the grain size histograms presented in Fig. 3. The particle size was estimated using ImageJ software. For Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3, the particle size ranged from 0.4 to 2.8\u2009µm, with an average diameter of 1.34\u2009µm (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3 compound displayed a smaller average particle size of 1.16\u2009µm (Fig. 3b).\nThe observed variation in particle size can be attributed to both the unit cell volume and the size of the crystallites present in the samples. These factors are interconnected and have an influence on the overall distribution of grain sizes [22, 23]. The unit cell volume, determined through XRD analysis, provides valuable information about how atoms are arranged within the crystal lattice. When the unit cell volume is larger, there is more space available for grain growth, resulting in larger grain sizes. Conversely, a smaller unit cell volume restricts the growth of grains, leading to smaller grain sizes. Additionally, the size of the crystallites, calculated using the Scherrer formula, directly reflects the dimensions of the individual grains in the material. Larger crystallites indicate the presence of larger grains, while smaller crystallites suggest smaller grains. Hence, crystallites act as fundamental units for grain formation, and their dimensions play a significant role in shaping the overall distribution of grain sizes [24].\n\n3.2 Optical properties\nThe absorbance spectra of Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3 compounds measured by UV–vis spectroscopy between 250 and 800\u2009nm at ambient temperature, is presented in Fig. 4a. This first absorbance peak, observed at ~350\u2009nm for both samples (x\u2009=\u20090.6 and 1.6), corresponds to the electronic transition between the valence and the conduction band of Fe3+ in octahedral coordination (i.e., this transition involves the transfer of charge from oxygen (2p) orbitals to the 3d orbitals of Fe ions) [25, 26]. Furthermore, an extended and broad absorption region centered at 590\u2009nm for both compounds, is attributed to the absorption of Mn2+ transition metal, which contributes to the overall optical properties of the compounds [25]. Another prominent absorption peak appears in both spectra around 700\u2009nm, which could be assigned to Ni2+ transition metal absorption, indicating the involvement of Ni2+ electronic transitions in the material’s optical response [27]. Thus, it seems that the partial substitution of Mn2+ by Ni2+ ions leads to a reduction in the effective absorption that occurs upon excitation at 590\u2009nm. This reduction in absorption suggests a decrease in the release of electrons, which implies an increase in the band gap as a result of Ni substitution.\nThe following equation (Eq. 1) could be used to calculate the optical absorption coefficient (α) where A(λ) is the measured absorbance and d is the thickness of the sample:\nThe optical band gaps were estimated by fitting the Tauc plot, given by the following equation [28]:\nwhere A is a proportionality constant, h is Planck’s constant, Eg is the optical band gap, ν is the frequency, and n is the Tauc exponent, chosen depending on the type of transition (for direct allowed transitions, the Tauc exponent is typically chosen as n\u2009=\u20091/2, while for indirect allowed transitions, n is chosen as n\u2009=\u20092). The value of the band gaps could be determined through the extrapolation on the x-axis, of the linear part of the absorption coefficient, plotted as a function of the incident photon energy. In the present work the value n\u2009=\u20091/2 of a direct allowed transition was found to provide the best fit to a straight line, indicating that carriers migrate vertically from the top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band via the absorption of incident photons. According to Fig. 4b, the band gap values of the two compounds were determined to be 1.9 and 2.4\u2009eV, for nickel fractions of 0.6 and 1.6, respectively. These values are below the threshold of 3\u2009eV, indicating that both compounds exhibit semiconducting characteristics. The rise in band gap with Mn substitution by nickel can be attributed to the elimination of extra energy levels associated with the Mn2+ metal ion. As a result, the relatively small energy gap of 1.9\u2009eV is linked to the observed broad band absorption in Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3 sample and the appearance of an additional absorption peak of (O(2p) to Mn2+(3d)), as illustrated in Fig. 4a. This leads to the creation of a localized inter-band structure, playing a crucial role in reducing the band gap in the Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3 compound with a higher concentration of manganese.\nFigure 5a presents the powder transmittance spectra T(λ). It is evident that the range of 300\u2009nm to 400\u2009nm exhibits the lowest transmittance values. As the wavelength increases within the visible range (400–700\u2009nm), T(λ) gradually rises. Moreover, the magnitude of transmittance (T) demonstrates an upward trend with the increase in nickel content. This observation implies that the introduction of nickel has led to mitigation of crystal defects linked with manganese. As a result, the quantity of free charges capable of absorbing photons has decreased, leading to higher transmittance values.\nUrbach energy (EU) is another important parameter for characterizing disorder, linked to the impact of doping or substitution in a material. The Urbach energy provides a measure of the band tail width resulting from localized states within the band gap, which are associated with the disorder present in the material. By examining the relationship between the absorption coefficient (α), a constant (α0) and the photon energy (hν), it is possible to estimate the Urbach energy (EU) using the following equation [29]:\nThe typical method involves plotting the logarithm of the absorption coefficient (α) as a function of photon energy as shown in Fig. 5b. In this logarithmic plot, the tailing segment appears as a linear region, and the Urbach energy can be determined from the slope of this linear portion. The observed large Urbach energy value measured for the nickel fraction of 0.6 indicates a broader tailing region and a higher degree of disorder or localization within the band gap. Conversely, the lower value obtained for the nickel fraction of 1.6 suggests a narrower tailing region and fewer localized states. Consequently, the decrease of EU resulting from nickel substitution denotes a reduction in structural disorder. In addition, this decrease leads to a widening of the band gap due to the contraction of the band tails [30]. In other words, as the structural disorder decreases, the band tails become narrower, resulting in an overall increase in the band gap width (Fig. 4b).\nLastly, it is important to note that both structural disorder and localized states have determining effects on the conductivity of materials by impeding the movement of charge carriers or trapping them within the material. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize or mitigate these effects in order to enhance the conductivity and overall electrochemical performance of anode compounds.\n\n3.3 Electrical properties\nTo complement the present study, it would be valuable to determine the electrical properties of this Alluaudite composition. In this context, impedance spectroscopy was utilized to assess the ionic conductivity of these anode materials, as well as the contributions from the various microscopic elements such as intragrain, intergrain, and electrode effects. The impedance data are presented in a complex plane plot, with the imaginary part of the impedance (Z”) plotted against the real part (Z’) (see Fig. 6). However, no distinct semicircles were observed, indicating that the electrical relaxation processes related to grain and grain boundary effects are not clearly distinguishable.\nTo address this, an equivalent electrical circuit model was applied for data simulation using the ZView software. The model consisted of parallel combination of a resistance (Rt) and a constant-phase element (CPE), in series with another constant-phase element (CPEele), which more accurately reflects the behavior of the bulk material and the electrode effects. The estimated parameters of this equivalent circuit are shown in Table 2, and the validity of the fitting procedure was evaluated using the chi-squared (χ2) value, which shows good agreement with other studies on ceramics [31].\nThe CPE capacitance values ranged from 10−12 to 10−11\u2009F for bulk contributions, and from 10⁻⁹ to 10⁻⁸\u2009F for electrode-related effects, are aligning with typical capacitance values for these processes [32]. While the Rt values were used to calculate the ionic conductivity of each sample. Conductivities of 1.42\u2009×\u200910−8 and 3.34\u2009×\u200910−9 were obtained for the nickel rates of x\u2009=\u20090.6 and x\u2009=\u20091.6, respectively as shown in Table 2. This result reveals moderate ionic conductivity of the alkali metal ions (Na⁺) within the framework of both compounds. A small difference in conductivity between the samples can be more likely attributed to the structural changes induced by the varying nickel content. Specifically, the lower conductivity of the sample with x\u2009=\u20091.6 Ni compared to the x\u2009=\u20090.6 Ni sample indicates a reduction in the size of the conducting pathways that cations must traverse. This is supported by the fact that the unit cell contracts, leading to a decrease in volume from approximately 881.5\u2009Å3 to 857.1\u2009Å3 as the nickel content increases.\n\n3.4 Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis\nTo improve the electronic conductivity and enable the use of these compounds as anode materials, a carbon coating process was applied. Raman spectroscopy was employed for both pristine Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3 powders (Fig. 7a) and the Na2Mn2-xNixFe(PO4)3/C composite materials (Fig. 7b) for the characterization of the vibrational modes to confirm the Alluaudite structure and to verify the presence of the carbon coating.\nThe Raman spectra in (Fig. 7a) display all the characteristic modes associated with the Alluaudite-type framework, where the vibrational modes were assigned based on previous studies [20]. Two key regions were identified: (1) the bands located below 400\u2009cm−1, which correspond to the external lattice vibrations, and (2) the bands above 400\u2009cm−1, associated with internal vibrations of the PO₄ units. The symmetric (νs) and asymmetric (νas) stretching modes of isolated PO₄ tetrahedra were assigned to the bands between 900–1000\u2009cm−1 and 1000–1200\u2009cm−1, respectively. The band appearing at 540\u2009cm−1 is attributed to asymmetric bending (δas), while those between 425–460\u2009cm−1 were linked to symmetric bending (δs) of the PO₄ groups. Furthermore, bands at around 273\u2009cm−1 and 339\u2009cm−1 were attributed to the vibrational and translational movements of Ti⁴⁺ ions. In contrast, the spectra for the NMNP/C composite (Fig. 7b) exhibit two additional broad bands around 1348\u2009cm−1 and 1568\u2009cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands of carbon, respectively [33]. The graphitic peak (G-band) is linked to the E2g vibrational mode of C-C bond stretching, indicative of highly ordered carbon, while the disorder peak (D-band) corresponds to the A1g vibrational mode, which reflects symmetry disruptions and crystalline disorder. The ratio of ID/IG is used to evaluate the level of disorder in the carbon layer. For Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3/C, the ID/IG ratio of 0.83 suggests a highly disordered carbon structure. It is reported that a lower ID/IG ratio indicates a higher proportion of amorphous carbon within the composite [34].\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed between room temperature and 650\u2009°C to quantify the carbon content in the Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3/C composite materials (Fig. 8). The TGA results revealed two distinct regions of weight loss. The first, occurring below 400\u2009°C, corresponds primarily to the decomposition of residual organic solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone used during the coating process [35]. A second significant weight loss, observed between 400\u2009°C and 650\u2009°C, is attributed to the carbonization of residual organic materials, confirming the effective incorporation of carbon. The carbon content was determined to be approximately 8.7\u2009wt% for the composite with a nickel fraction of 0.6 (Fig. 8a) and 12.8\u2009wt% for the composite with a nickel fraction of 1.6 (Fig. 8b).\n\n3.5 Electrochemical properties\nTo perform electrochemical measurements, half-cells were tested within a potential range of 0.1–3.6\u2009V (vs. Na/Na+) at a current rate of C/5 as depicted in Fig. 9. During the initial discharge, specific capacities of 350\u2009mAh\u2009g−1 and 372\u2009mAh\u2009g−1 were obtained for the nickel ratios of x\u2009=\u20090.6 (Fig. 9a) and x\u2009=\u20091.6 (Fig. 9b), respectively. Such capacities indicate the storage of approximately seven sodium ions. This can be attributed to the reduction of transition metals to their metallic forms, as evidenced by the irreversible long plateaus observed at 0.6\u2009V and 0.9\u2009V, respectively for x\u2009=\u20090.6 and 1.6. Additionally, the low voltages during the initial discharge induced the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. However, during the subsequent charging cycles, the plateaus disappeared entirely, indicating that Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3 phases undergo structural changes during the initial electrochemical discharge. The first sodiation into the framework lead to an irreversible amorphization [36, 37]. Noting that a similar behavior has been reported during the sodiation-desodiation process of Na2Co2Cr(PO4)3, Na2Co2Fe(PO4)3, Na2FeNi2(PO4)3, and NaCoV2(PO4)3 [13, 37,38,39].\nTable 3 illustrates a comparative analysis of the electrochemical performance of various anode materials, highlighting the initial discharge capacities, which are significantly promising. These notable capacities are largely attributed to electrolyte decomposition due to the lower cutoff potential employed. However, it is important to note that a capacity loss is generally observed in subsequent cycles, indicating challenges related to structural stability during prolonged cycling due to the conversion reaction.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to assess the electrochemical characteristics and reaction mechanism of the two anodes. The differential galvanostatic profiles during the initial three cycles were recorded at a sweep rate of 0.05\u2009mV/s and are illustrated in Fig. 10. In the first cycle profile of Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3 depicted in Fig. 10a, two closely positioned peaks are observed at 0.12\u2009V and 0.24\u2009V. Whereas, the profile of Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3 shown in Fig. 10b, displays an overlap of peaks at 0.12\u2009V, 0.33\u2009V, and 0.68\u2009V. The prominent peaks observed in both samples, are probably associated with the reduction of iron, manganese, and nickel to their metallic forms. These reduction peaks align with the extended plateaus observed in the galvanostatic profiles presented in Fig. 9. Additionally, the minor peaks at 0.12\u2009V, located near the low cutoff potential in both samples, may be attributed to the electrolyte decomposition. This behavior was reported for phosphate-based alluaudite compounds, such as α-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 [13], Na1.5□0.5Mn1.5Fe1.5(PO4)3 [40], CoFeOPO4/C [34] and NaNiCr2(PO4)3 [36]. The broad overlapped peak in Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3, closely matches the generated capacity of 372\u2009mAh/g, in contrast to the sharp cathodic peak in Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3 which corresponds to a lower capacity value of 350\u2009mAh/g. This minor deviation might be attributed to an additional occurrence of electrolyte decomposition in Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3.\nDuring the first anodic scan of cyclic voltammetry, two broad oxidation peaks are located at 0.73\u2009V and 1.3\u2009V in Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3 (Fig. 10a), indicating the partial reoxidation of metallic transition metals. While the corresponding peaks are slightly shifted in Na2Mn0.4Ni1.6Fe(PO4)3 (Fig. 10b) occurring at 0.9\u2009V and 1.93\u2009V. This shift can be attributed to the altered ratio of Ni and Mn content in the two compounds. During the second discharge, a broad peak appeared around 0.6\u2009V in Na2Mn1.4Ni0.6Fe(PO4)3 compound. This peak can be attributed to the reduction of additional transition metals resulting from incomplete metallic reduction during the first discharge.\nGlobally, the nature of the redox peaks in the first cycle appears distinct when compared to the subsequent cycles. This difference arises from conversion reactions occurring during the initial sodiation process, wherein a breakdown of the crystal structure, formation of new species, and changes in oxidation states of transition metals takes place, resulting in capacity fade. However, it is noteworthy that these anode materials exhibit a low operating potential relative to Na/Na+, which is closely aligned with the standard graphite potential of 0.2\u2009V vs Li/Li+ [40]. This characteristic has the potential to significantly enhance the energy density. The potential of these anode materials can be fully realized, by addressing the capacity fade and exploring strategies to enhance the reversible specific capacity. Among these strategies, further investigations into the specific electrolyte composition and its influence on the electrochemical behavior could provide valuable insights for enhancing the overall performance and stability of these battery systems [20].\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The starting materials included Na2CO3 (I) (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (II) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Mn(CH3CO2)2·4H2O (III) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Ni(CH3CO2)2·4H2O (IV) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and NH4H2PO4 (V) (99%, Panreac - AppliChem). First, (I), (II), (III) and (IV) were dissolved and mixed in distilled water at room temperature. Then, (V) was added as the precipitating agent to the mixture and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7. The solution was stirred, followed by a slow evaporation at ~60\u2009°C. The resulting powder was progressively heated with intermittent regrinding at temperatures ranging from 200\u2009°C to 500\u2009°C in air, to expel organic components. Finally, the powders were calcined at 850\u2009°C for 24\u2009h.\nStructural analysis was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and morphological analysis via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, Raman spectroscopy was performed on both samples before and after coating to assess changes in their vibrational properties. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded in air at room temperature using a Panalytical diffractometer operating with CuKα radiations. Data were collected over a scanning range from 10° to 60° in 2-theta, with a step of 0.017°. Rietveld refinement was performed using the FullProf software. High mechanical strength pellets of ⁓2\u2009mm thickness and ⁓12\u2009mm diameter were obtained by a cold press and through a sintering process at 850\u2009°C for 6\u2009h, subsequently followed by performing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis using JSM IT500HR instrument and their grain sizes were obtained using ImageJ software. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy was performed on both samples before and after coating to evaluate changes in their vibrational properties with SENTERRA instrument in backscattering geometry using a wavelength λ\u2009=\u2009514.5\u2009nm. The optical and band-gap properties of Na2Mn2-xNixFe(PO4)3 were examined using UV–vis spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of the synthesized samples were acquired at room temperature using a LAMBDA™ 1050 UV/Visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). Measurements were performed in the wavelength range of 250 to 800\u2009nm.\nElectrical properties were analyzed on the sintered pellets, to carry out the measurement, both parallel surfaces of the pellet were polished than sputtered with a layer of silver. Agilent E4980A was used to perfom the measurement in the frequency range of 1\u2009kHz to 2\u2009MHz, and at 250\u2009°C providing the ionic conductivity associated to the motion of the Na+ alkali ions. In the course of electrochemical testing, the electronic conductivity of the synthesized samples was improved through a carbon coating process. The Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3 powder (85% wt) was mixed with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (15% wt) as carbon source. Initially, 0.176\u2009g of PEG was dissolved in 10\u2009ml of N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. Subsequently, 1\u2009g of Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3 powder was added to the PEG solution and stirred magnetically for 1\u2009h at 50\u2009°C. The resulting mixture was then dried in a conventional oven at 120\u2009°C to evaporate NMP, resulting in the formation of a carbon-coated Na2Mn2−xNixFe(PO4)3/C composite. Negative electrodes were prepared by preparing a slurry consisting of 75% wt. of the active material, 15% wt. of carbon black, and 10% wt of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine (NMP) served as the solvent. The obtained slurry was cast on Al foil as a current collector, dried at 100\u2009°C for 4\u2009h in a conventional oven, cut into disks of 10\u2009mm in diameter, and then dried overnight at 120\u2009°C under vacuum. The loading mass of the electrode materials was 5.8\u2009mg/cm2 for Na2Ni0.6Mn1.4(PO4)3 and 3.98\u2009mg/cm2 for Na2Ni1.6Mn0.4(PO4)3. Metallic sodium was used as the counter and reference electrode, and the electrolyte was composed of 1\u2009M NaPF6 salt dissolved in EC: DMC (1:1, vol%) solvent combination. Electrochemical cells were assembled using coin cell CR2032 models inside an argon-filled glove box (Mbraun, H2O and O2\u2009<\u20091 ppm).\nThe electrochemical behavior of the prepared materials as negative electrodes was studied through galvanostatic cycling technique at C/5 current rate within a potential window of 0.01–3.6\u2009V. Cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 0.05\u2009mV/s was conducted to explore the correlation between transition metal redox reactions within the framework and electrochemical performance.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The starting materials included Na2CO3 (I) (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (II) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Mn(CH3CO2)2·4H2O (III) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Ni(CH3CO2)2·4H2O (IV) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and NH4H2PO4 (V) (99%, Panreac - AppliChem). First, (I), (II), (III) and (IV) were dissolved and mixed in distilled water at room temperature. Then, (V) was added as the precipitating agent to the mixture and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7. The solution was stirred, followed by a slow evaporation at ~60\u2009°C. The resulting powder was progressively heated with intermittent regrinding at temperatures ranging from 200\u2009°C to 500\u2009°C in air, to expel organic components. Finally, the powders were calcined at 850\u2009°C for 24\u2009h.\nStructural analysis was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and morphological analysis via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, Raman spectroscopy was performed on both samples before and after coating to assess changes in their vibrational properties.

Highly packed nanoflakes are evident in these images. As can be distinguished in Fig.\xa02b, these nanostructures were grown on the surface of the Ti powder. It can be seen that the grown TiS2 has nanoflower shapes with around 30\xa0nm width and height of 2\xa0µm.\nTo better investigate the morphology and structure of as grown TiS2, TEM has been used (Fig.\xa02d). Formation of 2D nanoflakes is evident in this image. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset of TEM image reveals the single crystallinity of prepared TiS2 (Fig.\xa02d).\nDiffraction picks can be assigned to hexagonal TiS2 and elemental Ti. The electron dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis was carried out and depicted in Fig.\xa02e. The EDS results show there is no contamination in the obtained TiS2 product, and the atomic percent have a good agreement with TiS2 material.\nTo determine the conversion rate of Ti to TiS2, the prepared sample was gently sonicated. Using this process, the TiS2 nanoflakes were exfoliated from the surface of the sample and dispersed in the solution which was also recognizable by changing the color of solution. Next, the sample was washed, rinsed, and weighted. This process was repeated for several times until almost all of the TiS2 flakes were removed from the sample. The SEM and EDS analyses have been used in each step to monitor the presence of TiS2 in the sample. The washing of the sample was continued until the amount of S content (related to TiS2) was negligible in the sample (for example, if it reached to atomic percent of below 2%).\nFigure\xa02f depicts the XRD pattern of the synthesized TiS2 nanosheets. It does not show any impurity phase in the material. TiS2 diffraction peaks are evident in the XRD result, while some Ti peaks are also present related to the Ti powder below the formed TiS2 nanosheets on the surface that has not been converted to TiS2.\nFigure\xa02g depicts Raman spectroscopy of the prepared TiS2 nanostructures which shows typical characteristic picks of Eg and A1g for TiS2 at\u2009~\u2009234 and\u2009~\u2009335\xa0cm−1, respectively, again confirming the growth of TiS2. As seen, a great peak at 340 is observed, corresponding to out-of-plane vibrations. In addition, the Eg peak, which corresponds to in-plane vibrations, is small. Indicating a rather thicker film, consisting of a few layers of TiS2.\nThe electrochemical behavior of half-cell sodium-ion battery fabricated by prepared TiS2 electrode was illustrated in Fig.\xa03. Figure\xa03a shows the specific capacity and coulombic efficiency. It can be observed that a specific capacity of 114 mAhg−1 at a current density of 66.6 mAg−1 (second cycle) has been obtained. It has also demonstrated a reversible discharge capacity of 106 mAhg−1 with coulombic efficiency of 99% after 100 cycles which demonstrates its great cyclability. Also, it can be seen that the initial coulombic efficiency is low which can be due to irreversible reactions related to the formation of the SEI layer. As the battery undergoes more charge/discharge cycles, the SEI layer thickness gradually increases and reaches its maximum thickness resulting in the increase in the coulombic efficiency after a few cycles (Fig.\xa03a). According to the obtained results, the fabricated battery has high capacity retention and only lost 7% of its capacity after 100 cycles (compared to the 2nd cycle).\nVoltage profile at some selected cycles are collected in Fig.\xa03b. It can be seen that the profiles are very close to each other, showing the good stability of the battery during cycling. To better investigate the electrochemical behavior of the TiS2 electrode in SIB, cyclic voltammetry (CV) test has been performed in the potential window 0 of 3\xa0V, with a scan rate of 0.8\xa0mV/s, and the result is depicted in Fig.\xa03c. Three anodic peaks at around 0.8, 1.7, and 2.4\xa0V are evident in the CV diagrams, which can be related to the reversible insertion/extraction of sodium ions inside the TiS2 structure [10]. These peaks can correspond to the evolution of high-stage intercalation of Na in the TiS2 structure [20]. In addition, in the CV diagrams, the shape and amount of the peaks in the different test cycles in Fig.\xa03b show very good matching, which can be an evidence of good stability of the synthesized TiS2 nanostructures during sodiation and desodiation processes. Figure\xa03d presents the rate capability analysis of the fabricated cell. As shown in the image, when charge/discharge current was increased, the specific capacity decreased gradually. Averagely, it delivers 92% of its initial capacity as the current rate returned to its initial state once again, which shows the excellent rate capability behavior of the fabricated TiS2-based battery.\nAs shown in Fig.\xa04, the integral area of the CV curves increases by increasing the scan rate. It is expected that the peak current shows a linear dependence to square root of the scan rate while the scan rate is slower than diffusion of Na to active material [34]. As it is depicted in Fig.\xa04b, the peak current has linear dependence to the square root of the scan rates which shows that the reaction was diffusion controlled according to Randles–Sevcik equation [34,35,36]. Using the power law (i\u2009=\u2009vb), we can determine the capacitive (non-faradic) current or diffusion-controlled (faradic) portion of the current (b\u2009=\u20090.5 for total diffusion-controlled current and b\u2009=\u20091 for total capacitive-controlled current) [37, 38]. Figure\xa04c depicts the peak current logarithm vs scan rate logarithm; hence, the slope of the curve determines the b parameter in power law which is 0.51 for our sample that indicates the current is almost a diffusion-controlled current.\nTo determine the effect of charge and discharge on the morphology of the sample, the SEM examination has been performed on the electrode, before and after cycling. It is obvious in Fig.\xa05 that the more the electrodes endure the charge and discharge cycles, the less porosity remains in the sample, which can hurdle the ion diffusion toward the active material. The related SEM images can be seen below:\nThe present results are briefly compared to the other reports on SIBs with TiS2-based electrode materials in Table 1, confirming the potential of the synthesized TiS2 nanoflakes as a high-performance SIB cathode material.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Its schematic presentation is depicted in Fig.\xa01a. The CVD furnace consists of a quartz tube with two heating zones. The first zone is designed for the sublimation of sulfur, while the second zone or hot zone is the place for the growth of TiS2 nanoflakes. The chemical reaction occurs in this latter zone.\nAs can be seen in Fig.\xa01, two vacuum paths were designed to be connected to the quartz tube: the main vacuum path and the bypass vacuum path. The flow of argon gas, which is used as an inert gas to carry sulfur vapor, is adjusted by a mass flow controller.\n\nSynthesis of TiS2 nanoflakes\nTen grams of titanium powder with 99.5% purity and a maximum particle size of 150 microns purchased from Goodfellow company was poured into the boat and placed into the hot zone. Ten grams of sulfur powder with 99.9% purity purchased from Merk was poured into the Erlenmeyer flask and placed in the sublimation zone. Then the furnace pressure was reduced to 0.02\xa0torr by the main vacuum path. Consequently, Ar gas was injected into the chamber with a flow rate of 12 SCCM. The hot zone temperature was adjusted to 650\xa0°C with an increasing temperature rate of 100\xa0°C/min. Also, the sublimation zone temperature was adjusted to 210\xa0°C with a 60\xa0°C/min rate. Afterward, the vacuum path was changed to bypass to reduce the sulfur vaporization rate. When the pressure was reduced to 0.5\xa0Torr, which is found to be suitable pressure for nanoflakes growth, the sulfur began to melt and vaporized gradually. This process was continued for 30\xa0min. After the growth process, the heaters of both zones were turned off and the chamber was cooled with a cooling fan. At 60\xa0°C, the boat was taken off from the furnace. In this CVD method, Ti powder particles were utilized to interact with sulfur vapor during theCVD process and obtain highly packed thin TiS2 nanoflakes down to 26\xa0nm with a unique morphology. The growth procedure was stopped before consuming all the mass of titanium particles, in order to support a proper electrical pathway toward the TiS2 active materials. Elemental precursors were used to increase the purity of products. To the best of our knowledge, this type of thin, high aspect ratio (1:100), highly dense sinuous textured TiS2 nanoflakes has not been reported before (Fig.\xa02a–c). The yield of this TiS2 nanostructure growth was approximately 0.2\xa0mg/min. Details of yield calculation are described in the supporting information.\n\nMaterial characterization\nField emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed by Hitachi S4160 FESEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were acquired by Philips CM300 Transmission Electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on Philips PW1730 X-ray diffractor at a step size of 0.05° per second and X-ray wavelength of 1.54056 A. Finally, EDAX (Ametek) device has been used for further investigation of the synthesized material.\n\nElectrochemical measurement\n\nGalvanometric charge/discharge test was performed to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the TiS2 electrode. Working electrode was prepared by mixing TiS2 active material, carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in an 8:1:1 weight ratio. The mixture was stirred overnight. The resulted homogenous slurry was consequently uniformly coated onto Al foil using the doctor blade technique. The coated foil was then dried in an 80\xa0°C vacuum oven for 24\xa0h. The prepared TiS2 electrode and the metal sodium electrode were used to assemble the stainless-steel CR 2032 coin cell in an Ar-filled glovebox. Whatman glass-fiber membrane was implemented between the two electrodes as the separator. 1\xa0M NaClo4 in 1:1 v/v ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) was implemented as the electrolyte.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

To enhance the electrochemical performance of the anatase TiO2 used in SIB, the polydopamine (PDA) was applied as carbon source to coat metatitanic acid, and the corresponding carbon-coated anatase TiO2 (TiO2@C) was obtained by pyrolysis the PDA-coated metatitanic acid at 550°C under the argon atmosphere (Fig. 1).\nThe morphology and microstructure of the obtained anatase TiO2 and TiO2@C were characterized by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As seen, the SEM image in Fig.\xa02a, TiO2 sample maintains the original morphology of metatitanic acid (Fig. S1, see the supplementary information). Figure 2b shows the TiO2@C sample after carbon coating, where the scattered smaller nanoparticles disappeared. For sample TiO2@C, the agglomerate ranges from tens of nanometers to one micron with the continuous carbon-coated layer. Compared with carbon coated on every single nanoparticle, the continuing carbon-coated layer could provide the consecutive electron transport channels [30]. The presence of coated carbon layer can improve the electronic conductivity of TiO2@C material and enable volume change buffering during the charge-discharge process, thus increasing the capacity and cycle stability of TiO2@C anode. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of TiO2 sample in Fig. 2c clearly shows the TiO2 anatase crystal lattice with (101) planes and a d-spacing of 3.47\xa0Å. While for sample of TiO2@C, the thickness of the carbon layer is about 2–3 nm (Fig. 2d). The content of carbon in the TiO2@C measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is ca. 17 wt% (Fig. S2).\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 3a) confirm that two samples are of the anatase TiO2 nanocrystals (JCPDS No. 21-1272). In addition, a peak at about 27° can be observed in XRD pattern of TiO2 and TiO2@C corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of rutile TiO2, and the intensity decrease in TiO2@C when carbon is introduced because of The phase transformation from anatase TiO2 to rutile TiO2 needs the oxygenated environment, while after carbon coating, the reduction environment of carbon layer should block the phase transformation of anatase TiO2 to rutile TiO2. Based on the XRD data, the average particle size of TiO2 nanoparticles of TiO2@C and TiO2 was calculated to be about 9.1 nm and 13.1 nm, and the corresponding microstrain was 0.11% and 0.15%, respectively (detailed calculation process was shown in the supplementary information). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to probe the elements and corresponding valence state in the TiO2 and TiO2@C nanocomposite. As seen in the XPS survey spectra in Fig. 3b, there are distinct C 1s and N 1s peaks in the TiO2@C sample, while the slight C 1s peak of TiO2 should come from the polluted carbon. The peaks centered at 458.7 and 464.3 eV of TiO2 and TiO2@C (Fig. 3c) can be attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. Furthermore, the fitting of the O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d) comprises the main peak at 529.9 eV and an additional broader peak deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 531.6 eV and 533.3 eV, corresponding to the Ti-O bond, the oxygen vacancies and oxygen adsorbed at\xa0surface of samples, respectively. It is obvious that TiO2@C processes a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies than that of TiO2. The XPS results indicate that using carbon-coated treatment can facilitate the formation of surface defects. The existence of crystal defects such as oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ is beneficial for obtaining superior electronic conductivities and surface Na-ion storage [31, 32], thus augmenting the electrochemical performance of SIB.\nAs for TiO2@C, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 3e) stems from the surface carbon layer of material, that the dominating peak deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 284.7 and 285.7 eV respectively corresponded to the C-C and C-O bonds, while the subordinate peak at 289.1 eV is vested in C=O bond. Moreover, the XPS result shows up to 5.7 at% of N doped into the TiO2@C, which is a result of the decomposition of amino group of polydopamine during the pyrolysis process. In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s (Fig. 3f), three peaks appear at 398.5, 399.7 and 400.5 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, respectively. It is also possible that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms can create carbon defects in the TiO2@C matrix, which acts as an additional active site to store sodium ions. Also, the three configurations of N can effectively increase the electrical conductivity of carbon materials [33, 34].\nTo demonstrate the excellent physical properties of the obtained samples and reveal the potential for application in SIB, the TiO2 and TiO2@C samples were assembled into half-cell to test the rate and cycling performances. Firstly, ether-based electrolyte was applied to investigate the electrochemical performance of the assembled cells. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was performed to study the electrode reaction process and reversibility of cell during charge-discharge cycle. Figure 4a and b shows the initial three CV curves of sample TiO2 and TiO2@C. As for TiO2 sample, two reduction peaks from the initial CV curve can be seen, among which the peak at about 0.6 V involves the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+\xa0[35], and another peak at the voltage of ~0.1 V involves the conversion of Ti3+ to sodium intercalation compound and then to metallic Ti0 [36, 37]. However, the current of the oxidation peak at ca. 0.1 V is lower than the current of reduction peak due to the fact that part of the conversion reaction is irreversible in the initial discharge. While for sample of TiO2@C, a strong reduction peak of ca. 0.2 V was observed from the first CV cycle, which can be ascribed to the abundant Na ions insertion into the internal layers and/or adsorption on the surface of the carbon layer and form the solid electrolyte interface film (SEI) on the electrode surface during first discharge, which is a distinct difference from the first CV curve of TiO2. The CV curves of the second and third cycles are close to overlap, which represents the excellent reversibility of TiO2@C electrodes. Two voltage plateaus can be clearly seen in the discharge curve of the initial cycle within two samples (Fig. S3), respectively corresponding to the reduction of Ti4+ and the formation of the SEI and the sodium intercalation compound.\nFigure 4c shows the rate performance of TiO2 and TiO2@C samples within ether-based electrolyte, measured at current densities ranging from 0.1 to 5 A g−1. The discharge specific capacity of TiO2@C is higher than the TiO2 sample throughout the test, especially at smaller current densities. During the initial discharge progress at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, TiO2@C delivers the capacity of 630 mA h g−1 while TiO2 only shows 267 mA h g−1, after ten cycles, the capacity of 330 mA h g−1 has been remained in sample of TiO2@C, nearly twice the capacity of TiO2. The capacity attenuation comes from the irreversible consumption of sodium ions by the SEI film formed on the electrode surface in the early cycle process and the consumption of electrolyte during charge/discharge progress [38, 39]. When the current densities reach 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, TiO2@C and TiO2 deliver the average capacity of 290, 217, 150, 100, 60 mA h g−1 and 147, 110, 83, 56, 26 mA h g−1, respectively. When the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, the discharge capacities of the two samples can all recover to the value of the tenth circle, indicating the favorable reversibility.\nCycling performance was afterward tested to investigate the lifetime of the two samples. As seen in Fig. 4d, the TiO2@C and TiO2 samples remain in a relatively stable state with capacity of 270 mA h g−1 and 150 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively. In order to further test the tolerance of TiO2@C and TiO2 at high current rate, galvanostatic charge-discharge test was conducted at a current density of 2 A g−1. It can be observed from Fig. 4e that the synthesized TiO2@C material has good cycle stability, which still maintains the capacity of 90 mA h g−1 after 2600 cycles with a Coulombic Efficiency of nearly 100%, while TiO2 holds a capacity of 40 mA h g−1, significantly lower than that of TiO2@C.\nThe CV tests with different scan rates from 0.2 to 0.6 mV s−1 were performed to study the diffusion performance of Na ions. The CV curves of the two samples at different scan rates (Fig. 5a and d) have similar shapes, and show minor polarization between Na ions insertion and extraction. The log (scan rate)-log (peak current) plots and corresponding b-values are shown in Fig. 5b and e, demonstrating that in both samples the Na ions insertion and extraction processes are a combination of capacitance and diffusion (b-value of 0.5 indicates a total diffusion-controlled behavior, whereas 1.0 indicates a capacitive process).\nCompared with TiO2 (Fig. 5e), TiO2@C electrode (Fig. 5b) shows a better reversibility by comparing the overlap ratio of the fitted linear line, because the anode and cathode peaks have approximately equal currents. At a certain scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1, the contribution of the capacitive current in the total measured current is evaluated, as shown in Fig. 5c, of which 75.2% is quantified as the capacitance current. As the scan rate increases from 0.2 to 0.6 mV s−1 (Fig. 5f), the capacitive contribution ratios exhibit progressively that increased from 75.2 to 86.3% in TiO2@C anode, while the capacitive contribution of TiO2 only from 74.1 to 83.9%. The desirable pseudocapacitive behavior can be attributed to the N-doped carbon layer, which provides convenient charge-transfer pathways for ultrafast and long-term cyclability.\nThe galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test (Fig. 6a) was conducted on the charge and discharge processes to further explore the Na-ion diffusion kinetics of TiO2@C and TiO2 electrodes. The diffusion coefficient of Na ions in each step of the titration curve during discharge and charge processes were calculated (detailed calculation process was shown in the supplementary information) and illustrated. As shown in Fig. 6a, TiO2@C shows the smaller polarization than TiO2 in each step of the titration curve during discharge and charge processes. The diffusion coefficient of Na-ions at Na ions insertion was calculated and the results were shown in Fig. 6b, the average diffusion coefficient (DNa+) of TiO2@C is 1.778 × 10−12 m2 s−1 significantly higher than that of TiO2 (1.061 × 10−12 m2 s−1), indicating that TiO2@C has a faster Na-ion diffusion capability.\nFurthermore, it can be observed that the diffusion rate of Na ions in TiO2 anode begins to decline at 30% state of the charge (SOC), reaches the lowest point at 58% SOC, and then rises to the initial level, which is corresponding to the voltage plateau dominated by the faradaic reaction in the discharge curve. Instead, the TiO2@C can significantly alleviate this decline process, indicating that the carbon coating processing on TiO2 surface can greatly enhance the diffusion rate of Na ions, and finally result in an excellent electrochemical performance of SIB. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement of the TiO2@C and TiO2 electrode was measured to get further details of the Na ions insertion kinetics. By analyzing the Nyquist plot and fitted equivalent circuit, an overlapped semi-circle at high and medium frequencies is characteristic of ion migration through the surface layer (sl) and the charge transfer (ct) through the electrode-electrolyte interface, and a sloping line at low frequencies is characteristic of Warburg element (W) dominant ion diffusion in SIB. Rel is the ohmic drop at the electrolyte and the value of TiO2@C is ca. 17.9 Ω read from Fig. 6c, smaller than that of the TiO2 (21.2 Ω). Likewise, the surface layer and charge transfer resistance (Rsl and Rct) of TiO2@C (15.3 Ω) is also smaller than that of TiO2 (29.8 Ω). Accordingly, it can be seen from the Bode plot (Fig. 6d) that the resistance of high and low frequency in TiO2 is higher than that of TiO2@C. The EIS results again demonstrated that the N-doped carbon-coating layer could improve the reaction kinetics.\nThe ester-based electrolyte was further applied to investigate the SIB electrochemical performances of TiO2 and TiO2@C samples. The rate performance is shown in Fig. 7a where the TiO2@C exhibits an initial specific capacity of 490 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. After 10 cycles, the discharge capacity is maintained at a value of 210 mA h g−1. Subsequently, along with the current rate increases from 0.2 to 5 A g−1, the TiO2@C sample obtains the average capacities of 190, 170, 150, 125, and 74 mA h g−1, respectively. And when the current rate is reset to 0.1 A g−1, the reversible discharge capacity recovers to a high level of 205 mA h g−1, representing excellent rate performance and high reversibility. On the contrary, TiO2 sample only delivers a capacity of 50 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and provides negligible capacity at high current densities of 2 and 5 A g−1.\nMoreover, the cycling performance of two samples at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1 was displayed and compared in Fig. 7b. The specific capacity of TiO2 electrode rises slowly in the early cycling and then stabilizes at a value of 60 mA h g−1. The possible reason is that the TiO2 electrode could not be fully activated at the current density of 0.1 A g−1, so that the preliminary cycling could not provide a stable capacity. Satisfactorily, the TiO2@C sample delivers a capacity of 230 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle, and remains a reversible capacity as high as 220 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles. Furthermore, Fig. 7c shows the long-term cycling life of the TiO2 and TiO2@C materials at a higher current density of 1 A g−1. After a 10-cycle electrochemical activation at 0.1 A g−1, the TiO2@C sample delivers a capacity of 160 mA h g−1 at the 11th cycle and obtains a reversible capacity of 130 mA h g−1 after 10,000 cycles at 1 A g−1, with a capacity decay rate of 0.002% per cycle. As for sample of TiO2, a value of 20 mA h g−1 is obtained after 10,000 cycles at 1 A g−1. The TiO2@C sample possesses the high capacity resulting from the N-doped-coated carbon layer that the surface defects and interconnected carbon framework of nanomaterials can accelerate the diffusions of ions and charges. The cyclability of TiO2@C at 2.0 A g−1 in the ester-based electrolyte has been provided in Fig. S5. After 4500 cycles, the capacity of TiO2@C in the ester-based electrolyte maintains a value of 105 mA h g−1, higher than that in the ether-based electrolyte. Although the discharge capacity in ether-based electrolyte is higher than that in ester electrolyte at the beginning of cycles, the cycle stability of TiO2@C in ester-based electrolyte is better.\nOne step further, to investigate the feasibility of TiO2@C for practical applications, Na3V2(PO4)3 was applied as cathode material to match the TiO2@C anode within ester-based electrolyte to fabricate a full cell. As electrochemically tested, the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode delivers a superior rate capacity of 112, 109, 105, 101, 96, and 84 mA h g−1 at the current of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. (Fig. S4). After matching the capacity of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and TiO2@C anode, the Na3V2(PO4)//TiO2@C full cell was assembled and the voltage range was 2–4 V. The overall electrochemical reaction during charge-discharge process of the full cell can be summarized as follows [40]:\nAs shown in Fig. 8a, the full cell shows the initial charge and discharge capacities of 130 mA h g−1 and 108 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 respectively, and maintains a good capacity retention of 90 mA h g−1 (83.3% of the initial capacity) after 200 galvanostatic cycles. The full cell featured an average discharge voltage of 2.7 V revealing by Fig. 8b, and the energy density is calculated to be ca. 300 Wh kg−1. These results prove the realization of Na-ion full cells based on TiO2@C anode that are encouraging enough to be considered for practical purposes.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The metatitanic acid was obtained from Chongqing Titanium Industry Co., Ltd of Pangang Group. All reagents were used without further purification.\n\nSynthesis of anatase TiO2 and TiO2@C\n300 ml of Tris-HCl (pH ~ 8.5) buffer solution was prepared first in a round flask. 600 mg of metatitanic acid powder was put into the buffer solution and dispersed in it. Then 225 mg of dopamine hydrochloride was added to the suspension, and the reaction was stirred magnetically with 300 r/min in a water bath at 30°C for 12 h. Polydopamine-coated metatitanic acid was obtained by washing and centrifugating using deionized water. Subsequently, the obtained polydopamine-coated metatitanic acid was heated in a sealed quartz tube under argon atmosphere at 550°C for 4 h, and the TiO2@C nanocomposite was acquired eventually. The metatitanic acid was directly pyrolyzed at 550°C to obtain TiO2 sample.\n\nCharacterizations of materials\nThe crystal structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (ultima IV) measurement using Cu Kα radiation. The chemical constitutions and valence states of the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi). The morphology of the samples was observed by using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (JEM-ARM200F). Thermogravimetric analysis (Netzsch STA 449 F3) was carried out to determine the weight ratio of carbon in the sample under the air atmosphere from room temperature to 1200°C at heating rate of 10 °C min−1.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nCR2032-type coin cells were assembled with TiO2@C or TiO2 as active material of electrode, sodium metal as the counter electrode and glass fiber (Celgard 2400, GF/D) member as separator in an argon-filled glove box (H2O, O2 < 0.01 ppm) and used to test the electrochemical performance. Active material, conductive carbon (Super P) and polyvinylidene difluoride as binder were mixed with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone solvent and formed black slurry, which was then coated on the copper foil and dried in vacuum drying chamber for 12 h. The mass loading of active material on the electrode was about 1–1.2 mg cm−2. The ether-based electrolyte was 1.0 M NaCF3SO3 in diglyme and the ester-based electrolyte was 1.0 M NaClO4 in EC:DEC=1:1 vol% with 5.0% of FEC. The full cell consists of commercial sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3) coated on the aluminum foil as the cathode, GF/D as separator, and TiO2@C as the anode assembled in CR2025-type coin cell within the ester-based electrolyte.\nThe charge-discharge cycling test of the cell was carried out using Land CT2001A battery testing system at a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test was performed under a current pulse of 30 mA g−1 for 30 min with an interval of 90 min. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660E).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The metatitanic acid was obtained from Chongqing Titanium Industry Co., Ltd of Pangang Group. All reagents were used without further purification.\n\nSynthesis of anatase TiO2 and TiO2@C\n300 ml of Tris-HCl (pH ~ 8.5) buffer solution was prepared first in a round flask. 600 mg of metatitanic acid powder was put into the buffer solution and dispersed in it. Then 225 mg of dopamine hydrochloride was added to the suspension, and the reaction was stirred magnetically with 300 r/min in a water bath at 30°C for 12 h. Polydopamine-coated metatitanic acid was obtained by washing and centrifugating using deionized water. Subsequently, the obtained polydopamine-coated metatitanic acid was heated in a sealed quartz tube under argon atmosphere at 550°C for 4 h, and the TiO2@C nanocomposite was acquired eventually. The metatitanic acid was directly pyrolyzed at 550°C to obtain TiO2 sample.\n\nCharacterizations of materials\nThe crystal structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (ultima IV) measurement using Cu Kα radiation. The chemical constitutions and valence states of the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi). The morphology of the samples was observed by using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (JEM-ARM200F). Thermogravimetric analysis (Netzsch STA 449 F3) was carried out to determine the weight ratio of carbon in the sample under the air atmosphere from room temperature to 1200°C at heating rate of 10 °C min−1.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nCR2032-type coin cells were assembled with TiO2@C or TiO2 as active material of electrode, sodium metal as the counter electrode and glass fiber (Celgard 2400, GF/D) member as separator in an argon-filled glove box (H2O, O2 < 0.01 ppm) and used to test the electrochemical performance. Active material, conductive carbon (Super P) and polyvinylidene difluoride as binder were mixed with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone solvent and formed black slurry, which was then coated on the copper foil and dried in vacuum drying chamber for 12 h. The mass loading of active material on the electrode was about 1–1.2 mg cm−2. The ether-based electrolyte was 1.0 M NaCF3SO3 in diglyme and the ester-based electrolyte was 1.0 M NaClO4 in EC:DEC=1:1 vol% with 5.0% of FEC. The full cell consists of commercial sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3) coated on the aluminum foil as the cathode, GF/D as separator, and TiO2@C as the anode assembled in CR2025-type coin cell within the ester-based electrolyte.\nThe charge-discharge cycling test of the cell was carried out using Land CT2001A battery testing system at a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test was performed under a current pulse of 30 mA g−1 for 30 min with an interval of 90 min. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660E).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, the (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, CS(NH2)2, C6H12O6, and NaCl were dissolved in deionized water and stirred for several hours. Secondly, the mixture was dried to remove water so the MoS2/NC precursor was well encased in the NaCl template. Subsequently, the obtained precursor was calcined in an Ar atmosphere. During the calcination process, Mo reacted with S ions, while glucose was carbonized at high temperatures and converted into an N-doped carbon framework. The interaction between the two made the MoS2/NC nanosheets grow uniformly on the surface of the NaCl template surface. Finally, MoS2/NC nanosheets were prepared by removing the NaCl template with deionized water.\nXRD was conducted to characterize the crystalline of the pure MoS2, MoS2/NC (no NaCl), and MoS2/NC. As shown in Fig.\xa02a, the diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 32.8°, 39.8°, 49.3°, and 58.7° corresponded to the (002), (100), (105), (103), and (110) planes of hexagonal MoS2 crystal (JCPDS No. 37–1492), respectively. It was noteworthy that the peaks located at (002) of the MoS2/NC and MoS2/NC (no NaCl) were weak, which could be the presence of carbon inhibiting the growth of (002) lattice plane [26,27,28]. In addition, according to the Debye–Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of the pure MoS2, MoS2/NC (no NaCl), and MoS2/NC samples were calculated using the peaks at (100) as 8.67\xa0nm, 7.02\xa0nm, and 7.08\xa0nm, respectively. Compared with pure MoS2, the XRD peaks of MoS2/NC (no NaCl) and MoS2/NC samples were broader and the calculated grain sizes were smaller, which might be caused by the reduction of crystallite size due to the addition of N-doped carbon [29]. Figure\xa02b presents the Raman spectra of the MoS2/NC and the MoS2 materials. Two peaks at 379 and 404 cm−1 were seen for the as-synthesized MoS2 sample, representing the E12g and A1g vibration modes. Compared with pure MoS2, apart from the characteristic peaks of MoS2, the MoS2/NC showed two broad peaks at 1354 cm−1 and 1578 cm−1, which could be well indexed to the D (disordered carbon) and G (graphitic carbon) bands of carbon, respectively [30]. The former represented the sp3 hybrid, and the latter was related to the sp2 hybrid. The calculated value of ID/IG was 1.22, indicating that the obtained MoS2/NC had a higher content of disordered carbon and more sp3-bond carbon. Raman’s results verified that pyrolyzed carbon and MoS2 were successfully synthesized by this method. To estimate the relative contents of MoS2 and C components in the MoS2/NC sample, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out in an air atmosphere. The weight loss of the MoS2 sample at 350 ℃–600 ℃was 9.86%, mainly because of the oxidation of pure MoS2 into MoO3 (Fig. S1) [31,32,33]. For the MoS2/NC sample, the weight loss of the MoS2/NC sample had increased to 35.9% at the same temperature range because of the oxidation of MoS2 to MoO3 and the combustion of carbon. Therefore, the contents of MoS2 and carbon were 71.3% and 28.7%, respectively. Figure S2 shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of MoS2/NC and MoS2 samples. The pure MoS2 sample showed a typical IV isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop, while the MoS2/NC sample displayed a H2 hysteresis loop. The specific surface areas of the two samples calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method were 5.95 m2 g−1 and 4.73 m2 g−1, respectively. The pore size distribution diagram showed that NaCl as a sacrificial template was crucial in reducing the pore size of the MoS2/NC. Small pores could shorten diffusion pathways and facilitate sodium ions and electrons transfer during discharge and charge processes.\nXPS was used to analyze the surface atomic composition of the samples of MoS2/NC and MoS2, as well as the results are displayed in Fig.\xa03. In the complete XPS spectra of the two samples, the signals of Mo, S, C, N, and O could be distinctly observed in MoS2/NC sample, while the carbon content in pure MoS2 sample was significantly reduced, which was consistent with the expected results (Fig. S3). Figure\xa03a depicts the high-resolution XPS spectrum in the 3d region of Mo, where the two peaks at 229.4 and 232.6 eV represented 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Mo4+, respectively, and the peak at 226.7 eV corresponded to the 2s signal of S. A small peak could also be observed at 236 eV, which was the 3d3/2 signal of Mo6+ according to previous studies [34, 35]. The generation of this peak might resulted from the surface oxidation of the MoS2/NC during the process of preparation and storage, which also explained the existence of the O element in the whole spectrum [36]. It can be seen from the XPS spectra of the S 2p region described in Fig.\xa03b that two peaks at 163.4 eV and 162.2 eV represented the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 signals of S2−, respectively. Similarly, a weak peak at 168.7 eV represented the S6+ signal, which was caused by the oxidation of S2− in the atmosphere [37]. Compared with pure MoS2, the peaks of Mo4+ 3d and S2− 2p of the MoS2/NC sample both shifted toward lower binding energy, which was caused by the increase of electron cloud density near MoS2 due to the addition of C [38]. Figure\xa03c is the fitted XPS spectrum of the 1s region of C, where 284.6, 285.9, 287.0, and 288.8 eV were categorized as C–C, C-N/C-O, C-S, and C\u2009=\u2009O bonds, respectively. This result indicated that N elements were successfully doped into carbon, which was further corroborated by the N 1s spectrum in Fig.\xa03d. Three peaks at 398.3, 400.2, and 401.9 eV could be identified as the N 1s region, representing pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively. The addition of N could improve the electrochemical performance of the materials mainly from the following aspects: on the one hand, N had a high electronegativity, and N doping could enhance the interaction between particles, thereby improving the electrochemical activity of the material. On the other hand, N doping could also provide more defects, which improved the transport rate of sodium ions by interacting with them [39, 40].\nThe morphological and microstructure characteristics were analyzed by SEM, TEM, and HRTEM. Figure\xa04a describes the SEM image of the MoS2/NC (no NaCl) sample, and as shown in the figure, the single MoS2/NC (no NaCl) sample presented an apparent massive structure. The MoS2/NC exhibited a typical nanosheet structure that the MoS2 nanosheets were uniformly embedded in the nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks (Fig.\xa04b, c). The results indicated that the addition of water-removable template NaCl could effectively restrain the aggregation of MoS2 and promote nanosheet formation. The average layer spacing of about 0.626 nm was represented to the (002) plane of MoS2 in the TEM and HRTEM images (Fig.\xa04d, e). Specifically, we could observe that the MoS2 nanosheets composed of 3–4 layers were evenly dispersed in the carbon shell. The cross-linked structure of these nanosheets was small and well combined with the carbon layer. This unique structure could availably buffer the volume variation of MoS2 during repeated charging-discharging processes, showing good cycling stability. The electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the MoS2/NC is shown in Fig.\xa01f, illustrating the polycrystalline nature of MoS2. Figure\xa04g–k show the EDS mapping images of the MoS2/NC. It was obvious that Mo, S, C, and N elements were uniformly distributed in the selected region. Based on the characterization mentioned above, the nanosheet-like MoS2/N-doped carbon was successfully synthesized.\nTo investigate the electrochemical behavior of sodium storage in the sample MoS2/NC, the electrode coated with 70% active substance was made into a button battery, and a series of electrochemical tests were carried out, such as the CV curves of MoS2/NC cycling three times (Fig.\xa05a). During the first discharge, two strong peaks could be observed near 0.72 V and 0.36 V while one weak peak near 0.65 V and one strong peak at ca. 1.82 V were seen during the first anodic sweep. The reduction peak at 0.72V corresponded to the formation of NaxMoS2 by the reaction between Na+ and MoS2 (reaction 1). Another reduction peak at 0.36 V was caused by the conversion reaction of NaxMoS2 and Na+ into Na2S and Mo (reaction 2), accompanied by the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.\nThe weak oxidation peak at 0.65 V was determined by the recombination of Na2S with Mo into NaxMoS2, and the other oxidation peak at 1.82 V indicated the process of extracting Na+ from NaxMoS2. At the end of the first cycle, the original MoS2 was partly transformed into a small amount of amorphous S and elemental Mo. In the second cathodic sweep, a new reduction peak appeared at 1.62 V, corresponding to the conversion of amorphous S into Na2S [41,42,43,44]. The reduction peak at 0.2–0.78 V remained unchanged but decreased intensity, indicating an irreversible phase transition occurred during the first cycle. In the subsequent few scans, the redox peaks overlapped highly, demonstrating that the MoS2/NC electrode had outstanding cycle capacity retention.\nFigure\xa05b represents the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the MoS2/NC electrode at 0.2 A g−1 in different cycles. The electrode’s potential dropped sharply above 1.0 V and slowly below 1.0 V during the first cycling process, as seen from the figure, which might be due to the presence of carbon [45]. During discharge, two voltage platforms could be seen at 0–0.25 V and 0.5–0.75 V, while during charge, a voltage platform occurs at 1.75–2.0 V, which were primarily in accordance with the peak value observed in the CV curve [46]. Besides, the initial discharging and charging specific capacities of MoS2/NC electrode were 582.96 and 435.97 mAh g−1, respectively, giving a Coulombic efficiency of 74.75%. Other irreversible reactions, such as electrolyte decomposition and SEI film formation, led to low initial Coulomb efficiency. The Coulomb efficiency of the electrode was above 98% in the subsequent cycles, indicating the formed SEI film was relatively stable [47,48,49]. Figure\xa05c describes the performance comparison of the electrodes of MoS2/NC, MoS2/NC (no NaCl) and MoS2 for 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. The reversible specific capacities of the three samples after 100 cycles were 334.6, 213.2, and 100.8 mAh g−1, respectively, indicating that the specific capacity and cycling lifetime of MoS2/NC electrode was higher than MoS2/NC (no NaCl) and MoS2. Additionally, the capacity of the single MoS2 electrode decreased rapidly after 50 cycles, showing poor electrochemical stability, mainly because of the poor conductivity of the material and the great volume variation during sodium-ion intercalation/de-intercalation. Compared with pure MoS2, the electrochemical performance of the MoS2/NC electrode had been improved, mainly due to the following two aspects. On the one hand, the introduction of N-doped carbon and the uniform distribution of nanosheets could enhance the conductivity of the material, alleviate the volume change during the cycle, increase the specific surface area, which improved the reaction kinetics, and thus further optimize the specific capacity [50, 51]. On the other hand, the electrochemical reconstruction phenomenon could enhance the architecture of the electrode, showing more excellent cyclic stability [52]. Figure\xa05d describes the long-term cycling capability of the MoS2/NC electrode. The electrode could provide a reversible capacity of 252.9 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 250 cycles, demonstrating that the composite exhibits excellent long-term cycling behavior. Figure\xa05e describes the rate performance of the MoS2/NC electrode. At 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 A g−1, the reversible capacities were 351.3, 282.2, 258.6, 227.2, 199.67, and 172.31 mAh g−1, respectively. The reversible capacity could quickly recover to 338.2 mAh g−1 after three large cycles when the current density returned to 0.2 A g−1, indicating that the MoS2/NC electrode had superior rate performance.\nAs one of the effective methods to study SIBs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been conducted to investigate the electrochemical dynamics differences of MoS2/NC and MoS2 electrodes. The Nyquist plots were fitted from the equivalent circuit in Fig.\xa06a and b. In the equivalent circuit, R1 was the internal resistance between electrode and electrolyte, CEP was the abbreviation of constant phase element, R2 was charge transfer resistance, and Zw was ascribed to the diffusion rate of sodium ions. As we all know, the Nyquist diagram consists of a semicircle and a diagonal line. The semicircle originated from the charge transfer resistance of the electrode, while the straight line was closely attributed to the impedance of the sodium-ion diffusion process. Table S1 lists the equivalent circuit parameters of different electrodes. The charge transfer resistance of the MoS2/NC electrode was significantly lower than that of the MoS2 electrode before cycling, showing faster reaction kinetics (Fig.\xa06a). After 50 cycles, the charge transfer resistance of the MoS2/NC electrode was still less than that of MoS2 (Fig.\xa06b). Due to the coupling of nitrogen-doped carbon with MoS2 and the uniform distribution of the nanosheets making the electrolyte to be more easily permeated into the electrode, which improved the reaction kinetics, finally leading to a lower R2 on the macroscale. In the low-frequency region, Fig.\xa06c and d show the Nyquist plots of the real part (Z′) of the two groups of samples versus ω−1/2. Among them, the Warburg coefficient was inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions, which could be determined by the slope of the Z′ and ω−1/2 lines [53]. That was, the smaller the slope of the fitted line was, the larger the diffusion coefficient of sodium ion was, and the better the kinetic property of the electrode was. Calculated by fitting the slope of the curve, the diffusion coefficient of the MoS2/NC electrode was 5.31\u2009×\u200910−15 cm2\xa0s−1 after 50 cycles, which was higher than that of the pure MoS2 electrode (7.29\u2009×\u200910−18 cm2\xa0s−1), indicating that MoS2/NC could promote the transmission and diffusion of sodium ions, showing better electrochemical performance. The R2 of both electrodes was decreased after 50 cycles, and compared with before cycling (2.19\u2009×\u200910−15 cm2\xa0s−1), the diffusion coefficient of the MoS2/NC electrode after cycling was still higher (Fig.\xa06d), which was because of the crystal structure transformation of MoS2 during cycling, which was consistent with those reported previously [54].\nTo further investigate the cyclic kinetics of the MoS2/NC electrode, CV tests were performed at the scanning rates of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mV s−1(Fig.\xa07a). These curves were similar in shape as could be seen from the figure, but with the increase in scanning rate, the values of peak currents increase. The capacitive process and diffusion behavior of the sodium storage mechanism could be qualitatively analyzed by the following Eqs.\xa0(3, 4):\nwhere a and b were constants, i was identified as the current, and v represents the sweep speed. As we all know, the b value represented the type of reaction kinetics. When the b value approached 0.5, the reaction was mainly controlled by the diffusion behavior. When closer to 1, the storage of sodium ions was mainly dominated by the capacitive behavior [55, 56]. Linear fitting was performed on oxidation peaks 1, 2 and reduction peaks 3, 4 in Fig.\xa07b. b values of peaks 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 0.762, 0.936, 0.776, and 0.756, respectively. The results indicated that the sodium-ion storage kinetics of the MoS2/NC composite was dominated by the capacitance behavior. According to the Eq.\xa0(5):\nthe capacitive contribution could be further calculated at different sweep rates, where k1v corresponded capacitive process and k2v1/2 represented the diffusion process. Figure\xa07c and d describe the calculated results. When the scanning rate was 0.2 mV s−1, the contribution of the capacitive was 46.85%. It could be seen from the results that the contribution of capacitance improved with the increase in the sweep speed. When the scanning rate scaled up from 0.2 to 1.0 mV s−1, the ratios were 46.9%, 50.6%, 62.4%, 63.0%, and 64.9%, respectively. For comparison, the CV curves of pure MoS2 and MoS2/NC (no NaCl) electrodes were measured at different scanning rates (Fig. S4). It was calculated that with the increase of scanning rate, the capacitance contributions of pure MoS2 electrode were 48.7%, 52.9%, 55.1%, 57.2%, and 61.7%, respectively, and that of MoS2/NC (no NaCl) electrode were 57.8%, 59.8% and 61.7%, 62.2%, and 64.6%, respectively. The capacitive contributions of MoS2/NC (no NaCl) and MoS2/NC electrodes were relatively higher than that of pure MoS2 electrodes, indicating that N-doped carbon could improve the capacitive contribution and promote sodium-ion transfer.\nTo further study the reasons for the excellent electrochemical performance of the MoS2/CN electrode, the morphological characteristics of the MoS2/CN electrode were analyzed after 100 cycles at a specific current density. It could be seen that the size of the MoS2 nanosheets in the electrode after cycling was reduced, and the irregular rectangular bulges were attached to the surface of the nanosheets (Fig.\xa08a). This morphology could also be observed in TEM, where the size of the rectangular bulges was about 60–80 nm as shown in Fig.\xa08b. Additionally, clear lattice fringes could be observed on the HRTEM image, where the 0.62 nm interplanar spacing corresponded to the (002) face of MoS2, which might be due to the electrochemical reconstruction phenomenon of the MoS2/CN electrode during the cycle, that was, the reaction kinetics changed because of the evolution of the microstructure [54, 57]. With the reduction of the size of MoS2 nanosheets and the formation of irregular rectangular bulges, the contact between the electrolyte and the electrode enhanced, thus exhibiting better electrochemical reaction kinetics, which was consistent with measurements of the EIS. This extraordinary morphological change might be the reason for the good stability of the MoS2/CN electrode.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

All chemicals were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Co., Ltd.\n\nPreparation of MoS2/NC\n0.4 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 0.4 g CS(NH2)2 were dispersed in 30 ml of deionized water, then 0.5 g C6H12O6 and 0.5 g NaCl were added into the solution with stirring for 2 h to dissolve completely. The precursor was diverted to a porcelain boat and incinerated at 800℃ for 2 h in a protective atmosphere (Ar) with a heating rate of 5℃ per minute. The collected product was washed with distilled water and ethanol repeatedly after cooling to room temperature and then dried for 5 h in a vacuum oven at 60℃ to acquire the MoS2/NC sample. As the control, the samples without adding NaCl (MoS2/NC (no NaCl)) and pure MoS2 were prepared in the same approach.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe coin-type battery was assembled according to the following process. Specifically, the active materials (70 wt%), acetylene black (20 wt%), and sodium alginate (10 wt%) were added to deionized water by thoroughly grinding to form a uniform slurry, and evenly spread on a Cu sheet, drying at 60℃ for 6 h to remove water, then copper foil was cut into discs a diameter of 14 mm, and subjected to vacuum drying for 12 h at 120℃. The mass loading of the electrode prepared was about 0.6–1.0 mg cm−2 and the amount of electrolyte in each battery was 40 μl. Using Na as the counter electrode and GF/D Whatman as the diaphragm, CR2032 coin batteries were fabricated in an expandable glove box for a series of tests. 1 M NaClO4 was dissolved in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC, 1:1 vol %) and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was added as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were carried out on the LAND Instrument (CT 3002A, Wuhan, China). The cyclic voltammograms (CV, 0.01–3 V, 0.2 mV s−1) and electrical impedance diagrams (EIS, 100 kHz–0.01 Hz, 5 mV s−1) of the samples were determined by an electrochemical workstation.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe crystalline structure and phase composition of the samples were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500). The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out at a heating rise of 20 ℃ min−1 in the flowing air. The specific surface area and pore size distributions of the samples were obtained by analyzing the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms.

All chemicals were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Co., Ltd.\n\nPreparation of MoS2/NC\n0.4 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 0.4 g CS(NH2)2 were dispersed in 30 ml of deionized water, then 0.5 g C6H12O6 and 0.5 g NaCl were added into the solution with stirring for 2 h to dissolve completely. The precursor was diverted to a porcelain boat and incinerated at 800℃ for 2 h in a protective atmosphere (Ar) with a heating rate of 5℃ per minute. The collected product was washed with distilled water and ethanol repeatedly after cooling to room temperature and then dried for 5 h in a vacuum oven at 60℃ to acquire the MoS2/NC sample. As the control, the samples without adding NaCl (MoS2/NC (no NaCl)) and pure MoS2 were prepared in the same approach.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe coin-type battery was assembled according to the following process. Specifically, the active materials (70 wt%), acetylene black (20 wt%), and sodium alginate (10 wt%) were added to deionized water by thoroughly grinding to form a uniform slurry, and evenly spread on a Cu sheet, drying at 60℃ for 6 h to remove water, then copper foil was cut into discs a diameter of 14 mm, and subjected to vacuum drying for 12 h at 120℃. The mass loading of the electrode prepared was about 0.6–1.0 mg cm−2 and the amount of electrolyte in each battery was 40 μl. Using Na as the counter electrode and GF/D Whatman as the diaphragm, CR2032 coin batteries were fabricated in an expandable glove box for a series of tests. 1 M NaClO4 was dissolved in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC, 1:1 vol %) and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was added as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were carried out on the LAND Instrument (CT 3002A, Wuhan, China). The cyclic voltammograms (CV, 0.01–3 V, 0.2 mV s−1) and electrical impedance diagrams (EIS, 100 kHz–0.01 Hz, 5 mV s−1) of the samples were determined by an electrochemical workstation.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe crystalline structure and phase composition of the samples were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500). The thermogravimetric analysis was carried out at a heating rise of 20 ℃ min−1 in the flowing air. The specific surface area and pore size distributions of the samples were obtained by analyzing the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms.

It was irregular solid blocks with obvious agglomeration characteristics. However, with the introduction of NaCl hard template, the synthesized HS X-C showed significant difference in morphology and microstructure.\nFrom Fig.\xa01a and b, it delivered a three-dimensional honeycomb-like structure with a wall thickness of less than 20 nm. The TEM image in Fig.\xa01c further confirmed this kind of special structure. HRTEM image revealed that the HS X-C was long-range-disordered but short-range-ordered in terms of crystalline property (Fig.\xa01d). The (002) lattice spacing was around 0.37 nm, which was larger than 0.335 nm for the graphite [28]. The discontinuous lattice strips should be attributed to the abundance of heteroatoms in biomass raw materials. During the heat treatment, some non-metallic heteroatoms could be doped into C, while the others were released in gas form. In addition, the etching of metal ions could also lead to discontinuity of lattice strips. Elemental analysis showed that the N and O heteroatom contents were about 1.1% and 5.2%, respectively, but no S element was detected. From the hierarchical elemental distribution map in Fig. S2, the doped N and O elements were distributed evenly. Figure\xa01e shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the HS X-C. When the relative pressure (p/p0) increased from 0 to 0.4, the amount of adsorbed N2 reached 105 cm3 g−1, indicating that there were many micropores. During the increase of p/p0 from 0.4 to 0.8, the amount of adsorbed N2 increased only by 64 cm3 g−1. Considering that no obvious hysteresis ring appeared between 0.4 and 0.8, the number of middle pores was relatively small. After p/p0 exceeded 0.8, the amount of adsorbed N2 increased rapidly with increasing pressure, indicative of the existence of many macropores [29]. These characteristics were well accorded with the pore size distribution curve in Fig.\xa01f. Calculated on the desorption isothermal curve, the BET surface area and total pore volume of the HS X-C were about 299 m2 g−1 and 0.91 cm3 g−1, respectively. The high specific surface area and abundant voids contributed to improving the contact area between material and electrolyte, facilitating the penetration of electrolyte, promoting the transportation of ions and easing the relaxation of the tension, so the HS X-C was expected to exhibit high capacity and excellent rate performance.\nThe XRD pattern and Raman spectrum of the HS X-C are shown in Fig.\xa02a and b. Although no sharp peak was observed in the XRD pattern, two obvious broad peaks appeared at 23° and 43°, which were assigned to (002) and (100) planes of graphite respectively. Such a situation was consistent with a short-range-ordered structure.\xa0In the Raman spectrum, two peaks were assigned to the vibration of disordered carbon (D-band) and graphitized carbon (G-band) were located at 1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively. The fitting analysis revealed that the peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) was about 0.85, further confirming that the HS X-C had a relatively high graphitization. XPS was used to detect the chemical composition of the surface. As shown in Fig.\xa02c, the chemical composition was relatively simple, where only C, N and O elements were detected. The C 1s HRXPS spectrum could be fitted into four peaks at 284.4, 285, 285.9 and 287.4 eV, corresponding to C–C, C-N, C-O and C\u2009=\u2009O bonds, respectively (Fig.\xa02d) [30]. The N 1s HRXPS spectrum could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 398 and 400 eV (Fig.\xa02e), which belonged to pyridinic N and pyrrole N, respectively [23]. The O 1s HRXPS spectrum could be divided into three peaks at 531.1, 532.2 and 533.2 eV, which corresponded to C\u2009=\u2009O, C-O and C–O–C bonds, respectively (Fig.\xa02f) [31]. These results showed that both N and O were doped into C host. Compared with C atom, since N and O had redundant free electrons and higher electronegativity, it was easy to cause electric field imbalance, thereby providing more adsorption sites for alkali metal ions [32].\nThe electrochemical behaviour of the HS X-C as an anode of Na-ion batteries was investigated. Figure\xa03a shows its initial three CV curves at 0.2 mV s−1. A pair of sharp redox peaks presented at approximately 0.044 and 0.095 V with a peak potential difference of 51 mV. The other peaks were very weak and broad. In addition, it was interesting that even in the first cathodic scan, no distinct peak of electrolyte decomposition was observed, implying that the anode could possess a high first coulombic efficiency. Figure\xa03b shows the charge–discharge profiles of different cycles at 0.5 A g−1. The discharge profiles could be roughly divided into three characteristic regions. In this region of higher than about 1.15 V, the discharge profile was steep, corresponding to the process of Na+ deposition in the defect area of the material. In the region of less than 0.07 V, the discharge profile was flat, corresponding to the insertion of Na+ into the “pseudo-graphite” layer [33,34,35]. The intermediate region at 1.0–0.07 V corresponded to the process of Na+ insertion into disordered carbon [36]. The three regional characteristics in the charge profiles were also obvious. The first discharge and charge capacities were 270.5 and 234 mAh g−1, respectively, with a high first coulombic efficiency of 86.5%. Generally, the anode material with high specific surface area delivered a low first coulombic efficiency because extra electrolyte was consumed for the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. However, in this work, in addition to no obvious electrolyte decomposition peaks in the first CV cathodic scan, the clear honeycomb structure of the material could still be observed even after 100 cycles (Fig. S3 (a-c)), indicative of a thin SEI layer. To confirm that the high first coulombic efficiency resulted from the solvent of the electrolyte, ester solvent (EC:DMC:EMC\u2009=\u20091:1:1 Vol%, 5.0% FEC) was used to replace diglyme and the results are shown in Fig. S3 (d-g). From Fig. S3 (d, e), significant differences were observed on the surface of the electrode, where the honeycomb structure of the HS X-C could not be observed due to the covering of a thick SEI film. From Fig. S3 (c, f), in the first CV curve, the electrode cycled in the electrolyte using diglyme as solvent had only negligible reduction peak at 0.74 V, while that cycled in the electrolyte with ester as solvent presented three strong reduction peaks at 0.35, 0.78 and 1.0 V. Moreover, the first coulombic efficiency sharply decreased to 28% (Fig. S3 (g)). Therefore, it could be concluded that diglyme was less prone to reductive decomposition on the surface of the HS X-C. Figure\xa03c shows the cycle performance of the HS X-C at 0.5 A g−1. In the 200 cycles, although the capacity decreased slowly in the first 8 cycles, it had maintained at about 202 mAh g−1 in the subsequent cycles. When cycling at different current densities from 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1, the stable capacities were 235, 216, 206, 191 and 161 mAh g−1, respectively (Fig.\xa03d), indicating that the anode possessed superior rate capability. From Fig.\xa03e, the anode also had long cycle stability at a high current density. After 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1, a discharge capacity of 185 mAh g−1 was kept, with capacity retention of 96.9% against the stable capacity of 191 mAh g−1. According to Tab. S1, compared with previously reported biochar anodes for Na-ion batteries, the HS X-C overall exhibited higher specific capacity, better rate capability and more excellent cycle stability.\nTo understand the reasons for the improvement of electrochemical performance of the HS X-C, in addition to investigating the impedance and structural changes of the electrodes during cycling, the structural influence of the synthesized carbon was also compared. Figure\xa03f shows the variation of electrochemical impedance with cycle number. All EIS consisted of two semicircles in the medium and high frequency area and a slope line in the low frequency area. In the equivalent circuit diagram, Rs represented the solution resistance, RSEI denoted the resistance associated with the migration of Na-ion through the solid electrolyte interface and Rct was the charge transfer resistance during the electrochemical reaction [37]. The fitting results was shown in Table S2. The Rs and RSEI values after 200 cycles showed only a negligible increase when compared with that after 50 cycles, indicative of high structural stability of the electrode. In addition, the Rct values decreased with the cycle, indicating that the charge transfer speed and the electrochemical reaction rate increased. From the TEM images of the cycled HS X-C electrode in Fig.\xa03g, h, the honeycomb structure of the material was well maintained after 1000 cycles, indicating that such a structure could indeed accommodate well to the tension generated by volume changes. Fig. S4 shows the cycle performance of the X-C at 2 A g−1, the discharge capacity of which had continuously been declining. After 450 cycles, the discharge capacity decreased to 106 mAh g−1, with a low-capacity retention of 44.7% compared with the second discharge capacity. Evidently, introducing NaCl template during the synthesis of material significantly improved the cyclic stability of carbon from Xanthium sibiricum fruits. The excellent electrochemical performance of the HS X-C should be attributed to its unique microstructure, which not only reduced the transmission path of electrons and ions, but also facilitated the release of tension.\nTo study the kinetics of the electrode process, CV curves were recorded at different scan rates from 0.2 to 1.4 mV s−1. As shown in Fig.\xa04a, as scan rate increased, all peaks increased in intensity but there was little change in peak potentials, indicating that the electrochemical reaction was highly reversible. The control step of the electrode process was determined by Ip\u2009=\u2009aνb, where b\u2009=\u20090.5 and 1 represent diffusion control and surface adsorption/reaction control, respectively [38].\xa0Figure\xa04b presents the relation curve of logIp – logν of redox peaks, where bR and bO were 0.85 and 0.75, respectively, indicating that the reaction rate was jointly controlled by diffusion and capacitance. The capacitive contribution was further calculated by I\u2009=\u2009k1v\u2009+\u2009k2v1/2, where k1v and k2v1/2 represent the contribution of the surface-driven pseudocapacitive process and the contribution of the diffusion-controlled reaction, respectively [39]. Figure\xa04c shows the variation of the capacitance contribution with the scanning rate. As the scanning rate increased from 0.2 to 1.4 mV s−1, the capacitance contribution increased from 73 to 86%. Figure\xa04d shows the capacitance contribution corresponding to different potentials at 0.8 mV s−1. The capacitance contribution between 0.6 and 3 V was significantly greater than that between 0 and 0.2 V, indicating that the electrode process was more controlled by diffusion during Na+ insertion/extraction into/out the pseudo-graphite layer. The diffusion coefficient (D) of Na+ was measured using the GITT technique. The recorded GITT curves was shown in Fig.\xa04e. D was calculated on the formula as follows:\nwhere τ is the duration of the pulse current, and mB is the weight of active material, S is the total area of the electrode, ΔEs is the voltage change during rest, ΔEτ is the voltage change during pulse, VM is the molar volume of the active material and MB is the molar mass of the active material [40]. In this work, each pulse was composed of 10\xa0min of titration with a current density of 20\xa0mA\xa0g−1 and 30\xa0min of rest. To reflect the speed of ion diffusion more accurately, the actual surface area of the active material was used to replace the apparent area of the electrode. The relative value of MB/VM was calculated based on the following formulation:\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) (g cm−3) is the density of materials, Vpore (cm3 g−1) is the total pore volume analyzed from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, and \\({\\rho }_{carbon}\\) is the true density of carbon (2 g cm−3). The calculated Na+ diffusion coefficients for discharge and charge are also shown in Fig.\xa04e. The D values were between 3.8\u2009×\u200910−15\u2009~\u20098.2\u2009×\u200910−17 cm2 s−1 during discharging, while the D values were between 5.0\u2009×\u200910−15\u2009~\u20091.3\u2009×\u200910−17 cm2 s−1 during charging. During discharging, the ion diffusion rate presented a rapid increase between 1.2 and 0.6 V and then gradually decreased until the cutoff voltage, indicating that the micropores were more accessible than the interlayer space in the hard carbon. The rapid decline of ion diffusion rate in the plateau region was because Na+ had to overcome a charge repulsion from the Na+ bound in micropores to insert interlayer space [29]. During charging, the detachment of Na+ from micropores was relatively easy, where a sudden increase in ion diffusion rate was also observed.\nFull cells were assembled to further evaluate the feasibility of the HS X-C anode, in which the cathode used was NVP/rGO previously reported by our group [27]. Herein, the mentioned current density and specific capacity were calculated on the weight of NVP/rGO. Figure\xa04f and g show the charge/discharge profiles and cycle performance at 0.1 A g−1(cathode). The charge/discharge profiles displayed a long voltage platform, low polarization and high operating potential. The charge potential plateau reached 3.4 V, ensuring high energy density of full cells. As shown in Fig.\xa04g, the full cell had good cycle stability. Based on the total weight of the anode and the cathode as well as an average operating voltage of 3.3 V, it could be calculated that the full cell delivered a high energy density of about 180 Wh kg−1(total). The rate performance is shown in Fig.\xa04h. When cycling at different current densities from 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.1 A g−1, the stable capacities were 97, 95, 88, 79 and 95 mAh g−1, respectively. These results indicated that the HS X-C was a potential anode for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Xanthium sibiricum fruits were taken from nature. After washing and drying, they were ground into powder with a grinder. Then, 2 g powder and 8 g NaCl were added into a steel tank with a ball-to-material ratio of 15:1 and milled on a planetary mill at 550 rpm for 6 h; subsequently, the high-temperature treatment was divided into two stages. First, the milled mixture was transferred to a corundum boat and annealed at 600 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere. After natural cooling, the solid was washed with distilled water to remove NaCl. Second, the collected product was dried at 110 °C in vacuum for 8 h and then further annealed in argon at 1000 °C for 2 h. The final product was labelled as HS X-C. For comparison, the hard carbon from Xanthium sibiricum fruits without the assistance of NaCl template was prepared through directly annealing the milled Xanthium sibiricum fruits at 1000 °C for 2 h, which was labelled as X-C. During annealing treatments, heating rate and argon flow used were 5 °C min−1 and 80 mL min−1, respectively.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe morphology, microstructure and composition of the synthesized products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini-500), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford max150). The specific surface area measurement was performed on a Micromeritics 2460 tester at 77 K, during which N2 was used as the adsorption/desorption gas. The graphitization degree of carbon was investigated by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Discover) and a Raman spectrometer (Witec alpha300). The chemical states and contents of the elements were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Escalab 250xi) and elemental analysis (EA, elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurement\nThe Na+ storage properties of the as-synthesized hard carbon were measured by the assembled 2032 cells. The working electrode was composed of the tested material, Super P carbon black and sodium alginate in a weight ratio of 75:10:15, in which copper foil served as the current collector and the active material loading was about 1.0\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. In a half cell, the counter electrode was Na metal disc. In a full cell, the cathode was composed of Na3V2(PO4)3/rGO, the preparation of which was referred to our previous work [27], Super P carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride in a weight of 83:10:7. The positive and negative capacity ratio is 1:1.2. The electrolyte was 1\xa0M NaPF6 in diglyme, while the separator was glass fibre (Whatman GF/A). Galvanostatic charge/discharge and galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) measurements were performed on a Neware battery tester. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurements were performed on an EC-lab electrochemical workstation. The amplitude and frequency range for EIS were 10\xa0mV and 100\xa0kHz–100\xa0mHz, respectively.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Xanthium sibiricum fruits were taken from nature. After washing and drying, they were ground into powder with a grinder. Then, 2 g powder and 8 g NaCl were added into a steel tank with a ball-to-material ratio of 15:1 and milled on a planetary mill at 550 rpm for 6 h; subsequently, the high-temperature treatment was divided into two stages. First, the milled mixture was transferred to a corundum boat and annealed at 600 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere. After natural cooling, the solid was washed with distilled water to remove NaCl. Second, the collected product was dried at 110 °C in vacuum for 8 h and then further annealed in argon at 1000 °C for 2 h. The final product was labelled as HS X-C. For comparison, the hard carbon from Xanthium sibiricum fruits without the assistance of NaCl template was prepared through directly annealing the milled Xanthium sibiricum fruits at 1000 °C for 2 h, which was labelled as X-C. During annealing treatments, heating rate and argon flow used were 5 °C min−1 and 80 mL min−1, respectively.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe morphology, microstructure and composition of the synthesized products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini-500), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford max150). The specific surface area measurement was performed on a Micromeritics 2460 tester at 77 K, during which N2 was used as the adsorption/desorption gas. The graphitization degree of carbon was investigated by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Discover) and a Raman spectrometer (Witec alpha300). The chemical states and contents of the elements were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Escalab 250xi) and elemental analysis (EA, elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurement\nThe Na+ storage properties of the as-synthesized hard carbon were measured by the assembled 2032 cells. The working electrode was composed of the tested material, Super P carbon black and sodium alginate in a weight ratio of 75:10:15, in which copper foil served as the current collector and the active material loading was about 1.0\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. In a half cell, the counter electrode was Na metal disc. In a full cell, the cathode was composed of Na3V2(PO4)3/rGO, the preparation of which was referred to our previous work [27], Super P carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride in a weight of 83:10:7. The positive and negative capacity ratio is 1:1.2. The electrolyte was 1\xa0M NaPF6 in diglyme, while the separator was glass fibre (Whatman GF/A). Galvanostatic charge/discharge and galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) measurements were performed on a Neware battery tester. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurements were performed on an EC-lab electrochemical workstation. The amplitude and frequency range for EIS were 10\xa0mV and 100\xa0kHz–100\xa0mHz, respectively.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD patterns of SnO2 has strong XRD peaks at 26.4°, 33.9°, and 51.8°, which corresponds to the standard card of SnO2. There is a small amount of SnO and SnO2 in the XRD patterns of the three Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites, which is related to the oxidation of Sn in the sample in the environment. In addition, Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites contain a small amount of CoSn2. By comparing with the standard XRD card, the diffraction peaks of the three Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites at 31°, 32°, 44°, and 45° correspond to (200), (101), (220), and (211) crystal faces of Sn (JCPDS No.04-0673). No significant peaks of Co and Zn are detected in Fig. 2a, which is because the reduction temperature is low and Co is not reduced,15 while Zn may be reduced but exists in an amorphous state.16 This indicates that SnO2 particles coated inside are successfully reduced to Sn particles. This is because in an inert atmosphere, SnO2 can be reduced to Sn at 700°C.17 The XRD patterns of three Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites were compared. With the increase of SnO2, the diffraction peak of Sn was enhanced. Indirectly, the content of Sn element in Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite is gradually increasing.\nThe Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite was analyzed using thermal analysis, with the thermogravimetric test conducted in air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10°C min−1 and a temperature range of 40–800°C. As shown in Fig. 2b, there is a slight mass loss below 300°C due to the evaporation of environmental water-absorbing material and organic matter decomposition. The weight loss for 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites was measured at 48.0%, 40.1%, and 37.6%, respectively, between temperatures of 300°C and 500°C, attributed to C and N loss as well as oxidation of Sn, Zn, and Co. Finally, the thermal analysis curve stabilized, indicating stable oxide formation (SnO2, ZnO, and Co3O4). Results show that an increase in SnO2 content leads to higher residual oxide after heat treatment in air atmosphere, resulting in decreased weight loss rate.\nIn order to analyze and compare the functional groups of SnO2 and three types of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites, FT-IR spectroscopy was employed for functional group determination. As shown in Fig. 2c, a prominent infrared peak corresponding to the Sn-O bond is observed in the infrared spectrum of SnO2 at approximately 641\xa0cm−1, confirming successful synthesis as supported by XRD results. Comparison of the infrared spectra of the three types of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites reveals an infrared peak at around 1586\xa0cm−1 attributed to C=N stretching vibration, while a stretching vibration peak at about 2333\xa0cm−1 corresponds to the C=C bond. The presence of a weak Sn-O bond in the infrared spectrum of 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite is indicative of oxidation due to exposure to air,18 consistent with aforementioned XRD results.\nThe structure and properties of carbon in three Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites were investigated using Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2d, there are three prominent Raman peaks at approximately 1316\xa0cm−1, 1574\xa0cm−1, and 2983\xa0cm−1, corresponding to the D, G, and 2D bands, respectively. The ID/IG band strength ratios for the 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites are measured as 0.96, 1.00, and 0.97, respectively. The higher ID/IG band intensity ratio observed in the case of the 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite suggests that when adding SnO2 at a quantity of 50\xa0mg, more defects or disordered structures are formed within the interior of the Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite, allowing for greater Na+ storage capacity.19\nThe surface morphology and elemental composition of Zn/Co-NPC, SnO2, and three types of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites were examined using SEM and elemental mapping tests. The morphology of the Zn/Co-NPC composites is characterized by a rhombohedral dodecahedron structure (Fig. 3a). The SEM image in Fig. 3b shows that SnO2 consists of uniformly dispersed spherical particles with a size of about 300\xa0nm. Compared to the SEM photos in Fig. 3c–e, the three composites maintain the rhombohedral dodecahedron structure of Zn/Co-NPC composites, with uniform particles. Six elements C, N, O, Sn, Co, and Zn coexist in the 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite (Fig. 3f–l). By comparing Fig. 3f and i, Sn is distributed in the rhombohedral structure, which means that Sn is successfully wrapped in the Zn/Co-NPC composite.\nWith an increase in SnO2 content in the precursor (Table SI), there is a corresponding increase in the content of Sn. However, this addition provides higher sodium storage capacity for the Zn/Co-NPC composites and improves their electrochemical performance.\nTEM investigation was conducted on the 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite, as shown in Fig. 4. The TEM image in Fig. 4a shows a regular rhombohedral dodecahedron structure with many small particles scattered within. In Fig. 4b, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows the lattice stripes of Sn and CoSn2, where the lattice stripe spacing of CoSn2 is 0.201\xa0nm, corresponding to the (220) crystal face of CoSn2, and the lattice stripe spacing of Sn is 0.27\xa0nm and 0.204\xa0nm corresponding to the (10) and (220) crystal faces of Sn, respectively. Figure 4c and d show the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) ring diagram of the 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite. The SAED is matched with the Sn (211), Sn (301), Sn (112), Sn (103), Sn (541), Sn (640), Sn (701), CoSn2 (002), CoSn2 (310), CoSn2 (413), and CoSn2 (622) crystal faces, respectively. The results are consistent with the XRD results above.\nXPS was used to determine the elemental composition and valence states of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composites, and the test results are shown in Fig. 5a–g. In the N 1s spectral diagram of Fig. 5a, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC has three fitted XPS peaks at 398.5 eV, 400.1 eV, and 401.1\xa0eV, belonging to pyridine nitrogen, pyrrole nitrogen, and graphitic nitrogen, respectively, indicating the presence of N in the composite.20 As shown in Fig. 5b, the XPS peaks of the C1s spectrum at 284.7 eV, 286.0 eV, and 288.0\xa0eV correspond to the C–C/C=C, C=N, and C=O/C–N bonds, respectively, indicating that N is doped in porous carbon.21 In Fig. 5c, the two fitting peaks of the Sn 3d spectrum at 495.2 eV and 486.7\xa0eV belong to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively, which confirms the presence of the Sn ion. As shown in Fig. 5d, the two fitted XPS peaks shown at 531.2 eV and 532.4\xa0eV belong to Sn–O, and the peak present at 530.8\xa0eV belongs to the C=O bond,22 which is due to the oxidation of the material exposed to air. The Co 2p spectrum in Fig. 5e shows two fitting peaks near 796.0 eV and 780.6\xa0eV corresponding to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. The Zn 2p spectrum has two distinct peaks at 1022.0 eV and 1044.9\xa0eV, corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the presence of Zn2+, which is due to the oxidation of Zn in the air. As shown in Fig. 5g, the full-spectrum of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC proves the presence of C, N, O, Sn, Zn, and Co, which is consistent with the above elemental analysis. In addition, the strength and binding energy of various elements did not change substantially, indicating that the stability of the material is good.\nIt can be seen from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms in Fig. 6a that all three composites belong to type IV isotherms. In addition, there are obvious hysteresis loops in the P/P0 range of 0.46–0.99, indicating that a large number of mesopores are generated in the material. The specific surface areas of 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC are 360.69 m2\xa0g−1, 364.89 m2\xa0g−1, and 417.38 m2\xa0g−1, respectively, and the corresponding average pore sizes are 9.76 nm, 12.06\xa0nm, and 6.79\xa0nm, respectively. The results indicated that the specific surface area increased gradually with the increase of SnO2 content. It can be found from Fig. 6b that 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite has a higher average pore diameter, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite has the smallest. During the heat treatment process, a large amount of SnO2 is converted to Sn and CoSn2, at which time the position once occupied by SnO2 becomes a hole. As a result, the three composites exhibit irregular mean pore sizes.\n\nCharacterization of the Electrochemical Performance\nIn order to investigate the electrochemical sodium storage mechanism of SnO2 and Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials, cyclic voltammetry tests were conducted at a scanning rate of 0.1\xa0mV\xa0s−1 (0.01–3.00\xa0V). As shown in Fig. 7a–c, wide cathode peaks appeared near 0.23\xa0V, 0.25\xa0V, and 0.34\xa0V during the initial cathode scan of the three composites, with subsequent cycles showing peak shift and strength weakening due to alloying reaction of Sn and Na, SEI film formation, and irreversible reactions.23,24 Additionally, the cathode peak near 0.02\xa0V is attributed to the alloying reaction of Sn and Na along with Na embedding into the carbon framework.25 In anode scanning, anode peaks around 0.25\xa0V, 0.56\xa0V. and 1.25\xa0V correspond to reversible dealloying of the NaxSn phase during oxidation.26\nComparatively analyzing CV curves for the three Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials reveals that there is no significant change in shape for the CV curve of the 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material during second and third cycles indicating better reaction kinetics and improved electrochemical performance during charge/discharge processes.\nFigure 7d illustrates CV curve for SnO2 electrode. The cathode peak at 0.52\xa0V is attributed to irreversible decomposition with the electrolyte as well as multi-step reaction between Na+ and SnO2. The anode peaks near 0.2\xa0V and 1.25\xa0V belong to dealloying reaction between Sn and Na.27 The oxidation peak and reduction peak intensity decreased in the second/third cycles suggesting irreversible capacity loss during charge/discharge.\nAs shown in Fig. 7e, the constant discharge/charge curves for the first three cycles of the 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material at current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 indicate the initial discharge capacity of 549.10 mAh g−l and the initial Coulomb efficiency reaching 78.55%. The irreversible capacity is attributed to SEI film formation and also irreversible reaction consistent with above CV curves.\nFigure 8a shows the Nyquist diagram for five different electrode materials. The lines and semicircles in the Nyquist diagram represent the low frequency and high frequency regions, respectively.28 The semi-circle of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material is smaller than that of pure SnO2, indicating that Zn/Co-NPC composite can alleviate the volume change during charge and discharge to some extent, which is more conducive to the diffusion of Na+.29 In the fitted circuit diagram, Rct represents charge transfer resistance, Rs and Rf represent component solution resistance, CPE1 and CPE2 represent double layer capacitance, and W0 represents diffusion impedance.30 The Rct values of SnO2, 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and Zn/Co-NPC electrodes were 202.34 Ω, 121.30 Ω, 21.82 Ω, 97.24 Ω, and 26.08 Ω, respectively. 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC has a small Rct value, indicating that the material is conducive to the rapid and stable embedding/removal of Na+ during charge and discharge, and has the best electrochemical performance.31\nFigure 8b shows the rate performance of five different electrode materials at 100 mA\xa0g−1, 200 mA\xa0g−1, 500 mA\xa0g−1, 1000 mA\xa0g−1, and 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 current densities to explore the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials. The rate properties of five electrode materials are compared and analyzed. 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC has high discharge specific capacity and the best rate properties. 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC has a higher capacity returning to the current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1, but shows large capacity fluctuations overall. At the current density of 100–1000\xa0mA\xa0g−1The average specific discharge capacities of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials are 366.13 mAh g−1, 303.07 mAh g−1, 279.43 mAh g−1, and 255.15 mAh g−1, respectively, and the corresponding specific discharge capacities show a slight step-down. When the current density is restored to 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1, the average discharge specific capacity is 308.18 mAh g−1, and the specific capacity can remain stable. 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials show the best rate performance because wrapping an appropriate amount of Sn is conducive to providing a wider and more stable channel for the transport of Na+, thereby improving its electrochemical performance.\nFigure 9a shows the cycling properties and 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC Coulomb efficiency of Zn/Co-NPC, SnO2, and Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials at 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 current density. By comparing and analyzing the cyclic properties of the five materials, the initial discharge specific capacities of Zn/Co-NPC, SnO2, 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC were 450.80 mAh g−1, 786.30 mAh g−1, 487.20 mAh g−1, 536.40 mAh g−1, and 549.10 mAh g−1, respectively.\nSn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material shows better cycling performance than SnO2, and 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material has the best cycling performance. Obviously, SnO2 does not have the protection of carbon materials and has poor electrical conductivity, so the volume changes greatly during the charging and discharging process, resulting in structural damage, and the contact rate between the active substance and Na+ becomes low, resulting in the maximum capacity attenuation. When the amount of SnO2 is too great, its late capacity is lower, and lower than that of uncoated Zn/Co-NPC composites. It is because Sn is difficult to combine well with the carbon framework of Zn/Co-NPC, so the problem of volume change is not well alleviated. After 100 cycles, the discharge specific capacity of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material is still 334.90 mAh g−1, which is higher than some previous results (Table SII). Compared with 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials not only inherit the stability of Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials, but also have a certain degree of improvement in the specific capacity. Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material exhibits excellent cyclic stability, indicating that stable carbon frame structure has a good protective effect on active substances.\nFigure 9b shows the cycling performance of Zn/Co-NPC, SnO2, and Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials for 200 cycles at a current density of 500\xa0mA\xa0g−1 and Coulomb efficiency of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC. The long-term cycling performance of Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials at a high current density is explored. The initial discharge specific capacities of Zn/Co-NPC, SnO2, 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC were 410.70 mAh g−1, 790.10 mAh g−1, 476.30 mAh g−1, 506.00 mAh g−1, and 537.10 mAh g−1, respectively. The initial Coulomb efficiency of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material is 68.12%. After 200 cycles, the specific discharge capacities of the five electrode materials were 222.30 mAh g−1, 100.57 mAh g−1, 207.00 mAh g−1, 275.80 mAh g−1, and 209.00 mAh g−1, respectively.\nSnO2 has the highest initial discharge capacity, but the later capacity attenuation is very serious, which is due to the volume change during the cycle, resulting in the destruction of the electrode material structure. However, the three groups of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials show better cyclic stability than SnO2 electrode due to the protection of the outer carbon material. The discharge specific capacity of Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials shows a small increase, which is caused by the gradual activation of active substances in the cycle.32 Comparing the cyclic properties of three kinds of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials still have excellent long-term cycle stability and high discharge specific capacity under high current density. On the one hand, the carbon frame structure of Zn/Co-NPC composite not only provides sufficient space for the transport of Na+, but also plays a role in alleviating the volume change in the cycle. On the other hand, the unique mesopore structure can provide additional transmission channels for Na+.33  It can be concluded that the effective coating of Zn/Co-NPC composite with appropriate Sn has the best electrochemical performance.\nIn order to further analyze the electrochemical kinetic mechanism of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode materials, CV tests were performed at different scanning rates (0.1–1.0\xa0mV\xa0s−1). As shown in Fig. 10a, under different scanning rates, the shape of CV curve of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material does not change significantly, indicating that this material has good electrochemical reaction kinetics and weak polarization. As can be seen from the relationship between scanning rate and current in Fig. 10b, the b values calculated by oxidation peak (Peak 1) and reduction peak (Peak 2) are 0.78 and 0.90, respectively, which is close to 1.0. The electrochemical sodium storage behavior of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material is mainly determined by the capacitor control behavior.34 As shown in Fig. 10c, at 0.8\xa0mV\xa0s−1, the pseudo-capacitance contribution of 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material is about 72.00% by fitting the formula i\u2009=\u2009k1v\u2009+\u2009k2v1/2. As shown in Fig. 10d, at scanning rates of 0.1 mV\xa0s−1, 0.2 mV\xa0s−1, 0.4 mV\xa0s−1, 0.6 mV\xa0s−1, and 1.0\xa0mV\xa0s−1, the corresponding capacitance contribution rates are 42.10%, 60.50%, 65.20%, 69.00%, and 74.60%, respectively. As the scan rate increases, so does the contribution rate of capacitive control. The results show that the capacitive control behavior plays a dominant role in the electrochemical reaction as the scanning rate increases. High capacitance contribution rate represents the fast transmission capability of Na+, and 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC has good magnification performance and excellent electrochemical performance at high rates.35\nThe sodium diffusion coefficient can be derived from the Randles-Sevcik equation (Ip\u2009=\u2009269,000\u2009×\u2009n3/2\u2009×\u2009A\u2009×\u2009D1/2\u2009×\u2009C\u2009×\u2009V1/2), where Ip is the peak current [mA], n is the number of electrons transferred in the electrode reaction, A is the electrode active surface area [cm2], D is the sodium diffusion coefficient [cm2 s−1], C is the Na+ ion concentration (mol cm−3), and V is the CV scanning rate [mV s−1]. The slope of the relationship between the peak oxidation current and the square root of the scanning rate is obtained by linear fitting to calculate the diffusion coefficient (Fig. S1). The oxidation peak diffusion coefficient is 1.968\u2009×\u200910−12 cm2\xa0s−1. This is due to the unique mesopore structure in the material providing additional transport channels for Na+, reducing transfer barriers.\nIn order to analyze the influence of constant current charge and discharge on the electrode material structure, the battery was disassembled after 100 cycles at  current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 and the electrode sheet was taken out, and the SEM test was carried out immediately. The results are shown in Fig. 11. 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material has a flat surface and uniform particles, and no particle damage phenomenon, indicating that the electrode material has a stable cycling performance. In contrast, the surface of 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material shows obvious agglomeration and particle shedding phenomenon, resulting in uneven distribution of active substances on the electrode surface, resulting in capacity attenuation during the cycle. The results show that when too much SnO2 is coated, the porous carbon frame cannot alleviate the damage caused by the volume change in the cycle. It is further proved that Sn@Zn/Co-NPC obtained with appropriate amount of SnO2 has the best electrochemical performance in the coating experiment of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC composite.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Methanol was supplied by Tianjin Yongda Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP) was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Except for SnC2O4, which is 98% pure, all other reagents are analytically pure.\n\nPreparation of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC\nThe process of material synthesis is illustrated in Fig. 1. Initially, stannous oxalate was heated in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5°C min−1 until it reached 600°C, and then maintained at this temperature for 2\xa0h. Subsequently, SnO2 particles were obtained after the cooling process for the subsequent experiment.\nQuantities of 20\xa0mg, 50\xa0mg, and 80\xa0mg of SnO2 were dispersed in 20\xa0mL methanol for a duration of 30\xa0min using ultrasonication. The ultrasonic solution was then slowly added to a mixture of 10\xa0mL anhydrous methanol and 2.00\xa0g PVP, and stirred for another 30\xa0min to form solution A. Subsequently, 10\xa0mL of methanol dissolved with 2-methylimidazole (1.23\xa0g) was added to the above solution A under continued magnetic stirring for an additional 20\xa0min. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.60\xa0g) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.62\xa0g) were placed into separate containers of 10\xa0mL methanol and then ultrasonically examined at room temperature, denoted as solutions B and C, respectively. Solutions B and C were then successively poured into the stirred solution A followed by magnetic stirring for an additional 10\xa0min. The obtained solution was transferred into a 100\xa0mL reactor where it reacted at 120°C for 4\xa0h. After cooling to room temperature, the purple mixed solution was centrifuged, cleaned with anhydrous methanol, and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80°C. The hydrothermal method for preparing Zn/Co-ZIFs was the same as above.\nThe material was then heat-treated in N2 and kept at 700°C for 2\xa0h. After the cooling of the furnace to room temperature, the obtained materials were designated as Zn/Co-NPC, 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC.\n\nMaterial Characterization\nFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Bruker VERTEX 70, 400–4000\xa0cm−1) was used to analyze the internal functional groups of the materials. The phase composition and crystal structure of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX 2500PC, Cu-Kα radiation, λ\u2009=\u20090.154056\xa0nm, angle range 10–80°). Raman spectroscopy (Raman microscope, DXR 3, test wavelength 532\xa0nm, test range 50–3000\xa0cm−1) was used to analyze whether there are defects in the internal structure of the material and the degree of graphitization of the carbon part. The thermal analysis (TGA, STA 449C, O2, 10°C min−1, temperature range 40–800°C) under an oxygen atmosphere was performed and calculated to obtain the weight percentage of Sn and carbon in the composites. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Mg-Ka radiation) were analyzed, and the valence states and conjugated bonds of elements were determined by analyzing and fitting the high-resolution photoelectron spectral images of different elements. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Scios, 0.5–30\xa0kV, 0.6 pA~65 nA) was used to analyze the surface morphology of the materials. The distribution and proportion of elements were analyzed by EDS mapping. The materials were tested by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2800, 200\xa0kV), and the internal structure and crystal information of the composites were analyzed. Nitrogen isothermal adsorption-desorption test (BET, desorption temperature 200°C, 10\xa0h, test temperature 77.3\xa0K). The isotherm type, specific surface area, and pore size distribution of the sample were tested by BET.\n\nElectrochemical Measurement\nThe active material/acetylene black/PVDF (7:1.5:1.5 ratio) was mixed, and a small amount of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was added to form a slurry. This slurry was then coated on copper foil and vacuum-dried at 80°C for 12\xa0h. Afterward, it was cut into electrode sheets with a diameter of 8\xa0mm and vacuum-dried at 105°C for 24\xa0h. The electrode sheets were then transferred to a glove box filled with high-purity argon. A model 2032 button battery was assembled with the sodium sheet as the counter electrode, GF/D as the diaphragm, and 1\xa0M NaPF6 (DIGLYME, 100 vol.%) as the electrolyte. Constant-current charge–discharge tests were performed on a Landt CT2001A tester at room temperature, and cyclic voltammetry (CV, 0.01–3\xa0V) and electrochemical impedance (EIS, 0.01–100000\xa0Hz) were measured on a PGSTAT204 electrochemical workstation.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Subsequently, SnO2 particles were obtained after the cooling process for the subsequent experiment.\nQuantities of 20\xa0mg, 50\xa0mg, and 80\xa0mg of SnO2 were dispersed in 20\xa0mL methanol for a duration of 30\xa0min using ultrasonication.

Methanol was supplied by Tianjin Yongda Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP) was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Except for SnC2O4, which is 98% pure, all other reagents are analytically pure.\n\nPreparation of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC\nThe process of material synthesis is illustrated in Fig. 1. Initially, stannous oxalate was heated in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5°C min−1 until it reached 600°C, and then maintained at this temperature for 2\xa0h. Subsequently, SnO2 particles were obtained after the cooling process for the subsequent experiment.\nQuantities of 20\xa0mg, 50\xa0mg, and 80\xa0mg of SnO2 were dispersed in 20\xa0mL methanol for a duration of 30\xa0min using ultrasonication. The ultrasonic solution was then slowly added to a mixture of 10\xa0mL anhydrous methanol and 2.00\xa0g PVP, and stirred for another 30\xa0min to form solution A. Subsequently, 10\xa0mL of methanol dissolved with 2-methylimidazole (1.23\xa0g) was added to the above solution A under continued magnetic stirring for an additional 20\xa0min. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.60\xa0g) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.62\xa0g) were placed into separate containers of 10\xa0mL methanol and then ultrasonically examined at room temperature, denoted as solutions B and C, respectively. Solutions B and C were then successively poured into the stirred solution A followed by magnetic stirring for an additional 10\xa0min. The obtained solution was transferred into a 100\xa0mL reactor where it reacted at 120°C for 4\xa0h. After cooling to room temperature, the purple mixed solution was centrifuged, cleaned with anhydrous methanol, and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80°C. The hydrothermal method for preparing Zn/Co-ZIFs was the same as above.\nThe material was then heat-treated in N2 and kept at 700°C for 2\xa0h. After the cooling of the furnace to room temperature, the obtained materials were designated as Zn/Co-NPC, 20Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC, and 80Sn@Zn/Co-NPC.\n\nMaterial Characterization\nFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Bruker VERTEX 70, 400–4000\xa0cm−1) was used to analyze the internal functional groups of the materials. The phase composition and crystal structure of Sn@Zn/Co-NPC were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX 2500PC, Cu-Kα radiation, λ\u2009=\u20090.154056\xa0nm, angle range 10–80°). Raman spectroscopy (Raman microscope, DXR 3, test wavelength 532\xa0nm, test range 50–3000\xa0cm−1) was used to analyze whether there are defects in the internal structure of the material and the degree of graphitization of the carbon part. The thermal analysis (TGA, STA 449C, O2, 10°C min−1, temperature range 40–800°C) under an oxygen atmosphere was performed and calculated to obtain the weight percentage of Sn and carbon in the composites. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Mg-Ka radiation) were analyzed, and the valence states and conjugated bonds of elements were determined by analyzing and fitting the high-resolution photoelectron spectral images of different elements. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Scios, 0.5–30\xa0kV, 0.6 pA~65 nA) was used to analyze the surface morphology of the materials. The distribution and proportion of elements were analyzed by EDS mapping. The materials were tested by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2800, 200\xa0kV), and the internal structure and crystal information of the composites were analyzed. Nitrogen isothermal adsorption-desorption test (BET, desorption temperature 200°C, 10\xa0h, test temperature 77.3\xa0K). The isotherm type, specific surface area, and pore size distribution of the sample were tested by BET.\n\nElectrochemical Measurement\nThe active material/acetylene black/PVDF (7:1.5:1.5 ratio) was mixed, and a small amount of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was added to form a slurry. This slurry was then coated on copper foil and vacuum-dried at 80°C for 12\xa0h. Afterward, it was cut into electrode sheets with a diameter of 8\xa0mm and vacuum-dried at 105°C for 24\xa0h. The electrode sheets were then transferred to a glove box filled with high-purity argon. A model 2032 button battery was assembled with the sodium sheet as the counter electrode, GF/D as the diaphragm, and 1\xa0M NaPF6 (DIGLYME, 100 vol.%) as the electrolyte. Constant-current charge–discharge tests were performed on a Landt CT2001A tester at room temperature, and cyclic voltammetry (CV, 0.01–3\xa0V) and electrochemical impedance (EIS, 0.01–100000\xa0Hz) were measured on a PGSTAT204 electrochemical workstation.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

As shown in Fig. 2a, the Sn/SnO2/C material has a high degree of crystallinity, and by comparing Sn (PDF#04-0673) and SnO2 (PDF#41-1445), it can be seen that the material contains Sn and SnO2. Since the carbon material is amorphous, the figure does not show any obvious carbon peaks. It can be seen in Fig. 2a that the characteristic peaks around 30.6°, 32°, 44°, and 45° correspond to the (200), (101), (220), and (211) crystal planes of Sn, respectively, and the characteristic peaks around 26.5°, 34°, and 51° correspond to the (110), (101), and (211) crystal planes of SnO2, respectively. By combining this with TGA tests, it can be observed that SnC2O4 firstly decomposes into SnO2 after heat treatment and is subsequently reduced to elemental Sn in the presence of carbon.16 At the same temperature, the peak ratio of SnO2 to Sn was found to decrease progressively with the increase in carbon content, which is due to the increase in the proportion of carbon material resulting in a larger contact area during the carbothermal reduction process, and hence better reduction. At the same ratio, it was found that the peak ratio of SnO2 to Sn decreased with the increase in temperature, which is because the reduction effect is more obvious with higher temperature.\nTGA testing of the material gives the degree of thermal reduction of carbon in the material. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the TG curve under nitrogen atmosphere shows self-decomposition of SnC2O4 at 300°C to 400°C, and the subsequent decrease in the curve around 840°C is due to the carbothermal reduction of SnO2 to elemental Sn.17 As there is a large mass loss in the original material between 800°C and 1000°C, the heat treatment temperatures were set to 800°C, 900°C, and 1000°C. The content of each component in the material was obtained by TGA testing of Sn/SnO2/C-519 composites under an oxygen atmosphere. From the figure it can be seen that there is an increase in weight between 450°C and 600°C, which is due to the oxidation of Sn in air by SnO2.  The subsequent decrease in mass is due to the oxidation of C in air to CO2, accompanied by the oxidation of Sn.18 After a series of reactions, 95.90% of the material weight remains. Combining the weight ratio of Sn to SnO2 obtained from the XRD results and the total weight of the final product (Fig. S1), the weight ratio of Sn:SnO2:C in the composites was obtained using Eqs. (1) and (2), yielding values of 6.84:74.62:18.54 (Sn/SnO2/C-518), 53.99:6.60:39.41(Sn/SnO2/C-219), 68.66:8.75:22.59 (Sn/SnO2/C-519), 63.49:29.60:6.91 (Sn/SnO2/C-819), and 77.79:10.31:11.9 (Sn/SnO2/C-5110).\nThe samples obtained from the heat treatment were subjected to SEM testing to analyze the surface morphology of the material. As shown in Fig. 3a, no Sn spheres were formed in the samples treated at 800°C, but some SnC2O4 forms were retained. This is because the melting point of SnO2 produced by the self-decomposition of SnC2O4 is much higher than that of the heat-treatment temperature, and only a small amount of SnO2 is reduced to elemental Sn. In addition, the presence of a large amount of SnO2 affects the mobility of the small amount of Sn. The samples treated at 900°C already had obvious Sn spheres produced, indicating that SnO2 can be reduced to elemental Sn at 900°C and that the elemental Sn melts and aggregates into Sn spheres at high temperatures. Compared with the samples treated at 900°C, it was found that the samples treated at 1000°C had Sn spheres of larger diameter, probably due to the higher temperature, which makes the growth of Sn spheres more efficient, resulting in the formation of larger particle size of Sn spheres.19 A comparison of Fig. 3b, d, and e shows that with the increase in the mixing ratio of SnC2O4 and carbon, the Sn spheres gradually become larger and more numerous, which is due to the difference in the reduction degree of the material due to the difference in the contact area and content of carbon and SnC2O4.\nThe Sn/SnO2/C-519 electrode material was tested by TEM. In Fig. 4a, it can be seen that the material consists of irregular spherical particles, which is because SnC2O4 is partially reduced to elemental Sn during the carbothermal reduction process, and the elemental Sn melts into small particles at high temperature. Lattice fringes of 0.153\xa0nm and 0.183\xa0nm, corresponding to the (211) and (200) crystal planes of Sn, respectively, can be observed from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Fig. 4b. In Fig. 4c, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) rings correspond to the Sn (200), Sn (101), SnO2 (301), SnO2 (312), SnO2 (431), and SnO2 (004) crystal planes. This indicates that the material contains Sn and SnO2 internally, which can be correlated with the above XRD results. The presence of C, O, and Sn in the material can be seen from the elemental mapping diagram in Fig. 4d, where C is distributed around the Sn spheres and represents unreacted carbon, while O is distributed on the surface of the Sn spheres due to the oxidation of the surface of the Sn particles in air and the presence of SnO2.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the five composites belong to type IV N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. It can be seen that the specific surface area and the average pore size of Sn/SnO2/C-518, Sn/SnO2/C-219, Sn/SnO2/C-519, Sn/SnO2/C-819, and Sn/SnO2/C-5110 are 34.20\xa0m2\xa0g−1/2.67\xa0nm, 68.83\xa0m2\xa0g−1/2.81\xa0nm, 39.14\xa0m2\xa0g−1/2.07\xa0nm, 27.50\xa0m2\xa0g−1/2.68\xa0nm, and 40.61\xa0m2\xa0g−1/2.42\xa0nm, respectively. The specific surface area increases with the addition of carbon, which is mainly related to the larger specific surface area of acetylene black. At the same proportion, the specific surface area was found to increase gradually with increasing temperature, probably because some of the carbon was encapsulated during Sn aggregation and consumed in the subsequent reduction process, resulting in the formation of pores at this location. This structure can increase the contact area between the Sn spheres and the electrolyte and shorten the ion transport path, thus improving the diffusion efficiency of Na+.20\nXPS tests were used to analyze the elemental composition and chemical valence states of the Sn/SnO2/C-519 electrode material. Figure 6a shows the full spectrum of Sn/SnO2/C-519, from which it can be seen that the peaks correspond to the elements C, O, and Sn, respectively, and the O element is mainly present in SnO2. Figure 6b shows the Sn 3d spectrum, where the peaks at 495.43\xa0eV and 486.99\xa0eV correspond to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, respectively.21 This confirms that the material contains Sn ions, which is due to the presence of SnO2. The three peaks obtained by fitting the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 6c) represent C–C/C=C, C–O, and C=O, which are located near 284.80\xa0eV, 285.77\xa0eV, and 289.73\xa0eV, respectively, and correspond to the small amount of C=O and C–O bonds contained in the acetylene black. Three peaks were obtained by fitting the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 6d) for C–O, C=O, and Sn–O bonds located near 533.77\xa0eV, 531.97\xa0eV, and 530.78\xa0eV, respectively, and the Sn–O bonds were generated by the presence of SnO2.22\n\nCharacterization of the electrochemical performance\nFigure 7a shows the cycling performance of the five electrode materials at 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 current density. It can be seen that the initial discharge specific capacities of Sn/SnO2/C-518, Sn/SnO2/C-219, Sn/SnO2/C-519, Sn/SnO2/C-819, and Sn/SnO2/C-5110 were 705.4, 644.0, 845.5, 929.6, and 863.4\xa0mAh\xa0g−1, respectively, and it was found that the specific capacity of the initial discharge gradually increased as the Sn content increased. The coulombic efficiency of Sn/SnO2/C-519 was 69.49% in the first cycle and gradually approached 100% after three cycles, indicating the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on the surface of the material. After 100 cycles, the discharge specific capacities were 93.4, 338.7, 583.6, 416.8, and 344.6\xa0mAh\xa0g−1, respectively. It can be seen that the electrode material obtained at 800°C performs the worst in sodium-ion batteries, which is attributed to the irreversible reaction of the SnO2 and the material detachment due to the volume expansion. Sn/SnO2/C-519 shows high specific capacity and excellent cycling performance due to its high Sn content and the fact that the Sn spheres are surrounded by carbon, which can alleviate part of its volume expansion. In addition, the internal pore structure of the Sn spheres themselves gives them a greater cushion for expansion.23 When the heat treatment temperature continues to increase, the reduced Sn increases, causing more Sn to agglomerate to form larger Sn spheres, leading to an increase in the absolute volume expansion of the material during the cycling process, which in turn causes the electrode material to be crushed off and affects the cycling performance of the material.\nFigure 7b shows the first three charging and discharging curves of the Sn/SnO2/C-519 electrode material at 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1, where it can be seen that the charge plateaus around 0.16\xa0V, 0.26\xa0V, 0.53\xa0V, and 0.67\xa0V then represent the dealloying reactions of Na15Sn4, Na9Sn4, NaSn, and NaSn5.24 It can be seen that the first discharge curve does not overlap with the two subsequent discharge curves, which is due to SEI film formation and irreversible reactions, consistent with its CV curve.\nFigure 7c shows the rate performance of the five electrode materials at 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 current density. As shown in Fig. 7c, the capacity of Sn/SnO2/C-519 fluctuates very little after high current cycling, and its capacity still has good stability when the current density returns to 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1. Sn/SnO2/C-219 has a lower capacity, although its rate performance is more stable. The capacities of Sn/SnO2/C-519 at 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 current density were 576.3, 602.8, 586.83, 549.2, and 588.7\xa0mAh\xa0g−1, respectively. The capacity at 200\xa0mA\xa0g−1 current density was larger than that at 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 current density, which may be due to the activation of the cell during cycling. In overall comparison, Sn/SnO2/C-519 has the best rate performance and demonstrates better electron transfer efficiency due to its lower impedance value, which makes its rate performance better than that of the four remaining materials.\nFigure 7d shows the cycling performance of the five electrode materials at current density of 500\xa0mA\xa0g−1. There is a slight increase in the capacity of the material in the initial cycling stage, which is caused by the poor initial electrolyte wettability, the gradual completion of the wettability during cycling, and the activation of the material.25 Sn/SnO2/C-518, Sn/SnO2/C-219, Sn/SnO2/C-519, Sn/SnO2/C-819, and Sn/SnO2/C-5110 exhibited specific capacities of 59.4, 324.8, 546.1, 502.3, and 524.7\xa0mAh\xa0g−1, respectively, after cycling for 500 cycles at current density of 500\xa0mA\xa0g−1. It can be seen that the capacity retention rate of Sn/SnO2/C-518 is the lowest, which is because the volume expansion rate of SnO2 obtained by carbon thermal reduction is larger, and the material structural damage is more serious during the cycle, so that only a small amount of active material is involved in the reaction during the cycling process, and thus the capacity decays more quickly. Table I shows a comparison of the electrochemical performance of Sn/SnO2/C-519 in this study with previously reported methods.\nCV tests were performed for five electrode materials at a scan rate of 0.01\xa0mV\xa0s−1. As shown in Fig. 8, during the cathodic scanning of Sn/SnO2/C, a broad peak appears at around 0.75\xa0V to below 0.25\xa0V in the first cycle and disappears in the subsequent cycles, which is due to the irreversible reaction of Na+ with SnO2 in the material. The peak at around 0.20\xa0V is due to the formation of a SEI film on the surface of the material.33,34 Within the anodic scanning curve, it can be seen that the anodic peaks at 0.16\xa0V and 0.26\xa0V merge to around 0.24\xa0V, which is due to the higher current.20 The CV curves of the two subsequent cycles overlap well, which indicates good electrochemical reversibility.\nFigure 8f shows the Nyquist plots for different electrode materials. The straight line and the semicircle in the Nyquist plots represent the low-frequency and high-frequency regions, respectively. The straight line in the low-frequency region corresponds to the Weber impedance (W0), and the semicircle in the high-frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct).35,36 The Rct values of Sn/SnO2/C-518, Sn/SnO2/C-219, Sn/SnO2/C-519, Sn/SnO2/C-819, and Sn/SnO2/C-5110 were found to be 26.92 Ω, 26.14 Ω, 15.37\xa0Ω, 29.81\xa0Ω, and 24.73\xa0Ω, respectively. The Sn/SnO2/C-519 material has the lowest resistance value and higher charge transfer efficiency, which is conducive to the fast and stable intercalation/deintercalation of Na+. When the current density is increased, the reaction rate can be ensured under the rapid movement of Na+, and the rate performance of the material can be improved.\nThe electrochemical kinetics of the material can be further analyzed by testing the Sn/SnO2/C-519 electrode material at different scan rates. As shown in Fig. 9a, the peaks between 0.15\xa0V and 0.30\xa0V gradually merge into one peak with the increase in the scan rate, which is caused by the subsequent increase in current with the increased scan rate.26 The peaks in the CV curve do not change significantly, indicating that the material has a good rate performance, and the above results are consistent. Through the current and scan rate function equation i\u2009=\u2009avb, by taking the logarithm of both sides, we can obtain log(i)\u2009=\u2009b\u2009×\u2009log(v)\u2009+\u2009log(a), and the slope of the straight line obtained by fitting log(i) and log(v) is b. A value of b close to 1.00 indicates that the material sodium storage is mainly controlled by the capacitance, and a value of b close to 0.50 indicates that the material sodium storage is mainly controlled by the diffusion. The b values of peak 1 and peak 2 were obtained by calculating the b values for the two selected redox peaks as 0.56 and 0.92, respectively, indicating that the sodium storage of this material is controlled by a combination of diffusive and capacitive behaviors.37 The capacitance contribution ratio of the material at different scan rates is obtained by the formula i\u2009=\u2009k1v\u2009+\u2009k2v1/2.38 As shown in Fig. 9d, the capacitance contribution ratio gradually increases with the increase in the scan rate, and the diffusion rate is lower than the electron transfer rate; thus, the higher capacitance contribution ratio is favorable for the rate performance of the material.39\nThe Na+ diffusion kinetics of the materials were investigated by testing the CV curves at different scanning rates for five materials and by the Randles–Ševčík equation (Eq. 3):\nwhere Ip is the peak current [mA], n is the number of electrons transferred in the electrode reaction, A is the electrode active surface area [cm2], D is the sodium diffusion coefficient [cm2\xa0s−1], C is the Na+ ion concentration (mol\xa0cm−3), and v is the CV scanning rate [mV\xa0s−1]. The larger the slope, the higher the Na+ diffusion coefficient, as can be seen by Eq. (3). As shown in Fig. 10, Sn/SnO2/C-519 has the highest slope and its Na+ diffusion coefficient is the highest. This indicates that the appropriate amount of both SnO2 and pores in the material can expand the sodium ion transport channel and improve the Na+ transport efficiency.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Acetylene black (battery grade) was provided by Shenzhen Kejing Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nPreparation of Sn/SnO2/C\nSnC2O4 and acetylene black were weighed in a 5:1 mass ratio and ground in an agate mortar and pestle apparatus to mix well. Subsequently, the mixed material was placed in a tube atmosphere furnace filled with N2, heated to 900°C at a rate of 3°C\xa0min−1 and held at this temperature for 2\xa0h, and then cooled naturally to obtain the Sn/SnO2/C composite material. The mass ratios were 2:1, 5:1, and 8:1, and the holding temperatures were 800°C, 900°C, and 1000°C. According to the mass ratios and the different temperatures, the materials were designated as Sn/SnO2/C-518, Sn/SnO2/C-219, Sn/SnO2/C-519, Sn/SnO2/C-819, and Sn/SnO2/C-5110 (Fig. 1).\n\nMaterial Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2500PC, Cu-Kα radiation, 10°–80°) was used to determine the composition of the materials. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the materials was carried out under oxygen or nitrogen atmosphere (NETZSCH STA 449 C, O2/N2, 10°C\xa0min−1, temperature range 40–1000°C), and the results obtained were used to analyze the thermal decomposition process of materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Mg-Kα rays) was carried out to determine the elemental valence and chemical bonding by analyzing high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy images of different elements. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Scios, 0.5–30\xa0kV, 0.6\xa0pA-65\xa0nA) was carried out to analyze the surface morphology of the materials and to obtain the elemental distribution of the materials by elemental mapping. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2800, 200\xa0kV) was performed to analyze the internal crystal structure of the composites. Nitrogen isothermal adsorption–desorption tests (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller [BET], degassing temperature 200°C, 10\xa0h, test temperature 77.3\xa0K) were carried out on the materials to test the isotherm type, specific surface area size, and pore size distribution of the samples by BET.\n\nElectrochemical Measurement\nThe active material, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (mass ratio 7:1.5:1.5) were mixed, and a small amount of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) was added dropwise to form a slurry, which was subsequently uniformly coated on a copper foil and vacuum-dried at 80°C for 12\xa0h. The foils were then cut into small rounds with a diameter of 8\xa0mm, further vacuum-dried at 105°C for 24\xa0h, and subsequently transferred to a glove box. A 2032 button cell was assembled using a sodium sheet as the counter electrode, GF/A as the diaphragm, and 1\xa0M NaPF6 (DIGLYME, 100 vol.%) as the electrolyte. Constant-current charge/discharge tests were carried out using a Landt CT2001A tester in a room temperature environment.

Nitrogen isothermal adsorption–desorption tests (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller [BET], degassing temperature 200°C, 10\xa0h, test temperature 77.3\xa0K) were carried out on the materials to test the isotherm type, specific surface area size, and pore size distribution of the samples by BET.\n\nElectrochemical Measurement\nThe active material, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (mass ratio 7:1.5:1.5) were mixed, and a small amount of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) was added dropwise to form a slurry, which was subsequently uniformly coated on a copper foil and vacuum-dried at 80°C for 12\xa0h. The foils were then cut into small rounds with a diameter of 8\xa0mm, further vacuum-dried at 105°C for 24\xa0h, and subsequently transferred to a glove box. A 2032 button cell was assembled using a sodium sheet as the counter electrode, GF/A as the diaphragm, and 1\xa0M NaPF6 (DIGLYME, 100 vol.%) as the electrolyte. Constant-current charge/discharge tests were carried out using a Landt CT2001A tester in a room temperature environment. Cyclic voltammetry (CV, 0.01–1.50\xa0V) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, 0.01–100000\xa0Hz) were carried out using a Shanghai Chenhua CHI660E electrochemical analyzer.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Nanofibers in all samples are straight and neat. The figures show that the average fiber diameters gradually increase as the growing content of SnCl2·2H2O, which are 226, 260, 270\xa0nm, respectively.\nFigure\xa02 demonstrates the morphologies of carbonized Sn/C nanofibers and fiber diameter distribution. The diameters of nanofibers are located in the range of 200–500\xa0nm. Figure\xa02a–c are the morphologies of Sn/C-0.4 carbonized at 600\xa0°C, 700\xa0°C and 800\xa0°C respectively. It can be seen that the fibers are sticked together instead of straight and independent. Under the carbonization temperature of 700\xa0°C, fibers become brittle and start to break. It reveals more evident when the temperature reaches 800\xa0°C. Figure\xa02d–f are the morphologies of Sn/C-0.5 carbonized at 600\xa0°C, 700\xa0°C and 800\xa0°C respectively. Fibers are continuous and straight, but still has a few breaking sections. Figure\xa02g–i show the morphologies of Sn/C-0.6 carbonizated at 600\xa0°C, 700\xa0°C and 800\xa0°C respectively. It can be observed that the fibers of Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C are continuous and even, and Sn particles are embedded in the carbon nanofibers as expected, representing the ideal morphology for the flexible electrodes.\n\n3.2 TGA Analysis of Sn/C Anode Material\nFigure\xa03 shows the mass loss of PAN/SnCl2·2H2O and pure PAN, with TG heating from 25 to 800\xa0°C in nitrogen. It can be observed from the curve of pure PAN that few mass loss occures before 293.8\xa0°C. It is verified as the process of pre-oxidation, during which, a small amount of residual DMF evaporates, as well as cyclization and dehydrogenation reactions of PAN are taken place to make structure of PAN more stable [16]. A sharp drop appears from 296 to 450\xa0°C, indicating the decomposition of PAN during the carbonization process, in which elements of hydrogen, oxygen escape from PAN in the form of H2O, CO, CO2, etc. After 500\xa0°C, the curve tends to be flat and the mass remains 71% at 800\xa0°C.\nIn the heating of PAN/SnCl2·2H2O, reaction process includes not only the carbonization of PAN, but also the reduction of SnCl2·2H2O to Sn. The mass of PAN/SnCl2·2H2O drops faster than the pure PAN before 300\xa0°C, because of the evaporation of DMF as well as decomposition of SnCl2·2H2O to form SnO2. Afterwards, mass keep dropping by carbonization of PAN and forming Sn. The weights of PAN/SnCl2·2H2O-0.4, PAN/SnCl2·2H2O-0.5, and PAN/SnCl2·2H2O-0.6 remain 56.33%, 54.09% and 49.40% at 800\xa0°C, respectively.\n\n3.3 TEM Analysis of Sn/C Anode Material\nFigure\xa04a shows the electrode with good flexibility. From the TEM image of Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C in Fig.\xa04b, it can be observed that there are some darker areas in the fiber, which refers to certain crystalline structure of Sn particles. Figure\xa04c–f shows the Sn/C nanofiber mainly containing elements of C, Sn, and few N and O. EDS mapping was used to understand the distribution of C, N, O, and Sn elements in the fiber. From the image, it can be noticed that a certain amount of Sn (26.8 wt%) is evenly distributed in the fiber, without obvious agglomeration.\n\n3.4 Elemental Analysis of Sn/C Anode Materials\nEA testing is to confirm the content of carbon. It is revealed that the carbon contents of Sn/C-0.6–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–800\xa0°C are 42.61%, 47.26%, 49.40%, respectively. It can be seen that within a certain range, the carbon proportion of Sn/C-0.6 nanofibers gradually increases with the increase of temperature.\n\n3.5 XRD Analysis of Sn/C Anode Materials\nFigure\xa05 is the XRD diffraction patterns of the nanofibers (PAN-700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–800\xa0°C). By comparison with the standard data card (JCPDS: 26–1077), the (005), (001) crystal faces of the corresponding carbon at 26.60°, 54.15° can be seen in PAN-700\xa0°C, which proves that the PAN nanofibers have been transformed into typical amorphous carbon. Sn/C-0.6–600\xa0°C only presents the diffraction peaks of carbon, without SnO2 or Sn, maybe because the temperature is relatively low and no SnO2 or Sn crystallization has occurred. The forming of SnO2 or Sn is related with the proportion of PAN and SnCl2·2H2O as well as the carbonization condition. The diffraction peaks of the Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C and Sn/C-0.6–800\xa0°C at around 30.6°, 32°, 43.9°, 44.9°, 55.3°, 62.5°, 63.8°, 64.6°, 72.4°, 73.2°, 79.5°, 89.4° are correlated with the diffraction peaks of standard map (JCPDS: 04–0673) at (200), (101), (220), (211), (301), (112), (400), (321), (420), (411), (312), (431) of Sn. And there is no characteristic peak of SnO2 in the XRD pattern, indicating that after pre-oxidation and carbonization, all SnCl2 is decomposed and reduced to form Sn simple substance. XRD patterns of Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C and Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C nanofibers show the presence of SnO2 and Sn simultaneously. The diffraction peaks at 26.61°, 33.89°, 37.95°, 51.78°, etc. are consistent with the diffraction peaks of standard map (JCPDS: 41–1445) at (110), (101), (200), (211) of SnO2, which is in accordance with others’ work [17].\n\n3.6 Raman Analysis of Sn/C Anode Materials\nFigure\xa06 shows the Raman characteristic peaks of nanofiber films carbonized with different carbonization temperatures and different proportions of SnCl2·2H2O. Carbon materials have two characteristic peaks: D peak (1358\xa0cm−1) intensity represents the degree of disordered carbon structure, and G peak (1586\xa0cm−1) intensity represents the integrity of the graphite structure. According to the figures, under the condition of the same carbonization temperature with different proportions, there is little difference in the degree of graphitizations of Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, and Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C nanofibers. It is also proved that with the increase of carbonization temperature, the degree of graphitization nanofiber films increases by comparing characteristic peaks of Sn/C-0.6–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C, and Sn/C-0.6–800\xa0°C. It can be seen that the degree of graphitization at 800\xa0℃ is the highest among all carbonization temperatures. Therefore, under the same conditions, carbonized temperature affects the degree of graphitization evidently, but the content of Sn element has little influence on the graphitization effect.\n\n3.7 Electrochemical Impedance Spectra\nTo investigate the electronic conductivity of Sn/C nanofibers, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was performed and results are shown in Fig.\xa07. The spectra are composed of one semicircle and a slope from high frequency to low frequency. The diameter of the semicircle represents the resistance of Na+ diffusing through the surface of the electrode [18]. As shown in Fig.\xa07, Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C shows the lowest charge-transfer resistance of 37.84Ω, compared with 45.83, 46.75, 48.43, and 59.07Ω for Sn/C-0.6–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, and Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C respectively. According to the SEM images shown in Fig.\xa02, Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C possessed the most uniform and continuous nanofibers, which contributes to the charge-transfer. In addition, SnO2 impurity in Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C and Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C may also influence the electronic conductivity of Sn/C nanofibers.\n\n3.8 Charge–Discharge Performance\nFigure\xa08 shows the first three cycles of galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of sodium-ion batteries at the current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1. The initial discharge and charging capacities of PAN-700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, and Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C are 291.6/152.3, 401.8/267.6, 448.5/227.2 and 617.5/431.2 mAh g−1, respectively. As seen, the capacity increases with the increase of Sn content in the composite materials. In the following second and third charge and discharge cycles, the capacities of Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C decrease evidently, indicating that cycling performance is worse than Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C. At the same time, in Fig.\xa08(d-f), the initial discharge and charging capacities of Sn/C-0.6–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C, and Sn/C-0.6–800\xa0°C are 533.7/380.8, 617.5/431.2, and 410.5/248.7 mAh g−1, respectively. Among them, the capacity and cycling performance of Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C is optimum. It is comparable with other researchers’ work [19,20,21]. During the charge–discharge process, Sn undergoes alloying and dealloying reactions of NaxSn. Theoretical capacity of Sn is 847 mAh g−1, which is much higher than that of carbon (279 mAh g−1) [20]. As shown in Fig.\xa08, tin has an impact on the electrochemical performance of Sn/C nanofibers, and the higher tin content in the composite material, the higher capacity of the sodium-ion batteries.\n\n3.9 Cycling Performance\nThe cycling performance of sodium-ion batteries at 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 for the 80 cycles are illustrated in Fig.\xa09. The capacities of PAN-700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C, and Sn/C-0.6–800\xa0°C remain at 78.9, 181.1, 156.2, 218.9, 286.6, and 128.4 mAh g−1 after 80 cycles and their initial coulombic efficiencies are 52.2%, 66.7%, 50.7%, 71.4%, 69.8%, and 60.59%, respectively. The capacity retentions over 80 cycles were 51.8, 67.7, 68.8, 57.5, 66.5 and 51.6%, respectively. Consequently, all batteries appear capacity fading in certain range, and Sn/C-0.6–700\xa0°C possesses higher capacity remain.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

All chemicals were used without further purification.\n\n2.2 Preparation of Sn/C Anode Materials\nIn this experiment, SnCl2·2H2O were added into prepared 10% PAN/DMF solution with three different weight ratios of PAN to SnCl2·2H2O (1:0.4, 1:0.5, 1:0.6), respectively. Samples were labeled as PAN/SnCl2·2H2O-0.4, PAN/SnCl2·2H2O-0.5, and PAN/SnCl2·2H2O-0.6. After fully stirring, nanofiber membranes were prepared by electrospinning. The electrospinning voltage was set at 20\xa0kV, the distance between the needle and the drum collector was 18\xa0cm, the speed of the drum was 150 r/min, and the electrospinning speed was 0.6\xa0mL/h.\nTo carbonize the nanofiber membranes, they were first heated from room temperature to 250\xa0°C at a heating rate of 5\xa0°C/min, maintained for 120\xa0min, and then carbonization took place in an argon atmosphere with the temperature raised to the temperature (600\xa0°C, 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C) at a heating rate of 5\xa0°C/min, and held for 120\xa0min. Finally, the Sn/C nanofiber composite was obtained after cooled to room temperature. Samples were labeled as Sn/C-0.4–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–800\xa0°C. PAN/SnCl2·2H2O carbonized at 900\xa0°C was also studied, however, the resultant film was very brittle and not suitable for binder-free electrode. For comparison, pure carbon carbonized from PAN was also studied, some morphology and structure characterization of pure carbon have been measured in our previous work [15].\n\n2.3 Performance Testing and Characterization\nThe JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to test and analyze the surface morphology of original nanofiber membranes and carbonized nanofiber film, and the diameter distribution of nanofibers were measured by Nano Measurer. The TG/DTA6300 comprehensive thermal performance analyzer was used to conduct thermogravimetric test and analysis of nanofibers, with the heating rate of 10\xa0°C /min, and the heating range of 25\u2009~\u2009800\xa0°C in nitrogen. The JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM-EDS) was used to conduct TEM test on carbon nanofibers and analyzed the distribution and crystallization of elements including C, N, O, and Sn in the Sn/C nanofiber film. The elemental analysis of the materials was carried out using the EA3000 elemental analyzer. The crystal structures were tested by XRD using the Empyrean X-ray diffractometer manufactured by PANalytical Corporation, with the 2θ angle range of 10°–80°. The Raman analysis of the samples was performed using Xplora Plus fully automatic confocal microscopy Raman spectrometer manufactured by Horiba France SAS.\nThe samples were applied into sodium-ion batteries to measure their electrochemical performance. The working electrodes were prepared directly from the carbonized samples without adding current collector and binder. Electrodes were punched into circular disks with a diameter of 0.5 inches. Thickness and mass of electrodes were measured to calculate their density. The thickness of samples is around 143\xa0μm. By calculation, the apparent density of samples are estimated to be 0.87, 1.08, 1.24, 1.60, and 1.93\xa0g\xa0cm−3. The working electrodes were assembled into CR2032 coin half-cells for testing the electrochemical properties. Pure sodium metal was used as the counter electrode. 1\xa0M NaClO4 in EC/DMC was used as electrolyte. Glass fiber mat (Whatman) was used as the separator. The assembly of the battery was carried out in a glove box filled with argon gas. The resistances of sodium-ion batteries containing Sn/C nanofiber anodes were investigated by measuring the impedances of cells with the frequency range of 100\xa0kHz to 1\xa0Hz under a voltage perturbation amplitude of 5\xa0mV. Charge–discharge properties of the carbonized samples at cutoff voltage of 0.01–3\xa0V (vs. Na/Na\u2009+) were measured by the LAND (CT2001A) battery tester. The cyclic performance was tested galvanostatically at a current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 for 80 cycles.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Samples were labeled as Sn/C-0.4–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–800\xa0°C. PAN/SnCl2·2H2O carbonized at 900\xa0°C was also studied, however, the resultant film was very brittle and not suitable for binder-free electrode. For comparison, pure carbon carbonized from PAN was also studied, some morphology and structure characterization of pure carbon have been measured in our previous work [15].\n\n2.3 Performance Testing and Characterization\nThe JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to test and analyze the surface morphology of original nanofiber membranes and carbonized nanofiber film, and the diameter distribution of nanofibers were measured by Nano Measurer. The TG/DTA6300 comprehensive thermal performance analyzer was used to conduct thermogravimetric test and analysis of nanofibers, with the heating rate of 10\xa0°C /min, and the heating range of 25\u2009~\u2009800\xa0°C in nitrogen. The JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM-EDS) was used to conduct TEM test on carbon nanofibers and analyzed the distribution and crystallization of elements including C, N, O, and Sn in the Sn/C nanofiber film. The elemental analysis of the materials was carried out using the EA3000 elemental analyzer. The crystal structures were tested by XRD using the Empyrean X-ray diffractometer manufactured by PANalytical Corporation, with the 2θ angle range of 10°–80°. The Raman analysis of the samples was performed using Xplora Plus fully automatic confocal microscopy Raman spectrometer manufactured by Horiba France SAS.\nThe samples were applied into sodium-ion batteries to measure their electrochemical performance. The working electrodes were prepared directly from the carbonized samples without adding current collector and binder. Electrodes were punched into circular disks with a diameter of 0.5 inches. Thickness and mass of electrodes were measured to calculate their density. The thickness of samples is around 143\xa0μm. By calculation, the apparent density of samples are estimated to be 0.87, 1.08, 1.24, 1.60, and 1.93\xa0g\xa0cm−3. The working electrodes were assembled into CR2032 coin half-cells for testing the electrochemical properties. Pure sodium metal was used as the counter electrode. 1\xa0M NaClO4 in EC/DMC was used as electrolyte. Glass fiber mat (Whatman) was used as the separator. The assembly of the battery was carried out in a glove box filled with argon gas. The resistances of sodium-ion batteries containing Sn/C nanofiber anodes were investigated by measuring the impedances of cells with the frequency range of 100\xa0kHz to 1\xa0Hz under a voltage perturbation amplitude of 5\xa0mV. Charge–discharge properties of the carbonized samples at cutoff voltage of 0.01–3\xa0V (vs. Na/Na\u2009+) were measured by the LAND (CT2001A) battery tester. The cyclic performance was tested galvanostatically at a current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 for 80 cycles.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The electrospinning voltage was set at 20\xa0kV, the distance between the needle and the drum collector was 18\xa0cm, the speed of the drum was 150 r/min, and the electrospinning speed was 0.6\xa0mL/h.\nTo carbonize the nanofiber membranes, they were first heated from room temperature to 250\xa0°C at a heating rate of 5\xa0°C/min, maintained for 120\xa0min, and then carbonization took place in an argon atmosphere with the temperature raised to the temperature (600\xa0°C, 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C) at a heating rate of 5\xa0°C/min, and held for 120\xa0min. Finally, the Sn/C nanofiber composite was obtained after cooled to room temperature. Samples were labeled as Sn/C-0.4–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–800\xa0°C. PAN/SnCl2·2H2O carbonized at 900\xa0°C was also studied, however, the resultant film was very brittle and not suitable for binder-free electrode. For comparison, pure carbon carbonized from PAN was also studied, some morphology and structure characterization of pure carbon have been measured in our previous work [15].\n\n2.3 Performance Testing and Characterization\nThe JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to test and analyze the surface morphology of original nanofiber membranes and carbonized nanofiber film, and the diameter distribution of nanofibers were measured by Nano Measurer. The TG/DTA6300 comprehensive thermal performance analyzer was used to conduct thermogravimetric test and analysis of nanofibers, with the heating rate of 10\xa0°C /min, and the heating range of 25\u2009~\u2009800\xa0°C in nitrogen. The JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM-EDS) was used to conduct TEM test on carbon nanofibers and analyzed the distribution and crystallization of elements including C, N, O, and Sn in the Sn/C nanofiber film. The elemental analysis of the materials was carried out using the EA3000 elemental analyzer. The crystal structures were tested by XRD using the Empyrean X-ray diffractometer manufactured by PANalytical Corporation, with the 2θ angle range of 10°–80°. The Raman analysis of the samples was performed using Xplora Plus fully automatic confocal microscopy Raman spectrometer manufactured by Horiba France SAS.\nThe samples were applied into sodium-ion batteries to measure their electrochemical performance. The working electrodes were prepared directly from the carbonized samples without adding current collector and binder. Electrodes were punched into circular disks with a diameter of 0.5 inches. Thickness and mass of electrodes were measured to calculate their density. The thickness of samples is around 143\xa0μm. By calculation, the apparent density of samples are estimated to be 0.87, 1.08, 1.24, 1.60, and 1.93\xa0g\xa0cm−3. The working electrodes were assembled into CR2032 coin half-cells for testing the electrochemical properties. Pure sodium metal was used as the counter electrode. 1\xa0M NaClO4 in EC/DMC was used as electrolyte. Glass fiber mat (Whatman) was used as the separator. The assembly of the battery was carried out in a glove box filled with argon gas. The resistances of sodium-ion batteries containing Sn/C nanofiber anodes were investigated by measuring the impedances of cells with the frequency range of 100\xa0kHz to 1\xa0Hz under a voltage perturbation amplitude of 5\xa0mV. Charge–discharge properties of the carbonized samples at cutoff voltage of 0.01–3\xa0V (vs. Na/Na\u2009+) were measured by the LAND (CT2001A) battery tester. The cyclic performance was tested galvanostatically at a current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 for 80 cycles.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The electrospinning voltage was set at 20\xa0kV, the distance between the needle and the drum collector was 18\xa0cm, the speed of the drum was 150 r/min, and the electrospinning speed was 0.6\xa0mL/h.\nTo carbonize the nanofiber membranes, they were first heated from room temperature to 250\xa0°C at a heating rate of 5\xa0°C/min, maintained for 120\xa0min, and then carbonization took place in an argon atmosphere with the temperature raised to the temperature (600\xa0°C, 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C) at a heating rate of 5\xa0°C/min, and held for 120\xa0min. Finally, the Sn/C nanofiber composite was obtained after cooled to room temperature. Samples were labeled as Sn/C-0.4–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.4–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.5–800\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–600\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–700\xa0°C, Sn/C-0.7–800\xa0°C. PAN/SnCl2·2H2O carbonized at 900\xa0°C was also studied, however, the resultant film was very brittle and not suitable for binder-free electrode. For comparison, pure carbon carbonized from PAN was also studied, some morphology and structure characterization of pure carbon have been measured in our previous work [15].\n\n2.3 Performance Testing and Characterization\nThe JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to test and analyze the surface morphology of original nanofiber membranes and carbonized nanofiber film, and the diameter distribution of nanofibers were measured by Nano Measurer. The TG/DTA6300 comprehensive thermal performance analyzer was used to conduct thermogravimetric test and analysis of nanofibers, with the heating rate of 10\xa0°C /min, and the heating range of 25\u2009~\u2009800\xa0°C in nitrogen. The JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM-EDS) was used to conduct TEM test on carbon nanofibers and analyzed the distribution and crystallization of elements including C, N, O, and Sn in the Sn/C nanofiber film. The elemental analysis of the materials was carried out using the EA3000 elemental analyzer. The crystal structures were tested by XRD using the Empyrean X-ray diffractometer manufactured by PANalytical Corporation, with the 2θ angle range of 10°–80°. The Raman analysis of the samples was performed using Xplora Plus fully automatic confocal microscopy Raman spectrometer manufactured by Horiba France SAS.\nThe samples were applied into sodium-ion batteries to measure their electrochemical performance. The working electrodes were prepared directly from the carbonized samples without adding current collector and binder. Electrodes were punched into circular disks with a diameter of 0.5 inches. Thickness and mass of electrodes were measured to calculate their density. The thickness of samples is around 143\xa0μm. By calculation, the apparent density of samples are estimated to be 0.87, 1.08, 1.24, 1.60, and 1.93\xa0g\xa0cm−3. The working electrodes were assembled into CR2032 coin half-cells for testing the electrochemical properties. Pure sodium metal was used as the counter electrode. 1\xa0M NaClO4 in EC/DMC was used as electrolyte. Glass fiber mat (Whatman) was used as the separator. The assembly of the battery was carried out in a glove box filled with argon gas. The resistances of sodium-ion batteries containing Sn/C nanofiber anodes were investigated by measuring the impedances of cells with the frequency range of 100\xa0kHz to 1\xa0Hz under a voltage perturbation amplitude of 5\xa0mV. Charge–discharge properties of the carbonized samples at cutoff voltage of 0.01–3\xa0V (vs. Na/Na\u2009+) were measured by the LAND (CT2001A) battery tester. The cyclic performance was tested galvanostatically at a current density of 100\xa0mA\xa0g−1 for 80 cycles.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

During the hydrothermal process that involving only (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and thiourea, a flower-like structure was formed due to the self-assembly of MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. S1a). When graphene oxide suspension was added, a highly wrinkled lamellar structure composed of graphene sheets and MoS2 layers was formed due to the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged graphene oxide and Mo7O246−, leading to the formation of sandwich-structured MoS2/G (Fig. S1b). After further adding Zn2+, a novel vertical structure of MoS2/ZnS/G was formed (Fig. S1c), where Mo7O246− was able to land on graphene through electrostatic attraction enabled by Zn2+ media. The vertical growth of MoS2/ZnS/G not only possessed the structural advantages of parallel MoS2/G (e.g., expanded interlayer distance and good electron conductivity), but also exposed more active sites and provided open channel for efficient Na+ storage, shortened the distance for Na+/electronic transport, which were crucial for improving both rate capability and cycle life.\nFigure\xa02 analyzes the morphological and structural differences among the as-synthesized MoS2, MoS2/G, and MoS2/ZnS/G. The MoS2 sample had a flower-like spherical structure that composed of numerous sheets (Fig.\xa02a), as confirmed by TEM image in Fig.\xa02b, which demonstrated self-aggregation of pure MoS2 layers. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig.\xa02c showed an interlayer distance of 0.62\xa0nm for the (002) plane of pure MoS2, corresponding to the structure shown in Fig.\xa02d. The MoS2/G sample had a highly wrinkled lamellar structure (Fig.\xa02e), with improved self-stacking of MoS2 layers after the addition of graphene, as shown in TEM image of Fig.\xa02f. HRTEM image in Fig.\xa02g showed an expanded interlayer distance of 0.64\xa0nm for the (002) plane of MoS2, as illustrated in Fig.\xa02h. The geometry of MoS2/ZnS/G was significantly different from the above two samples. TEM image in Fig.\xa02i shows that the MoS2/ZnS/G contains large graphene sheet on the bottom and numerous small MoS2 layers on the top (confirmed by HRTEM result shown in Fig.\xa02j). When graphene is bended, the MoS2 layers still standing on the surface of graphene (Fig. S1d). Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that most of the MoS2 nanosheets were "standing" on the surface of graphene rather than lying on it (Fig.\xa02l). The interlayer distance of (002) plane for MoS2 showed a further growing trend, which was examined to be 0.69\xa0nm. In addition, typical lattice distance of 0.32\xa0nm for the (111) plane of ZnS is observed in Fig.\xa02k, which was closely attached to MoS2 layers, implying a strong contact between MoS2 and ZnS. Aberration-corrected HRTEM (Figs. 2m and S2) displayed abundant 1T-phase trigonal lattices MoS2 and some 2H-phase honeycomb lattices of MoS2 in the MoS2/ZnS/G, along with numerous defects in the MoS2 sheets. The previous works have confirmed that the defect-rich structure in electrode can provide extra sites for sodium storage, and enable better electronic/ionic kinetics for fast sodium storage at high current rates [23–25]. Such a dual-phase and defect-rich structure of MoS2/ZnS/G is expected to promote better electronic conductivity and higher Na+ affinity.\nXPS survey spectrum (Fig. S3) revealed that the MoS2/ZnS/G hybrid consisted of Mo, Zn, S, C, and O. The presence of O in the sample was due to inevitable oxidation in the air. The elemental distribution images of the sample (Fig.\xa02n) showed a homogeneous distribution of Mo, Zn, S, and C. The chemical composition of Mo, Zn, S, and C was examined by ICP-AES, and the results are listed in Table S1. XRD patterns of the three samples (Fig.\xa02o) showed typical diffraction peaks for MoS2 (JCPDS No. 75-1539). Comparing with pure MoS2, a slight peak shift to the lower angle of the MoS2 (002) plane was observed in the MoS2/G sample, indicating an expanded interlayer distance that agreed with HRTEM result. Moreover, for the MoS2/ZnS/G sample, the (002) diffraction peak was largely weakened, suggesting that the stacking of MoS2 layers was effectively suppressed. No characteristic diffraction peaks of graphene were observed in the MoS2/G and MoS2/ZnS/G samples, indicating the high dispersion state of graphene sheets. The observation of ZnS (111) plane in MoS2/ZnS/G was agreed with HRTEM results in Fig.\xa02k, confirming the existence of ZnS. Furthermore, the highly overlapped distribution of C and Zn elements in Fig. S4 implied that the existence of ZnS may play an important role in the formation of such a unique MoS2/ZnS/G structure.\nTo confirm the role of ZnS in the formation of MoS2/ZnS/G, a chemical etching process was conducted by immersing MoS2/ZnS/G in 1\xa0mol·L−1 HCl solution for 1\xa0h at room temperature. The post-treated sample was marked as MoS2/ZnS/G-HCl. Compared to MoS2/ZnS/G, XRD pattern of MoS2/ZnS/G-HCl (Fig. S5) showed two notable differences: the absence of ZnS diffraction peak and the strengthening of the MoS2 (002) plane. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that without the help of ZnS, MoS2 sheets peel off from graphene and restack into thicker layers. SEM and TEM images shown in Fig. S6 agreed with XRD results. Elemental mapping images of the MoS2/ZnS/G-HCl (Fig. S7) also confirmed the disappearance of ZnS in the final sample. All the above discussions supported the vertical structure of MoS2/ZnS/G.\nTo obtain more structural information about the MoS2/ZnS/G hybrid, a Raman test was conducted. As shown in Fig.\xa03a, two broad peaks centered at 1344 and 1591\xa0cm−1 were observed and attributed to the defect-related D-band and graphite-related G-band of carbon, respectively [26, 27]. The presence of graphene was also confirmed by C 1s XPS spectrum in Fig. S8. The intensity of the D-band was found to be higher than that of the G-band, indicating a high level of disorder in the grapheme of MoS2/ZnS/G sample. Typical peaks for the 2H and 1T modes of MoS2 were also observed, confirming the co-existence of both phases [27, 28]. Importantly, the intensity of the graphene peak was much smaller than that of MoS2, suggesting that the graphene dwas well covered by MoS2. XPS spectra further supported these findings. The high-resolution Mo 3d XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b) exhibited two dominant doublets. The peaks at 232.5 and 229.4\xa0eV were assigned to the Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 of the 1T-phase MoS2, while the peaks at 232.7 and 229.6\xa0eV were assigned to the variation of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 of the 2H phase, respectively [17]. The S 2p spectrum also showed two components at 162.0 and 162.4\xa0eV for the S 2p3/2, and 163.2 and 163.8\xa0eV for the S 2p1/2. As for the Zn 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d), typical peaks observed at 1022.4 and 1045.6\xa0eV corresponded to the Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 of ZnS [29, 30]. The specific surface area of MoS2/ZnS/G was calculated to be 140.6\xa0m2·g−1 based on the nitrogen isothermals (Fig.\xa03e), which was much higher than that of the MoS2/G sample (62.2\xa0m2·g−1, Fig. S9). The pore size distribution plot (Fig.\xa03f) indicated an average pore size of 3.9\xa0nm for MoS2/ZnS/G. The large surface area and porous structure of this hybrid are favorable for fast electronic/ionic transport. In comparison with the MoS2/G sample, the MoS2/ZnS/G exhibits three dominant structural advantages: (1) shortened distance for ionic and electronic transport due to the vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets; (2) increased active sites for sodium storage resulting from the expanded layer distance of MoS2 and the defect-rich structure; and (3) enhanced electronic conductivity attributed to the existence of 1T-phase MoS2, graphene, and numerous heterostructural interfaces.\nThe sodium storage performance of the as-prepared electrodes was evaluated in half-cells. To gain a better understanding of the structural superiority of MoS2/ZnS/G, the electrochemical performance of MoS2/G and ZnS/G (structural characterizations are provided in Figs. S10–S13) was also determined. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of MoS2/ZnS/G are shown in Fig.\xa04a. During the first scan, the reduction peaks at 1.18 and 0.84\xa0V were ascribed to the insertion of Na+ into the MoS2 lattice [31, 32]. The Na-insertion potential of MoS2/ZnS/G is higher than that of MoS2/G (Fig. S14). The peaks shift of MoS2/ZnS/G is due to the enlarged interlayer distance of MoS2, which resulted in a lower energy barrier for Na+ insertion. As the reduction proceeded, another peak was observed at 0.36\xa0V, corresponding to the reduction of ZnS [33]. During the anodic process, the recovery peak for ZnS appeared at 0.89\xa0V, similar to the ZnS/G sample in Fig. S15. The desodiation peaks of MoS2 appeared at 1.60 and 1.78\xa0V, which were lower than those of MoS2/G. The CV curves for the second and third scans were almost overlapped, implying good electrode reversibility that is consistent with the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles. The initial discharge/charge capacity of MoS2/ZnS/G was 848/498\xa0mAh·g−1 at 0.1\xa0A·g−1. The irreversible capacity loss in the first discharge/charge process is mainly due to the decomposition of electrolyte, the formation of solid–electrolyte interfaces film, and the irreversible side reactions of electrode. It should be noted that the initial discharge/charge capacity of MoS2/ZnS/G was higher than those of MoS2/G (612/336 mAh·g−1, Fig. S16a) and ZnS/G (796/414 mAh·g−1, Fig. S16b), demonstrating the structural superiority of this vertical defect-rich sample. From the second cycle onward, the discharge/charge capacities of MoS2/ZnS/G stabilized at\u2009~\u2009470/460\xa0mAh·g−1. The cycling performance of MoS2/ZnS/G, MoS2/G, and ZnS/G electrodes is compared in Fig.\xa04c. After 100 cycles at 0.1\xa0A·g−1, ZnS/G and MoS2/G exhibited a capacity of only 114 and 277\xa0mAh·g−1, respectively, while a high capacity of 470\xa0mAh·g−1 was reserved in MoS2/ZnS/G electrode, corresponding to a respectable capacity retention of 97% (compared with capacity in the second cycle).\nThe rate capability of the samples was subsequently examined, and as expected, the MoS2/ZnS/G sample showed the best rate capability. Figure\xa04d illustrates that when the current density increased from 0.1 to 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0\xa0A·g−1, the reversible capacities gradually dropped from 497 to 465, 445, 408, 376, and 298\xa0mAh·g−1, respectively. Significantly, when the current density was tuned back to 0.1\xa0A·g−1, the capacity rapidly recovered to a high value of 541\xa0mAh·g−1, indicating good structural stability. The capacity increase in this MoS2/ZnS/G was agreed with the pervious reported works that may due to a gradually activation of electrodes which facilitate the electronic/ionic kinetics [34]. To further evaluate the long cycling performance of MoS2/ZnS/G, tests were conducted at 1.0\xa0A·g−1, and the result is given in Fig.\xa04e. After 500 cycles discharge/charge process, a reversible capacity of 280\xa0mAh·g−1 was maintained, demonstrating a capacity decay of 0.056% per cycle (comparing with 388\xa0mAh·g−1 in the second cycle). The capacity retention of this MoS2/ZnS/G significantly outperforming the MoS2/G, ZnS/G, and previously reported MoS2-based electrodes for SIBs, detailed comparison is listed in Table S2. Additionally, Fig.\xa04f compares the rate capability of the MoS2/ZnS/G with other reported MoS2-based electrodes [31, 34,35,36,37,38,39,40].\nThe electrochemical kinetics of MoS2/ZnS/G was analyzed through a series of CV measurements. Figure\xa05a shows CV curves recorded under various scan rates ranging from 0.2 to 1.0\xa0mV·s−1, with three typical peaks selected to monitor the reduction and oxidation processes. The relationship between the current (i) and scan rate (v) in the CV curves followed the equation: \\(i=a{v}^{b}\\), where b value depends on the solvated ions storage mechanism, and a is a constent. A b value approaching 0.5 indicates a diffusion-controlled process, while a b value approaching 1.0 indicates a pseudocapacitance-controlled process. As shown in Fig.\xa05b, the b values for peaks A, B, and C were calculated to be 0.82, 0.70, and 0.95, respectively, indicating a mixed mechanism dominated by pseudocapacitive Na+ storage. To quantify the contribution of capacitive behavior, the pseudocapacitance-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes were calculated using the equation: \\(i={k}_{1}v+{k}_{2}{v}^{1/2}\\), where k1v and k2v represent the pseudocapacitance-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes, respectively. Figure\xa05c illustrates that the pseudocapacitive process contributed 89.3% of the total capacity at a scan rate of 1.0\xa0mV·s−1. As the scan rate increased, the proportion of capacitive capacity gradually rose, as shown in Fig.\xa05d. The high value of capacitive contribution in MoS2/ZnS/G accounted for its favorable electrochemical kinetics at high current densities.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plot of MoS2/ZnS/G, as depicted in Fig. S17, demonstrated a lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of 515\xa0Ω than MoS2/G (610\xa0Ω) and ZnS/G (1007\xa0Ω). The lower Rct of MoS2/ZnS/G indicated faster ion/electron transportation, further highlighting the crucial role of this unique structure: (1) Pseudocapacitance-dominated electrochemical process, which helps to maintain the structural stability, further leads the long cycle life and good rate capability; (2) defect-rich structure of the final sample, which can not only provide extra sites for sodium storage but also favorable for a long cycling lifespan and high current rate; (3) vertical grown of MoS2 on graphene sheets, which provides shorter and open channels for fast ion/electron transport; and (4) co-existence of 2H–MoS2 and 1T–MoS2 phase, which promote better electronic conductivity and higher Na+ affinity.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Firstly, 60 mg graphene oxide (GO) was sonicated and stirred in 30-ml deionized water. Next, 89 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 370 mg (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, and 800 mg thiourea were added into the mixture after stirring for 30\xa0min.

The helical CNFs were prepared on the surface of Cu foil by CVD method, which were scattered evenly. The CNFs were intertwined with each other. The average diameter of CNF is about 100 nm, and CNFs exhibit smooth surface. As shown in Fig. S1d, CNFs were decorated with Cu/CuO, which did not change the original morphology of nanofiber.\nFigures\xa02, S2 show TEM images of CNFs and Cu-CNFs. Before Cu/CuO decorating, the short-range ordered structure can be clearly observed by TEM in CNFs, and the layer spacing is about 0.37 nm (Fig. S2). As shown in Fig.\xa02a–d, Cu/CuO nanoparticles are evenly anchored on the surface of CNF. As shown in Fig.\xa02d, the interplanar spacings are 0.21 nm, corresponding to (111) plane of metallic Cu. The crystalline interplanar spacing is 0.23 nm, which corresponded to (111) plane of CuO. Meanwhile, the interspace spacing of carbon around Cu/CuO nanoparticle increases to 0.40 nm, which provides a larger space for the intercalation and diffusion of Na+.\nIn order to determine the structural characteristics of the as-prepared CNFs, XRD was conducted, and the results are displayed in Fig.\xa03a. A wide diffraction peak corresponded to the (002) plane of graphite can be observed, indicating that the crystallinity of CNFs is relatively low, which is consistent with TEM results. Figure\xa03b shows Raman spectra of the CNFs and Cu-CNFs. There are two characteristic peaks at 1342 and 1590 cm−1 corresponding to the carbon materials D-band and G-band, respectively. The D-band (~\u20091350\xa0cm−1) represents the disorder groups and defects, whereas the G-band is the consequence of sp2 stretching. The intensity ratio of D to G peak indicates the amount of lattice defects in the graphitic structure, and thus, the ID/IG ratio could be used to assess the degree of disorder in carbon. The ID/IG ratio of Cu-CNFs (1.01) is substantially greater than that of CNFs (0.93), indicating rich defects on CNFs after magnetron sputtering treatment [31]. The numerous defects/vacancies are supposed to be beneficial for the adsorption of Na+ in SIBs [3].\nXPS C 1s and Cu 2p spectra of the Cu-CNFs are shown in Figs. 3c–f, S3, S4. In C 1s XPS spectra, the peaks at 284.7, 285.1, 286.7 and 288.6 eV originate from C-sp2, C-sp3, C-O and C=O, respectively [21]. Compared with CNFs (Fig.\xa03c), the peak area of sp3 in Cu-CNFs is significantly increased, which further indicates that some defects will form on the surface of CNFs during magnetron sputtering. In Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig.\xa03d), peaks located at 932.7 and 952.5 eV can be attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. The results show that the synthesized materials contained Cu. The presence of Cu2+ is evidenced by the distinctive satellite peaks centered at 941.2, 944.2 and 962.6 eV. Besides, the peak around 934 eV is fitted to Cu-C. As shown in Fig.\xa03f, XPS O 1s spectra are separated into three peaks located at 531.5 and 531.7\xa0eV, related to C–O and C=O, respectively [32]. The presence of Cu–O can also effectively prove the existence of the CuO on the surface of CNFs. XPS results show that CuO/Cu nanoparticles are attached to the surface of the CNFs.\nThe galvanostatic charge–discharge, CV and EIS experiments were used to test the sodium storage properties of as-prepared samples. CV curves of CNFs and Cu-CNFs were measured with a scan rate of 0.1 mV·s−1 from 3.0 to 0.01 V for the first three cycles (Fig.\xa04a, b). During the first reduction process, there was a visible broad reduction peak at ≈1.0 V, which is generally ascribed to the electrolyte degradation and the formation of SEI film. The initial discharge–charge profiles of the CNFs anode at a current density of 0.1\xa0A·g−1 are depicted in Fig.\xa04c. There are two discharge platforms in the first discharge curve which are matched to the CV curve’s irreversible peaks (below 0.1\xa0V and around 1.0\xa0V, respectively). Both of CNFs and Cu-CNFs demonstrate a large irreversible capacity during the first cycle, with the ICE of only 35%, which is due to the formation of the SEI film. With the decoration of Cu/CuO, the discharge specific capacity has been increased from 633 to 729\xa0mAh·g−1, and the reversible capacity has also been greatly increased due to fewer irreversible processes and the improvement of the adsorption capacity for Na+ with Cu-CNFs anode. The cycling stability of Cu-CNFs anode was examined at the current density of 0.1\xa0A·g−1 to elucidate the influence of Cu/CuO nanoparticles for CNFs. As shown in Fig.\xa04d, Cu-CNFs maintain a capacity of 300 mAh·g−1 at 0.1\xa0A·g−1 after 200 cycles, which is higher than that of CNFs (200 mAh·g−1). Meanwhile, the Coulombic efficiency rapidly rises to over 99.5%. Moreover, Cu-CNFs do not show obvious capacity decrease after 400 cycles, demonstrating outstanding cycling stability.\nDespite the discussion above, however, the initial Coulombic efficiency of Cu-CNFs is not satisfactory. To address this issue, 1 mol·L−1 NaPF6/dimethoxyethane (DME) was selected as the electrolyte to modify the initial Coulombic efficiency. Once the electrolyte was introduced, the coin cell’s initial Coulombic efficiency increased from 30% to 76% (Figs. S5, 4e). The high initial Coulombic efficiency is primarily attributed to the use of DME, which can prevent electrolyte decomposition and promote the formation of a thin and stable SEI film.\nThe rate performances of CNFs and Cu-CNFs are shown in Fig.\xa04g at different current densities ranging from 0.1 to 2\xa0A·g−1. The Cu-CNFs anode provides discharge capacity of 310, 232, 180, 147, 120 and 310 mAh·g−1 at 0.1\xa0A·g−1, 0.2\xa0A·g−1, 0.5\xa0A·g−1, 1\xa0A·g−1 and 2\xa0A·g−1, respectively. When the current was reduced to 0.1\xa0A·g−1 again, its capacity could still be maintained at 310\xa0mAh·g−1. To further explore the electrochemical\xa0behavior of Cu-CNFs anodes at high current densities, the long-term cycling performance was examined. At high current density of 1\xa0A·g−1, the reversible capacity was nearly constant at 150\xa0mAh·g−1 after 6000 cycles (Fig.\xa04f). As shown in Fig. S6, EIS was investigated with the electrode discharged to 0.5 V after 10 cycles. The Nyquist plots present compressed semicircle, corresponding to the resistance of sodium ions diffusion through the SEI film (Rf) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct), respectively. In addition, the ohmic resistance (Rs), containing separator, electrolyte and electrode resistance, is around 8.4\xa0Ω. According to equivalent circuit (Fig. S6), Cu-CNFs exhibit a lower Rct of 214.6\xa0Ω than CNFs (427.3\xa0Ω). The effective reduction of Rct could be attributed to the unique carbon structure.\nTo further figure out the sodium storage mechanism, CV measurements were carried out at several sweep rates ranging from 0.2 to 1.8\xa0mV·s−1 (Fig.\xa05a, b). CV curves were not\xa0altered\xa0significantly with the scan speeds increasing. The value of b is the slope of the line in Fig.\xa05c. b\u2009=\u20091 means that the capacity is determined by surface-controlled behavior, b value close to 0.5 indicating the pseudocapacitive process [33]. The b values of Cu-CNFs and CNFs were 0.92647 and 0.74387, respectively, demonstrating that the dynamics of the Cu-CNFs is surface-controlled behavior. The primary sodium storage mechanism is the adsorption behavior of Na+ on the material surface. This indicates that Na+ fluidity is substantially improved during the electrode’s working process, significantly enhancing its electrochemical performance. The equation of i(V)\u2009=\u2009k1v\u2009+\u2009k2v1/2 was performed to further determine the effect of capacitive-controlled behavior on charge storage at a specific scanning speed. In the formula, k1v and k2v1/2 represent the capacitive-controlled contribution and diffusion-controlled contribution, respectively. According to Fig. S7, with the scanning speed gradually increasing, the capacitance contribution gradually rises from 33% to 59%. This result demonstrates that the diffusion control mechanism is primarily responsible for the storage of Na+ in the CNFs anode.\nFor Cu-CNFs, capacitance is more important for Na+ storage at different scanning speeds. As the scanning speed increases from 0.2 to 1.8\xa0mV·s−1, the capacitance contribution increases from 51% to 81% (Fig.\xa05d) with the scan speed increasing to the high value of 1.8 mV·s−1, indicating that capacitive behavior controls the Na+ storage of Cu-CNFs as the scanning speed gradually increases. The results above show that Cu/CuO nanoparticles can promote the occurrence of Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation and increase the capacity of CNFs, which is consistent with the results of electrochemical testing. The morphology of the Cu-CNFs electrode after 200 cycles was characterized by SEM (Fig. S8). As can be seen from Fig. S8, CNFs are stable and do not show obvious changes such as volume expansion and rupture, which well explains its good cycling performance. Meanwhile, some spherical particles appear on the surface of CNFs, which might be unwashed salts.\nThe electrochemical capabilities of Cu-CNFs anode were also assessed in full cells by linking with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (Fig. S9). The charge and discharge curves of the Cu-CNFs and Na3V2(PO4)3 electrodes are shown in Fig. S9a. The testing voltage is in a voltage range of 0.5–3.5 V for full cells. As shown in Fig. S9b, c, the full Cu-CNFs||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells displayed high Coulombic efficiency. The initial Coulombic efficiency was 60%, and it maintained above 95% after the 10th cycle. The effective electrochemistry performance of the full cells further confirms the viability of the Cu-CNFs.\nTo further reveal the high-efficiency sodium storage mechanism of Cu-CNFs, DFT calculations were conducted to explore how Cu/CuO nanoparticles affect Na+ adsorption behavior. With Cu/CuO nanoparticles anchored at the vacancy defects (Fig. S10), the order degree of lattice structure around Cu/CuO would be improved, which provided a channel for the rapid transport of Na+. The density of state (DOS) was calculated to deeply explain how the related physical parameters influence SIBs. The Cu-CNFs exhibit a higher total DOS (TDOS) near the Fermi level than CNFs (Fig.\xa06a), suggesting improved Na+ storage capacity and increased electronic conductivity. In Fig.\xa06b, local DOS (LDOS) shows that the state density of Cu-CNFs is mainly contributed by C and Cu. It can be shown from the projected DOS (PDOS) diagram that C is mainly contributed by the p orbital (Fig.\xa06c), and Cu is mainly contributed by the d orbital (Fig.\xa06d), so the p-d orbital hybridization is the main reason for the improvement of electrical conductivity. The state density of other elements in CNFs and Cu-CNFs is shown in Figs. S11 and S12. To prove how the p-d orbital hybridization promotes the cyclic stability of SIBs via the Cu/CuO nanoparticles, we calculated the adsorption energy of Na+ on Cu-CNFs and CNFs. The adsorption energy (△Ead) of Na+ on Cu-CNFs was\u2009−\u20092.97\xa0eV, which was lower than that of CNFs (−\u20092.14\xa0eV), signifying that a more stable Na+ adsorption (Fig.\xa06e) as well as the Na+ adsorption ability was increased via the Cu/CuO nanoparticles. The substantial electron redistribution at the active site from charge density differences in Fig.\xa06f further proves the improved Na+ adsorption from Cu/CuO nanoparticles. Meanwhile, Na+ adsorbed on Cu-CNFs exhibits more electrons than that on CNFs (Fig. S13), which means that Na+ adsorbed on Cu-CNFs is more stable than that on CNFs. The above theoretical calculations confirm that Cu/CuO nanoparticles modulate p-d orbital hybridization and promote the adsorption of Na+.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

CNFs preparation process is as follows. The CNFs were fabricated by using a simple one-step CVD method, based on our previous work [31]. 0.005 mol·L−1 Y(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.01\xa0mol·L−1 Ni(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in 10 ml alcohol solution to obtain Ni/Y catalyst solution. After that, Cu foil\xa0was dipped into the Ni/Y catalyst solution and maintained for 1 h and then dried at 25\xa0°C under vacuum conditions. The as-prepared Cu foil was heated to 550\xa0°C for 1 h at a rate of 10\xa0°C·min−1 in a H2/Ar/C2H2 mixture and then cooled to 25\xa0°C under the protection of Ar atmosphere. On the surface of the Cu foil, CNFs were evenly grown.\nCu-CNFs preparation process is as follows. The Cu nanoparticles were deposited on CNFs by magnetron sputtering of a Cu target with pure argon as the working gas. When the as-prepared sample was transferred to the environmental atmosphere, a small portion of Cu was oxidized (Cu-CNFs). The vacuum degree was 1.8\u2009×\u200910–8 Pa, the sputtering power was 30\xa0W, the sputtering pressure was 0.27\xa0Pa, and the sputtering time was 23\xa0s.\n\n2.2 Materials characterization\nThe morphology of the as-prepared samples was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi, S-8100). And the microstructures were observed by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-F200). Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples were obtained using a X ploRA PLUS Raman spectrometer (laser: 532\xa0nm). The CNFs and Cu-CNFs were also analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, NEXSA).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe sample was dried in a vacuum chamber at 80\xa0°C for 12\xa0h before assembling the CR2032 coin-type cells in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O and O2\u2009<\u20090.1\u2009×\u200910–6; MBRAUN). The as-prepared Cu-CNFs and CNFs were directly used as the anode (size: 1\xa0cm\u2009×\u20091 cm). It should be mentioned that the active material average mass loading was around 2.1\xa0mg·cm−2. The Whatman fiberglass as battery diaphragm was employed to isolate the counter-electrode from the working electrode. Sodium-metal pieces were used as the counter-electrodes. The electrolyte was made of 1 mol·L−1 NaClO4 in an ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1, vol ratio) solution with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive. The amount of electrolyte was just enough to wet the electrode and separator. Galvanostatic charge–discharge and cycle stability was tested by a LAND CT2001A multichannel battery testing system at different current densities within the voltage range of 0–3 V at 25\xa0°C (vs. Na+/Na). The cycle voltammetry (CV) curves were measured on Bio-Logic VMP-300 electrochemical workstation (France). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out by the same electrochemical workstation with a frequency range of 0.01–100 MHz at 25\xa0°C.\n\n2.4 DFT calculations\nDFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The exchange–correlation function was calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation method. Self-consistent calculations were carried out under a plane-wave cut-off of 400\xa0eV. The convergence accuracy of the self-consistent process was set as 1\u2009×\u200910−4\xa0eV, and the geometrical optimization was stopped when the Hellmann–Feynman forces on the atoms were smaller than 0.2\xa0eV·nm−1. Brillouin zone k-point sampling was performed with 3\u2009×\u20093\u2009×\u20092 Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack grids. A vacuum space of 2.5\xa0nm was constructed to eliminate the interactions between adjacent layers.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

CNFs preparation process is as follows. The CNFs were fabricated by using a simple one-step CVD method, based on our previous work [31]. 0.005 mol·L−1 Y(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.01\xa0mol·L−1 Ni(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in 10 ml alcohol solution to obtain Ni/Y catalyst solution. After that, Cu foil\xa0was dipped into the Ni/Y catalyst solution and maintained for 1 h and then dried at 25\xa0°C under vacuum conditions. The as-prepared Cu foil was heated to 550\xa0°C for 1 h at a rate of 10\xa0°C·min−1 in a H2/Ar/C2H2 mixture and then cooled to 25\xa0°C under the protection of Ar atmosphere. On the surface of the Cu foil, CNFs were evenly grown.\nCu-CNFs preparation process is as follows. The Cu nanoparticles were deposited on CNFs by magnetron sputtering of a Cu target with pure argon as the working gas. When the as-prepared sample was transferred to the environmental atmosphere, a small portion of Cu was oxidized (Cu-CNFs). The vacuum degree was 1.8\u2009×\u200910–8 Pa, the sputtering power was 30\xa0W, the sputtering pressure was 0.27\xa0Pa, and the sputtering time was 23\xa0s.\n\n2.2 Materials characterization\nThe morphology of the as-prepared samples was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi, S-8100). And the microstructures were observed by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-F200). Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples were obtained using a X ploRA PLUS Raman spectrometer (laser: 532\xa0nm). The CNFs and Cu-CNFs were also analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, NEXSA).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe sample was dried in a vacuum chamber at 80\xa0°C for 12\xa0h before assembling the CR2032 coin-type cells in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O and O2\u2009<\u20090.1\u2009×\u200910–6; MBRAUN). The as-prepared Cu-CNFs and CNFs were directly used as the anode (size: 1\xa0cm\u2009×\u20091 cm). It should be mentioned that the active material average mass loading was around 2.1\xa0mg·cm−2. The Whatman fiberglass as battery diaphragm was employed to isolate the counter-electrode from the working electrode. Sodium-metal pieces were used as the counter-electrodes. The electrolyte was made of 1 mol·L−1 NaClO4 in an ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1, vol ratio) solution with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive. The amount of electrolyte was just enough to wet the electrode and separator. Galvanostatic charge–discharge and cycle stability was tested by a LAND CT2001A multichannel battery testing system at different current densities within the voltage range of 0–3 V at 25\xa0°C (vs. Na+/Na). The cycle voltammetry (CV) curves were measured on Bio-Logic VMP-300 electrochemical workstation (France). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out by the same electrochemical workstation with a frequency range of 0.01–100 MHz at 25\xa0°C.\n\n2.4 DFT calculations\nDFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The exchange–correlation function was calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation method. Self-consistent calculations were carried out under a plane-wave cut-off of 400\xa0eV. The convergence accuracy of the self-consistent process was set as 1\u2009×\u200910−4\xa0eV, and the geometrical optimization was stopped when the Hellmann–Feynman forces on the atoms were smaller than 0.2\xa0eV·nm−1. Brillouin zone k-point sampling was performed with 3\u2009×\u20093\u2009×\u20092 Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack grids. A vacuum space of 2.5\xa0nm was constructed to eliminate the interactions between adjacent layers.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The density of states (DOS) of SnTe, SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC are shown in Fig.\xa01b, whose band structures are displayed in Figs. S1–S3. Compared with the large band gap of 0.515\xa0eV for SnTe, graphene effectively reduces the band gap to 0.329\xa0eV (SnTe@rGO), and the N-doped C layer further converts SnTe from a semiconductor to a conductor (SnTe@rGO@NC), demonstrating that the hierarchical confinement effect can boost SnTe to exhibit high electron transfer kinetics. FESEM and TEM were performed to further investigate the morphology and microstructure of SnTe, SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC. It can be seen that SnTe shows a nanoparticle morphology in Fig. S4a, b, which is completely encapsulated by graphene in Figs. 1c, S4c and d. Furthermore, SnTe nanoparticle is tightly wrapped with N-doped C and firmly anchored on graphene in Figs. 1d, S4e and f. High-resolution (HR) TEM image of SnTe@rGO@NC in Fig.\xa01e exhibits lattice fringes with the interplanar spacings of 2.23 and 3.16\xa0Å, which are attributed to (220) and (200) planes of cubic SnTe phase, respectively. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) pattern in Fig.\xa01f distinctly shows the lattice facets of \\((0{\\overline{2}}2)\\), \\(({\\overline{2}}{\\overline{2}}4)\\) \\(({\\overline{2}}02)\\) of cubic SnTe (233). Figure\xa01g depicts the high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of SnTe@rGO@NC, where the atomic arrangement of SnTe corresponds exactly with the position along (111) zone axis of cubic SnTe. The element mapping results are shown in Fig.\xa01h, which illustrates that the C, N, O, Sn and Te elements distribute uniformly in SnTe@rGO@NC nanocomposite.\nRietveld refinement XRD patterns of bare SnTe (Fig. S5), SnTe@rGO (Fig. S6) and SnTe@rGO@NC (Fig.\xa02a) verify that all diffraction peaks can be indexed as cubic SnTe phase (JCPDS No. 46–1210) without other impurities [33]. The detailed refinement parameters are shown in Table S1. The ball-stick model of cubic SnTe is exhibited in Fig.\xa02b. Subsequently, Raman spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the structural details of the samples further, as shown in Fig.\xa02c. Pristine SnTe displays two scattering modes of Eg and A1g in vibration peaks at about 588.3 and 679.1\xa0cm−1 [34]. The two characteristic peaks located near 1580 and 1350\xa0cm−1 for SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC are corresponding to the graphited band (G) and the disordered band (D) of carbon materials, respectively [35]. The contents of carbon in composites were detected by TG analysis, as shown in Fig.\xa02d. The mass ratios of graphene and N-doped C in SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC can be determined to be about 38.6% and 16.6%, respectively [36, 37]. The specific surface and porosity of SnTe@rGO@NC were detected by quantifying N2 adsorption–desorption (Fig. S7) [38]. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area is 32.87\xa0m2·g−1, and the average pore diameter is 13.04\xa0nm for SnTe@rGO@NC, which is beneficial to increasing the contact area of electrolyte and electrode, providing a buffer area for inhibiting the volume expansion during the reversible Na-ion (de)intercalation process [39].\nXPS was performed to disclose their surface elemental composition and valence states. In the high-resolution C 1s spectra (Fig.\xa02e), the fitting peaks at 284.8, 285.8, 287.6\xa0eV for SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC correspond to C–C/C=C, C–O and C=O bonds, respectively [40]. In addition, C-N peak appears at 285.6\xa0eV for SnTe@rGO@NC, demonstrating the successful coating of the N-doped C layer. And other two peaks centered at 284.2 and 284.3\xa0eV can be assigned to the C-Sn and C-Te, respectively, representing the formation of chemical bonds between SnTe and carbon [41]. In addition, three different types of nitrogen structures can be readily read out from Fig.\xa02f, namely, pyridinic-N (398.5\xa0eV), pyrrolic-N (400.5\xa0eV) and graphite-N (403.2\xa0eV). The introduction of nitrogen renders the π-conjugated system of carbon-rich in electronic. Thus, the electronic conductivity of SnTe@rGO@NC can be further enhanced by the carbon layer containing nitrogen. Figure\xa02g depicts the Sn 3d spectra of SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC, in which two pairs of peaks are assigned to SnTe and Sn–C, respectively. Meanwhile, Te 3d spectra in Fig.\xa02h can be fitted into two pairs of peaks, which are related to Te-Sn and Te-C in SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC [33]. The XPS characterization results reveal strong electron interactions between SnTe nanoparticles and carbon, which is beneficial to endowing SnTe@rGO@NC nanocomposite with a stable structure for Na-ion storage.\n\n3.2 Electrochemical performance and kinetics analysis\nThe sodium-ion storage performances of SnTe@rGO@NC were conducted by galvanostatic discharge/charge and CV tests. Figure\xa03a shows the CV curves of SnTe@rGO@NC in the first five cycles to illustrate the electrochemical reactivity and sodiation/desodiation behavior. The reversible weak redox peaks at around 1.56/1.92\xa0V are ascribed to the Na-ion insertion/extraction process in SnTe host, and strong couples at 0.92/1.60\xa0V correspond to the conversion reaction (SnTe\u2009+\u20092Na+\u2009+\u20092e−\u2009↔\u2009Sn\u2009+\u2009Na2Te). Meanwhile, a cathodic peak appears at 0.42\xa0V, suggesting that the elemental Sn undergoes alloying with sodium to produce Na15Sn4, and multi-step dealloying behavior occurs at around 0.65\xa0V (4Sn\u2009+\u200915Na+\u2009+\u200915e−\u2009↔\u2009Na15Sn4) [42]. By comparison, CV profiles of SnTe and SnTe@GO at 0.1\xa0mV·s−1 are depicted in Figs. S8 and S9, exhibiting weak and inconspicuous redox peaks, suggesting that the confinement effect of graphene and N-doped C can efficiently weaken polarization to enhance the electrochemical dynamics of SnTe. Figure\xa03b illustrates the corresponding galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of SnTe@rGO@NC at a current density of 50\xa0mA·g−1, exhibiting clear conversion plateaus and alloying/dealloying slopes, which align well with the CV results [43, 44]. The overlapping CV and charge–discharge curves indicate a great electrochemical reversibility.\nSnTe@rGO@NC delivers the highest first discharge/charge capacities of 485.1/261.5\xa0mAh·g−1 with the highest initial Coulombic efficiency compared with pristine SnTe and SnTe@rGO (Figs. S10 and S11). As depicted in Fig.\xa03c, SnTe@rGO@NC electrode demonstrates great cyclic stability, retaining the highest capacity retention of 188.0\xa0mAh·g−1 after 50 cycles at 50\xa0mA·g−1. Figure\xa03d exhibits the rate properties of the three electrodes, where SnTe@rGO@NC shows superior rate capability with the specific capacities of 250.0, 206.1, 165.9, 118.1, 78.3 and 44.4\xa0mAh·g−1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000\xa0mA·g−1, respectively. Figure S12 displays the charge–discharge curves of the three samples at various current densities, in which SnTe@rGO@NC exhibits the lowest polarization behavior with the increase of rate, suggesting that the hierarchical confinement effect can efficiently enhance the electron and Na-ion transfer capability. When the current density is returned to 50\xa0mA·g−1, the capacity can still maintain to high value of 243.2\xa0mAh·g−1, revealing that SnTe@rGO@NC anode possesses excellent cycling reversibility and structure stability. Moreover, at a large current density of 1000\xa0mA·g−1, the best cycling performance can be achieved for SnTe@rGO@NC, maintaining the capacity of 95.8 mAh·g−1 after 100 cycles in Fig.\xa03e. Long-term cycle stability was assessed at a current density of 200\xa0mA·g−1, as shown in Fig.\xa03f. SnTe@rGO@NC electrode exhibits a significant initial reversible capacity of 182.3\xa0mAh·g−1 and demonstrates excellent cyclability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles, showing a minimal capacity decay rate of 0.051% per cycle. In contrast, the capacity retentions of SnTe and SnTe@rGO at 200 and 1000\xa0mA·g−1 are close to zero, which testifies that the graphene and N-doped C not only serve as buffer to prevent the electrode structure collapse but also as enhancers of electron conductivity and Na+ transport kinetics.\nElectrochemical kinetic behavior of the electrodes was systematically evaluated by various characterization methods. CV test was conducted at various sweep rates ranging from 0.1 to 1.0\xa0mV·s−1. CV curves of SnTe@rGO@NC remain the similar shape at high scanning rates in Fig.\xa04a, which indicates the reversible conversion-alloying reaction and faster response to high sweep rate compared with SnTe and SnTe@rGO (Figs. S13, S14). The relationship between the peak current (i) and the scan rate (v) should obey a power law [45]:\nwhere a and b are constants. The value of b, which is the slope of the plot of lgi versus lgv, illustrates the Na+ storage mechanism: Typically, if b\u2009=\u20090.5, it suggests that the semi-infinite linear diffusion process dominates the response current; whereas b\u2009=\u20091.0 indicates that the surface capacitive process is the one that governs the current. Figure\xa04b presents the logarithmic scale of current versus scan rate, which is the peak position fitting of the SnTe@rGO@NC at different scanning speeds. The assigned b values of peaks D1, D2, C1 and C2 are 0.81, 0.88, 0.61 and 0.71, respectively. Hence, the capacity contribution behavior of SnTe@rGO@NC is consisted with the contribution of both the capacitive and diffusion processes. To further investigate the capacitive contribution ratio at various scanning speeds, a well-known equation shown below can be used to calculate the characteristic percentage at a given scan rate [46]:\nwhere k1v and k2v1/2 represent the capacitive and Na-ion diffusion contribution, respectively. The values of k1 and k2 can be determined by the slope and y-axis intercept of the linear fit of ip/v1/2 vs. v1/2 based on the equation [47]:\nAs shown in Fig.\xa04c, the capacitive contribution for SnTe@rGO@NC at 0.1\xa0mV·s−1 is 27.0%, confirming that the total charge transfer is dominant by Na-ion diffusion. Figure\xa04d shows that, as the scan rate increases, the capacitive contribution ratio also increases, being 31.9%, 35.0%, 39.1%, 44.1%, 50.9% and 54.3% for SnTe@rGO@NC at scan rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0\xa0mV·s−1, which are higher than those for bare SnTe (Fig. S13) and SnTe@rGO (Fig. S14). This pseudocapacitive behavior acts as an auspicious sign for boosting the rate performance and the capacity at high scan rates.\nTo further investigate the diffusion coefficient of sodium-ion within SnTe, SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was carried out. The potential-time function GITT curves are shown in Fig. S15a (SnTe), Fig. S16b (SnTe@rGO) and Fig.\xa04e (SnTe@rGO@NC). The formula shown below can be used to yield the Na+ diffusion coefficient [39]:\nwhere τ is the pulse time, Vm is the molar volume, m is the active mass, S is the total surface area of electrode, MB is the molar mass and Δ\\({E}_{\\text{s}}\\) and Δ\\({E}_{\\text{t}}\\) are the voltage drops. In regard to Eq.\xa0(4) and the calculation principle, the calculated Na+ diffusion coefficient of SnTe, SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC during charge–discharge is shown in Fig. 4f, S15b and S16b, where SnTe@rGO@NC electrode exhibits fast Na+ diffusion coefficients (10–9-10–11 cm2·s−1) [48, 49]. EIS was also measured to investigate the kinetics behavior, and the EIS curves of SnTe, SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC electrodes before cycling are shown in Fig. S17. After fitting, the Rct (charge transfer resistance) value of SnTe@rGO@NC is 109.0\xa0Ω, which is smaller than that of 205.2\xa0Ω for SnTe@rGO and 547.8\xa0Ω for SnTe. The above results verify that hierarchical encapsulation of graphene and N-doped C can effectively enhance the electronic and Na-ion transport dynamics.\nBesides the above-mentioned experiment characterizations, the electrochemical dynamics behavior is also studied by applying theoretical calculation. The difference in charge density of sodium adsorption on SnTe, SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC is presented in Fig.\xa04g. The results show that carbon layer encapsulation greatly facilitates sodium-ion transfer. Figure\xa04h displays Na-ion adsorption energies and sites in simplified modes of SnTe, SnTe@rGO and SnTe@rGO@NC, and the adsorption energies are −\u20091.01, −\u20092.21 and−4.39\xa0eV, respectively, which clarifies that SnTe@rGO@NC possesses the strongest Na-ion adsorption capability. The Na-ion diffusion barrier was calculated to manifest the electrochemical reaction rate inside the electrode materials. The calculated results are shown in Fig.\xa04i, in which the Na-ion migration barrier can be decreased from 0.52 to 0.13\xa0eV by graphene and N-doped C layer confinement, indicating superior sodium transfer ability and rate performance for SnTe@rGO@NC architecture.\n\n3.3 Na-ion storage mechanism\nEx situ TEM and ex situ XPS techniques were characterized at various charged/discharged states in SnTe@rGO@NC electrode to investigate Na-ion storage mechanism during initial sodiation/desodiation process. Figure\xa05a displays TEM image of SnTe@rGO@NC after discharging to 0.75\xa0V, showing that the SnTe nanoparticles are still wrapped by graphene and N-doped C layer, which suggests great morphological stability. Figure\xa05b shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, whose diffraction rings correspond to (220), (331) and (422) planes of Na2Te as well as (111), (220) and (311) planes of Sn metal [25, 42]. HRTEM image in Fig.\xa05c displays distinct lattice fringes with the spacings of 2.59 and 3.74\xa0Å, which can be assigned to (220) facet of Na2Te and (111) facet of Sn metal. HAADF-STEM image in Fig.\xa05d gives the atomic structure along (010) direction of Sn metal. Those results verify that Na2Te and Sn metal are produced in the conversion reaction. Figure\xa05e shows the EDS mapping images of C, N, Na, Sn and Te elements, which are all uniformly distributed. When discharged to 0.01\xa0V, much smaller nanoparticles tightly anchored on graphene can be observed in Fig.\xa05f, indicating the superiority of graphene encapsulation in maintaining good electrode integrity. SAED pattern in Fig.\xa05g can be assigned to cubic Na15Sn4 and cubic Na2Te, as well as (400) and (332) facets of Na15Sn4 and (311) facet of Na2Te appear in HRTEM image (Fig.\xa05h). Figure\xa05i shows HAADF-STEM image of Na15Sn4 at the atomic scale along the (010) zone axis. EDS mapping images (Fig.\xa05j) also manifest that graphene and N-doped C play an important part in preserving electrode stability at full Na-ion insertion state. When fully charged to 3.0\xa0V, SnTe nanoparticles are well wrapped by graphene and N-doped C in Fig.\xa05k, which manifests that dual carbon protection has a positive effect on maintaining the structure integration. As presented in Fig.\xa05l, diffraction spots in SAED pattern are related to (002), (0\\(\\overline{2 }\\)2) and (0\\(\\overline{2 }\\)0) planes of cubic SnTe along (100) zone axis. Clear lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 3.16\xa0Å can be observed in Fig.\xa05m, which is assigned to the (200) facet of SnTe. The results clarify that the charge product is regenerated to SnTe, which demonstrates excellent cyclic reversibility [50]. HAADF-STEM image (Fig.\xa05n) can be assigned to the atom arrangement of SnTe along the (\\(\\overline{1 }\\)01) zone axis, in which the ball-stick mode of SnTe matches well with the atom image. Figure\xa05o shows the uniform distribution of C, N, Na, Sn and Te elements, clarifying the excellent stability of composite architecture after large-sized Na-ion insertion/extraction. To summarize, ex situ TEM illustrates from the atomic scale that the SnTe goes through a conversion-alloying dual reaction mechanism for Na-ion storage, whose reaction process can be described as SnTe\u2009+\u20092Na+ \u2009+\u20092e−\u2009↔\u2009Sn\u2009+\u2009Na2Te, 4Sn\u2009+\u200915Na+ \u2009+\u200915e−\u2009↔\u2009Na15Sn4.\nFurthermore, ex situ XPS was conducted to investigate the electronic structure of elements for SnTe@rGO@NC during the first charge–discharge process in Fig.\xa06a. In C 1s spectrum, it can be noted that typical O–C=O, C=O, C–O, C–N, C–C/C=C, C–Te and C–Sn peaks appear at 291.2, 289.1, 287.9, 286.5, 284.8, 284.3 and 284.2\xa0eV for various charging/discharging states [24]. The strong peak at 279.1\xa0eV mainly comes from the acetylene black conductive agent [51]. In the N 1s spectra, the pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphite-N are located at 399.1, 400.5 and 403.2\xa0eV, respectively. In the O 1s spectra, the peaks at approximately 530.1, 530.8, 531.7, 532.7 and 536.8\xa0eV are indexed to Sn–O, Na–O, O=C, O-C and Na Auger, respectively. It can be observed that the binding energy of Sn 3d spectra moves to a smaller position after Na-ion insertion into the host, and remains unchanged until the state of complete discharge. A reversible process is presented during the charging process, indicating that Sn acts as the redox center to be responsible for the charge compensation. Meanwhile, C-Sn bond consistently exists during Na-ion insertion/extraction process. As for the Te 3d spectra, the peaks centered at 576.7/587.2\xa0eV and 577.0/587.5\xa0eV are related to Te-C and Te2− 3d3/2/Te2− 3d3/2 of SnTe or Na2Te, respectively. XPS results prove the stable existence of Sn–C and Te– bonds during the Na-ion storage process, which play an important role in improving the electrode stability and kinetics behavior.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

After that, the sample was carbonized in a tube furnace at 500\xa0°C for 2\xa0h with an argon atmosphere to acquire SnTe@rGO@NC.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nField emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Verios G4) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, Themis Z) were applied to characterize the morphology and microstructure information of the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to analyze the structure and crystallinity of the samples prepared. Raman spectrum was obtained by Alpha 300R, and thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer (NETZACH, 449 F3) was measured from room temperature to 800\xa0°C at a heating rate of 10\xa0°C·min−1 in air. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5000 Versa Probe, Al Ka) was performed to analyze the chemical state of the surface elements.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nIn the argon-filled glove box (O2 and H2O level\u2009<\u20090.01\xa0ppm), the CR-2025 type coin cells were assembled using Na metal as a counter electrode and glass fiber as a separator. Polyvinylidene fluoride (acting as a binder), acetylene black and the active material were blended with a mass ratio of 1:1:8, and the mixture was then dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone to form a uniform slurry, which was later coated on a piece of copper foil and dried at 60\xa0°C throughout 12\xa0h. A small disk with a diameter of 12\xa0mm was obtained by cutting the dried film to perform as the anode electrode. The electrolyte was 1\xa0M NaClO4 in the mixed solution of diethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate (1:1 in volume) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted on the electrochemical workstation. On the NEWARE battery test system, the charge–discharge test was measured at different current densities.\n\n2.4 Theoretical calculation\nThe density functional theory (DFT) computation was implemented in Materials Studio. All atomic and electronic structure calculations followed the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formulation. The calculated parameters are as follows: The kinetic cutoff energy was 500\xa0eV based on a plane-wave basis, the self-consistent electronic energy was less than 10–5\xa0eV and the geometry energy convergence criterion was smaller than 0.01\xa0eV·Å−1. The 3\u2009×\u20091\u2009×\u20091\xa0k-point mesh was set when integrating the Brillouin zone by using Monkhorst-Pack.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Three times, tests were done and marked A, B, and C to show that the results were always consistent. Only two or more positive results were thought to prove the presence of the investigated compounds in MCV. The flavonoids and alkaloids found in this study are similar to those reported by a previous study which used solvent water [54, 55]. Furthermore, using water solvent is still comparable to other solvents such as flavonoid and tannin in methanol, hexene, ethyl acetate and acetone solvents [56].\n\n3.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)\nFigure\xa03 shows the first weight loss at below 200\xa0°C derived from evaporation of the leftover organic solvents. The organic fraction decomposed and was eliminated as CO2 at these temperatures [57]. At 2 in Fig.\xa03, the sudden weight loss of 300–600\xa0°C is ascribed to the breakdown of zinc acetate dihydrate and the weight loss constantly decreasing until 580 ºC; afterwards, no significant heat loss can be seen. 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C, and 900\xa0°C were chosen as calcination temperatures from this result, and a complete ZnO formation can be known with heating at more than 580\xa0°C [26]. This shows that temperatures from 700 to 900\xa0°C are good enough for the thermal decomposition of the metal–organic precursor and fabricated ZnO ion batteries.\n\n3.3 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine the functional groups included into ZNO-NPs production by detecting bond vibrations. Band assignments for all samples analysed during this study are shown in Table\xa02. Figure\xa04 shows a comparison of FTIR spectra of calcined ZnO-NPs at three different temperatures (700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C, and 900\xa0°C). Due to the metal–oxygen stretching mode, peaks at 200\xa0cm−1 to 600\xa0cm−1 resemble metal oxides [58]. The peak value of 594\xa0cm−1 was obtained in this study used to indicate the stretching modes of the Zn–O bond. As for wavenumber at 895\xa0cm−1 and 964\xa0cm−1 were indicated RCOO− or OH− group of phenol [59, 60], significant amounts of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and amines can be found in plants, and these compounds can be used in the stabilisation, capping and synthesis of nanoparticles [61]. According to [41], the stretching vibration of the O–H group is represented by strong absorbance peak at 3000\xa0cm−1 to 4000\xa0cm−1. The large absorption band about 3742\xa0cm−1 is owing to the presence of several O–H groups on the surface of NPs, which are likely to be common [41]. When the annealing temperature was increased, only a broad band of zinc oxide and RCOO– was observed.\n\n3.4 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)\nThe SEM micrographs see (Fig.\xa05) of the different samples showed that they had structures with considerable particle agglomeration and having size range of 100 to 300\xa0nm. Agglomeration reported in Fig.\xa05 is common nature of metal oxide after calcination [41]. Particles calcined at 900\xa0°C showed the highest level of agglomeration, and this trend continued with higher calcination temperatures. In Fig.\xa07, the XRD examination revealed a rise in crystallinity and grain size, which is consistent with this observation. The large surface area (active site) of nanoparticles with small crystallite size [62].\n\n3.5 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)\nFigure\xa06 shows TEM images of ZnO-NPs calcined at 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C, and 900\xa0°C The TEM observations support the SEM findings about the form and size of the crystallites. The sample that was calcined at 700\xa0°C and 800\xa0°C had highly agglomerated structures with irregular spherical crystal forms. However, the samples obtained using a longer thermal calcination procedure (900\xa0°C) appear to affect the morphology of ZnO-NPs into more irregular polyhedral forms, generating larger particles in larger planar blocks.\nThe TEM pictures showed that when the calcination temperatures increase, the crystallites will become larger. A sample calcined at 700\xa0°C is found to be smaller than a calcined at 900\xa0°C, due to more thermal energy available at higher temperatures and crystals can form and growth. This explains why the 900\xa0°C sample had bigger crystals than the 700\xa0°C sample did. The average size of a crystallite is about 38\xa0nm, 42.5\xa0nm, and 65.3\xa0nm for samples that were heated to 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C, and 900\xa0°C, respectively. The sample that was calcined at 900\xa0°C had bigger crystals than the samples that were calcined at 700\xa0°C and 800\xa0°C. This is because the annealing temperature, which is 900\xa0°C, is higher. Higher temperatures always make it easier for crystals to grow faster because there is more energy available for phase formation and crystal growth [33].\nSelected area electron diffraction was also used to look at the structure and crystal orientations of the ZnO-NPs (SAED). Insets of the HRTEM images of each ZnO-NPs sample show the SAED patterns (Fig.\xa06c, f, and i). The ZnO-NPs are made up of many different crystals, which can be seen in the pattern of the SAED. Samples that were calcined at 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C, and 900\xa0°C have interplanar distances of 0.2517\xa0nm, 0.2532\xa0nm, and 0.2556\xa0nm, respectively. These distances are the same as the (002) plane spacing. The XRD results show that ZnO-NPs have a hexagonal wurtzite structure. This (002) crystal plane proves that.\n\n3.6 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)\nAll the diffraction peaks are in the range 20° until 80°, indicating a hexagonal wurtzite structure for the ZnO-NPs confirmed by PDF reference 8,901,397 (Fig.\xa07) [63]. The intensity of the diffraction peaks increases as the calcination temperature rises, indicating that the ZnO phase is becoming stronger [63]. The (100), (002), and (101) planes correspond to the three sharp peaks. Using the Debye–Scherrer, Eq.\xa0(1), the average size of Zn-ONPs was determined based on the most intense peak (101). Which is D, the crystalline size in nm, k is the Scherrer constant equal to 0.9, λ is x-ray wavelength (0.15406\xa0nm), while β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak in radians, and θ is the peak location in radians. From the calculation, the data show the commercial ZnO typically 63\xa0nm size crystallites, while ZnO-NPs calcined at 700, 800 and 900\xa0°C have 17\xa0nm, 29\xa0nm and 55\xa0nm size crystallites, respectively.\n\n3.7 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimeter (ASAP) Analysis\nFigure\xa08 shows the adsorption–desorption isotherms plot of ZnO-NPs at different calcined temperatures (700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C, and 900\xa0°C). Therefore, based from the isotherm plots, all the ZnO-NPs samples are in type IV adsorption isotherms by the IUPAC classification, which are associated with mesoporous structures with pore sizes ranging from about 2\xa0nm to 50\xa0nm [64]. The hysteresis type of ZnO-NPs is H3 which described solid shapes with very wide distribution of pore size as shown in Fig.\xa08 [23, 65]. The relative pressure of the desorption branch step area leading to a lower closure point is almost completely influenced by the adsorption. Table 3 shows the SBET of ZnO-NPs samples annealed at different temperatures measured by N2 gas adsorption. As a results, ZnO-NPs showed highest surface area when calcined at 800\xa0°C and lowest surface area calcined at 900\xa0°C. At lower calcination temperatures (700–800\xa0°C), surface area and pore volume increased gradually owing to the degradation of the precursor. Lower calcination temperatures, as stated in the thermal study, may have led to the evolution of distinct gases from the surface and bulk of the precursors, resulting in more porous structures and an increase in surface area. However, at higher calcination temperatures 900\xa0°C, the surface area and pore volume of NPs decrease owing to agglomeration, crystallite development, and inter-crystallite sintering; this is consistent with the literature [66]. ZnO-NPs' large surface area allows for enhanced electrode interface–analyte interaction and easier electron transport during the oxidation process [67].\n\n3.8 UV–Visible (UV–Vis) Spectrometer\nThe wavelength range of 200–800\xa0nm at room temperature using UV–Vis absorption spectrum from Shimadzu cooperation is recorded all peak ZnO-NPs at 377\xa0nm. UV–Vis peak for all ZnO-NPs dispersed in distilled water is shown in Fig.\xa09 [26, 68]. As stated by a previous study, the range of 360–380\xa0nm is the maximum optical absorption band [26, 68]. The observed all absorption curve are 377\xa0nm (3.27\xa0eV), which is close to the band gap of the ZnO 1\xa0s-1\xa0s electron transition (3.37\xa0eV) [69]. Above 3.3\xa0eV absorption in ZnO assembled to the band-to-band transition. As particle size decreases, so does the distance between electronic levels and the band gap. This is due to the electron hole pairs being significantly closer together. Furthermore, the coulombic interaction between them cannot be missed, resulting in a larger total kinetic energy [70].\n\n3.9 Cyclic Voltammograms (CV)\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to examine the electrochemical performance of a ZnO-NPs. Figure\xa010 shows CV curves measured at 0.1\xa0mV\xa0s-1. The ZnO-NPs calcined at 700\xa0°C was chosen due to the highest initial charge capacity and good cycling stability after 100 cycles. CV is used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of ZnO structures as anode materials for Sodium-ion batteries. The CV curves for five cycles are shown in Fig.\xa010. Two cathodic peaks, one at 0.35\xa0V (major peak) and the other at 0.98\xa0V (minor peak), are seen in the first cycle. Addition of Na+ into the carbon is responsible for the 0.35\xa0V peak, whereas breakdown of the electrolyte causes the 0.98\xa0V and the production of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Subsequent cycles showed no sign of the 0.35\xa0V peak, indicating that the 0.35\xa0V peak was caused by dominated conversion/alloying processes. The multistep de-sodiation of the NaZn alloy to create ZnO is responsible for the appearance of numerous peaks at distinct potentials, 0.09, 1.47, and 2.86\xa0V, in the anodic region during the first cycle. Equation\xa0(1)-(2) represent the ZnO conversion/alloying and sodiation insertion reactions [71]. The pattern obtained in Fig.\xa010 represents conversion and sodiation reaction [70].\nThe cycling stability of the produced ZnO-NPs was further examined by monitoring their cycle performance up to 100 cycles.\nZnO-NPs calcined at 700, 800, and 900\xa0°C have different cycling performances, as shown in Fig.\xa011a. A voltage range of 0.01–3.00\xa0V was used to perform 0.1 C rate cycling on the test cells [72]. The highest\xa0irreversible discharge capacity of 591 mAh g−1 was observed in ZnO-NPs calcined at 700\xa0°C, followed by 440 mAh g−1 in NPs calcined at 900\xa0°C and 355 mAh g−1 in NPs calcined at 800\xa0°C at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The reversible discharge of ZnO-NPs calcined at 700\xa0°C is 128 mAh g-1 through second cycle and drops to 94 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles with 73% capacity retention. The reversible discharge capacity of ZnO-NPs calcined at 900\xa0°C decreased from 120 mAh g-1 for second cycle to 80 mAh g-1 for 100th cycle, with 66% retention rate. This may be Na-ions have shorter diffusion lengths in ZnO due to the material's small particle sizes, which also increases the active sites for ion insertation/de-insertation [72]. In comparison, the reversible discharge capacity of ZnO-NPs calcined at 800\xa0°C was 96 mAh g-1 at the second cycle and dropped to 59 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles with 62% retention capacity. Moreover, furthermore, the initial galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the ZnO-NPs at current density of 100 mAhg-1 are displayed in Fig.\xa011(b), (c), and (d) [72]. As can be seen, the initial discharge curves are distinct from subsequent discharge curves for all electrodes, indicating the formation of an SEI layer during the initial sodiation. As a result, all electrodes experience irreversible capacity loss during the initial cycle, resulting in a low initial Coulombic efficiency [49]. Figure\xa011b shows that the plateau voltages of the charge–discharge profiles match well with the peak voltage in Fig.\xa010 CV.\nThe discharge performance of the half cells at various current densities that range from 0.2 C to 1.0 C is shown in Fig.\xa012. ZnO-NPs for 700\xa0°C exhibits a discharge capacity of around 349 mAhg−1 at a low rate of 0.2 C. However, the discharge capacity gradually drops and after 66 cycles discharge capacity of about 58 mAhg−1. Nevertheless, this sample ZnO-NPs practically recovered their original capacities when the rate was again dropped to 0.2 C after being exposed to large current loads (1.0 C), which illustrates the remarkable stability of ZnO-NPs [73]. Evidently, ZnO-NPs at a calcination temperature of 700\xa0°C show the highest initial discharge and had good cycling stability after 66 cycles. At ZnO-NPs calcined at 800\xa0°C show the lowest initial discharge, 169 mAhg−1. After 66 cycles, the discharge capacity is 44 mAhg−1. While ZnO-NPs 900\xa0°C show moderately initial discharge which is 325 mAhg−1 and after 66 cycles is 54 mAhg−1.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

For plant extract preparation, the method from [34, 48, 49] was adapted with some modifications. After washing with tap water, the green MCV leaves were rinsed with Milli-Q water from Synergy ®UV and dried in an oven at 100\xa0°C for 1\xa0h. The leaves were blended into fine powders by using a blender.\nApproximately 10\xa0g of dry crushed leaves was added to 100\xa0ml of Milli-Q in a water bath and left for 20\xa0min at 60\xa0°C. The leaves extract was cooled at room temperature and filtered using Whatman filter paper No.1. The filtrate was collected. Triplicates of phytochemical test were done towards MCV leaves extract using the method from [50] to investigate the compound’s presence in the extract. Figure\xa01 shows overall process from plant extract preparation and finally the phytochemical test. The obtained extract was directly used for the green synthesis of ZnO-NPs.\n\n2.2 Synthesis of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs)\nThe precursor used in this experiment was 99% pure zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn (CH3COO)2(H2O)2 from Sigma-Aldrich to produce ZnO-NPs. The method from [51, 52] was adapted and modified to synthesize ZnO-NPs. 0.1\xa0M Zinc acetate dihydrate was stirred for 10\xa0min and added to 25\xa0ml of the leaf’s extracts in a magnetic stirrer for 2\xa0h at 60\xa0°C. The light green colour was detected. Centrifuging at 6000\xa0rpm for 20\xa0min separated particles. The solution was then rinsed with methanol. The precursor powder was obtained after 12\xa0h of oven drying at 100\xa0°C as can be seen in Fig.\xa02 [34]. ZnO precursor was calcined at 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C and 900\xa0°C for 8\xa0h [26].\n\n2.3 Characterization\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) from PerkinElmer was used to investigate the optimum heat treatment temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen at a heating rate of 10\xa0°C/min; the initial and final temperature was 30 to 900\xa0°C, and 0.6\xa0g precursor powder was used in TGA. The TGA curves of the metal precursor solution after drying at 100\xa0°C to remove the solvent. Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) (PerkinElmer) was prepared using ATR, and the sample was measured at a resolution of 4000 to 400\xa0cm−1 and 16 scans per sample using 2\xa0mg of ZnO-NPs. For morphology studies, samples of ZnO-NPs were observed at with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM 6360 LA) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (JEOL JEM-2100 F) with a field emission electron gun (FEG) which is highly bright and stable. For SEM measurements, the particle size of the ZnO-NPs was analysed at two different magnifications, 5,000X and 10,000X, with an acceleration voltage of 15\xa0kV and a working distance of 15\xa0mm. About half of a small spatula was dissolved in deionized water for the TEM measurement. The sample was put in an ultrasonic bath for 30\xa0min to make sure that the crystallites were spread out evenly. The sample of liquid was then put on the TEM grid and heated in an oven for 1\xa0h at 80\xa0°C. TEM measurements were done with a 200\xa0kV accelerating voltage and a field emission electron gun (FEG). X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) was used to analyse\xa0the transmission of ZnO-NPs (Shimadzu XRD 600). Bragg-optical Brentano's setup, on the other hand, used CuKα, a scanning speed of 2\xa0deg/min, and radiation with the sample spinning from 20 to 80°. A UV–Visible (Shimadzu UV-1800) spectrophotometer measures electromagnetic radiation that includes ultraviolet and visible light and is sent as a wave with a wavelength or frequency between 200 and 800\xa0nm pass through quartz cuvette for the absorption spectra of the ZnO-NPs samples using Milli-Q water as a blank reference.\n\n2.4 Preparation of Electrode\nZnO-NPs nanoparticles, carbon black (Sigma-Aldrich,\u2009>\u200999.5%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) were fabricated at a weight ratio of 75:20:5 in Nmethyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent to create working electrodes. A few pieces of labelled copper foil were pasted with homogenous slurry and then, dried at 100\xa0°C in a vacuum for 6\xa0h. The weight range of active material was measured at around ∼2\xa0mg\xa0cm−2 [53].\n\n2.5 Electrochemical Performance\nCoin-type cells examined electrode electrochemistry. These cells were performed in an argon-filled glovebox (MBRAUN, Unilab, Germany, H2O, O2\u2009<\u20090.1\xa0ppm) with sodium metal (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% trace metal basis) as the counter electrode, a Whatman glass fibre (GF/D) as the separator, and a mixture of 1\xa0M NaClO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) in propylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.7% pure) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (99%) as the electrolyte. A Neware battery analyser conducted galvanostatic cycling between 0.01 and 3.00\xa0V versus Na/Na+. CV was done on a CHI 700E electrochemical workstation at 0.3\xa0mV\xa0s−1 and 0.01–3.00\xa0V versus Na/Na+ [53].\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

For plant extract preparation, the method from [34, 48, 49] was adapted with some modifications. After washing with tap water, the green MCV leaves were rinsed with Milli-Q water from Synergy ®UV and dried in an oven at 100\xa0°C for 1\xa0h. The leaves were blended into fine powders by using a blender.\nApproximately 10\xa0g of dry crushed leaves was added to 100\xa0ml of Milli-Q in a water bath and left for 20\xa0min at 60\xa0°C. The leaves extract was cooled at room temperature and filtered using Whatman filter paper No.1. The filtrate was collected. Triplicates of phytochemical test were done towards MCV leaves extract using the method from [50] to investigate the compound’s presence in the extract. Figure\xa01 shows overall process from plant extract preparation and finally the phytochemical test. The obtained extract was directly used for the green synthesis of ZnO-NPs.\n\n2.2 Synthesis of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs)\nThe precursor used in this experiment was 99% pure zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn (CH3COO)2(H2O)2 from Sigma-Aldrich to produce ZnO-NPs. The method from [51, 52] was adapted and modified to synthesize ZnO-NPs. 0.1\xa0M Zinc acetate dihydrate was stirred for 10\xa0min and added to 25\xa0ml of the leaf’s extracts in a magnetic stirrer for 2\xa0h at 60\xa0°C. The light green colour was detected. Centrifuging at 6000\xa0rpm for 20\xa0min separated particles. The solution was then rinsed with methanol. The precursor powder was obtained after 12\xa0h of oven drying at 100\xa0°C as can be seen in Fig.\xa02 [34]. ZnO precursor was calcined at 700\xa0°C, 800\xa0°C and 900\xa0°C for 8\xa0h [26].\n\n2.3 Characterization\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) from PerkinElmer was used to investigate the optimum heat treatment temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen at a heating rate of 10\xa0°C/min; the initial and final temperature was 30 to 900\xa0°C, and 0.6\xa0g precursor powder was used in TGA. The TGA curves of the metal precursor solution after drying at 100\xa0°C to remove the solvent. Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) (PerkinElmer) was prepared using ATR, and the sample was measured at a resolution of 4000 to 400\xa0cm−1 and 16 scans per sample using 2\xa0mg of ZnO-NPs. For morphology studies, samples of ZnO-NPs were observed at with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM 6360 LA) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (JEOL JEM-2100 F) with a field emission electron gun (FEG) which is highly bright and stable. For SEM measurements, the particle size of the ZnO-NPs was analysed at two different magnifications, 5,000X and 10,000X, with an acceleration voltage of 15\xa0kV and a working distance of 15\xa0mm. About half of a small spatula was dissolved in deionized water for the TEM measurement. The sample was put in an ultrasonic bath for 30\xa0min to make sure that the crystallites were spread out evenly. The sample of liquid was then put on the TEM grid and heated in an oven for 1\xa0h at 80\xa0°C. TEM measurements were done with a 200\xa0kV accelerating voltage and a field emission electron gun (FEG). X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) was used to analyse\xa0the transmission of ZnO-NPs (Shimadzu XRD 600). Bragg-optical Brentano's setup, on the other hand, used CuKα, a scanning speed of 2\xa0deg/min, and radiation with the sample spinning from 20 to 80°. A UV–Visible (Shimadzu UV-1800) spectrophotometer measures electromagnetic radiation that includes ultraviolet and visible light and is sent as a wave with a wavelength or frequency between 200 and 800\xa0nm pass through quartz cuvette for the absorption spectra of the ZnO-NPs samples using Milli-Q water as a blank reference.\n\n2.4 Preparation of Electrode\nZnO-NPs nanoparticles, carbon black (Sigma-Aldrich,\u2009>\u200999.5%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) were fabricated at a weight ratio of 75:20:5 in Nmethyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent to create working electrodes. A few pieces of labelled copper foil were pasted with homogenous slurry and then, dried at 100\xa0°C in a vacuum for 6\xa0h. The weight range of active material was measured at around ∼2\xa0mg\xa0cm−2 [53].\n\n2.5 Electrochemical Performance\nCoin-type cells examined electrode electrochemistry. These cells were performed in an argon-filled glovebox (MBRAUN, Unilab, Germany, H2O, O2\u2009<\u20090.1\xa0ppm) with sodium metal (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% trace metal basis) as the counter electrode, a Whatman glass fibre (GF/D) as the separator, and a mixture of 1\xa0M NaClO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) in propylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.7% pure) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (99%) as the electrolyte. A Neware battery analyser conducted galvanostatic cycling between 0.01 and 3.00\xa0V versus Na/Na+. CV was done on a CHI 700E electrochemical workstation at 0.3\xa0mV\xa0s−1 and 0.01–3.00\xa0V versus Na/Na+ [53].\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

However, as shown in Fig.\xa02a–d, there are few differences for the morphology (shown by SEM) of samples before and after treatment, which means the depositing operation does not have obvious effect on using of particles and thus does not need further treatment before using as anode materials.\nFigure\xa03a shows the adsorption-desorption isotherms of samples, according to Fig.\xa03a, the specific surface area of EU1100 is 231.1 m2 g−\u20091, and when carbonization temperature is increased to be 1300\xa0°C, the value changed little (240.6 m2 g−\u20091), which is quite different from some biomass based hard carbon (usually less than 100 m2 g−\u20091 according to some studies [11, 23,24,25]). According to Fig.\xa03b, the diameter of pores in EU1100 and EU1300 mainly locates at ~\u20090.9\xa0nm (micropores) and ~\u20093.6\xa0nm (mesopores), these pore are blocked after heat treatment with pitch, and thus there are obviously weakened peaks in pore size distribution curves of EU1100M and EU1300M, which leads to significant decreasing of specific surface area (29.2 m2 g−\u20091 for EU1100M and 34.5 m2 g−\u20091 for EU1300M shown in Fig.\xa03a).\nThe deposition during heating samples together with pitch may not only block the pores of EU1100 and EU1300, which results in obvious reduction of specific surface area, but also make new crystallite structure with many disordered bonds and high interlayer distance form. The ratio of D peak and G peak in Raman spectrum can be used to describe the changes of defects in carbon materials, the higher value ID/IG is regarded as more disordered bonds (such as tetrahedral bonds or dangling bonds) in sample [32, 33]. The Raman spectra of samples are shown in Fig.\xa03c, according to Fig.\xa03c, the value ID/IG of EU1100M and EU1300M are higher than those of EU1100 and EU1300, indicating more disordered bonds in EU1100M and EU1300M. These disordered bonds may result in non-uniform stacking of crystallites and then increase interlayer distance, which can be confirmed by XRD spectra shown in Fig.\xa03d. According to Fig.\xa03d, the interlayer distance of defects-modified samples (EU1100M and EU1300M) has been increased. Reasonable increasing of defects in crystallites are usually regarded as positive result for storage of sodium ion [32, 34], and thus the electrochemical performances of EU1100M and EU1300M may be better, which can be confirmed in the following electrochemical tests.\nFigure\xa04a shows the 1st charge/discharge curves of samples, according to Fig.\xa04a, although the ICE of EU1300 is higher than that of EU1100, their charge specific capacities are similar, which can be attributed to the few changes of specific surface areas for EU1100 and EU1300 (shown in Fig.\xa03a). Additionally, the ICE and specific capacities of EU1100 and EU1300 are all increased after modifying defects (EU1100M and EU1300M shown in Fig.\xa04a). As shown in Fig.\xa04b, the improved capacities mainly occur at the voltage regions less than 0.1\xa0V (plateau region in Fig.\xa04a) and 0.1 −\u20091.5\xa0V (slope region in Fig.\xa04a), the formation of these voltage regions could be attributed to insertion or filling of sodium ion in interlayers and disordered crystallites of hard carbon [16], therefore, the increased capacities in these voltage regions may be caused by new formation of structure with more disordered bonds and higher interlayer distance in EU1100M and EU1300M (confirmed by Raman and XRD spectra in Fig.\xa03c–d). The improvement for ICE and region of capacity can also be confirmed by CV analysis (shown in Fig.\xa05). As shown in Fig.\xa05a–b, although 2nd and 3rd curves of EU1100 or EU1100M overlap well, the area (from ~\u20090.1\xa0V to ~\u20091.2\xa0V) in EU1100M surrounded by 1st (red line) and 3rd (green line) curves is smaller than that of EU1100, which illustrates that the reversibility of EU1100M is better. Additionally, the area surrounded by green line of EU1100M from 0\xa0V to ~\u20091.5\xa0V is larger than that of EU1100, indicating higher capacity during this voltage region, which is consistent with the result shown in Fig.\xa04b. Similar phenomenon about ICE and capacity can also been in CV curves of EU1300 (Fig.\xa05c) and EU1300M (Fig.\xa05d).\nThe rate performances of samples are shown in Fig.\xa06a, according to Fig.\xa06a, the discharge specific capacities of EU1300 are lower than those of EU1100, especially at high current densities (500 mA g−\u20091 and 1\xa0A g−\u20091), which indicates that the purely increasing carbonization temperature cannot improve the specific capacity of Eucommia ulmoides barks-derived hard carbon for SIB. The specific capacities of EU1100M and EU1300M are higher than those of EU1100 and EU1300 from 100 mA g−\u20091 to 1\xa0A g−\u20091, respectively, indicating the effectiveness of modifying defects. Table\xa01 shows the electrochemical performances of different carbon based anodes in SIB, as shown in Table\xa01, Eucommia ulmoides barks-derived hard carbon have high ICE and good rate performance.\nAdditionally, as shown in Fig.\xa06a, although the capacities of EU1300M are higher than those of EU1100M from 100 mA g−\u20091 to 500 mA g−\u20091, when the current density is increased to be 1\xa0A g−\u20091, the capacities of EU1300M decrease quickly and show lower values than those of EU1100M, which can be attributed to less disordered bonds and lower interlayer distance of EU1300M (shown in Fig.\xa03c and d). The improvement of electrochemical performances after modifying defects can also be confirmed by cycling tests (shown in Fig.\xa06b), after 500 times cycling testes at high current density (1\xa0A g−\u20091), the discharge capacity and capacity retention of EU1100M (capacity retention: 83.5%) and EU1300M (capacity retention: 72.8%) are all higher than those of EU1100 and EU1300, respectively.\nIn order to validate the method (modifying defects) is also effective for other biomass based hard carbon, Cupressus funebris (cypress wood) was used. The preparing process of cypress wood-derived hard carbon was same to EU1300 and EU1300M, and the obtained samples were named as CW1300 and CW1300M, respectively. Additionally, the fabrication and electrochemical measurements of SIB using CW1300 or CW1300M as anode materials were also same to EU1300 and EU1300M.\nFigure\xa07a shows the 1st charge/discharge curves of CW1300 and CW1300M, indicating the ICE and specific capacities can be increased after modifying defects. As shown in Fig.\xa07b, the improved capacity mainly occurs at the voltage region less than 0.1\xa0V (plateau region in Fig.\xa07a). Additionally, the discharge specific capacities of samples can also be improved by modifying defects, which can be confirmed in rate tests (Fig.\xa07c) and cycling tests (Fig.\xa07d), respectively.\nAccording to SEM images shown in Fig.\xa08a–b, although there are few differences for the morphology of CW1300 and CW1300M, the SEM image of CW1300 (Fig.\xa08a) is different from that of EU1300 (Fig.\xa02c), indicating that the structure of CW1300 and EU1300 may be different. The differences of structure can be confirmed by specific surface area analysis (Fig.\xa08c), the specific surface area of CW1300 is 91.2 m2 g−\u20091, which is smaller than that of EU1300 (240.6 m2 g−\u20091). Additionally, according to Fig.\xa08c and d, respectively, the decreasing of specific surface area and increasing of disordered bonds after modifying defects can be also seen in cypress wood-derived hard carbon.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Eucommia ulmoides barks were washed, dried and then ground to be powders. The powders were carbonized (Ar atmosphere) to be 1100 or 1300\xa0°C with a heating rate of 5\xa0°C min−\u20091 and held at the final carbonization temperature for 30\xa0min. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were washed with HCl to remove salt, followed by washing with deionized water until pH\u2009=\u20096.5-7. After dried at 110\xa0°C, the hard carbon was obtained. The hard carbon carbonized at 1100\xa0°C was named as EU1100, and the hard carbon carbonized at 1300\xa0°C was named as EU1300.\nEU1100 or EU1300 was put into corundum boat, coal tar pitch powders with a softening point of 78\xa0°C was put beside the EU1100 or EU1300 without direct contact. The samples were carbonized (Ar atmosphere) to be 1000\xa0°C with a heating rate of 5\xa0°C min−\u20091 and held at 1000\xa0°C for 30\xa0min. After cooling down to room temperature, the defects-modified samples were obtained and named as EU1100M and EU1300M, respectively.\n\n2.2 Fabrication and Electrochemical Measurements of SIB\nEU1100, EU1300, EU1100M or EU1300M was mixed with carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), the mixture was coated on Cu foil and dried at 120\xa0°C under vacuum condition for obtaining anode. The anode was then tailored to circle with 13\xa0mm diameter. SIB was fabricated under Ar atmosphere with the circular anode as working electrode, 1\xa0mol L−\u20091 NaCF3SO3 in diglyme as electrolyte, glass fiber membrane (Whatman, GF/D) as separator and sodium metal as counter electrode. Land Battery Test System was used to complete galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis at different current densities from 0 to 2.5\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). CHI660E electrochemistry working station was used to carry out cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−\u20091, within the range from 0 to 3\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). All electrochemical tests were operated at room temperature.\n\n2.3 Characterization\nScanning electron microcopy (SEM) was done with a JEOL JSM-7610FPlus instrument. Specific surface area and pore analysis were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at 77\xa0K on JW-BK200C, the specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [27], and the pore size distribution (PSD) was calculated by two-dimensional version of the non-local density functional theory (2D-NLDFT) heterogeneous surface model [28,29,30,31], in which the lower pore width limit was 0.36\xa0nm and the λ (model parameter) was set as 3.5. Raman spectra were performed on a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution instrument using λ\u2009=\u2009532\xa0nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were carried out on a Rigaku SmartLab3000W instrument using CuKα radiation (40\xa0kV, 30\xa0mA).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Eucommia ulmoides barks were washed, dried and then ground to be powders. The powders were carbonized (Ar atmosphere) to be 1100 or 1300\xa0°C with a heating rate of 5\xa0°C min−\u20091 and held at the final carbonization temperature for 30\xa0min. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were washed with HCl to remove salt, followed by washing with deionized water until pH\u2009=\u20096.5-7. After dried at 110\xa0°C, the hard carbon was obtained. The hard carbon carbonized at 1100\xa0°C was named as EU1100, and the hard carbon carbonized at 1300\xa0°C was named as EU1300.\nEU1100 or EU1300 was put into corundum boat, coal tar pitch powders with a softening point of 78\xa0°C was put beside the EU1100 or EU1300 without direct contact. The samples were carbonized (Ar atmosphere) to be 1000\xa0°C with a heating rate of 5\xa0°C min−\u20091 and held at 1000\xa0°C for 30\xa0min. After cooling down to room temperature, the defects-modified samples were obtained and named as EU1100M and EU1300M, respectively.\n\n2.2 Fabrication and Electrochemical Measurements of SIB\nEU1100, EU1300, EU1100M or EU1300M was mixed with carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), the mixture was coated on Cu foil and dried at 120\xa0°C under vacuum condition for obtaining anode. The anode was then tailored to circle with 13\xa0mm diameter. SIB was fabricated under Ar atmosphere with the circular anode as working electrode, 1\xa0mol L−\u20091 NaCF3SO3 in diglyme as electrolyte, glass fiber membrane (Whatman, GF/D) as separator and sodium metal as counter electrode. Land Battery Test System was used to complete galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis at different current densities from 0 to 2.5\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). CHI660E electrochemistry working station was used to carry out cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−\u20091, within the range from 0 to 3\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). All electrochemical tests were operated at room temperature.\n\n2.3 Characterization\nScanning electron microcopy (SEM) was done with a JEOL JSM-7610FPlus instrument. Specific surface area and pore analysis were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at 77\xa0K on JW-BK200C, the specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [27], and the pore size distribution (PSD) was calculated by two-dimensional version of the non-local density functional theory (2D-NLDFT) heterogeneous surface model [28,29,30,31], in which the lower pore width limit was 0.36\xa0nm and the λ (model parameter) was set as 3.5. Raman spectra were performed on a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution instrument using λ\u2009=\u2009532\xa0nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were carried out on a Rigaku SmartLab3000W instrument using CuKα radiation (40\xa0kV, 30\xa0mA).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Eucommia ulmoides barks were washed, dried and then ground to be powders. The powders were carbonized (Ar atmosphere) to be 1100 or 1300\xa0°C with a heating rate of 5\xa0°C min−\u20091 and held at the final carbonization temperature for 30\xa0min. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were washed with HCl to remove salt, followed by washing with deionized water until pH\u2009=\u20096.5-7. After dried at 110\xa0°C, the hard carbon was obtained. The hard carbon carbonized at 1100\xa0°C was named as EU1100, and the hard carbon carbonized at 1300\xa0°C was named as EU1300.\nEU1100 or EU1300 was put into corundum boat, coal tar pitch powders with a softening point of 78\xa0°C was put beside the EU1100 or EU1300 without direct contact. The samples were carbonized (Ar atmosphere) to be 1000\xa0°C with a heating rate of 5\xa0°C min−\u20091 and held at 1000\xa0°C for 30\xa0min. After cooling down to room temperature, the defects-modified samples were obtained and named as EU1100M and EU1300M, respectively.\n\n2.2 Fabrication and Electrochemical Measurements of SIB\nEU1100, EU1300, EU1100M or EU1300M was mixed with carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), the mixture was coated on Cu foil and dried at 120\xa0°C under vacuum condition for obtaining anode. The anode was then tailored to circle with 13\xa0mm diameter. SIB was fabricated under Ar atmosphere with the circular anode as working electrode, 1\xa0mol L−\u20091 NaCF3SO3 in diglyme as electrolyte, glass fiber membrane (Whatman, GF/D) as separator and sodium metal as counter electrode. Land Battery Test System was used to complete galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis at different current densities from 0 to 2.5\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). CHI660E electrochemistry working station was used to carry out cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−\u20091, within the range from 0 to 3\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). All electrochemical tests were operated at room temperature.\n\n2.3 Characterization\nScanning electron microcopy (SEM) was done with a JEOL JSM-7610FPlus instrument. Specific surface area and pore analysis were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at 77\xa0K on JW-BK200C, the specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [27], and the pore size distribution (PSD) was calculated by two-dimensional version of the non-local density functional theory (2D-NLDFT) heterogeneous surface model [28,29,30,31], in which the lower pore width limit was 0.36\xa0nm and the λ (model parameter) was set as 3.5. Raman spectra were performed on a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution instrument using λ\u2009=\u2009532\xa0nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were carried out on a Rigaku SmartLab3000W instrument using CuKα radiation (40\xa0kV, 30\xa0mA).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

After cooling down to room temperature, the defects-modified samples were obtained and named as EU1100M and EU1300M, respectively.\n\n2.2 Fabrication and Electrochemical Measurements of SIB\nEU1100, EU1300, EU1100M or EU1300M was mixed with carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), the mixture was coated on Cu foil and dried at 120\xa0°C under vacuum condition for obtaining anode. The anode was then tailored to circle with 13\xa0mm diameter. SIB was fabricated under Ar atmosphere with the circular anode as working electrode, 1\xa0mol L−\u20091 NaCF3SO3 in diglyme as electrolyte, glass fiber membrane (Whatman, GF/D) as separator and sodium metal as counter electrode. Land Battery Test System was used to complete galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis at different current densities from 0 to 2.5\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). CHI660E electrochemistry working station was used to carry out cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−\u20091, within the range from 0 to 3\xa0V (versus Na+/Na). All electrochemical tests were operated at room temperature.\n\n2.3 Characterization\nScanning electron microcopy (SEM) was done with a JEOL JSM-7610FPlus instrument. Specific surface area and pore analysis were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at 77\xa0K on JW-BK200C, the specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method [27], and the pore size distribution (PSD) was calculated by two-dimensional version of the non-local density functional theory (2D-NLDFT) heterogeneous surface model [28,29,30,31], in which the lower pore width limit was 0.36\xa0nm and the λ (model parameter) was set as 3.5. Raman spectra were performed on a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution instrument using λ\u2009=\u2009532\xa0nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were carried out on a Rigaku SmartLab3000W instrument using CuKα radiation (40\xa0kV, 30\xa0mA).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, KNHCF nanocubes were synthesized on the surface of CNTFs directly as a binder-free cathode via chemical bath deposition and subsequent chemical etching. The specific reaction process is explained in Scheme S1. Simultaneously, the rugby ball-shaped NTP was grown on CNTFs by a mild solvothermal reaction to serve as an advanced anode for the FARSIB. Thereafter, both the as-fabricated KNHCF@CNTF and NTP@CNTF were immersed in a gel electrolyte consisting of Na2SO4 and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) for a period of time and dried to form a thin layer of gel electrolyte. Finally, the quasi-solid-state FARSIB was fabricated by twisting the cathode and anode together.\n\n3.1 Morphology and Structure of the Cathode Materials\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig.\xa02a) exhibits a CNTF with a uniform diameter of about 100\xa0μm, which is composed of intertwined carbon nanotubes. In Fig.\xa02b, c, the SEM images show that Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays were uniformly coated on the surface of the CNTF by the simple chemical bath deposition method. After chemical etching, the nanosheet arrays are transformed into nanocubes with large porous gaps (Fig.\xa02d). The internal free space can not only promote the diffusion of electrolyte ions for better rate performance, but also accommodate the volume change of the electrode materials during intercalation and deintercalation of alkali cations, resulting in long cycle life and high specific capacity. It is noted that the fiber-shaped electrode still maintains an admirable tensile strength of about 300\xa0MPa after the active materials are coated on its surface (Fig. S1), which is of great significance for the application of fiber-shaped energy-storage devices. The morphology of a nanocube with a side length of about 160\xa0nm was further investigated by low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as displayed in Fig. S2. Figure\xa02e, f exhibits the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum and elemental mapping, suggesting the coexistence and homogeneous distribution of the elements K, Ni, Fe, C, and N. To study the effect of the concentration of potassium ferricyanide solution on morphology, SEM images of the corresponding products at various concentrations are shown in Fig. S3. As the concentration of the reaction solution increases, the nanocubes gradually tend toward regular cube shapes, whereas the free space between the cubes gradually decreases.\nMore evidence for the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to KNHCF was obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig.\xa02g, the characteristic peaks of the obtained nanosheets on CNTFs can all be indexed to those of α-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 38-0715) except for the background peaks of the CNTFs themselves. After chemical etching, the characteristic peaks located at 17.3°, 24.5°, 35.0°, and 39.3° are consistent with the (200), (220), (400), and (420) phases of KNHCF, while the peaks of Ni(OH)2 disappear, implying that the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are converted to KNHCF nanocubes. Figure S4 exhibits the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra, further demonstrating the coexistence of the elements K, Ni, Fe, C, and N. The high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig.\xa02h) exhibits two main peaks located at 856.4 and 874.0\xa0eV, respectively, consistent with the Ni 2p3/1 and Ni 2p1/2 states of Ni2+, respectively [37]. In addition, the Fe 2p spectrum (Fig.\xa02i) of KNHCF contains two main peaks located at 709.8 and 723.6\xa0eV, corresponding to those previously reported for Fe3+ [46].\n\n3.2 Electrochemical Characterization of the Cathode Materials\nBenefiting from the absence of conductive additives and binders, the cathode material for the ARSIBs was expected to display more efficient charge transfer and ion diffusion. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves at 0.05\xa0A\xa0cm−3 of KNHCF@CNTF generated under different concentrations of the reaction solution are shown in Fig. S5, indicating that the volumetric capacity of KNHCF@CNTF is the maximum when the concentration is 3.0\xa0mM. Figure\xa03a displays the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Ni(OH)2@CNTF, KNHCF powders, and KNHCF@CNTF at 5\xa0mV\xa0s−1. Evidently, the Ni(OH)2@CNTF exhibits much less coverage than that of KNHCF@CNTF, implying that the untreated Ni(OH)2@CNTF is virtually incapable of storing and releasing sodium ions. As revealed in Fig. S6, the pristine CNTF just provides little contribution to the volumetric capacity. In addition, compared with KNHCF powder, the KNHCF@CNTF shows a much lower voltage hysteresis of 0.045\xa0V and higher current, suggesting its faster reaction kinetics and larger capacity, which is further verified by the GCD curves at 0.05\xa0A\xa0cm−3 (Fig. S7) [11, 47]. As shown in Fig.\xa03b, the GCD curves at various current densities displayed a stable output voltage plateau of about 0.4\xa0V. It is worth mentioning that the KNHCF@CNTF electrode displays negligible voltage hysteresis at a range from 0.05 to 5.0\xa0A\xa0cm−3 and only required 21.1\xa0s per discharge or charge at a large current density of 5.0\xa0A\xa0cm−3, indicating its superfast charge–discharge characteristic. More importantly, benefiting from the fast reaction kinetics, the KNHCF@CNTF electrode achieves a greater volumetric capacity (58.54\xa0mAh\xa0cm−3 at 0.05\xa0A\xa0cm−3) and better rate performance (72.7% retention after a 100-fold increase in current density), whereas the KNHCF powder electrode possesses a small volumetric capacity of 48.60\xa0mAh\xa0cm−3 at the same current density [calculated from the corresponding GCD curves (Fig. S8)] and poor capacity retention of 25.5% when the current density increases to 0.8\xa0A\xa0cm−3 (Fig.\xa03c). Such improved rate performance was demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement (Fig. S9). For KNHCF@CNTF, the diameter of the semicircle in the high-frequency region was smaller and the slope of the line in the low-frequency region was greater than that of KNHCF powder, corresponding to better electron conductivity and ion diffusion [11, 48]. This demonstrates that the direct growth of active materials on the conductive substrates is beneficial to the electron transport and ion diffusion. The long-term cyclability of the KNHCF@CNTF was investigated at 0.8\xa0A\xa0cm−3, and an excellent capacity of 52.85\xa0mAh\xa0cm−3 was retained after 1000 cycles (Fig.\xa03f), with a low volumetric capacity decay of only 9.8% and high coulombic efficiency of about 100%, exhibiting outstanding cycle stability and reaction reversibility. The SEM images (Fig. S10) reveal that the free-standing nanocubes with a porous structure are still preserved even after long-term Na+ (de)intercalation (500 and 1000 cycles, 0.8\xa0A\xa0cm−3), further indicating the remarkable structural stability.\nElectrochemical kinetic analysis was performed by plotting CV curves to gain further insight into the Na+ storage process. Figure\xa03d shows the CV curves of the KNHCF@CNTF cathode measured at different scan rates from 1.0 to 5.0\xa0mV\xa0s−1, in which two nearly symmetric redox peaks correspond to the intercalation/extraction of Na+ in the KNHCF lattice. The proportion of diffusion-controlled and capacitive contributions can be described by Eq.\xa01 [49, 50]:\nwhere values of b close to 0.5 and 1.0 correspond to diffusion-controlled and capacitive behavior, respectively. The values of b calculated from the redox peaks are 0.92 and 0.87, respectively, implying a capacitor-like process for the storage of Na+. In addition, the percentages of capacitive and diffusion-controlled contributions can be calculated by Eqs.\xa02 and 3 [51, 52]:\nin which k1 and k2 are constants. Figure S11 exhibits the percentage contributions of the two kinetic processes at various scan rates. The contributions of the capacitive process are 76.7%, 81.4%, 84.4%, 86.7%, and 87.8% as the scan rates are increased from 1.0 to 5.0\xa0mV\xa0s−1. Based on the above analysis, the large contribution of capacitive behavior can be responsible for the superfast charge–discharge characteristic and excellent rate performance [50].\nTo gain insight into the structural evolution of the KNHCF cathode during the charge–discharge process, ex situ XRD and XPS were performed in various states of Na+ extraction/insertion (Fig. S12). Clearly, no new characteristic diffraction peaks appear, suggesting that the charge–discharge process belongs to a solid-solution reaction without the formation of a new phase [51]. Moreover, the characteristic (200) and (400) peaks slightly shift to larger angles with the insertion of Na+ and returned to their original position after the subsequent charging process, suggesting that the insertion of Na+ can lead to a volume decrease in the unit cell. This phenomenon is attributed to the attractive interactions of the inserted Na+ with the surrounding C\u2009≡\u2009N groups [53]. In addition, Fig. S13 displays the Na 2p and Fe 2p XPS regions for the fully charged and discharged states. In the Na 2p region, there is no intensity at the initial or the fully charged states, but a peak appears at 1072.3\xa0eV during the discharge process, implying the highly reversible insertion/release of sodium in the host material during the discharge/charge process. To further explore the storage mechanism of sodium ions, the valence states of Fe were measured in various states. Figure S13b shows the Fe 2p XPS regions at the initial state, in which the main peaks at 709.8 and 723.6\xa0eV correspond to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 states of Fe3+, respectively. After being discharged to 0\xa0V, the location of the main peak transfers to 708.5\xa0eV, indicating that Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+ upon the insertion of sodium ions (Fig. S13a). The main peak then returns to its initial location after the subsequent charging process, further demonstrating the excellent reversibility. Based on the above analysis, the reversible electrochemical reaction of sodium insertion and extraction in the cathode material can be depicted as: xNa+\u2009+\u2009KNi[Fe(CN)6]\u2009+\u2009xe−\u2009↔\u2009NaxKNi[Fe(CN)6].\n\n3.3 Morphology and Structure of the Anode Materials\nAs a high-performance anode material, rugby ball-shaped NTP was synthesized by a one-step solvothermal reaction on CNTFs. The SEM images in Fig.\xa04a, b show the surface of a CNTF uniformly coated by microparticles. The TEM image (Fig.\xa04c) reveals that the single active material consisted of rugby ball-shaped micron-scale particles with sizes of about 1\xa0μm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig.\xa04d) reflects the high crystallinity of the rugby ball-shaped NTP, wherein the lattice fringe spacing of 0.37\xa0nm corresponds to its (113) plane. The EDS spectrum (Fig.\xa04e) and its corresponding EDS mapping images (Fig.\xa04g) distinctly demonstrate the coexistence and uniform spatial distribution of Na, Ti, P, and O elements. XRD measurement was carried out to further confirm the composition and structure (Fig.\xa04f), in which all characteristic peaks are indexed to NTP (JCPDS No. 01-085-2265). The successful synthesis of NTP was likewise verified by XPS as shown in Fig. S14, the results of which were consistent with those of XRD and TEM. For comparison, carbon-coated NTP powders (NTP@C) were prepared and investigated by SEM and TEM (Fig. S15). The SEM and TEM images (Fig. S15a, b) show that the NTP@C powder retained the rugby ball-shaped structure. The HRTEM image (Fig. S15c) clearly shows that the NTP surface is uniformly coated with an amorphous carbon shell with a thickness of about 4\xa0nm, forming a core–shell structure.\n\n3.4 Electrochemical Characterization of the Anode Materials\nThe electrochemical properties of the obtained NTP@CNTF were investigated in a three-electrode system under the same conditions as for the cathode. Figure\xa05a compares the CV curves of pristine CNTF, NTP powder, NTP@C powder, and NTP@CNTF measured at 2\xa0mV\xa0s−1. Like the positive electrode, pristine CNTFs make little contribution to the volumetric capacity. In addition, compared with the NTP and NTP@C powders (same active materials loading with NTP@CNTF), the NTP@CNTF owns smaller separation of the redox peaks and a larger coverage area, indicating its smaller polarization and higher reversible capacity, which is further verified by their GCD curves at 1.6\xa0A\xa0cm−3 (Fig. S16). As shown in Fig.\xa05b, the CV curves of NTP@CNTF measured at various scan rates show a pair of sharp redox peaks, corresponding to the characteristic potentials of a Ti3+/Ti4+ redox couple [54]. Figure\xa05c shows that the b values corresponding to the redox peaks are 0.76 and 0.71, respectively, from which it may be assumed that the sodium storage is a combination of surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes [49]. The GCD curves (Fig.\xa05d) at various current densities demonstrate stable charge–discharge plateaus of about −\u20090.85/−\u20090.75\xa0V, which is consistent with the CV results. Besides, Fig.\xa05e displays the specific capacities of NTP@CNTF at various current densities and its corresponding coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, the NTP@CNTF can achieve an excellent volumetric capacity of 98.4\xa0mAh\xa0cm−3 at 0.2\xa0A\xa0cm−3 and possess a high capacity retention of 82.5% as the current density increases to 8.0\xa0mA\xa0cm−3, suggesting remarkable rate performance. The high coulombic efficiency implies the high reversibility of sodium-ion intercalation and deintercalation at the anode material. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (Fig. S17) indicates the remarkable electronic conductivity and ion diffusivity of the anode. The long-term cycling stability of NTP@CNTF was also explored (Fig.\xa05f), with 87.6% retention after 3000 cycles at a current density of 4.0\xa0mA\xa0cm−3. As demonstrated in Fig. S18, the SEM images show that the free-standing rugby ball-shaped structure is well preserved after 1000 cycles and only partly disrupts even after 3000 cycles, suggesting strong adhesion between active material and CNTF. The outstanding electrochemical performance achieved in this work is superior to those of many previously reported NTP-based materials that require high-temperature heat treatment and binders (Table S1).\n\n3.5 Electrochemical Performance and Flexibility Test of as-Prepared FARSIBs\nBased on the above analysis, an aqueous Na-ion full cell was fabricated using KNHCF@CNTF and NTP@CNTF as the cathode and anode, respectively. To achieve charge balance between them, the length ratio of the cathode and anode is set at about 2:1. Figure S19 shows the corresponding CV curves at 5\xa0mV\xa0s−1. To verify the potential of the two binder-free electrodes for wearable energy-storage devices, a quasi-solid-state FARSIB was successfully assembled with a CMC-Na2SO4 polymer electrolyte. A low-resolution SEM image (Fig. S20) of the fiber-shaped device displayed a twisted structure. Figure\xa06a shows the CV curves of this FARSIB, all of which exhibit a pair of apparent redox peaks at various scan rates from 1 to 5\xa0mV\xa0s−1. The GCD curves (Fig.\xa06b) were measured at various current densities from 0.2 to 4.0\xa0A\xa0cm−3 and displayed a stable discharge plateau of\u2009~\u20091.15\xa0V. Notably, the FARSIB delivers a volumetric capacity of 34.21\xa0mAh\xa0cm−3 at 0.2\xa0A\xa0cm−3 and can retain a high capacity of 24.23\xa0mAh\xa0cm−3 at 4.0\xa0A\xa0cm−3, implying its remarkable rate properties. The long-term cycling stability and corresponding coulombic efficiency of the FARSIB were tested at 2.0\xa0A\xa0cm−3 (Fig.\xa06c), still maintaining about 84.7% of initial capacity after 500 cycles and high coulombic efficiency close to 100%. The volumetric energy and power density of our FARSIB are displayed in Fig.\xa06d. The FARSIB reaches a maximum volumetric energy density of 39.32\xa0mWh\xa0cm−3 and a maximum volumetric power density of 4.60\xa0W\xa0cm−3, which considerably exceed the values previously reported for other fiber-shaped energy-storage devices, such as Co//Zn battery [13], GO/MWCNT//MoS2-rGO/MWCNT [55], Ni//Zn battery [11], NiCo//Zn battery [56], titanium wire/Co3O4 nanowires//carbon fibers/graphene [57], and NIB [5]. In addition, based on the total mass of the fiber-shaped cathode and anode (including active and inactive components), the specific energy/power densities were calculated as shown in Fig. S21. Thanks to the lightweight CNTFs, the assembled FARSIB exhibits a maximum specific energy density of about 27.72\xa0Wh\xa0kg−1 and still maintains a high specific energy density of about 19.61\xa0Wh\xa0kg−1 achieving a maximum power density of about 3.24\xa0KW\xa0kg−1. For fiber-shaped energy-storage devices, mechanical flexibility is of great significance for practical application as a power source for wearable electronic devices. As shown in Fig.\xa06e, there are negligible changes in capacity at 1.2\xa0A\xa0cm−3 under various bending angles, exhibiting the excellent mechanical flexibility of the assembled device. Furthermore, the full battery exhibits superior mechanical stability with only 5.7% of initial capacity loss after bending at 90° for 3000 cycles (Fig. S22), which can be attributed to the absence of binders and strong adhesion between the active materials and CNTF. Figure S23 exhibits the electrochemical impedance spectroscopies of the assembled FARSIB before and after bending tests, indicating the slight increase in the contact resistance (Rs) and faradic charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrodes after the bending test. In addition, an LED could be powered by two of the assembled fiber-shaped batteries connected in series (Fig.\xa06f), and the brightness of the LED barely changed when the devices were bent at various angles (Fig. S24). To further demonstrate the potential of the FARSIBs in wearable electronics, two assembled FARSIBs were woven into the flexible textile with an abbreviation (NB) of “Na-ion battery” and powered for a red LED shown in Fig. S25, verifying the practicability and high flexibility of our FARSIBs.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

CNTFs were cleaned with ethanol and deionized water. After being dried at 70\xa0°C overnight, the CNTFs were pretreated in O2 plasma for 8\xa0min at 150\xa0W. Firstly, 10\xa0g of NiSO4·6H2O and 2\xa0g K2S2O8 were dissolved in 100\xa0mL of H2O under magnetic stirring and 5\xa0mL aqueous ammonia (28%) was added into the above solution. Then, the pretreated CNTFs were suspended into the reaction for 40\xa0min under slowly stirring. After that, the obtained CNTFs were washed repeatedly with distilled water and dried at 60\xa0°C to get Ni(OH)2@CNTFs. Next, the obtained Ni(OH)2@CNTFs were placed in a solution of potassium ferricyanide at a certain concentration (1.5, 3.0, and 6.0\xa0mM) for 24\xa0h at room temperature. Finally, the KNHCF@CNTFs were cleaned with deionized water and dried at 60\xa0°C in a vacuum for 12\xa0h. The mass loading of active material on the surface of CNTF (3.0\xa0mM) is about 2.42\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. For comparison, the powder of KNHCF was obtained by the same method. Ni(OH)2 powder (100\xa0mg) and excess potassium ferricyanide were mixed under continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature. After 24\xa0h, the reaction products were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water. Finally, the KNHCF powder was obtained after vacuum drying at 60\xa0°C overnight.\n\n2.2 Preparation of NTP@CNTF\nNTP@CNTF was prepared by a simple and mild solvothermal method. CNTFs were cleaned and dried as described above. Firstly, 1\xa0mL of TiCl3 solution (30\xa0wt% HCl) was dropwise added into 30\xa0mL of ethylene glycol under string and kept stirring for 0.5\xa0h. Then, 1\xa0mL of phosphoric acid was dropwise added into the above solution. Next, 1\xa0g of NaH2PO4·2H2O was added into it. After stirring for 0.5\xa0h, the reaction solution and pretreated CNTFs were placed into a 50-mL reaction vessel to heat at 150\xa0°C for 6\xa0h. Finally, the obtained NTP@CNTFs were rinsed with ethanol and distilled water and dried at 80\xa0°C for 24\xa0h. The mass loading of active material on the surface of CNTF is about 2.7\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. For comparison, the powder product in Teflon-lined stainless autoclave was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. After dried at 60\xa0°C for 12\xa0h, 0.1\xa0g of obtained powder was added into 50\xa0mL of glucose solution (0.04\xa0M) under magnetic stirring. After stirring for 24\xa0h, the glucose-coated NTP powders were collected by centrifugation and dried at 60\xa0°C overnight.

CNTFs were cleaned with ethanol and deionized water. After being dried at 70\xa0°C overnight, the CNTFs were pretreated in O2 plasma for 8\xa0min at 150\xa0W. Firstly, 10\xa0g of NiSO4·6H2O and 2\xa0g K2S2O8 were dissolved in 100\xa0mL of H2O under magnetic stirring and 5\xa0mL aqueous ammonia (28%) was added into the above solution. Then, the pretreated CNTFs were suspended into the reaction for 40\xa0min under slowly stirring. After that, the obtained CNTFs were washed repeatedly with distilled water and dried at 60\xa0°C to get Ni(OH)2@CNTFs. Next, the obtained Ni(OH)2@CNTFs were placed in a solution of potassium ferricyanide at a certain concentration (1.5, 3.0, and 6.0\xa0mM) for 24\xa0h at room temperature. Finally, the KNHCF@CNTFs were cleaned with deionized water and dried at 60\xa0°C in a vacuum for 12\xa0h. The mass loading of active material on the surface of CNTF (3.0\xa0mM) is about 2.42\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. For comparison, the powder of KNHCF was obtained by the same method. Ni(OH)2 powder (100\xa0mg) and excess potassium ferricyanide were mixed under continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature. After 24\xa0h, the reaction products were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water. Finally, the KNHCF powder was obtained after vacuum drying at 60\xa0°C overnight.\n\n2.2 Preparation of NTP@CNTF\nNTP@CNTF was prepared by a simple and mild solvothermal method. CNTFs were cleaned and dried as described above. Firstly, 1\xa0mL of TiCl3 solution (30\xa0wt% HCl) was dropwise added into 30\xa0mL of ethylene glycol under string and kept stirring for 0.5\xa0h. Then, 1\xa0mL of phosphoric acid was dropwise added into the above solution. Next, 1\xa0g of NaH2PO4·2H2O was added into it. After stirring for 0.5\xa0h, the reaction solution and pretreated CNTFs were placed into a 50-mL reaction vessel to heat at 150\xa0°C for 6\xa0h. Finally, the obtained NTP@CNTFs were rinsed with ethanol and distilled water and dried at 80\xa0°C for 24\xa0h. The mass loading of active material on the surface of CNTF is about 2.7\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. For comparison, the powder product in Teflon-lined stainless autoclave was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. After dried at 60\xa0°C for 12\xa0h, 0.1\xa0g of obtained powder was added into 50\xa0mL of glucose solution (0.04\xa0M) under magnetic stirring. After stirring for 24\xa0h, the glucose-coated NTP powders were collected by centrifugation and dried at 60\xa0°C overnight.

For an enhanced conductivity of the resulting CSC, the ZIF-67 particles (C-ZIF-67) are connected together (‘stringed’) by a network of CNTs (Fig. S1). Sn119 NMR spectroscopy reveals that several tetravalent thiostannate species (SnS32−, SnS44−, and Sn2S64−) exist in solution and these are referred to collectively as ‘SnxSyn−’ (Fig. S2) [43]. Within the ion-exchange process, Co2+ in ZIF-67 reacts rapidly with SnxSyn− species, forming a unique superstructure comprised of nano-dispersed CoS2 and SnS2 phases. The overall reaction follows Eq.\xa0(1):\nAs shown in Fig.\xa01b, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns exhibit the diffraction peaks of CoS2 (PDF No. 00-41-1471), SnS2 (PDF No. 00-23-0677), and carbon, verifying their presence in the CSC. Compared with standard phase, the reflection for the (0 0 1) plane of SnS2 registers a slight shift toward lower angles, implying an expanded interlayer spacing [14, 44]. The expanded interlayer spacing could be associated with the use of thiostannate precursor and low-temperature ion-exchange process. The ion-exchange reaction of thiostannate with ZIF-67 typically occurs at −5\xa0°C in 1\xa0h, where fast reassembly of SnS2 results in the expanded interlayer spacing. Also, the relatively low annealing temperature (450\xa0°C) is beneficial to retain the expanded interlayer spacing of SnS2. The content of carbon nanotubes in CSC is obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which is ca. 3.75 wt% (Fig. S3). By inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the elemental content of CSC is analyzed, revealing that the mole ratio of Co/Sn/S is ca. 1.00/1.73/5.46 (Table S1). The corresponding mass content of CoS2 and SnS2 in the CSC is 26.95 and 69.30wt%, respectively (Fig.\xa01c). The type-IV N2 adsorption isotherms of CSC present an evident hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores (Fig.\xa01d). The corresponding pore width (inset) mainly centers in the range of 20–45\xa0nm. The theoretical capacity of CSC anode (CT-CSC) can be evaluated roughly according to the equation: CT-CSC\u2009=\u2009xCT-CoS2\u2009+\u2009yCT-SnS2, where x and y is the percentage content of CoS2 and SnS2 in the CSC. The CT-CoS2 and CT-SnS2 are the theoretical capacity of CoS2 and SnS2, which is 872 and 1136 mAh g−1, respectively. Thus, CT-CSC\u2009=\u20090.2695\u2009×\u2009872\u2009+\u20090.695\u2009×\u20091136\u2009=\u20091024.5 mAh g−1.\nFigure\xa01e exhibits field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of CSC, which consists of carbon nanotubes-stringed core/shell architecture (inset). Such core/shell structures are greatly influenced by precursors, solvents, reaction temperatures, and concentrations (Figs. S4–S6). The content of SnS2 in the CSC can be tuned to some extent by varying the concentration of thiostannate solution (Fig. S6). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image shows the typical radial morphology of the CSC (Fig.\xa01f). Energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping yields a distribution of the elements C, Sn, Co, and S in the CSC, which correspond well with the TEM image (Fig.\xa01g). The details of shell and core were further characterized by TEM. The shell is actually composed of nanosheets (Fig. S7a). As displayed in Fig.\xa01h, high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) image clearly exhibits interplanar spacings of 0.248 and 0.615\xa0nm for CoS2 (2 1 0) and SnS2 (0 0 1) lattice planes, verifying such nanosheets assembled by nano-dispersed SnS2 (red) and CoS2 (blue-green). The TEM-EDS line-scan profiles show matched peaks with Co, Sn, S elements, further suggesting the superstructure of shell co-assembled by SnS2 and CoS2 phases (Fig. S7b). Corresponding to SEM image of CSC (inset), the core of CSC shows an abundant microstructure, in which the pore (green) can be observed (Fig. S8a). As shown in Fig.\xa01i, HR-TEM image of the core also exposes the lattice planes of SnS2 (0 0 1) and CoS2 (2 1 0), which accord with the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S8b). Such results verify that the core of CSC is also assembled by nano-dispersed SnS2 and CoS2 phases. The CSC was further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S9, compared with commercial CoS2 sample, the high-resolution of XPS of Co 2p of CSC shows a ca. 0.45\xa0eV shift toward higher binding energy. Moreover, the high-resolution of XPS of Sn 3d of CSC also appears a 0.61\xa0eV shift toward higher binding energy. Such results imply the presence of chemical effect between CoS2 and SnS2 in CSC anodes [45, 46].\n\n2.2 Half-Cell Properties\nThe electrochemical properties of anode materials are firstly evaluated by testing half-cells with Na foil as counter electrode and ether-based electrolytes with fluorine-containing sodium salt. For comparison, commercial SnS2 and CoS2 powders with well-matched XRD patterns to standard phases are also tested (Fig. S10). Compared with the CSC, the N2 isotherms of commercial SnS2 and CoS2 samples typically exhibit no evident hysteresis loop, whereby the corresponding pore diameter distributions display nonporous properties (Fig. S11). After initial three scans at 0.1\xa0mV\xa0s−1, mono-component metal sulfides (CoS2 and SnS2) and anodes composed of both compounds show gradually stabilized CV curves (Fig. S12). The initial CV curve of the CSC anode shows three oxidation peaks, which are associated with SnS2 phase at 0.70–1.55\xa0V and CoS2 phase at 1.70–2.10\xa0V, respectively. The reduction peak at 1.60–1.80\xa0V is correlated with the CoS2 phase, while the peaks at 0.50–1.10\xa0V are linked to SnS2 and formation of solid electrolyte interphase (Fig. S13a). In subsequent scans, the reduction peak related to CoS2 gradually disappears, which could result from electrochemical activation of nano-dispersed SnS2 and CoS2 phases [16, 22]. As shown in Fig.\xa02a, the activated CSC delivers a main oxidized peak potential range (0.75–1.65\xa0V), which is close to that of SnS2 (0.80–1.45\xa0V) but remarkably lower than that of CoS2 (1.30–2.18\xa0V) and SnS2/CoS2 mixture (1.25–2.15\xa0V). Correspondingly, CSC anode displays an average charge voltage of ca. 1.30\xa0V, which is close to that of SnS2 but lower than that of CoS2 (ca. 1.92\xa0V) (Fig.\xa02b). Compared with commercial SnS2/CoS2 mixture with average charge voltage of ca. 1.81\xa0V, CSC anode also shows evident low-plateau merit (Fig.\xa02c). This verifies that the construction of a superstructure assembled from nano-dispersed SnS2 and CoS2 phases is crucial for lowering the intrinsically high plateau of the CoS2 phase. Specifically, as shown in Fig.\xa02d, the introduction of nano-dispersed SnS2 phase into CSC effectively lowers the intrinsic average charge voltage of CoS2 up to ca. 0.62\xa0V. This in turn will translate to a higher plateau voltage for full-cells, thereby improving their energy density.\nCompared with other metal chalcogenide anodes, CSC exhibits obvious high-capacity and low-plateau advantages (Fig.\xa02e). Moreover, compared with commercial SnS2 and CoS2, and mixtures of the two, CSC shows a remarkably improved rate capability, ranging from 0.5 to 20 A g−1 with a high capacity of 327.6 mAh g−1anode at 20 A g−1 (Fig.\xa02f). The corresponding discharge/charge curves are exhibited in Fig. S14. When tested with ester-based electrolyte, CSC shows similar CV curves to that in ether-based electrolyte, but the reversible capacity, to the same cutoff voltage, shrinks markedly (Fig. S15). In addition, compared with in ether-based electrolyte, the rate capability of CSC is greatly deteriorated (Fig. S16), along with an increased resistance of charge transfer (Fig. S17). Such phenomena suggest the key role of ether-based electrolyte in stabilizing metal sulfide anodes and realizing fast charge transfer, which could be associated with good compatibility between metal sulfide and ether solvent [1, 15]. Evidently, the CSC anode effectively circumvents the intrinsic high voltage of CoS2 and low-rate drawback of SnS2 in ether-based electrolyte. Compared with other anode materials in half-cells, CSC also shows a remarkable high-rate capability (Fig.\xa02g, Table S2)_ENREF_12_ENREF_13_ENREF_14_ENREF_15_ENREF_16_ENREF_17_ENREF_18 [47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. The CSC can be cycled at high current densities (1 and 10 A g−1) with excellent long-life cyclability, specifically, 410.8 mAh g−1anode at 10 A g−1 over 500 cycles without decay (Fig.\xa02h).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical Kinetics\nThe electrochemical kinetics of the CSC anode in half-cells is studied in detail by reference to the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared with electrodes made from commercial samples of SnS2 and CoS2, the Nyquist curve for a typical CSC anode shows a semi-circle with smaller diameter, implying a faster charge transfer (Fig.\xa03a). Based on the derived equivalent circuit, the resistances of charge transfer for CSC, commercial SnS2 and CoS2 anodes are 9.5, 32.7, and 13.4 Ω, respectively (Fig.\xa03b). To compare Na+ diffusion coefficient (\\(D_{{{\\text{Na}}^{ + } }}\\)) in CSC and SnS2/CoS2 mixture, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was conducted at 0.05 A g−1 for 0.5\xa0h, followed by relaxation for 2\xa0h. The typical GITT discharge profiles of CSC and SnS2/CoS2 mixture are shown in Fig.\xa03c. As illustrated in Fig.\xa03d, \\(D_{{{\\text{Na}}^{ + } }}\\) can be calculated following equation \\(D_{{{\\text{Na}}^{ + } }} = \\frac{{4L^{2} }}{\\pi \\tau }\\left( {\\frac{{\\Delta E_{S} }}{{\\Delta E_{t} }}} \\right)^{2}\\), where L is Na+ diffusion length (cm), τ is the current impulse time (s), t is relaxation time (s), ΔES is steady-state potential change (V), ΔEt is the instantaneous potential change (V) used to deduce IR drop [55, 56]. Corresponding to the GITT profiles, the calculated average \\(D_{{{\\text{Na}}^{ + } }}\\) is ca. 0.5\u2009×\u200910–9 cm2\xa0s−1, which is around twice that in half-cell with SnS2/CoS2 mixture (Fig.\xa03e). Evidently, compared with simply mixed SnS2/CoS2 anode, the CSC assembly of nano-dispersed SnS2 and CoS2 particles shows remarkable superiority in terms of charge transfer kinetics and ionic diffusion.\nNext, the pseudocapacitive contribution to charge storage in the Na//CSC half-cell was evaluated, on the basis that this component gives rise to faster charge transfer kinetics. CV curves at different rates are shown in Fig.\xa03f, and the correlation of peak currents (i) and scan rates (v) was assessed against the relationship i\u2009=\u2009avb, where a and b are adjustable constants [57]. As shown in Fig.\xa03g, the resultant b-values are 0.98, 0.81, and 0.93, respectively, which implies the presence of a substantial pseudocapacitive contribution. The latter can be quantified through the equation i\u2009=\u2009k1v\u2009+\u2009k2v1/2, where k1v and k2v1/2 represent pseudocapacitive and ion-diffusion controlled contribution, respectively [57,58,59]. As shown in Fig.\xa03h, CSC anodes exhibit dominant pseudocapacitive contributions at scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.5\xa0mV\xa0s−1, specifically, 64.0%, 67.0%, 71.6%, 78.3%, and 86.3%, respectively. Figure\xa03i displays the CV curves of Na//CSC at 1.5\xa0mV\xa0s−1, in which the shaded region represents the pseudocapacitive contribution. This, together with the small charge transfer resistance and high \\(D_{{{\\text{Na}}^{ + } }}\\), explains the excellent rate capability of the CSC anode.\n\n2.4 Electrochemical Mechanism\nTo investigate the mechanism that underpins the superior electrochemical behavior of CSC anodes, samples were at various states-of-(dis)charge characterized by ex situ XRD. The copper current collector in a Na//Cu half-cell discharged to 0.4\xa0V shows only the intrinsic diffraction peaks for metallic copper, verifying no evident electrochemical reaction between Na and Cu collector in ether-based electrolyte (Fig. S18). Compared with original samples (CSC, commercial SnS2 and CoS2), the samples after electrochemical activation exhibit dramatically different XRD patterns, indicating the occurrence of phase transition (Fig. S19). For CoS2, the relevant electrochemical reactions are as follows: CoS2\u2009+\u2009xNa+ \u2009+\u2009xe−\u2009→\u2009NaxCoS2, NaxCoS2\u2009+\u2009(4\xa0−\xa0x)Na+ \u2009+\u2009(4\xa0−\xa0x)e−\u2009↔\u20092Na2S\u2009+\u2009Co [60]. For SnS2, the corresponding electrochemical reactions are as follows: xNa+ \u2009+\u2009SnS2\u2009+\u2009xe−\u2009→\u2009NaxSnS2, NaxSnS2\u2009+\u2009(4-x)Na+ \u2009+\u2009(4-x)e−\u2009↔\u20092Na2S\u2009+\u2009Sn, Sn\u2009+\u2009yNa+ \u2009+\u2009ye−\u2009↔\u2009NaySn [40, 61]. Compared with single phases, the CSC anode shows similar featured diffraction peaks to pure SnS2, while the peaks from the CoS2 diffraction pattern are difficult to discern. This could be associated with differences in crystallinity between products derived from SnS2 and CoS2. For investigating the mechanism of activated CSC, original CSC anodes were activated for at least 3 cycles to obtain phase-transformed materials. Corresponding to the discharge–charge-time curves in Fig.\xa04a, the activated CSC anodes at various states-of-charge show repeatable XRD patterns, implying good reversibility during the discharge/charge processes (Fig.\xa04b). The peak intensity of XRD pattern of anode (such as C-0.97\xa0V, blue) is lower than that of initially charged anode (such as C-0.97\xa0V, pink), which could be associated with the decreased diameter and gradually aggravated amorphization of metal sulfide phases. Similar phenomena have been reported in other metal chalcogenide anodes such as CoSe2 and CoS2 [13, 60]. At different (dis)charge states, the corresponding XRD of anodes shows different patterns, which should be correlated to the successive formation of different products.\nAs shown in Fig.\xa04c, HR-TEM image of CSC discharged to 0.4\xa0V displays interplanar spacings of 0.569 and 0.316\xa0nm, corresponding to lattice plane (0 0 4) of Na29.58Sn8 and (1 0 1) of Co. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns reveal the lattice plane (2 1 1) of Co, (5 1 3) and (1 3 1) of Na29.58Sn8 in the discharged product (Fig.\xa04d). When charged back to 2.9\xa0V, the crystalline domains in the resulting product are remarkably smaller than those in the discharged state. As shown in Fig.\xa04e, HR-TEM image of CSC charged to 2.9\xa0V displays interplanar spacings of 0.184 and 0.295\xa0nm, which are assigned to lattice plane of (2 2 1)’ of NaxCoS2 and (0 0 2)’ of NaxSnS2 (with CoS2 and SnS2 standard phases as reference), respectively. The SAED pattern exhibits typical polycrystalline features, in which lattice plane (2 2 0) of NaxCoS2, (1 0 3) and (1 0 0) of NaxSnS2 can be identified (Fig.\xa04f). Based on the characterization above, the progress of electrochemical reduction, followed by oxidation, for the CSC electrode is illustrated in Fig.\xa04g. Typically, SnS2 and CoS2 phases in CSC experience an initial phase transition to Na+-intercalated intermediates (NaxMS2, M\u2009=\u2009Sn, Co), which act as active materials for subsequent discharge/charge cycles. Based on the analysis above, the exotic property mediation beyond rule-of-mixtures [35, 36] (cocktail mediation effect) among nano-dispersed SnS2 and CoS2 phases in CSC is schematically illustrated in Fig.\xa04h–i. Specifically, along the different ionic diffusion directions, the nano-dispersed SnS2 and CoS2 phases in CSC will alternatively react with Na+ carriers, as schematically illustrated in Fig.\xa04i. The nano-dispersion of SnS2 and CoS2 phases effectively shortens the ion diffusion path, which can kinetically boost electrochemical processes of both metal sulfide anodes. Due to intrinsic thermodynamics difference, the electrochemical competition is present between SnS2 and CoS2 phases. Also, it does not exclude one of the two phases could show local kinetic merit owing to the diameter difference between them. Thus, in the CSC anode, the alternative electrochemical reaction processes could coexist between the two phases. It enables complementary charge voltage plateau of different metal sulfide phases, resulting in lowered charge plateau of CSC anode.\n\n2.5 Full-Cell Properties\nTo verify the practicability of the CSC anode, a high-voltage cathode material Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 was employed to assemble CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cells. Synthesis of Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 followed a modified literature method (Supporting Information), and yielded a micro-particle morphology with a well-matched XRD pattern with the standard phase (Fig. S20) [33]. Corresponding to CV curves, Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 cathode shows ca. 3.9\xa0V discharge plateau with low electrochemical polarization, which is suitable for demonstrating the practicability of different anodes (Fig. S21a, b). The Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 cathode delivers a good rate capability from 0.05 to 0.5 A g−1, showing a high reversible capacity of 124.1 mAh g−1electrode at 0.05 A/g (Fig. S21c, d). Over 350 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, the Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 cathode shows a capacity of 106.4 mAh g−1electrode, corresponding to a low capacity decay of 0.02% per cycle (Fig. S22). Figure\xa05a shows the typical CV curves of CoS2//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7, SnS2//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7, and CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cells at 0.5\xa0mV\xa0s−1. Evidently, the main redox peaks of CoS2//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 appear at 1.0–2.5\xa0V, implying that its average discharge voltage is in the range. In contrast, the ranges of main redox peaks of SnS2//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 and CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cells are in 2.0–4.0\xa0V, which imply a higher average discharge voltage than that of the former. Figure\xa05b shows that the discharge capacity available from the CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 cell, while the voltage is above 2\xa0V, is ca. 61.7 mAh g−1electrode, which is 1.62 times that of CoS2//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7. As displayed in Fig.\xa05c, CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cells present an average discharge voltage of 2.57\xa0V, which is close to that of SnS2//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 and ca. 0.62\xa0V higher than that with CoS2 anode. The CSC anode confers a significantly higher average voltage during discharge of full-cells when compared with CoS2 cells. Compared with other full-cells reported previously, CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cells also show obvious merits in terms of discharge voltage and capacity (Fig.\xa05d). Moreover, CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cells show a high-rate capability from 0.05 to 1 A g−1, delivering a high capacity of 120.3 mAh g−1electrode at 0.05 A g−1 (Fig.\xa05e). The corresponding discharge/charge curves are shown in Fig. S23, where the voltage plateaus are well-retained. As exhibited in Fig.\xa05f, compared with other full-cells with different electrode materials, CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cell delivers comparable merits in terms of energy/power density. [62,63,64,65,66,67] Specifically,\u2009~106.1 Wh kg−1electrode/1278.3\xa0W\xa0kg−1electrode are achieved at 1 A g−1. When operated over 120 cycles at 0.25 A g−1, CSC//Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 full-cell shows a high capacity of 63.0 mAh g−1electrode with a low decay of 0.20% per cycle (Fig.\xa05g). Such results suggest a good practicability of CSC in full-cells.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Driven by hybrid entropy and good wettability of the substrate, carbon cloth is uniformly covered by the molten Na/In metal, rendering a flat electrode surface similar to pure Na metal surface as presented in Fig.\xa01b-d. As shown in Fig. S2, XRD peaks confirm the existence of cubic NaIn and orthorhombic Na2In apart from the typical diffraction peaks of cubic Na metal. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.\xa01e, elemental mapping images confirm the uniform distributions of Na and In within the whole composite electrode.\n\n3.2 Electrochemical Testing of the Na Ion Deposition\nNa ion plating/stripping properties of the Na/In/C and the pure Na metal were subsequently evaluated with symmetrical coin cells. 1.0\xa0M NaClO4 in EC:PC (1:1 by volume) with 5 wt% FEC was employed as an electrolyte. As shown in Fig.\xa02a, c, cells cycled galvanostatically at 1 and 2\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (1 mAh cm−2) demonstrated stable deposition overvoltage of 51/100\xa0mV and smooth voltage profiles over 870/710\xa0h, respectively. Intriguingly, even under a harsh condition of 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (Fig.\xa02e), the cell still has a long-term cycling life over 560\xa0h. Of note, upon extensive cycling process at 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2, a thick SEI with relative low quality (compared with 1 and 2\xa0mA\xa0cm−2) and gradually increasing thickness will cover the whole anode surface [50], hence resulting in the formation of protrusions and islands (Fig. S3b, c) as well as slow Na ion transport kinetics within the SEI (Fig. S3a). As a result, larger overpotential would be needed to maintain a constant applied deposition current based on the Butler–Volmer equation, thereby leading to a progressively increasing overvoltage as presented in Fig.\xa02e [51]. It is also remarkable that cells with the Na/In/C electrode can also deliver a long life span over 300\xa0h at 1 and 2\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 with a higher capacity of 3 mAh cm−2 as shown in Fig. S4a, b. Moreover, even at a harsh testing condition of 5 mAh cm−2, the Na/In/C electrode can still retain an impressive cycling stability over 600/300\xa0h at 1 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (Figs. 2g and S4c). Notably, the Na/In/C electrode demonstrates better stabilities among recently reported Na metal batteries cycled in the common EC/PC electrolyte (Fig. S5). By comparison, as illustrated in Fig.\xa02b, d, f, it can be seen that cells assembled with pure Na metal electrodes experience much larger voltage hysteresis of 82, 156 and 340\xa0mV at 1, 2 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (1 mAh cm−2). Even worse, these cells all display an abrupt voltage drop (Fig.\xa02b, d, f,) in a few cycling hours, indicative of the soft short circuit originated from penetration by notorious sodium dendrites. Moreover, rate capability of the symmetrical Na/In/C and Na cells are depicted in Fig.\xa03a. Apparently, as the current density changing from 1 to 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2, the cell utilizing Na/In/C composite electrodes show low voltage fluctuation and highly stable Na ion deposition. In parallel, long-term cycling stabilities of cells employing Na/In/C anodes with different Na:In weight ratios (8:1 and 12:1) were also evaluated. As shown in Fig. S6a, d, both Na/In/C samples (8:1 and 12:1) demonstrate the distinct presence of natrophilic NaIn and Na2In phases. As to the Na/In/C anode with a ratio of 12:1, it is obvious that cells show large voltage fluctuations and unstable charge/charge profiles at 1 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (1 mAh cm−2) (Fig. S6b, c). This could be mainly ascribed to the reduced natrophilic NaIn and Na2In phases compared with Na/In/C anode with a ratio of 10:1. Albeit cells utilizing Na/In/C anode (8:1) can deliver similar cycling stability at 1 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (1 mAh cm−2) (Fig. S6e, f) as those employing Na/In/C anode (10:1), fabricating Na/In/C anode with a ratio of 10:1 is much more preferable on account of higher prices of In.\nAs expected, cell with pure Na metal exhibits a poor tolerance to the rate testing condition and a sudden voltage drop associated with short circuit occurs (Fig.\xa03a), meaning that Na metal undergoes a much more severe corrosion in the EC/PC electrolyte. Under the 2 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 testing (1 mAh cm−2) conditions, it can be witnessed that cells with the Na/In/C composite electrodes demonstrate a much smaller nucleation overpotential entailed for Na ion plating comparing with the cells with pure Na metal electrodes (Fig. S7a-d). Interestingly, it is found that the pure Na metal and the Na/In/C anode possess similar growth overpotentials (Na:\u2009~\u200925\xa0mV, Na/In/C:\u2009~\u200920\xa0mV) at 1\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 in the initial tens of cycles (Fig.\xa03b, c), which may originate from their similar SEI thicknesses and Na ion diffusion kinetics within SEI under a low Na ion deposition current [50]. However, upon long-term cycling process, reactive Na metal demonstrates unstable Na ion deposition process and even short cut, which can be largely attributed to the poor SEI quality and dendrites formation as shown schematically in Fig. S8. This suggests that the Na–In alloy can significantly decrease Na ion nucleation barrier and promote Na ion nucleation and propagation kinetics [10].\nElectrochemical impedance of the symmetric cells with Na/In/C and Na metal electrodes was further measured with EIS. Figure\xa03d, e shows Nyquist plots of the Na/In/C||Na/In/C cells and Na||Na cells after 1, 60 and 120 cycles at 1\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (1 mAh cm−2). From 60 to 120 cycles, EIS profiles for Na/In/C||Na/In/C cells show little changes, while those of the Na||Na cells change significantly. RSEI and Rct, representing SEI quality and charge transfer dynamics, were obtained by fitting the corresponding EIS profiles as manifested by Fig. S9a, b. Clearly, cell with the Na/In/C composite electrode presents low RSEI of 21.75 Ω and Rct of 71.44 Ω (Fig. S9a) after initial cycling. After 60 and 120 cycles, these RSEI and Rct values undergoes only mild increases upon cycling. In contrast, although the cell with Na metal electrode demonstrates a similar RSEI (23.86 Ω) and Rct of 72.89 Ω (Fig. S9a) after first cycle, conspicuous increases in RSEI and Rct values are shown in Fig. S9b after 60 and 120 cycles, indicating that the Na/In/C electrodes possess much improved charge transfer dynamics and better chemical stability in the common EC/PC electrolyte.\n\n3.3 Morphology Variation and Surface Analyses\nMorphological evolutions of the Na metal and the Na/In/C composite electrode after various cycles (1\xa0mA\xa0cm−2, 1 mAh cm−2) were investigated using SEM and in situ optical microscopy. As shown in Fig.\xa04a-c, dendritic and porous Na deposition emerges after 50 and 100 cycles, which can be further revealed by in situ optical microscopy visualizing the deposited Na surface (Fig.\xa04g). On the contrary, the Na/In/C electrode preserves a dendrite-free and unscathed morphology after 100 and 500 cycles (Fig.\xa04d-f). Upon cycling at higher current densities of 2 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (Fig. S10a-f), the Na/In/C composite electrode maintains similar morphologies as that cycled at 1\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (Fig.\xa04d-f), while pure Na metal anode suffers from alike dendritic and porous Na deposition after 100 and 500 cycles (Fig. S11a-f). Besides, in situ optical microscopy (Figs. 4h and S10g, h) shows that the Na/In/C surface is smooth without forming any detectable sodium protuberance and dendrite, again confirming remarkable interfacial stability of the Na/In/C electrode in the EC/PC electrolyte.\nOther than the post-cycling morphology evolution analysis, interfacial chemistry of the Na and the Na/In/C composite electrodes after 50 cycles at 1\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 (1 mAh cm−2) was studied with XPS (Figs. 5 and S12). As shown in the C 1\xa0s spectra of the pure Na metal (Fig.\xa05d), several clear peaks located at 286.7, 288.9 and 290.4\xa0eV can be assigned to -C-O-, ROCO2Na and Na2CO3 [39]. Interestingly, except the existence of the above products, it was worth mentioning that one extra peak at 292.5\xa0eV related to –CF3 can be observed in the C 1\xa0s spectra of the Na/In/C electrode (Fig.\xa05a). Apart from this difference, C 1\xa0s signals associated with the decomposed carbonate electrolyte are stronger for the pure Na electrode. Additionally, compared with pure Na metal (Fig.\xa05e, f), the Na/In/C electrode demonstrates an intensive signal of the F 1\xa0s (Fig.\xa05c) and Cl 2p spectra (Fig.\xa05b), suggesting apparent enrichments of NaF and NaCl products in the SEI component [51]. The absence of F signal of the pure Na metal anode after 50 cycles can be largely attributed to the continuous breaking of SEI on the Na dendrite structures (Figs. 4a-c and S11a-f, S13), leading to the unnecessary consumption of electrolyte and thus causing ultralow contents of preferable NaF and –CF3 [51]. Furthermore, it is apparent that peaks located at 441.3/441.6 and 449.2/449.8\xa0eV (Fig. S14) can be ascribed to the presence of natrophilic NaIn and Na2In phases on the Na/In/C composite electrode interface [52], which are conducive to promoting Na ion deposition stability as verified by both experimental analyses and DFT simulations. It is thus reasonable to consider that the Na/In/C electrode possesses a much more robust SEI structure and interface stability in the EC/PC electrolyte. According to the above analyses, it is reasonably accepted that Na ions preferentially deposit at the protuberances upon cycling (Fig.\xa05g), which ultimately result in the formation of cracks and dendrites. By contrast, the presence of In can improve Na ion nucleation kinetics and guide uniform Na ion deposition (Fig.\xa05g), thus effectively suppress Na dendrites growth and restrain the volume bulge of Na metal during long-term cycling.\n\n3.4 Sodium Ion Deposition Reversibility Analysis\nTo obtain a better understanding of the superior sodium ion deposition reversibility on the Na/In/C electrode surface, DFT, AIMD and FE simulations were carried out to delineate the Na ion binding sites/energy, plating kinetics and deposition morphology evolution process. Initial adsorption structure models of Na–Na2In and Na–NaIn are provided in Fig. S15. As summarized in Fig.\xa06a-c, optimized binding energies between a Na ad-atom (blue color) and NaIn surfaces are -1.34 (100), -1.48 (110) and -1.82\xa0eV (111), whereas these values on pure Na surfaces are -1.089 (100), -1.067 (110) and -0.761\xa0eV (111), respectively (Fig. S16). These show that NaIn owns an intrinsic natrophilic merit and this can largely reduce Na nucleation energy and homogenize the Na+ deposition flux. Meanwhile, the (311) crystal plane of Na2In also shows preferable natrophilic feature as shown by its high binding energy of -1.93\xa0eV (Fig. S17). A lattice matching (100) interface between Na and NaIn is built to further ascertain Na ion deposition stability via AIMD simulation (Fig.\xa06d). As evidenced, a smooth and compact interface is sustained during the whole AIMD simulation process, thus significantly facilitating Na ion plating/stripping kinetics and removing morphological instability. In sharp contrast, porous structures are formed on the pure Na metal surface as shown in Fig. S18, which agrees well with the experimental results. Finite element simulations were further used to study evolution processes of the electrode surface at various overpotentials and time (0, 30 and 60\xa0s). Initially, Na metal surface with square-shaped bumps was intentionally fabricated to examine Na ion deposition behavior under different overpotential (Fig.\xa06e). Noticeably, larger overpotential (300\xa0meV) induces conspicuous preferential deposition, leading to severe directional growth, morphology irregularity and eventually a porous structure. However, at a lower overpotential (100\xa0meV), unwanted porous and dendritic growth of Na metal is effectively suppressed. In addition to the effect of overpotential on Na ion deposition kinetics, initial bump shapes also play a decisive role on the Na ion plating behavior. For instance, grave dendritic growth and preferential Na ion plating occurred for the triangle-shaped bumps even at a low overpotential (100\xa0meV), which can be ascribed to the concentrated equipotential lines at the sharp corners (Fig. S19). Adversely, the presence of regular circle-shaped bumps on the Na metal surface brought about smooth surface evolution at high 300\xa0meV overpotential (Fig. S20). Additionally, higher exchange current density (i0) (based on the Tafel profiles analyses shown in Fig. S21a, b, i0 values of the pure Na metal and the Na/In/C anode are 0.158 and 0.332\xa0mA\xa0cm−2, respectively) promotes smooth Na ion deposition even at larger overpotential as shown in Fig. S22 for Na/In. All these theoretical analyses evidently reveal the reversible Na ion deposition mechanism on the Na/In/C electrode (lower overpotential and larger exchange current density values) surface, matching well with prior electrochemical and chemical results.\n\n3.5 Feasibility of the Na/In/C Composite Electrode in Sodium Metal Full Cell\nTo further elaborate the suitability of the Na/In/C composite electrode in EC/PC electrolyte (1\xa0M NaClO4 in EC/PC), Na/In/C composite and Na foil were, respectively, paired with a high-voltage Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NaVPOF) cathode to construct full coin cells. According to the area mass loading of the Na, Na/In/C and NaVPOF (experimental section) and the theoretical capacity of Na (1166 mAh g−1)/NaVPOF (130.7 mAh g−1, 2\u2009~\u20094.5\xa0V), ratios of the negative capacity to the positive capacity (N/P ratio) for the Na||NaVPOF and Na/In/C||NaVPOF full batteries are 6.2 and 4.1, respectively. XRD and SEM images of the NaVPOF cathode synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method are shown in Fig. S23a, b. Figure\xa07a presents specific illustration of sodium metal full batteries paired a high-voltage NaVPOF cathode with the Na/In/C composite anode. As exhibited in Fig.\xa07b, c, the cell demonstrates a smooth voltage profile at 0.05 C and sharp redox peaks with a scan rate of 0.5\xa0mV\xa0s−1 ranging from 2.5 to 4.3\xa0V (vs Na/Na+). Moreover, the NaVPOF-Na/In/C cell yields highly reversible charge capacities of 124, 115, 101, 80 and 61 mAh g−1 at rates of 0.05, 0.1, 1, 2 and 5 C, respectively (Fig.\xa07d). More promisingly, the cell is observed to be able to deliver a specific capacity of 88.4 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 87.6% at 1 C rate, which contributes to a low capacity attenuation of 0.019% per cycle (Fig.\xa07e). Unsurprisingly, the NaVPOF-Na cell shows unsteady charge/discharge curve (Fig. S24a), large voltage polarization (Fig. S24b) and inferior cycling capability at 1 C (Fig. S24c). These results reinforce the much better performance of the Na/In/C composite electrode in sodium metal full batteries in the common EC/PC electrolyte.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Then, these disks were totally immersed into ethanol with an ultrasonication treatment for 3\xa0h. Next, the plates were dried at 80\xa0°C under vacuum for 24\xa0h. Subsequently, metal Na foil, metallic In powder and carbon cloth disks (weight ratio of Na:In:C\u2009=\u200910:1:4) were put into a nickel crucible maintaining at\u2009~\u2009400\xa0°C for 10\xa0min. Finally, liquefied Na and In can thoroughly infuse into the entire carbon cloth plate, creating the Na/In/C composite. Average weight of one Na/In/C composite disk (0.785\xa0cm−2) is 9.3\xa0mg, and the mass loading of Na within the Na/In/C composite is 7.9\xa0mg\xa0cm−2.\n\n2.2 \nSynthesis of Na\n\n3\n\nV\n\n2\n\nO\n\n2\n\n(PO\n\n4\n\n)\n\n2\n\nF (NaVPOF)\n\nBriefly, 0.1\xa0g hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were firstly added into 36\xa0mL DMF and sonicated for 20\xa0min. Secondly, a solution comprising of 0.0015\xa0mol NaF, 0.001\xa0mol NH4VO3 and 8\xa0mL deionized water was gradually drop-wisely into DMF. Then, 8\xa0mL (NH4)2HPO4 (0.001\xa0mol) aqueous solution was mixed with the above solution to guarantee the required stoichiometric ratio (Na:V:P:F\u2009=\u20093:2:2:3). Finally, this solution was sealed into the 60-mL Teflon autoclaves and retained at 180 ℃ for 10\xa0h.\n\n2.3 Materials Characterization\nX-ray diffractometer (XRD) patterns of Na, Na/In/C and NaVPOF were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer utilizing Cu-K radiation. A QUATTRO S scanning electron microscope was employed to obtain the morphology and microstructure of the cycled Na and Na/In/C electrodes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB 220i-XL) was carried out to investigate surface chemical properties of the cycled Na and Na/In/C electrodes. Real-time Na ion dynamics deposition and surface morphology evolution process on the Na and Na/In/C electrode were studied by in situ optical microscopy.\n\n2.4 Electrochemical Measurements\nTo assess the Na ion stripping/plating stability, symmetrical Na||Na and Na/In/C||Na/In/C cells were assembled in a glove box. Electrochemical deposition curves and long-term cycling life span of these cells were tested with a MACCOR battery cycler at 1, 2 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 with a capacity of 1 and 3 mAh cm−2. As to the full-cell testing, NaVPOF, carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 were leveraged as active material, conductive additive and binder, respectively. 1.0\xa0M NaClO4 in EC/PC (1:1 volume ratio) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was adopted as electrolyte. Mass loading of the NaVPOF cathode/pure Na foil anode is 14.2/7.9\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were taken with a Zahner electrochemical workstation (voltage range of 2.5–4.3\xa0V, 0.5\xa0mV\xa0s−1 scan rate) to study the Na ion deposition kinetics and redox reversibility. Rate performance and long-term cycling stability tests were done from 0.05 C to 5 C rates. Interfacial electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) features were determined over a frequency range from 1\xa0MHz to 100\xa0mHz through an impedance analyzer (Zennium pro).\n\n2.5 Computational Details\nDFT simulations were firstly conducted to determine Na atom adsorption sites, binding energies and charge differential density upon (100), (110) and (111) crystal planes of Na metal and NaIn as well as (311) crystal plane of Na2In. All the DFT calculations were coped with projector augmented plane wave method [45]. The exchange–correlation interaction among itinerant electrons is handled by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [46]. van der Waals interactions between Na atom and Na metal or NaIn/Na2In surface were treated with semiempirical London dispersion corrections of Grimme et al. [47]. Cutoff energy of the plane wave basis was set at 600\xa0eV to ensure strict force and energy convergence criterion, and the k-point mesh (Monkhorst–Pack) was 7\u2009×\u20097\u2009×\u20091. AIMD simulations were then performed to clarify dynamic Na atoms movement process on the (011) crystal surface of Na metal and NaIn. A lattice matching interface consisting of six layers of NaIn and three layers of Na metal were fabricated. All the AIMD simulations were done with Gaussians and plane wave (GPW) method implemented in the CP2K software package with a single Γ point and the energy cutoff was set at 300 Ry [48]. DFT-D3 and PBE were employed to deal with long-range weak van der Waals and electron exchange–correlation interactions. All the configurations were allowed to relax for 1.2\xa0ps (time step is 0.5\xa0fs) at 300\xa0K in the canonical ensemble (NVT) dictated by Nose–Hoover thermostat. Morphology evolution of Na metal surface with distinct overpotential and bump shape was further investigated using finite element simulation (COMSOL Multiphysics) utilizing tertiary current distribution and deformed geometry modules. The Na ion deposition kinetics at the Na or Na/In surface were subjected to the concentration-dependent Butler–Volmer equation:\n where i0 stands for the exchange current density; cR and cO are the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced species (initial concentration of Na ion in the electrolyte is 1\xa0M), respectively; upon deposition process, cR maintains constant (1\xa0M), while the value of cO is given according to Nernst–Planck equation as described before [49]; value of the αa and αc is 0.5, respectively; and η, R and T are the overpotential, gas constant and temperature, respectively. Therefore, Na metal surface deposition behavior can be obtained based on Faraday’s law of electrolysis:\n ρ and M are the density and molar mass of Na metal, respectively.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Subsequently, metal Na foil, metallic In powder and carbon cloth disks (weight ratio of Na:In:C\u2009=\u200910:1:4) were put into a nickel crucible maintaining at\u2009~\u2009400\xa0°C for 10\xa0min. Finally, liquefied Na and In can thoroughly infuse into the entire carbon cloth plate, creating the Na/In/C composite. Average weight of one Na/In/C composite disk (0.785\xa0cm−2) is 9.3\xa0mg, and the mass loading of Na within the Na/In/C composite is 7.9\xa0mg\xa0cm−2.\n\n2.2 \nSynthesis of Na\n\n3\n\nV\n\n2\n\nO\n\n2\n\n(PO\n\n4\n\n)\n\n2\n\nF (NaVPOF)\n\nBriefly, 0.1\xa0g hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were firstly added into 36\xa0mL DMF and sonicated for 20\xa0min. Secondly, a solution comprising of 0.0015\xa0mol NaF, 0.001\xa0mol NH4VO3 and 8\xa0mL deionized water was gradually drop-wisely into DMF. Then, 8\xa0mL (NH4)2HPO4 (0.001\xa0mol) aqueous solution was mixed with the above solution to guarantee the required stoichiometric ratio (Na:V:P:F\u2009=\u20093:2:2:3). Finally, this solution was sealed into the 60-mL Teflon autoclaves and retained at 180 ℃ for 10\xa0h.\n\n2.3 Materials Characterization\nX-ray diffractometer (XRD) patterns of Na, Na/In/C and NaVPOF were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer utilizing Cu-K radiation. A QUATTRO S scanning electron microscope was employed to obtain the morphology and microstructure of the cycled Na and Na/In/C electrodes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB 220i-XL) was carried out to investigate surface chemical properties of the cycled Na and Na/In/C electrodes. Real-time Na ion dynamics deposition and surface morphology evolution process on the Na and Na/In/C electrode were studied by in situ optical microscopy.\n\n2.4 Electrochemical Measurements\nTo assess the Na ion stripping/plating stability, symmetrical Na||Na and Na/In/C||Na/In/C cells were assembled in a glove box. Electrochemical deposition curves and long-term cycling life span of these cells were tested with a MACCOR battery cycler at 1, 2 and 5\xa0mA\xa0cm−2 with a capacity of 1 and 3 mAh cm−2. As to the full-cell testing, NaVPOF, carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 were leveraged as active material, conductive additive and binder, respectively. 1.0\xa0M NaClO4 in EC/PC (1:1 volume ratio) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was adopted as electrolyte. Mass loading of the NaVPOF cathode/pure Na foil anode is 14.2/7.9\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were taken with a Zahner electrochemical workstation (voltage range of 2.5–4.3\xa0V, 0.5\xa0mV\xa0s−1 scan rate) to study the Na ion deposition kinetics and redox reversibility. Rate performance and long-term cycling stability tests were done from 0.05 C to 5 C rates. Interfacial electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) features were determined over a frequency range from 1\xa0MHz to 100\xa0mHz through an impedance analyzer (Zennium pro).\n\n2.5 Computational Details\nDFT simulations were firstly conducted to determine Na atom adsorption sites, binding energies and charge differential density upon (100), (110) and (111) crystal planes of Na metal and NaIn as well as (311) crystal plane of Na2In. All the DFT calculations were coped with projector augmented plane wave method [45]. The exchange–correlation interaction among itinerant electrons is handled by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [46]. van der Waals interactions between Na atom and Na metal or NaIn/Na2In surface were treated with semiempirical London dispersion corrections of Grimme et al. [47]. Cutoff energy of the plane wave basis was set at 600\xa0eV to ensure strict force and energy convergence criterion, and the k-point mesh (Monkhorst–Pack) was 7\u2009×\u20097\u2009×\u20091. AIMD simulations were then performed to clarify dynamic Na atoms movement process on the (011) crystal surface of Na metal and NaIn. A lattice matching interface consisting of six layers of NaIn and three layers of Na metal were fabricated. All the AIMD simulations were done with Gaussians and plane wave (GPW) method implemented in the CP2K software package with a single Γ point and the energy cutoff was set at 300 Ry [48]. DFT-D3 and PBE were employed to deal with long-range weak van der Waals and electron exchange–correlation interactions. All the configurations were allowed to relax for 1.2\xa0ps (time step is 0.5\xa0fs) at 300\xa0K in the canonical ensemble (NVT) dictated by Nose–Hoover thermostat. Morphology evolution of Na metal surface with distinct overpotential and bump shape was further investigated using finite element simulation (COMSOL Multiphysics) utilizing tertiary current distribution and deformed geometry modules. The Na ion deposition kinetics at the Na or Na/In surface were subjected to the concentration-dependent Butler–Volmer equation:\n where i0 stands for the exchange current density; cR and cO are the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced species (initial concentration of Na ion in the electrolyte is 1\xa0M), respectively; upon deposition process, cR maintains constant (1\xa0M), while the value of cO is given according to Nernst–Planck equation as described before [49]; value of the αa and αc is 0.5, respectively; and η, R and T are the overpotential, gas constant and temperature, respectively. Therefore, Na metal surface deposition behavior can be obtained based on Faraday’s law of electrolysis:\n ρ and M are the density and molar mass of Na metal, respectively.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

It has been reported that MOF-based materials present vast opportunities in the quest for optimal electrode materials for rechargeable batteries due to their high porosity, diverse structures and controllable chemical compositions [38,39,40]. Here, firstly, a Bi-MOF as the precursor (Fig. S1) was prepared by a modified two-step solvothermal reaction [41], in which bismuth chloride (BiCl3) as Bi precursor, and the ligand of trimesic acid (H3BTC) served as a structure-directing agent and carbon source [42]. Specifically, the carboxyl group (–COOH) of H3BTC lost its proton (H+) to form the carboxylate ion (–COO−) [43, 44]. Bi3+ acted as the central metal ion and coordinated with the -COO− of the deprotonated H3BTC ligand to form a coordination bond [43, 45]. After HTS (Fig. S2) in Ar atmosphere for only 15\xa0s, the final product of Bi/CNRs-15 was obtained, where Bi nanoparticles were in-situ formed from Bi-MOFs and uniformly embedded in the carbon nanorods. Meanwhile, under the extreme heating generated by HTS, the chlorine can effectively escape from BiOCl (hydrolyzed from BiCl3) through the reaction 2BiOCl\u2009+\u2009C\u2009=\u20092Bi\u2009+\u2009CO2\u2009+\u2009Cl2 [46]. In order to optimize the synthesis condition, Bi/CNRs-5, Bi/CNRs-30 and Bi/CNRs-TFA were also prepared. All synthesis details are offered in the Experimental Section.\nFigures S3 and 1b, c present the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Bi/CNRs-15, respectively. Clearly, Bi nanoparticles with an average particle size of 26.5\xa0nm (Fig. S4) are homogeneously loaded in the carbon nanorods, which profits from the rapid cooling/heating rate. In sharp contrast, the analogs of Bi/CNRs-TFA synthesized through a TFA method display aggregated particles, nonuniform size distribution and low metal loading (Figs. S5 and S6), which are principally caused by prolonged heat treatment and slow cooling/heating rate. The samples with different pulse time (5 and 30\xa0s) are also presented in Fig. S7. It is evident that Bi/CNRs-15 exhibits the best dispersity in these three samples. Figure\xa01d shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Bi/CNRs-15, where highly crystallized nanoparticles can be observed with interlayer distances of 0.326 and 0.234\xa0nm, corresponding to (012) and (104) planes of metallic Bi. The XRD patterns of Bi/CNRs-5, Bi/CNRs-15, Bi/CNRs-30, and Bi/CNRs-TFA are shown in Figs. 1e and S8, respectively. With increasing the thermal shock time, the XRD peaks assigned to BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) disappear until 15\xa0s and the present sharp peaks are indexed to the high-crystallinity rhombohedral Bi phase (JCPDS No. 85-1329). Note that the average crystallite size of the Bi particles calculated from Scherrer equation (Table S1) is larger than that observed from TEM (26.5\xa0nm). The possible reason is that XRD gives volume-weighted measurements, which tends to overestimate the geometric particle size [47,48,49]. Moreover, the well-defined crystallinity of Bi/CNRs-15 can be identified by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. S9. A series of clear spotty diffraction rings portray the polycrystallinity of Bi/CNRs-15, further validating the XRD result [50]. As shown in Fig. S10, the bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM) and corresponding energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) mapping images unambiguously reveal that Bi and C elements are homogeneously distributed in the Bi/CNRs-15 composite without obvious aggregation.\nXPS was measured to investigate the surface characteristics of the Bi/CNRs-15 hybrid, where only C, Bi, and O elements are perceived (Fig. S11). The high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. S12) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.8, 285.7, and 289.2\xa0eV, being ascribed to C–C/C=C, C–O, and C=O bonds, respectively [51]. Two pairs of peaks shown in the Bi 4f high-resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. S13) are assigned to metallic Bi (157.3 and 162.7\xa0eV) and Bi2O3 (159.2 and 164.6\xa0eV), resulting from unavoidable oxidation of highly active Bi in the nanoscale under ambient air [22, 27]. After etching 10\xa0nm, the peak intensity of Bi2O3 (Fig. S13b) is obviously much weaker than that without etching, proving that Bi2O3 mainly exists on the surface of the sample. The high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Fig. S14) can be fitted into three peaks with the binding energy of 530.3, 532.4, and 533.9\xa0eV, corresponding to Bi–O, C–O–Bi, and C–O bonds, respectively. The C–O–Bi bond is a chemical bond formed between C and O atoms, and the O atom also interacts with Bi, which involves the coordination of organic ligands to metal ion centers [44]. As observed in the Raman spectrum (Fig.\xa01f), there are two typical peaks located at 1340 and 1596\xa0cm−1, attributing to D bands (defective structure) and G bands (graphite structure) of carbonous materials, respectively. Moreover, the D band can be further deconvoluted into three peaks at 1345 (D1), 1183 (D2), and 1497 (D3) cm−1, respectively. The D1 band corresponds to the disorders and defects in carbon lattice and the D2 band is ascribed to edge defects, while the D3 band is associated with amorphous sp3 carbon [52,53,54]. The calculated ratios of ID1/IG based on integrated peak intensity is 1.86, disclosing abundant defects and disorders in Bi/CNRs-15. To further corroborate defects in Bi/CNRs-15, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization was also carried out. As presented in Figs. 1g and S15, the strong EPR signal at g\u2009=\u20092.0034 is associated with the rich carbon vacancies in the Bi/CNRs-15 hybrid [53], which is well consistent with the Raman spectrum. Compared to Bi/CNRs-TFA, the continuous gas emission can sacrifice irreversible heteroatom defects while induce more reversible carbon vacancies under extreme heating conditions derived from HTS [54]. These abundant vacancies are able to furnish more active sites for the absorption and diffusion of Na+, which is beneficial for Na storage [55]. The Bi content in Bi/CNRs-15 is determined by the TGA in air, which is calculated to be 86.8% from the equation in Fig. S16. To further study the specific surface area and pore texture type of Bi-MOFs and Bi/CNRs-15, nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique was implemented. As shown in Fig. S17, Bi/CNRs-15 displays a typical mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 48.1 m2\xa0g−1. The high porosity increases the contact areas between the electrolyte and electrode, and decreases the Na+ diffusion distance, facilitating the rate performance of Bi/CNRs-15 [56].\n\n3.2 Low-Temperature Performance\nThe Na storage properties of Bi/CNRs-15 were investigated in 2025 coin-type half cell and full cell at room temperature, which shows remarkable high-rate performance and appealing cycling stability even under high mass loadings (Figs. S18-S27, detailed description in Supporting Information). Based on the well-tailored Bi/CNRs-15 electrode, half cells were also assembled with metallic Na to evaluate the electrochemical performance at low temperature. As shown in Fig.\xa02a, the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode exhibits admirable adaptability for temperature. The capacity of Bi/CNRs-15 testing at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 slightly decreases as the temperature drops to −\u200940\xa0°C, and the capacity can be retrieved and maintain stability when the temperature returns to 0\xa0°C. The discharge/charge curves (Fig. S29) display polarized plateaus below −\u200920\xa0°C due to rapidly increasing internal resistance. The CV curves (Fig. S30) under low-temperature conditions show great repetition between the first and second cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability and Na+ storage reversibility of the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode. From Fig. 2b–d and S31, the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode represents ultrahigh rate capability (261.4\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 5\xa0A\xa0g−1) and superior cycling performance (240.3\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 after 2400 cycles with a capacity retention of 67.3%) at −\u200940\xa0°C, while Bi/CNRs-TFA only exhibits moderate rate property (101.5\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 5\xa0A\xa0g−1). In sharp contrast, the pure Bi electrode is unstable and displays battery invalidity after only several cycles at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 at −\u200940\xa0°C (Fig. S32). As presented in Figs. 2e and S33, even at −\u200960\xa0°C, Bi/CNRs-15 still displays incredible rate property (237.9\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 2\xa0A\xa0g−1), which is much better than other anode materials previously reported in open literatures (Fig.\xa02f and Table S2). Simultaneously, Bi/CNRs-15 also exhibits competitive cycling stability (237.1\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 after 150 cycles) [Fig.\xa02g]. Surprisingly, the phenomenon of exceeding theoretical capacity appears in Fig.\xa02b, which has been reported for different kinds of electrode materials (carbon, metal, metal oxide, metal sulfides, etc.) [57,58,59]. In this work, the extra capacity may come from interfacial charge storage [58]. Additionally, carbonaceous materials can store extra Na in pores and cavities [59].\nTo preliminarily estimate the practical applications of the Bi/CNRs-15 hybrid in extremely cold areas, the full cell was fabricated using Bi/CNRs-15 as an anode, and NVP as a cathode with a negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 1.01 (see Supporting Information for details) for the electrochemical performance test (Fig.\xa03a). The Bi/CNRs-15//NVP full cell exhibits excellent fast charging capability at −\u200940\xa0°C with a high capacity of 382.9\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 0.1\xa0A\xa0g−1 (based on active mass of the anode), in which 58.9% of the capacity can be retained even when the current density increases by 20-folds from 0.1 to 2 A\xa0g−1 (Figs. 3b and S34). Note that the specific capacity of the full cell is lower than that of the half cell owing to the un-optimized cathode and the problem of matching the anode and cathode [60]. As illustrated in Fig. S35, the full cell displays appealing cycling stability (a capacity retention of 97.0% at 0.1\xa0A\xa0g−1 after 100 cycles) after high-rate cycling. As shown in Fig.\xa03c, the full cell presents a stable capacity retention of 63.9% at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 over 1000 cycles. It should be noted that the charged full cell can power the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at −\u200940\xa0°C (Figs. 3d and S36). The practical feasibility is further evaluated by the pouch cell (Fig.\xa03e), which displays 75.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1. It should be noted that the coulombic efficiencies of the Bi/CNR-15//NVP pouch cell are lower than 100%, which is caused by the NVP cathode with relatively low CEs of 98.8% and the un-optimized N/P ratio [61, 62]. Figure\xa03f demonstrates that the assembled full cell delivers a high energy density of 181.9\xa0Wh\xa0kg−1 at a power density of 45.5\xa0W\xa0kg−1, and even 37.9\xa0Wh\xa0kg−1 at a power density of 1119.5\xa0W\xa0kg−1 (based on the total mass of the cathode and anode). Even at −\u200960\xa0°C, the full cell still delivers a capacity of 190.4\xa0mAh\xa0g−1 at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 (Figs. 3g and S37). Totally, the achieved performances illustrate that the as-fabricated Bi/CNRs-15//NVP system possesses outstanding temperature adaptability, fast charging capability, and ultralong lifespan at ultralow temperature, providing evidences of Bi/CNRs-15 as a feasible anode for practical applications in low-temperature SIBs.\n\n3.3 Charge Storage Kinetics\nThe detailed Na+ diffusion kinetics of Bi/CNRs-15 and pure Bi were assessed by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) at both 25 and −\u200940\xa0°C. Clearly, the slope region possesses higher Na+ diffusion coefficient (D) due to fast Na+ adsorption on the surface [63], while the plateau region exhibits lower D because of sluggish alloying/dealloying reactions. As the temperature drops to −\u200940\xa0°C, the D values of Bi/CNRs-15 and pure Bi are in ranges of 1.4\u2009×\u200910–8 to 7.4\u2009×\u200910–13 and 1.4\u2009×\u200910–8 to 3.7\u2009×\u200910–14, respectively (Fig.\xa04a-c). In comparison with pure Bi, the enhanced D values of Bi/CNRs-15 under room temperature (Fig. S41) and low temperature, especially in the plateau region, are well consistent with unprecedented rate capability and also support the positive effect of nanoparticles driven by HTS on the kinetics of Na storage. Moreover, the Bi/CNRs-15 anode presents smaller ΔEτ (instantaneous potential change during the constant current pulse) and ΔEs (steady-state potential change by the current pulse) than the pure Bi anode (Fig. S42), which indicates better Na+ diffusion ability of Bi/CNRs-15 than pure Bi.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to quantitatively identify the charge transfer resistances and deeply comprehend the superior reaction kinetics of Bi/CNRs-15 [64]. One semicircle in high and middle frequencies and a straight line in low frequency can be observed in the Nyquist plots of Bi/CNRs-15 and pure Bi, implying similitude electrochemical processes in these two electrodes. The fitting results of charge transfer resistance (Rct) and electrolyte resistance (Rel) values are quantified with the equivalent circuit. The Rct value decreases gradually with increasing cycles and reaches an extremely low value of 1.2\xa0Ω after 50 cycles (Fig. S43), suggesting that the Bi/CNR-15 electrode has excellent stability and maintains high electrochemical reaction kinetics. As presented in Fig.\xa04d, compared with room temperature, the steep rise of Rel at −\u200940\xa0°C demonstrates low ionic conductivity caused by increased viscosity of the electrolyte [65]. We can also find that Rct of Bi/CNRs-15 is slightly lower than that of pure Bi at 25\xa0°C while much lower at −\u200940\xa0°C, which indicates that Bi/CNRs-15 has a distinct advantage particularly under low-temperature conditions (Fig.\xa04e). The temperature-dependent EIS was further carried out to measure the values of Rct from −\u200940 to 0\xa0°C (Figs. 4f-h and S45). Based on the Arrhenius equation [65, 66],\nwhere T is the temperature, A is a constant and R is the gas constant. The activation energy (Ea) for charge transfer (Fig.\xa04i) of Bi/CNRs-15 is calculated to be 48.2\xa0kJ\xa0mol−1, which is lower than that of pure Bi (50.4\xa0kJ\xa0mol−1). The above results verify that nanomanufacturing and hierarchical porous structure are more conducive to reducing the charge transfer barrier and achieving fast reaction kinetics, which are vital to acquire incredible fast charging capability at extremely low temperature.\n\n3.4 Stable SEI Component\nAs an inert layer formed from chemical and electrochemical reactions of components in the electrolyte, SEI plays a critical role in determining the performance of batteries [67]. Meanwhile, a cold condition can convert the reaction of electrolyte decomposition and results in the formation of metastable SEI with dominant organics, which greatly decelerates the migration of Na+ [68]. In order to further study the relationship between SEI and Na storage behavior, TEM and XPS measurements with different etching depths were carried out for both Bi/CNRs-15 and pure Bi electrodes after 5 cycles at −\u200940\xa0°C. As shown in Fig.\xa05a, d, the SEI layer of Bi/CNRs-15 is thin (the thickness of 8–20\xa0nm) and homogeneous, whereas that of pure Bi is thicker (the thickness of 10–42\xa0nm) and uneven. By deeply analyzing the high-resolution spectra of C 1s, F 1s, and O 1s (Figs. 5b, c, e, f and S46), the C 1s peaks at 284.8\xa0eV (C–C/C–H), 285.7\xa0eV (C–O), 287.1\xa0eV (C=O), and O 1s peaks located at 533.2\xa0eV (C=O) are associated with organic compounds primarily derived from the decomposition of solvents [69, 70]. The peaks at 289.1\xa0eV (Na2CO3) of C 1s spectra, the peaks located at 529.7\xa0eV (Na2O) of O 1s spectra and the peaks at 684.1\xa0eV (Na-F) are assigned to inorganic components produced from Na+-solvent-PF6− reduction products and the decomposition of NaPF6 [71, 72]. The peaks at 290.6\xa0eV (C-F) of C 1s spectra and the peaks located at 689.1\xa0eV (C-F) of F 1s spectra illustrate that fluorinated organic compounds reside in SEI layer [73]. A small amount of robust fluorinated organic compounds are highly efficacious to preclude the continuous side reactions of SEI components [74]. As observed in Fig.\xa05g, h, the concentration of organic species in SEI of pure Bi is commonly higher than that of Bi/CNRs-15, demonstrating more decompositions of solvent existing in the pure Bi electrode. To the extent that the total peak area ratios of Na2CO3, Na2O, and Na-F peaks stand for inorganic species in SEI layer. With increasing etching depths, the proportions of inorganic compounds in SEI on the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode gradually step up and are higher than those in SEI of pure Bi throughout. Specifically, NaF with high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level and decent band gap is a good electron insulator to block electrons [75]. Na2CO3 with relatively high ionic conductivity is conducive to the transport of Na+ [76]. These two inorganic components can synergize with each other to construct a robust SEI of the anode side. Furthermore, as the sputtering depth increases, the soaring rise in proportion of NaF indicates that the inner SEI layer is mainly composed of inorganic species. The continuous and compact inner SEI layer can effectively buffer the volume expansion and improve the cycling lifetime at low temperature [68]. Overall, more inorganic component in SEI layer on the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode greatly interprets the reason for better rate performance and cycling stability of Bi/CNRs-15 than pure Bi.\n\n3.5 High-Rate Activation\nShockingly, we found that the capacity can be restored and even higher at 0.1\xa0A\xa0g−1 after losing almost all capacities at 5\xa0A\xa0g−1 (Fig.\xa02e). To further explore such an unusual phenomenon named “negative fading”, we tested the cycling performance at 0.1\xa0A\xa0g−1 after high-rate activation (Fig.\xa06a). Compared with the performance without high-rate activation, Bi/CNRs-15 after high-rate (1/3/5\xa0A\xa0g−1) cycling shows capacity increment and stable capacity retention to some extent. The Bi/CNRs-15 electrode with a high mass loading (Fig.\xa06b) also represents better rate property after high-rate activation at −\u200940\xa0°C. As shown in Figs. 6c, d, and S47, the electrode activated after high rate of 5\xa0A\xa0g−1 evolved into smaller-sized coral-like porous nanostructures due to the high mechanical stress during repeated volume changes. To further study the specific surface area of the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode after activation, nitrogen adsorption–desorption test was implemented. It is found that the specific surface area of the Bi/CNRs-15 composite is relatively small (6.8 m2\xa0g−1, Fig. S48) before activation. However, after 5 cycles at 5\xa0A\xa0g−1, the specific surface area of Bi/CNRs-15 composite increases significantly to 24.7\xa0m2\xa0g−1 (Fig.\xa06e), which is larger than that after 5 cycles at 0.1\xa0A\xa0g−1 (13.8\xa0m2\xa0g−1, Fig.\xa06f). The expanded specific surface area induced by morphology evolution creates additional active sites for interfacial reaction to improve the kinetic properties, resulting in the capacity increment [77, 78]. Ulteriorly, the instantaneous surface activation under large current can dramatically reduce the side reaction between the anode and the electrolyte [79]. The EIS tests were also conducted to further understand the nature behind the excellent electrochemical performance of high-rate activation. As shown in Fig. S49, the value of Rct after 5 cycles at 5\xa0A\xa0g−1 is only 74.5 Ω, much lower than that after 5 cycles at 0.1\xa0A\xa0g−1 (174.6 Ω). Figure\xa06g-i demonstrates that the SEI layer of the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode after 5 cycles at 5\xa0A\xa0g−1 (the thickness of 7–14\xa0nm) is thinner than that of the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode at 0.1\xa0A\xa0g−1 (the thickness of 8–20\xa0nm). The dense inorganic species dominate in the inner layer, while a small number of organic compounds are distributed near the surface, showing a layered structure. This is beneficial for Na+ transfer and enhances the rate capability of the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode after high-rate activation [80, 81]. Overall, due to thinner and more homogeneous SEI layer after high-rate activation and more active sites induced by morphology evolution for redox reaction, the Bi/CNRs-15 electrode after high-rate activation delivers better sodium storage performance. This unique perspective can be used for obtaining high capacity and superior stability of the Bi-based electrodes at low temperature by creating new electrochemically active sites under large current.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The ultrapure water used in all experiments was with a specific resistance of 18.2\xa0MΩ\xa0cm.\n\n2.2 Preparation of Bi/CNRs-15\nFirst, Bi-MOFs were synthesized via a modified two-step solvothermal method. Typically, BiCl3 (0.5\xa0mmol) and KI (0.5\xa0mmol) were dispersed in acetic acid (50\xa0mL) and deionized (DI) water (12.5\xa0mL), respectively. After fully stirred, these two solutions were mixed to form the tender green suspension and the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 6. After 30\xa0min of stirring, the above dispersion was transferred into a Polytetrafluoroethylene lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 160\xa0°C for 2\xa0h. Then BiOI nanosheets (BiOI NSs) were obtained after centrifugation and freeze drying. Subsequently, BiOI NSs (0.5\xa0g) and H3BTC (0.9\xa0g) were dissolved in the mixture of dimethylformamide (22.5\xa0mL) and methanol (7.5\xa0mL) and magnetically stirred for 30\xa0min. Thereafter, the obtained solution was shifted to a 50\xa0mL Teflon-lined autoclave and held at 120\xa0°C for 3\xa0h. The powders of Bi-MOFs were assembled by filtration, washing and drying. Finally, the carbon cloth loaded with Bi-MOFs was clipped into copper electrodes of DC power to acquire Bi/CNRs-15, which was passed a current of 10 A in the argon-filled glovebox for 15\xa0s. Besides, contrast samples shocked for 5 and 30\xa0s were also synthesized, which are denoted as Bi/CNRs-5 and Bi/CNRs-30, respectively. As a comparison, Bi/CNRs-TFA was synthesized by a conventional TFA treatment. The same Bi-MOF precursors were placed in a tube furnace annealed at 600\xa0°C for 2\xa0h in an Ar/H2 (with 5 vol% H2) atmosphere.\n\n2.3 Materials Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on an instrument with Cu Kα (Rigaku D/Max-2550). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL) were fulfilled to obtain the structure and morphology of all samples. Raman spectra were carried out by a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected at an ESCALAB 250Xi system. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in the air using an SDT Q600 instrument. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer) was used to test the specific surface area and pore sizes. The carbon vacancies were measured by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique on a Bruker EMX plusmachine. In-situ XRD was performed on a Rigaku Smart lab. Low-temperature electrochemical tests were conducted in the high and low temperature test chamber (BPH-060).\n\n2.4 Electrochemical Measurements\nAll CR2025-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box by employing Na metal as the counter electrode, Whatman glass fiber (GF/C) as the separator, and 1\xa0M NaPF6 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) as the electrolyte. The active materials (Bi/CNRs-15, Bi/CNRs-5, Bi/CNRs-30, Bi/CNRs-TFA, pure Bi) were mixed with Super P and sodium carboxymethylcellulose with a weight ratio of 7:2:1. The mixed slurry was uniformly pasted on Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 70\xa0°C. Additionally, the mass loadings of active materials were ranging from 0.6 to 4.2\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. In this work, all capacities are evaluated by the whole weight of the Bi/CNRs-15 composite. The electrodes were tested 3 cycles at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 at room temperature before transferring to the high and low temperature test chamber. The cathode consists of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride in a mass ratio of 7:2:1. The full cell was assembled using NVP and Bi/CNRs-15 as the cathode and anode, respectively, with the same electrolyte and separator. Meanwhile, the voltage range was selected at 1.5–3.3\xa0V for the full cell, and the anode was electrochemically activated for 3 cycles before it was used in the full cell. The galvanostatic charge/discharge and GITT tests were implemented using a LAND-CT2001A battery testing system in 0.01–1.5\xa0V (vs. Na+/Na) at room temperature/low temperature. The pulse current, duration and relaxation time of the GITT tests are 50\xa0mA\xa0g−1, 600\xa0s, and 3600\xa0s, respectively.

If the synthesis of 'Bi/CNRs-TFA' is not mentioned, you should return an empty JSON."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n2 Experimental Section\n\n2.1 Materials\nAll chemicals of bismuth chloride (BiCl3, 99%, Macklin Reagent Co., Ltd.), potassium iodide (KI, 99%, Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.), acetic acid (CH3COOH, 99.5%, Macklin Reagent Co., Ltd.), trimesic acid (H3BTC, 99.9%, Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.), methanol (CH3OH, 99%, Beijing Chemical Works) and dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%, Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.) were used without further purification. The ultrapure water used in all experiments was with a specific resistance of 18.2\xa0MΩ\xa0cm.\n\n2.2 Preparation of Bi/CNRs-15\nFirst, Bi-MOFs were synthesized via a modified two-step solvothermal method. Typically, BiCl3 (0.5\xa0mmol) and KI (0.5\xa0mmol) were dispersed in acetic acid (50\xa0mL) and deionized (DI) water (12.5\xa0mL), respectively. After fully stirred, these two solutions were mixed to form the tender green suspension and the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 6. After 30\xa0min of stirring, the above dispersion was transferred into a Polytetrafluoroethylene lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 160\xa0°C for 2\xa0h. Then BiOI nanosheets (BiOI NSs) were obtained after centrifugation and freeze drying. Subsequently, BiOI NSs (0.5\xa0g) and H3BTC (0.9\xa0g) were dissolved in the mixture of dimethylformamide (22.5\xa0mL) and methanol (7.5\xa0mL) and magnetically stirred for 30\xa0min. Thereafter, the obtained solution was shifted to a 50\xa0mL Teflon-lined autoclave and held at 120\xa0°C for 3\xa0h. The powders of Bi-MOFs were assembled by filtration, washing and drying. Finally, the carbon cloth loaded with Bi-MOFs was clipped into copper electrodes of DC power to acquire Bi/CNRs-15, which was passed a current of 10 A in the argon-filled glovebox for 15\xa0s. Besides, contrast samples shocked for 5 and 30\xa0s were also synthesized, which are denoted as Bi/CNRs-5 and Bi/CNRs-30, respectively. As a comparison, Bi/CNRs-TFA was synthesized by a conventional TFA treatment. The same Bi-MOF precursors were placed in a tube furnace annealed at 600\xa0°C for 2\xa0h in an Ar/H2 (with 5 vol% H2) atmosphere.\n\n2.3 Materials Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on an instrument with Cu Kα (Rigaku D/Max-2550). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL) were fulfilled to obtain the structure and morphology of all samples. Raman spectra were carried out by a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected at an ESCALAB 250Xi system. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in the air using an SDT Q600 instrument. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer) was used to test the specific surface area and pore sizes. The carbon vacancies were measured by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique on a Bruker EMX plusmachine. In-situ XRD was performed on a Rigaku Smart lab. Low-temperature electrochemical tests were conducted in the high and low temperature test chamber (BPH-060).\n\n2.4 Electrochemical Measurements\nAll CR2025-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box by employing Na metal as the counter electrode, Whatman glass fiber (GF/C) as the separator, and 1\xa0M NaPF6 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) as the electrolyte. The active materials (Bi/CNRs-15, Bi/CNRs-5, Bi/CNRs-30, Bi/CNRs-TFA, pure Bi) were mixed with Super P and sodium carboxymethylcellulose with a weight ratio of 7:2:1. The mixed slurry was uniformly pasted on Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 70\xa0°C. Additionally, the mass loadings of active materials were ranging from 0.6 to 4.2\xa0mg\xa0cm−2. In this work, all capacities are evaluated by the whole weight of the Bi/CNRs-15 composite. The electrodes were tested 3 cycles at 1\xa0A\xa0g−1 at room temperature before transferring to the high and low temperature test chamber. The cathode consists of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride in a mass ratio of 7:2:1. The full cell was assembled using NVP and Bi/CNRs-15 as the cathode and anode, respectively, with the same electrolyte and separator. Meanwhile, the voltage range was selected at 1.5–3.3\xa0V for the full cell, and the anode was electrochemically activated for 3 cycles before it was used in the full cell. The galvanostatic charge/discharge and GITT tests were implemented using a LAND-CT2001A battery testing system in 0.01–1.5\xa0V (vs. Na+/Na) at room temperature/low temperature. The pulse current, duration and relaxation time of the GITT tests are 50\xa0mA\xa0g−1, 600\xa0s, and 3600\xa0s, respectively. CV curves and temperature-dependent EIS measurements with a frequency range of 100\xa0kHz to 0.01\xa0Hz were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Ivium-n-Stat).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

As depicted in Figure S1, NMVP/C, NMVP/C/rGO, NMVPZ/C, and NMVPZ/C/rGO exhibit identical structural characteristics, matching well with the NASICON structured NMVP. The narrow peaks indicate the strong crystallinity of the electrode materials, and the absence of additional peaks suggests the absence of detectable contaminants. Additionally, Rietveld XRD refinement was employed to comprehensively understand the crystal information of NMVP/C/rGO and NMVPZ/C/rGO materials. Both samples were successfully indexed to the characteristic features of the R-3c group (see Fig.\xa01 and Tables S1 and S2). The lattice parameters of NMVPZ/C/rGO were found to be a\u2009=\u2009b\u2009=\u20098.97148\xa0Å and c\u2009=\u200921.70810\xa0Å, exceeding the corresponding values for NMVP/C/rGO. This expansion of the lattice parameters can be attributed to the larger radius of Zr4+ (0.80\xa0Å) compared to that of V3+ (0.74\xa0Å). Consequently, NMVP/C/rGO possesses relatively larger ion transport channels, facilitating fast Na\u2009+\u2009diffusion during the electrochemical process.\nXPS measurements of the obtained samples were carried out to characterize their valence states. The full XPS spectra displayed in Fig.\xa02c confirm the presence of Na, P, V, Zr, Mn, C, and O elements in the sample. The Mn 2p XPS spectra of NMVPZ/C/rGO (Fig.\xa01f) show sharp peaks at 641.9 and 653.9\xa0eV, indicating the presence of divalent Mn [9, 21, 22]. Additionally, the V 2p XPS peaks at 523.6\xa0eV and 516.8\xa0eV correspond to trivalent vanadium in all samples. The Zr 3d XPS spectra of NMZP/C/rGO contain two peaks that correspond to Zr 3d5/2 at 183.2\xa0eV and Zr 3d3/2 at 185.6\xa0eV, which indicates that Zr is tetravalent. Figure S2 shows the consistent positions of Mn, V (c), and Zr in NMVP/C, NMVP/C/rGO, NMVPZ/C, and NMVPZ/C/rGO, indicating that the introduction of rGO and Zr does not alter the valence states of the samples. The Raman spectrum (Figure S3a) reveals that all three samples show two characteristic carbon peaks that correspond to the D-band (1350\xa0cm−1) and the G-band (1590\xa0cm−1), respectively. The fitted I band at 1280\xa0cm−1 is caused by disorder or polyenes in the graphite lattice, as seen in Fig. S3(b). The D′ band, a tiny fitted peak at 1680\xa0cm−1, corresponds to the defect-induced peak linked to disorder in graphene [38,39,40]. The mass ratio of C in samples were calculated to be 7.1 and 10.1 wt% (Figure S4). The specific surface areas of the two materials were 37.2 m2\xa0g-1 (NMVPZ/C/rGO) and 125.8 m2\xa0g-1 (NMVP/C/rGO). Compared to the materials without rGO composite (29.2 m2\xa0g-1 for NMVPZ/C and 20.5 m2\xa0g-1 for NMVP/C), it is evident that the inclusion of rGO effectively increases the specific surface area of the materials. Furthermore, the mesoporous structure of all samples, both before and after compounding with rGO, was demonstrated by BJH tests, indicating that this structure facilitates electrolyte penetration during charging/discharging, thereby promoting the fast kinetics of charge transfer for electrode reactions (see Figure S5).\nThe SEM and TEM analyses were employed to characterize the morphology of the samples. The SEM images show that all samples are irregularly shaped and have a size distribution of 1–5\xa0μm (Fig.\xa02a–d). In general, the particle size of NMVP/C and NMVPZ/C microspheres is larger than that of the rGO-coated materials (NMVPZ/C/rGO), which indicates that the presence of rGO inhibits particle aggregation. The particles of the NMVPZ/C/rGO sample are well-wrapped in rGO networks (Fig.\xa02e). Moreover, HR-TEM shows that the surface of the NMVPZ/C/rGO is uniformly covered with a thin layer of C, measuring 8\xa0nm in thickness (Fig.\xa02f and g), which is a result of the thermal pyrolysis of citric acid. Additionally, the distribution of each elements is homogeneous throughout the sample (see Fig.\xa02h). The dual conductive networks effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of the cathode material, leading to electrodes with rapid kinetics.\nFigure\xa03 illustrates the electrochemical performance of half-cells cycling at room temperature within the voltage range of 2.0–3.8\xa0V. The CV profiles (Fig.\xa03a) of NMVPZ/C/rGO show two pairs of peaks at 3.6/3.48\xa0V and 3.5/3.33\xa0V, corresponding to redox reaction of Mn2+/Mn3+ and V3+/V4+. The CV curves for different cycles overlap well, which illustrates the high stability of the electrode materials during charging/discharging. As illustrated in Figure S6, the NVMP/C sample demonstrates a significant voltage separation between its anodic and cathodic peaks, whereas the NVMP/C/rGO and NVMZP/C/rGO cathodes exhibit smaller separations. This suggests weaker polarization, attributable to the presence of the rGO conductive network. Figure\xa03b depicts that NMVPZ/C/rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 98.5 mAh g−1, similar to NMVP/C and NMVPZ/C (Figure S7). However, the capacity is slightly lower than that of NMVP/C/rGO (Fig.\xa03c) because the replacement of inactive Zr for V reduces the theoretical capacity of the material. Despite the lower reversible capacity, NMVPZ/C/rGO demonstrates 99.5% of the theoretical capacities (Figure S8), indicating that the combination of Zr doping and rGO coating enhances the reversibility of electrode reactions for NMVP/C/rGO. The initial Coulombic efficiency of the materials exhibits comparable values. Both NMVP/C and NMVPZ/C/rGO demonstrate a notably high initial Coulombic efficiency exceeding 98%, indicative of a high degree of reversibility. To compare cycling stability between NMVP/C, NMVP/C/rGO, NMVPZ/C, and NMVPZ/C/rGO samples, the cycling was tested at 2\xa0°C. Figure\xa03d depicted that the NMVPZ/C/rGO exhibits remarkable capacity retention of 84.8% after 1000 cycles, while NMVP/C/rGO and NMVPZ/C demonstrate lower capacity retentions of 80.1% and 59.6%, indicating the highest cyclability of NMVPZ/C/rGO among all samples. Observations reveal that NMVP/C, lacking both Zr and rGO, exhibits the poorest stability, with the electrode nearly failing when the cycling number reached 800 cycles.\nTo assess the structural stability of the material over extended cycling, we have incorporated XRD and SEM data plots of the NMVPZ/C/rGO material following 1000 cycles at 2\xa0°C. XRD peak (Figure S9) intensities of both NMVP/C and NMVPZ/C materials were notably weakened after 1000 cycles, primarily attributed to the structural damage induced by the continuous Na+ insertion/de-insertion process. Conversely, the rGO-composited materials exhibited comparable diffraction peak intensities to their pre-cycling states, with the crystal structures of NMVPZ/C/rGO materials showing minimal deviation from the initial powder samples, suggesting that rGO composite incorporation effectively mitigates material structural damage during charge–discharge cycling, thereby contributing to enhanced structural stability. SEM characterization of both NMVP/C and NMVPZ/C/rGO materials after 1000 cycles is depicted in Figure S10. Notably, particles of NMVPZ/C/rGO material remained intact with smooth surfaces, which indicates the effectiveness of rGO composite in preventing material fracture.\nThe rate capability of all materials was assessed under varying rates, as shown in Figure S11. NMVP/C/rGO and NMVPZ/C/rGO electrodes exhibit higher capacities at lower C-rates, while the capacities of NMVP/C and NMVP/C/rGO decrease rapidly with increasing rates, particularly at 5\xa0°C. Notably, the NMVPZ/C/rGO demonstrates the highest rate capacity among all samples. Additionally, the cells were charged at the same rate of 0.5\xa0°C but discharged with varying rate. Figure\xa03e shows that NMVP exhibits a specific capacity of 90 mAh g−1 at 0.2\xa0°C, whereas the capacity rapidly decreases with an increase in the C-rate. When the discharge rate increases to 40\xa0°C, it is almost inactive due to its inferior electronic conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusivity. NMVPZ/C exhibits considerably better capacity at a high discharge rate than does NMVP/C. Even at high rates of 40\xa0°C and 60\xa0°C, there are still 69.5 and 65.7 mAh g−1. Notably, the NMVPZ/C/rGO electrode demonstrates superior rate capability, delivering high capacities of 77.9 and 71.9 mAh g−1 at 40 and 60\xa0°C, respectively. The NMVPZ/C/rGO material demonstrates superior performance compared to materials solely doped with Zr. Specifically, the NMVPZ/C/rGO material showcases enhanced rate capability compared to Zr-doped NASICON cathode material [27,28,29].\nThe electrochemical kinetic characteristics of the electrodes were further evaluated using the GITT and CV. Figure\xa04a and b depict the CV curves of the electrodes at various scanning rates. The Na\u2009+\u2009diffusion coefficients (DNa+) were estimated by linearly fitting the square root of the scan rate (v 1/2) against the peak current (I p), using the Randles–Sevcik equation, as depicted in Fig.\xa04c. The values of DNa+ for various electrodes are displayed in Table S3. It can be seen that the NMVPZ/C/rGO has the highest DNa+ during the charge and discharge process (Figure S12). Additionally, the GITT (Figure S13) is employed to obtain the Na+ diffusivity (DNa+) according to the following equation:\nwhere DNa+ is the Na+ diffusion coefficient, τ is the duration of the current pulse (s), nm is the number of moles (mol), Vm is the molar volume (cm3 mol–1), S is the electrode area (cm2), ΔEs is the equilibrium voltage change induced by current pulse, and ΔEt is the voltage change during the constant current pulse (neglecting the iR drop) [41,42,43].\nDuring charge/discharge, the NMVPZ/C/rGO displays the equilibrium potential slope profiles, indicating solid-solution reaction mechanisms. In contrast, the NMVP/C/rGO electrode exhibits both slope and flat plateau regions, suggesting a two-phase mechanism during sodiation/desodiation. Notably, NMVPZ/C/rGO shows a smaller overpotential (0.01–0.02\xa0V) compared to NMVP/C/rGO, suggesting faster kinetics in NMVPZ/C/rGO. The DNa+ calculated from GITT for NMVP/C/rGO drop significantly from approximately 3.21\u2009×\u200910−11 cm2\xa0s−1 at the first plateau to 4.89\u2009×\u200910−14 and 9.17\u2009×\u200910−14 cm2\xa0s−1 at the second plateau. The decrease in diffusion coefficients is associated to the larger Na+ diffusion barriers arising from the biphasic transition from Na3MnV(PO4)3 to Na2MnV(PO4)3. The DNa+ in NMVPZ/C/rGO exhibited a notable improvement, maintaining a stable value of approximately 5.74\u2009×\u200910−11 cm2\xa0s−1 throughout the charing/discharging process. This enhancement in ionic diffusion, coupled with minimal polarizations during electrochemical reactions, thereby enhancing the high-rate capability of NMVPZ/C/rGO. In addition, EIS results (Figure S14) show that NMVPZ/C/rGO demonstrates the lowest Ohmic impedance at 2.5 Ω, followed by NMVP/C/rGO at 2.8 Ω. In contrast, the Ohmic impedance of NMVP/C and NMVPZ/C is estimated to be 3.1 Ω and 5.2 Ω, respectively. These results reveal that materials with rGO coating display lower Ohmic impedance compared to those without rGO.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

In detail, an aqueous suspension of graphite oxide (GO) was prepared by sonicating and dispersing it in mixture of ethanol and deionized water for 2\xa0h. To prepare 4\xa0mmol of the target compounds, stoichiometric volumes of C20H28O8Zr, C6H8O7, NH4H2PO4, CH3COONa, NH4VO3, and CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O were then added to the GO suspension, followed by continuous stirring at 90\xa0°C. The resulting gel was dried for four hours at 150\xa0°C before being pulverized into powder in a mortar. Finally, the powders were heated in an argon environment environment for 4\xa0h at 350\xa0°C and 10\xa0h at 700\xa0°C. Na4MnV(PO4)3/C, Na4MnV(PO4)3/C/rGO, and Na3.8MnV0.8Zr0.2(PO4)3/C were synthesized under the same process, and they are abbreviated as NVMP/C, NMVP/C/rGO, NMVPZ and NMVPZ/C/rGO.\n\n2.2 Material characteristics\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using a D8 ADVANCE instrument to examine the crystalline structure. The morphology of the samples was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSW-5510LV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (JEOL-F200). The carbon structure and contents were analyzed using TG-DSC (STA448F3), XPS (ESCALAB Xi\u2009+), and Raman spectroscopy (DXR3). For electrochemical characteristics, the active material was dispersed in NMP with a ratio of 8:1:1 with binder and Super P, coated on aluminum foil, after drying at 120 degrees Celsius to obtain the cathode. CR2032 coin cells were assembled using Na metal as the anode. The electrolyte consisted of 1\xa0M NaClO4 dissolved in a solution of ethylene carbonate (EC) / propylene carbonate (PC)/fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) with a volume ratio of 47.5/47.4/5.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

In detail, an aqueous suspension of graphite oxide (GO) was prepared by sonicating and dispersing it in mixture of ethanol and deionized water for 2\xa0h. To prepare 4\xa0mmol of the target compounds, stoichiometric volumes of C20H28O8Zr, C6H8O7, NH4H2PO4, CH3COONa, NH4VO3, and CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O were then added to the GO suspension, followed by continuous stirring at 90\xa0°C. The resulting gel was dried for four hours at 150\xa0°C before being pulverized into powder in a mortar. Finally, the powders were heated in an argon environment environment for 4\xa0h at 350\xa0°C and 10\xa0h at 700\xa0°C. Na4MnV(PO4)3/C, Na4MnV(PO4)3/C/rGO, and Na3.8MnV0.8Zr0.2(PO4)3/C were synthesized under the same process, and they are abbreviated as NVMP/C, NMVP/C/rGO, NMVPZ and NMVPZ/C/rGO.\n\n2.2 Material characteristics\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using a D8 ADVANCE instrument to examine the crystalline structure. The morphology of the samples was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSW-5510LV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (JEOL-F200).

For NVPF cathodes, the main obstacle of poor conductivity could be well-addressed by carbon hybridization or nano-crystallization strategies. However, carbon compositing process would bring up fluorine-loss issue and the designation of tailor-made nanocomposite remains challenging. Here, we realize the optimal regulation on crystal growth by virtue of a fluorinated ionic liquid usage, which could compensate the fluorine-loss during high-temperature annealing process. As a structural-directing agent, ionic liquid with low surface tension also helps to reduce surficial Gibbs free energy of NVPF crystal, facilitating to reduce the particle size. Meanwhile, the π-cation interaction between reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and cations of ionic liquid is beneficial to fabricate ultrathin rGO-wrapped NVPF nanoplates (I-NVPF@rGO). The tailored I-NVPF@rGO exhibits enhanced conductivity and optimized crystal planes, resulting in excellent rate capability and improved energy density. When coupling with MoS2/SnS/rGO anode, the MoS2/SnS/rGO||I-NVPF@rGO full battery delivers a capacity of 116\xa0mA\xa0h\xa0g−1 at 0.2\xa0C. This strategy offers valuable insights into the development of sodium-ion batteries.\n\n\nGraphic abstract\nThe tailored I-NVPF@rGO nanocomposite has been prepared by a low-surface-energy strategy. The obtained I-NVPF@rGO shows high electronic and ionic conductivity due to its optimized particle size, refined crystal growth, and the ultrathin conductive rGO network. The fluorinated ionic liquid compensates the fluorine inhibiting the F-loss, which endows the I-NVPF@rGO with high energy density in sodium ion batteries.\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\n\nData availability\nData will be made available on request.\n\n\nCited by (0)\nView Abstract\n© 2024 Elsevier B.V.

However, their synthesis requires harsh conditions such as high pressure and temperature, and the cathode materials exhibit poor electrical conductivity and sluggish kinetics, hindering SIBs from meeting the requirements for practical applications. In this study, a conversion-type Gr/FeSO4 nanocomposite based on earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements was developed using a high-energy mechanical ball-milling method. The conversion reaction in FeSO4 was triggered via a simple direct-contact pre-sodiation method, wherein the FeSO4 particles were reversibly converted to Fe0 and Na2SO4 and recovered in the next charging process. Meanwhile, graphene in Gr/FeSO4 acted as a conductive matrix that provided additional electron transfer paths, resulting in increased ionic and electronic conductivities and enhanced diffusion kinetics. Owing to these matrices, the as-prepared Gr/FeSO4 nanocomposite exhibited remarkable long-term cyclability. This study highlights the advantages of combining pre-sodiation and conversion reactions for cathodes and demonstrates the feasibility of employing naturally abundant FeSO4 for high-performance SIBs.\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\n\nData availability\nData will be made available on request.\n\n\nCited by (0)\n1\nThese authors contributed equally.\n2\nPresent address: Department of Chemistry and Materials Science, School of Chemical Engineering, Aalto University, P.O.

The electric-controlled exfoliation method produced sodium intercalated graphene oxide (Na-GO). Na-GO has a crystalline structure with a few-layered scattered sheet shape, 87.9 percent crystallinity, a computed density of 2.26\xa0g/cm3, and a cell volume of 35.29x106pm3. The Coulombic efficiency of the Na-GO material increased from 98.8% in the first electrochemical cycle to 100.5 percent in the 60th, and the specific capacity (S.C.) of the Na-GO electrode at a current density of 100\xa0mA/g is about 368 mAh/g. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles against sodium metal were carried out as a reference electrode. This is a brand-new method for creating high-performing materials that do not require purifying or cleaning procedures.\n\n\nGraphical abstract\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\n\nData availability\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.\n\n\nCited by (0)\nView Abstract\n© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Two Na+ ions can reversibly (de)intercalation from/into the unit structure, with a reversible capacity of 106.7 mAh/g. The charge–discharge curves show a voltage slope at 3.4\xa0V, and a plateau at 3.6\xa0V. To elucidate the sodium storage mechanisms, the structure evolution and electron transfer are demonstrated using in-situ X-ray diffraction and ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. It is found that at different stage of the electrochemical process, it undergoes different phase reaction process with different redox couples. A single-phase reaction occurs when the first sodium-ion extracted from Na4MnV(PO4)3 with a V3+/V4+ redox, while a two-phase reaction takes place when the second sodium-ion extracted with a Mn2+/Mn3+ redox. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, GITT, indicates the single-phase reaction process shows a faster kinetic compared to the two-phase reaction process. These findings between the kinetics, chemical and structural evolution provide new insight into the sodium storage mechanisms of NASICON-type cathode, and further the understanding of other materials for sodium-ion batteries.\n\n\nGraphical abstract\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\n\nData availability\nData will be made available on request.\n\n\nCited by (0)\n© 2023 The Author(s).

However, challenges such as phase separation arising from different expansion coefficients among phases under high voltage or during prolonged cycling have been a concern. Bridging effect from a spinel phase was in-situ introduced herein via a target element quenching process. The introduced stabilized spinel-bridged phase can create a structural confinement between the O3 and P2 phases and realize interface reconstructing simultaneously by target-element optimization. Based on the experimental and computational results, the multiphase riveting-structured O3/spinel/P2 triphasic structure provides a structural constraint and alleviates the internal stress, which can suppress detrimental irreversible phase changes to enhance the structural reversibility and stability. Beneficial to the optimized ions high diffusion kinetics and lower diffusion barriers, the obtained O3/spinel/P2-Na0.98Ni0.3Cu0.1Ti0.05Mo0.05Mn0.5O2-δSδ demonstrates an impressive initial capacity of 178.6 mAh g-1 at a current density of 10 mA g-1, with a remarkable capacity retention rate of 86.65% over 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1. This innovative approach offers a new solution for preparing structurally stable, high-performance layer-structured oxides with satisfied cycling performance for sodium-ion batteries.\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\n\n\nData availability\nData will be made available on request.\n\n\nCited by (0)\n1\nThese authors contributed equally to this work.\nView Abstract\n© 2024 Elsevier B.V.
