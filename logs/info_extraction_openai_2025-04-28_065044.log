The critical point for realizing high Ca is to fabricate the electrode with superior specific capacity with the condition of high loading mass. Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted much attention as a promising next-generation energy storage system owing to the abundance and economy of sodium sources and their similar electrochemical behavior to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the larger radius of Na+ compared to Li+ leads to much more sluggish reaction kinetics and severe structural pulverization of the electrode during cycling, which are harmful for cell capacity and cycle stability.\nIn order to achieve high Ca in SIBs, it is urgently required to explore advanced electrode materials, especially anode ones with high reversible capacity and low cost. Among various candidates, transition metal sulfides have recently attracted much attention because they can furnish high specific capacity (Cs) and widespread availability as well as small stress change during cycling. Selenium is located in the same group as sulfur in the Periodic table of elements; moreover, it possesses higher conductivity than sulfur. Therefore, metal selenides can serve as potential anodes for SIBs. There are a few reports on metal selenides, such as MoSe2, FeSe2, SnSe, or CoSe2, which exhibit a favorable electrochemical performance. Recently, Mai's group has reported novel NiSe2 nano-octahedra as promising anodes showing excellent cycle stability and rate capacities.\nDespite the breakthrough in metal selenides, the fraction and loading of active material on the electrodes are still too low. A routine slurry-coating procedure, in which a nonconductive binder of ∼10 wt% is usually used to maintain the electrode integrity, is commonly adopted for the preparation of electrodes. This seriously hinders the electron transfer and decreases the capacity of the electrode. In addition, conductive carbon is always adopted to increase electron/ion transfer and relieve volume changes. However, the low tap density of carbonaceous material limits the overall tap density of the electrodes. As a result, it is difficult to achieve high active material loading. To say the least, the thicker the electrode film, the harder the charge transfer. Therefore, there is a trade-off between specific capacity and active material loading. Directly growing pure active material onto the current collector will avoid the cumbersome additives of carbon and a binder. Moreover, if the active material is vertically grown on a three-dimensional (3D) current collector to form a hierarchical array structure, the charge transfer channel will be available despite the high active material loading. Therefore, the direct growth method is an effective approach to obtain high Ca for metal selenides. Recently, there have been some reports about metal selenides grown on foam Ni (F–Ni) for various applications, such as electrocatalysis for water splitting and H2/O2 generation.\nHerein, a new anode material of Ni3Se2 with a 3D hierarchical nanorod array (NA) structure (denoted 3DHNA) was successfully explored as an anode for high-areal-capacity SIBs. The NiSe NAs were first grown in situ on a 3D F–Ni current collector to form an integrated 3D microstructure (denoted 3D NA), which was favorable for quick ion transfer even at high electrode loading. Because F–Ni simultaneously serves as an Ni source of NiSe, the adherence of NA on F–Ni is tight, promising abundant electron transfer. In order to further acquire a secondary 3D structure for enhanced electrochemical reaction, the intermediate of the NiSe 3D NA electrode was post-treated through a decomposition followed by a fusion (decomposition–fusion) process. After this special process, a nanorod composed of a consecutive core and a rough surface with many protuberances attached was acquired, which was favorable for both quick charge transfer and structural stability. Moreover, along with this process, the composition of NA was transformed from NiSe to Ni3Se2. Compared with NiSe and NiSe2, the intrinsic low volume change of Ni3Se2 also decreased the risk of structural fracture. It is well known that the volume expansion of these materials is derived from insertion of Na through a conversion reaction to form amorphous Na2Se. By comparison with the reaction process described in eqn (S2)–(4),† Ni3Se2 experiences minimum volume stress. As a result, the electrode delivered a stable reversible capacity of 1.55 mA h cm−2 at 0.2 mA cm−2 after 100 cycles, with a capacity retention of 95%. Even at a high current density of 4 mA cm−2, the cell still retained a good Ca of 0.87 mA h cm−2. The Ca values are obviously superior to those of other metal selenides reported previously.\nThe preparation of Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA is exhibited in Scheme 1. Both the composition and the morphology of the NA experience a gradual evolution by regulating the temperature in order to realize an optimal electrochemical reaction. The bushy NA with a smooth surface are vertically grown on F–Ni to form an orderly 3D NA electrode after a one-step solvothermal reaction, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. S1a and b.† From the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. S2,† the diffraction peaks of 3D NA are indexed as two kinds of hexagonal NiSe phases with different space groups (PDF#08-1887 and 02-0892) (denoted R/P-NiSe). In order to roughen the nanorod to obtain a secondary 3D structure and to modulate the composition for a better electrochemical reaction, the 3D NA electrode is post-treated at high temperature under the protection of an inert gas. After treatment at different temperatures, the macroscopic 3D NA are well maintained for all samples, as indicated by the low-resolution SEM images in Fig. 1a, S1c and S1e.† While the single nanorod undergoes an obvious morphological evolution along with the increased temperature, as can be seen from the high-resolution SEM images. Moreover, as displayed by the XRD patterns, the composition of the samples experiences a corresponding transformation. Actually, as shown in Fig. S1d,† the smooth nanorods are broken into loose and separate nanoparticles and the diameter of the nanorod becomes larger at 500 °C. In addition, along with the high-temperature treatment, a pure phase of hexagonal NiSe (PDF#02-0892) is retained, as exhibited in Fig. S3.† Slight peaks attributed to hexagonal Ni3Se2 (PDF#19-0841) are also discovered, indicating that a transformation from NiSe to Ni3Se2 occurs. As mentioned above, Ni3Se2 suffers from a lower volume change compared with NiSe during the electrochemical reaction. With a further increase in temperature to 600 °C, the diffraction peaks are almost completely consistent with hexagonal Ni3Se2, demonstrating the formation of pure Ni3Se2. In addition, the nanorod in Fig. 1b becomes compact and the diameter decreases again compared with that at 500 °C. There are still many protuberances attached to the surface of the nanorod. Therefore, the NA experiences a decomposition–fusion process at 600 °C. The potential evolution process for different morphologies is explained as follows: the low melting point of Se (221 °C) results in it easily dissolving out from R/P-NiSe during heating. When the temperature is 500 °C, the dissolution of Se may be uneven; therefore, the NiSe nanoparticles are formed on the nanorod during cooling down. When the temperature is further increased to 600 °C, the dissolved Se is more evenly dispersed; therefore, the Ni3Se2 nanorods become smoother and more compact and the diameters decrease again. With a further increase in temperature to 700 °C, even if a stable Ni3Se2 phase is maintained, the NiSe phase clearly appears again. As displayed in Fig. S1f,† the nanorods are fractured into a lotus root shaped structure. Some bulky particles even scatter to cause the collapse of the NA. This is described as a further condensation process. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement is carried out to explore the mass change of the electrode during the heating process, as shown in Fig. S4.† The mass of the 3D NA electrode is stable up to 450 °C. After that, the mass shows a very slight increase with increased temperature. Since there is no impurity seen in the XRD results, the slight mass increase should result from the increased mass of F–Ni at a high treatment temperature. In order to confirm this, the TGA of pure F–Ni, which is treated in N2H4·H2O solvent without the addition of Se, is tested in Fig. S4.† As expected, the pure F–Ni exhibits a very consistent mass change process with a 3D NA electrode. The very slight mass increase happens after 450 °C, which may be ascribed to the slight side reaction of F–Ni at a high treatment temperature. The XRD result of F–Ni after treatment at 600 °C is collected, as shown in Fig. S5.† Actually, apart from the diffraction peaks of F–Ni, there are two very small peaks which are ascribed to NiOOH (PDF#06-0075), resulting in the slight mass increase of F–Ni. The electrochemical performance of pure F–Ni after treatment at 600 °C is tested, as displayed in Fig. S6.† The areal capacity is very low, demonstrating the negligible capacity contribution of F–Ni. Therefore, the loading of active material on the electrode can be calculated by the mass difference between the electrode with and without addition of Se, as illustrated by eqn (S1).† The active material loading of the Ni3Se2 electrode at 600 °C is about 4 mg cm−2. In order to evaluate the optimal cycle stability for SIBs, the capacity retention of the three electrodes are compared in Fig. S7.† It is obvious that the electrode obtained at 600 °C has the best cycle stability. It is not appropriate to directly compare the specific capacity of the electrodes because of the different theoretical capacities of the active materials (the theoretical capacity of NiSe is 388 mA h g−1 while it is 320 mA h g−1 for Ni3Se2). For the electrode at 500 °C, the cycle capacities are stable in the initial cycles. However, after 35 cycles, the capacity declines sharply, indicating full destruction of the electrode structure. This should be ascribed to the unstable electrode surface due to an excessive side reaction between the electrolyte and the electrode. As proved by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm in Fig. S8,† it is clear that the electrode at 500 °C possesses a higher BET surface area (22.7 m2 g−1) than that at 600 °C (14.9 m2 g−1). It is well known that the irreversible formation of a solid electrolyte interface film (SEI) happens on the interface of the electrode and the electrolyte. In addition, the NiSe phase is also not very suitable for a stable electrode structure compared with Ni3Se2. The SEM images of the electrode at 500 °C after cycling have been obtained, as shown in Fig. S9.† Obviously, the nanorod arrays are almost destroyed after cycling and the nanoparticles are agglomerative, which largely decreases the ion and electron transfer of the electrode. The performance of the electrode at 700 °C is very inferior, mainly because of the destruction of the nanorod structure. Therefore, the 3DHNA acquired at 600 °C is the best choice as the anode for SIBs because of its optimal composition and morphology.\nIn order to explore the morphology of optimal 3DHNA in-depth, transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are recorded in Fig. 1c. Obviously, the nanorods are monolithic but not compact. Moreover, the surface of the nanorod is lumpy with many nano-protuberances attached. The special morphology balances the charge transfer and irreversible side reaction derived from SEI formation, contributing to an excellent electrochemical performance. Because of the fusion of the nanorods, the contact between the electrode and the electrolyte decreases, which largely suppresses the side reaction on the electrode surface, as proved by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm in Fig. S8.† On the other hand, because of the special evolution process described above, the nanorods should not be too compact to infiltrate the electrolyte. In addition, many protuberances on the surface are still preserved to provide a channel for charge transfer. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern in the insert in Fig. 1d (corresponding to the red box in Fig. 1c), a distinct crystal lattice with a spacing of 0.22 nm is observed in these protuberances, which are ascribed to the (202) crystal plane of Ni3Se2. In addition, the (202) crystal lattice is also discovered in the body of the nanorod. An X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) spectrum is employed to further evaluate the surface composition. As shown in Table S1,† the elements of Ni and Se are detected with an atom ratio of more than the 3:2 of Ni3Se2, resulting from the F–Ni substrate. In addition, the O element exists, which is due to the surface oxidation of the 3DHNA electrode and an oxide layer on the F–Ni. From the Ni 2p XPS result in Fig. 1e, Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 appearing at 860.4 and 879.8 eV are matched well with Ni3Se2, whereas the peaks at lower binding energies of 854.5 and 872.3 eV are attributed to metal Ni 2p in F–Ni. As for the Se spectrum in Fig. 1f, only peaks corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 in Ni3Se2 are discovered. Ni3Se2 undergoes a lower volume change during cycling compared with NiSe. Therefore, the structural stress is largely decreased, contributing to excellent cycle stability.\nTo test the storage performance for SIBs, Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA serves as the electrode to assemble the coin cell. The electrochemical process is first investigated by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.001–3 V, as shown in Fig. 2a. Clearly, only a pair of redox peaks occur in the first cycle, demonstrating a simple one-step reversible reaction process. The obvious cathodic peak at 0.6 V is attributed to the conversion reaction occurring between metal selenide and Na+ by analogy with metal sulfide. As a result, ultrafine Ni nanoparticles are uniformly distributed into the Na2Se matrix. In the anodic scan, the sharp peak located at 1.69 V corresponds to reversible recovery of Ni3Se2. Obviously, the charge capacity undergoes some loss because of the formation of irreversible SEI film. For the second cycle, the pair of redox peaks still exist but with some shift. The reduction peak obviously shifts onwards to 1.1 V while the oxidation peak shows an inappreciable change, indicating decreased electrochemical polarization. This is consistent with the reaction process in which Ni3Se2 is turned into ultrafine nanocrystals after the first activation process. The CV profiles for the following four cycles overlap well with each other, suggesting suppressed polarization and excellent reversibility for sodium storage after the initial cycle. Fig. S10† exhibits the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at different cycles. The electrochemical plateaus are completely consistent with the CV results. Moreover, the charge–discharge plateaus are coincident with each other. Even after 100 cycles, the plateaus are still well maintained, further demonstrating superior reversibility.\nIn order to explore the reaction mechanism in depth, ex situ HRTEM images of the electrode in different charge–discharge states are investigated in Fig. 3. After the first full sodiation reaction, Ni3Se2 is fully reduced into Ni nanoparticles (marked by the circles in Fig. 3a) embedded into the Na2Se matrix. The large magnification of the circle inserted in Fig. 3a clearly exhibits the (111) crystal plane of metal Ni. When the cell finishes the charge process, the interplanar spacing of 0.24 nm corresponding to the (003) plane of Ni3Se2 can be discovered in Fig. 3b, suggesting the recovery of the Ni3Se2 phase. In order to illustrate the same reaction process as the first cycle in subsequent cycles, the conversion product and local structure after the second cycle are detected in Fig. 3c and d. As a result, the conversion reaction is also reversible between Ni nanoparticles and Ni3Se2. The one-step reversible conversion reaction promises excellent stability for sodium storage in the overall electrochemical reaction process. The reversible redox reaction process is expressed by eqn (1) and (2):\nThe rate performance is evaluated, with current densities increasing stepwise from 50 to 1000 mA g−1. As displayed in Fig. S11a,† the new material provides excellent charge capacities of 456.6, 368.6, 332.7, 289.7, 266.1, 237.2, and 218.0 mA h g−1 at current densities of 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 800, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Moreover, the Cs recovers to 304.1 mA h g−1 when the current density returns to 200 mA g−1, indicating a stable electrode structure and reversibility. It is worth mentioning that the loading of active material on the current collector is 4 mg cm−2, much higher than those of previously reported metal selenides. The outstanding rate capacities on the condition of high active material loading are attributed to the special 3DHNA structure. The primary 3D NA structure avoids a thick film on the electrode impeding electrolyte immersion. Moreover, the secondary 3D nanorod morphology further increases the contact area of the electrode and electrolyte. As exhibited in Fig. 2b, the rate performance based on Ca is evaluated. A high reversible capacity of 1.83 mA h cm−2 is obtained at 0.2 mA cm−2. Even increasing the current density to 4 mA cm−2, the electrode still delivers a capacity of 0.87 mA h cm−2. By connecting the Ni3Se2 cell, a small LED panel with the word “SIB” is lit. The charge–discharge curves at different current densities are displayed in Fig. S12a.† The plateaus are apparent and consistent with the CV results even when the current density is increased to 4 mA cm−2, explaining the excellent rate capacities. The rate performance outdistances other metal selenides reported in the literature, as shown in Fig. S13.† In most reports, Ca is lower than 0.5 mA h cm−2 because of a low active material fraction and loading. The cycle performance is also measured to illustrate the structural stability of the electrode. As displayed in Fig. S11b,† the first reversible capacity reaches 409.4 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 65% at 50 mA g−1. After 100 cycles, a steady capacity of 388.06 mA h g−1 is still retained, ensuring excellent capacity retention of up to 95% (Fig. S11c†). The capacity is slightly higher than the theoretical capacity of Ni3Se2 (320 mA h g−1), which may stem from slight electric double layer capacitive interface storage and the reversible growth of a polymeric/gel-like film derived from catalytically enhanced electrolyte reduction. At a high current density of 200 mA g−1, the cell still delivers a reversible capacity of 237.9 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. S11d†). The corresponding Ca for different cycles are exhibited in Fig. 2c. Even after 100 cycles, a superior Ca of 1.55 mA h cm−2 is still maintained. The desirable electrochemical performance accounts for the special structural design of the electrode, as graphically illustrated by Fig. 2d. First, in a macro context, 3D NA directly grown on F–Ni provide abundant channels for electron/ion transfer. In addition, the 3D nanorod secondary structure obtained by the decomposition–fusion process further offers enriched channels for Na+ migration, not only between the protuberances but also in the inside of the nanorod. This guarantees a full electrochemical reaction for excellent cycle and rate capacities. Thirdly, the fusion of nanorods reduces the contact of the electrode with the electrolyte to some extent and lessens the SEI formation on the electrode surface, guaranteeing a stable electrode structure and excellent reversibility. Finally, the intrinsically low volume change of Ni3Se2 prevents electrode fracture during cycling. The SEM image of the electrode after cycling is tested to further explain the structural stability, as displayed in Fig. S14.† Obviously, the NA structure is still well retained even though the nanorod becomes tougher and the diameter is larger. Therefore, this new-type material of Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA has great potential for SIBs due to the achievement of a high Ca. To gain an insight into the electrochemical kinetics of the electrode for sodium storage, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the cell before and after cycling are conducted in Fig. S12b.† The semicircle in the high-to-medium frequency region is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Obviously, Rct shows a significant decrease after cycling, in agreement with the CV and charge–discharge curves. This indicates a fruitful electrochemical reaction after the first cycle.\nDespite plentiful attempts and the successful achievement of excellent performance of SIBs in recent years, unfortunately, most of these attempts pay attention only to the high specific capacity and long cycle life based on the mass of active material. It is time to put a more concentrated focus on the requirements for practical battery application. Here, the important parameters of this work which are closely related to practical application are compared with other similar state-of-the-art work in the literature referring to metal selenides, as symbolically exhibited in Fig. 4. Obviously, for most work, the fraction of active material is not 100% because of conductive carbon and binder additive. The addition of conductive carbon is an important pathway to improve the capacity and cycle stability of the active material. Moreover, the electrode loading is always lower than 1.2 mg cm−2. It is acknowledged that the thinner the coating layer, the better the cell performance. However, the double low electrode parameters improve the capacity at the expense of the practical Ca. As a result, the Ca in these reports are lower than 0.8 mA h cm−2. On the contrary, the electrode in this work possesses 100% content of active material and a high loading of 4 mg cm−2. The high Ca of 1.55 mA h cm−2 is thus delivered. These results indicate the potential of an Ni3Se2 electrode with optimal 3DHNA for practical application of SIBs.\nIn summary, Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA were directly grown on F–Ni to serve as the anodes for high-areal-capacity SIBs free of carbon or binder. By a simple solvothermal reaction, NiSe NA with a smooth nanorod surface were vertically attached on 3D F–Ni to form an integrated electrode. The 3D NA ensures quick electron/ion transfer even at high electrode loading. Then, the nanorod was further roughened by a decomposition–fusion process to obtain an optimal secondary 3D structure. Through this special process, a nanorod composed of consecutive core and rough surfaces with many protuberances attached was acquired. This design increases the electrochemical reaction sites of NA because Na+ can transfer not only between the protuberances but also in the inside of the nanorod. In addition, to some extent, the repeat fusion of the nanorod decreases the irreversible side reaction between the electrode and electrolyte, contributing to a stable electrode interface and electrochemical reversibility. Moreover, along with the process, NiSe was transformed into Ni3Se2. The intrinsic low volume change in Ni3Se2 compared with NiSe favors the structural stability of the electrode during cycling. The systematic investigation of the mechanism showed an effective one-step reversible conversion reaction, guaranteeing stable electrochemical properties. As a result, the high reversible capacity of 1.55 mA h cm−2 was retained after 100 cycles at 0.2 mA cm−2 with excellent capacity retention of up to 95%. Even at a high current density of 4 mA cm−2, the cell still delivered a capacity of 0.87 mA h cm−2. This result is the most outstanding among the relevant reports about metal selenides. From a practical consideration, the electrode shows the most balanced performance with respect to various important parameters compared with other metal selenides. Therefore, this work proposes an effective design pathway for a 3DHNA Ni3Se2 electrode free of carbon or binder for high-areal-capacity SIBs.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The development of large-scale energy storage technologies is one of the critical factors for the widespread application of renewable energies due to their intermittency in time and space. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as ideal technologies for large-scale energy storage because of the abundant and inexpensive sodium resources. The exploration of suitable electrode materials, especially the anode materials, is a critical issue for the application of SIBs. Extensive investigations into anode materials have focused on carbonaceous materials and alloy materials, such as hard carbon, graphene sheets, hard–soft composite carbon, and Si–Sb alloy. Among them, hard carbon is the most promising candidate, since it was first reported by Dahn's group in 2000. In the early times, hard carbon showed a low reversible capacity with low initial coulombic efficiency. Recent efforts have greatly enhanced its reversible capacity and cycling stability. Nevertheless, challenges, such as high-cost and poor rate capability, still exist and hinder its practical application in SIBs. Nano-sized hard carbons are reported to possess excellent electrochemical performance, owing to the sufficient contact between the electrolyte and electrode and short Na+ ion diffusion path. However, the large surface area causes serious side reactions with the electrolyte, which leads to a low Coulombic efficiency and capacity decay. On the other hand, micro hard carbon materials with lower surface areas often show high initial Coulombic efficiency, but the long Na+ ion diffusion path results in a low rate performance. To incorporate the advantages of both nano- and micro-size materials, a micro-nano structure was proposed as an effective strategy.\nThree different sodium storage processes in hard carbon have been proposed: adsorption on the surface-active sites, intercalation into graphitic layers, and filling into nanopores. However, there is still a lack of consensus on the assignment of each voltage region to the corresponding sodium storage modes and the unclear mechanism results in difficultly in tuning the electrochemical behavior of hard carbon. Dahn et al. proposed a two-step mechanism. The slope region was ascribed to interlayer intercalation, while the plateau below 0.1 V was due to Na+ filling into nanopores. Ji and Cao et al. proposed an adsorption–insertion mechanism, in which the sloping part in the voltage profile was ascribed to sodium adsorption on the defect sites and the low-voltage plateau was attributed to sodium intercalation into the graphitic layers. Recently, Grey et al. found that the sodium inserted in the slope range is ionic in nature, which corresponds to ions adsorbing onto near defects, and at the plateau voltage, the ions gradually become more metallic and form quasi-metallic sodium clusters in an angstrom level, which is different from the bulk metallic sodium. It can be clearly seen that the main disagreement of the sodium storage mechanism is whether the low-voltage plateau belongs to metallic sodium formation or sodium intercalation into the graphitic layers.\nHerein, the biomass of kapok fibers with natural hollow tube structures was selected as a precursor to prepare hard carbon with a micro-nano structure through a two-step pyrolysis method at 1200 °C (1200HCMNT) or 1400 °C (1400HCMNT), which have been suggested as the most suitable carbonizing temperatures. As expected, the carbonized products exhibited an excellent sodium storage performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency, high reversible capacity, and excellent rate capability. To further understand the sodium storage mechanisms in the hard carbon materials, multiple characterization tools, such as galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and the thermal analysis technique, were applied to investigate the sodium insertion/extraction process.\nThe kapok fibers show a hollow type structure with a diameter of 15–20 μm and a wall thickness of 0.8–1 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†). During the carbonization, the kapok fibers underwent aromatization, polycondensation, and the formation of short graphite layers. The morphology remains well with merely a shrink in the diameter of 5–10 μm and wall thickness of about 200 nm (Fig. 1a). Compared to bulk hard carbon, the micron tube structure is considered to facilitate liquid electrolyte diffusion and give little contribution to total special surface area. Moreover, nano-sized wall thickness can reduce the solid-state diffusion length for Na+. Fig. 1b shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms for the HCMNTs. With increasing carbonization temperature, the specific surface area of the HCMNTs decreases gradually, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The small specific surface area is expected to reduce the SEI formation and improve the initial Coulombic efficiency. The element species and distribution of 1400HCMNT obtained from the XPS and EDS results are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Compared to other biomass-derived carbons, the HCMNTs show high purity of carbon with only traces of Si and Al. The C1s peak of 1400HCMNT (Fig. S2, ESI†) is deconvoluted into a major peak of C–C (sp2) at 284.8 eV and three weak peaks of C–C (sp) at 285.2 eV, C–O at 286.2 eV, and CO at 288.3 eV, which indicates the high carbon-content. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1c) of both samples present a highly disordered nature. Two broad diffraction peaks of the (002) and (100) planes can be attributed to the presence of small graphene-like layers. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the interlayer spacing (d002) of HCMNTs is in the range of 0.38–0.39 nm, which is larger than that of graphite (0.335 nm). The Lc values, calculated via the Scherrer equation using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) information of the (002) plane, decrease with the increase of carbonization temperature. The Raman spectra (Fig. 1d) of both the carbonized samples exhibit two peaks of the D band (the defect-induced band) at 1327 cm−1 and G band (the crystalline graphite band) at 1587 cm−1. Along with the increase of the carbonization temperature, the relative integrated intensity ID/IG ratios increase, and the crystallite size La values decrease (Table S1, ESI†), indicating the transformation of interior defect concentration and the crystals shrink for the (100) direction at higher carbonization temperatures. The microstructure analysis is further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1e and f, both samples display non-graphitized structure. A gradual development of local graphitic structure and diffraction rings are observed in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns with increasing treatment temperatures.\nGalvanostatic discharge–charge experiments were carried out to evaluate the sodium storage behavior of the HCMNT samples. Electrolyte of NaClO4 or NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 w/w) is assessed, as shown in Fig. S3 and Note S1 (ESI†). Finally, 1 M NaClO4 in EC/DMC was used in further research, for higher coulombic efficiency and better cycling performance. As shown in Fig. 2a, the two HCMNT samples show similar sodium storage behaviors with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of ∼80%, attributed to the low specific surface areas. The charge–discharge profiles exhibit two distinct parts: slope areas above 0.1 V and a plateau region around 0–0.1 V, indicating two different sodium storage mechanisms, which is also verified by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results (Fig. S4, ESI†). The reversible capacity of 1400HCMNT is 292.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, much higher than that of the 1200HCMNT (228 mA h g−1). The higher capacity of 1400HCMNT may benefit from the lower specific surface area and more closing pores, resulting from the higher treatment temperature. The HCMNTs possess excellent rate capability, because of the uniform hollow micro-nano structure with shorter diffusion distance of the Na-ion and better infiltration of electrolyte (Fig. 2b). 1400HCMNT shows better rate performance with a reversible specific capacity of 250, 224, and 167 mA h g−1 at the current rate of 0.5, 1, and 2C, respectively. To understand the capacity decline at high rates, discharge curves and the slope/plateau region contribution of 1400HCMNT at different current densities are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). With increasing charge–discharge rates, the plateau capacity declines rapidly and the slope capacity is well preserved. Compared with the previously reported hard carbon materials, 1400HCMNT exhibits a comparable rate performance with nanostructure materials, such as hollow carbon nanowires synthesized by hollow polyaniline nanowires (Fig. S7, ESI†). 1400HCMNT reveals a superior capacity retention ratio, among the biomass-based hard carbon materials. Fig. 2c shows the cycling performance of HCMNTs. After 200 cycles, the capacity retentions are higher than 93%, which is attributed to the stable micro-nano structure. The electrochemical properties in a full cell were also tested with Na2MnFe(CN)6 as the cathode. However, the performance still needs to be further improved (Fig. S8, and Note S2, ESI†).\nTo understand the sodium storage behavior in HCMNTs, especially the contribution at the low-voltage plateau, XPS, EPR, Raman, HR-TEM, and DSC measurements were applied for the samples at different states. Fig. 3a shows the quasi-open circuit voltage (Q-OCV) plots of the 1200HCMNT and 1400HCMNT. There is no noticeable difference for the low-voltage plateau region, indicating that the sodium storage mechanism at the low-voltage plateau is independent of the treatment temperature.\nFig. 3b shows the Na 1s XPS spectra for the 1400HCMNT at different states. A small broad peak in the Na 1s spectrum of the pristine electrode is contributed by the CMC binder (Na+ at 1071.2 eV). When the electrode was discharged to 0.1 V, a strong peak ascribed to the ionic sodium ions (1071.2 eV) can be observed, which is suggestive of the solid electrode interface (SEI) components (such as Na2CO3, NaC2H3O2, NaClO3 and NaCl, with the significant Na and Cl signals in the EDS mapping, Fig. S10 and Note S3, ESI†) and adsorbed sodium ions. When discharged to 0 V, the Na 1s peak shifts to a higher binding energy (1071.8 eV) and approaches the bond energy of sodium metal, suggesting the formation of metallic sodium. To further confirm the formation of metallic sodium, EPR, a powerful technique to detect unpaired electrons, was applied. For comparison, the EPR spectra of the 1400HCMNT electrode after plating sodium metal (Fig. S11, ESI†) were also collected (Fig. 3c), which contain two parts: a symmetrical broad line and an asymmetrical narrow peak. The broad line, which fits the Lorentz line shape and follows Curie magnetism, belongs to the Carbon center free radicals and delocalized electrons, which can be ascribed to the complex components of the SEI films. The narrow peak centred at the g-value of 2.002, conforms to the Dysonian asymmetry shape in the small line asymmetry parameter A/|B| (the absolute ratio of the maximum to the minimum signal). It suggested the existence of a metallic bond, as observed in lithium-ion batteries, demonstrating the formation of metallic sodium. The pristine 1400HCMNT electrode has no obvious signal in the EPR spectra except a little structural defect signal, since the highly pure carbon shows no carbon-center free radical and delocalized electron. After being discharged to 0.1 V, the EPR spectra are dominated by a symmetrical broad peak. However, when discharged to 0 V, an obvious narrow peak centred at g = 2.002 can be observed, demonstrating the formation of metallic sodium. Compared to the spectra of bulk sodium metal, the sharp peak belonging to the electrochemically formed metallic sodium shows a higher g-value, which could be attributed to the small size of metallic sodium, like metallic sodium clusters reported by K. Gotoh and C. Grey et al. Further TEM and Raman characterizations also verify that no prominent insertion into the graphitic layers was observed, as discussed in detail in the ESI† (Fig. S12, S13 and Table S3, ESI†). The 1200HCMNT shows a similar sodium storage mechanism to 1400HCMNT, so only the mechanism studies on 1400HCMNT are shown in the manuscript. More results of 1200HCMNT are shown in Note S4 in the ESI.†\nThese results and analyses demonstrate that the sodiation process can be divided into ionic state and metallic state storage (Fig. 4). Above 0.1 V (slope region), sodium is stored in the hard carbon in the ionic state, such as adsorbing on the defects or surface of the graphene sheets. At the low voltage range plateau, metallic sodium clusters or domains form in the nanopores of hard carbon. The aforementioned EPR results and previously reported NMR results confirmed the formation of metallic sodium in hard carbon after being discharged to 0 V. However, metallic sodium was barely detected by other characterization techniques, such as XRD or Raman. This may result from the small size of metallic sodium. The DSC measurements in the temperature range of −20 to 200 °C under Argon flow with samples at different sodium storage voltages were employed. As shown in Fig. 3d, only a small exothermic peak for PTFE binder at 23 °C can be seen in the DSC profile of the pristine electrode, indicating the thermal stability of the carbon material and binder. The melting phenomena can be easily detected in the hard carbon with plating sodium at 98 °C. For the samples discharged to 0.1 and 0 V, no peak at ∼98 °C can be observed. However, the two samples experienced a low voltage plateau (the sample discharged to 0 V and the hard carbon with plating sodium) exhibiting an endothermic peak at around 2 °C, which could be ascribed to the melting of metallic sodium clusters. The Kelvin equation suggested that the melting point of a metal would greatly decrease with the reduction in particle size. Therefore, the electrochemically formed metallic sodium clusters or domains in the hard carbon may be in a quasi-liquid state at room-temperature. It can be well explained that the electrochemically formed metallic sodium is hardly detected by crystallographic characterization techniques.\nIn summary, HCMNTs with a micro-nano structure were synthesized from hollow Kapok fibers. The 1400HCMNT sample delivers high reversible capacity, high initial coulombic efficiency, and excellent rate performance. The nano-sized tube walls bring good infiltration of electrolyte, shorten the diffusion distance of sodium-ions, and enhance the rate capacity of the HCMNTs. Combining EPR with thermal analysis, the sodium storage mechanisms in the HCMNT were also investigated. Sodium is stored in the hard carbon in the ionic state in the slope region and metallic sodium state in the low-voltage plateau. Moreover, the physical state of metallic sodium in the hard carbon could be quasi-liquid at room temperature.

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 XRD analysis\nSamples of pure copper oxide and composites of copper and gallium oxides containing 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% of gallium precursor (i.e., Ga(NO3)3·xH2O), calculated with respect to copper precursor (i.e., CuSO4·5H2O) weight, were structurally analysed by XRD. The obtained patterns of CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 are shown in Fig. 1. The phases of the synthesized samples matched well with the standards in the ICSD database. Through phase confirmation, it has been ascertained that there are four oxide phases of Cu and Ga found in the synthesized composites. They are CuO (copper oxide), copper gallium oxide (CuGa2O4), paramelaconite (Cu4O3) and gallium oxide (β-Ga2O3), which matched well with the ICSD standard patterns with reference numbers 01-080-1268, 00-044-0183, 01-083-1665 and 01-087-1901, and have monoclinic (space group: C2/c), cubic (space group: Fd3m), tetragonal (space group: I41/amd) and monoclinic (space group: C2/m) structures, respectively. CGO-0 showed diffraction peaks corresponding to CuO alone, whereas when the gallium precursor was introduced at 5 wt%, CGO-5 showed peaks for CuO and CuGa2O4. In addition to these two phases, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 also showed peaks for the Cu4O3 phase, and CGO-20 exhibited peaks corresponding to Ga2O3 in addition to the prior mentioned oxide phases. The XRD patterns of all samples showed no traces of additional phases to the prior mentioned ones. The content of each phase was calculated as a percentage in terms of the ratio of the integral intensity of each phase over the sum of the integral intensities of all phases present in the sample, as reported in Table 1. The percentage of CuO phase was found to be 100%, 83.90%, 73.08%, 49.18% and 38.58% in CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. CGO-5 contained 16.10% CuGa2O4, whereas the CuGa2O4 content was found to be 22.90%, 27.25% and 6.59% in CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The Cu4O3 content was estimated to be 4.02%, 23.57% and 39.25% in CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The Ga2O3 phase has been found only in CGO-20, and its content has been found to be 15.59%. The presence of CuO decreased gradually with increasing Ga content from CGO-0 to CGO-20. Ga precipitated in the form of CuGa2O4 in CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, whereas in CGO-20, there is formation of Ga2O3 in addition to the CuGa2O4 phase, which shows that the abundance of Ga content in CGO-20 perturbed the equilibrium of CuGa2O4 phase formation which led to a favourable phase equilibrium for Ga2O3 and so lower probability for the formation of CuGa2O4. With an increase in Ga loading from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, Cu4O3 formation became more prominent. Cu4O3 started appearing in CGO-10 and the amount increased with Ga loading until CGO-20. As β-Ga2O3 is known to be a relatively electrochemically inactive phase, CGO-20 is speculated to show poor electrochemical anodic performance among all the samples owing to its relatively greater content of Ga2O3. It has been proved that both CuO and Cu4O3 are electrochemically active materials, and thus the presence of both of these phases may enhance the storage capability of the prepared composites. Thus, the presence of the novel phase CuGa2O4 plays a vital role in controlling the anodic activity of the material. It is expected that the CuGa2O4 phase is responsible for enhancing the anode material stability by means of buffering the structural collapse of the material that happens during electrochemical cycling. Based on this assumption, it is expected that the sodium-ion storage capability of CGO-5, CGO-10 and CGO-15 may be better than that of CGO-0 and CGO-20, owing to the CuGa2O4 content in them. Further, Cu4O3 was investigated as an anode material for LIBs and was shown to exhibit superior rate performance and lower polarization owing to its lower impedance than CuO. Thus, the collective and optimized proportional presence of the CuO, CuGa2O4 and Cu4O3 phases in the composites is expected to affect the electrochemical performance of the composites. The contribution of instrumental error to the broadening of the peaks is corrected by following eqn (1), where the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak profile of a Si standard is used for calibration purposes. In eqn (1),Lobserved denotes the FWHM of the obtained XRD pattern, Linstrument is the FWHM of the standard reference peak profile, and Lhkl is the FWHM of the peak corresponding to the (hkl) crystalline plane after instrumental correction. The crystallite size and micro strain of each phase in each sample are found by following the Williamson–Hall (W–H) method (Fig. 2) in which line broadening in XRD is assumed to be the result of a cumulative effect of finite crystallite size and micro strain. Thus, in this analysis these two effects on peak broadening are de-convoluted and the final equation is given in eqn (2), where Lhkl represents the FWHM of the (hkl) plane, θhkl is the Bragg diffraction angle corresponding to the (hkl) peak orientation, k denotes the shape factor, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, ε is the strain and D denotes the crystallite size. The W–H analytical method is considered to be an improved technique relative to Scherrer’s method of analysis, as the strain contribution to peak broadening is neglected in Scherrer’s equation. The corresponding equation for the Scherrer method is given in eqn (3). In eqn (3), all variables have their usual meaning as described earlier. The crystallite sizes and micro strain values of the various chemical phases that are present in all samples under investigation are tabulated and shown in Table 1. Negative values of micro strain represent compressive strain whereas positive values indicate tensile strain.\nThe lattice parameters of the unit cells corresponding to different phases were obtained by refining and fitting the XRD peaks of the corresponding phases, and the obtained values are shown in Table 1. It can be found from Table 1 that the CuO phase in CGO-0 showed a crystallite size of 15.69 nm, which is its lowest size among all the other samples and is accompanied by a compressive micro strain of 2.14 × 10−3. The CuO phase showed crystallite sizes of 16.89, 81.62, 42.32 and 40.93 nm in CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The crystallite sizes of CuGa2O4 in CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 are found to be 7.04, 50.41, 13.43 and 5.50 nm, respectively. The crystallite sizes of Cu4O3 are found to be 2.60, 18.04 and 11.77 nm in CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. Ga2O3, which existed only in CGO-20, was found to exhibit a crystallite size of 58.85 nm.\nNaing et al. and Liao et al. showed that grain size enormously affects the electrochemical behavior of metal alloys. It has been proved that the coarser the crystallite, the better the rate performance, owing to larger grain boundary areas that allow diffusion of electrolyte ions through them, and finer crystallites in anode materials increase the cycle life, as they resist flow of electrolyte ions due to their narrower grain boundaries. As mentioned earlier, CuO and Cu4O3 are electrochemically active materials, whereas the presence of Ga either in the form of a ternary oxide, CuGa2O4, or as a binary oxide, Ga2O3, worsens the electrochemical performance due to the redox inactive behavior of Ga. However, the presence of Ga with Cu, i.e. CuGa2O4, in the anode material may increase the cycle life by providing a buffering effect against structural collapse or volume expansions that take place in the active matrix during charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, Cu4O3 has been proved to exhibit superior rate performance and capacity retention over CuO and Cu2O. Thus, considering the above factors and the crystallite sizes obtained from XRD, it can be assumed that the large crystallite size of CuO in CGO-10 can lead to an improvement in rate performance, but may reduce the cycle life due to the formation of a greater quantity of residual phases. But, the presence of an inactive phase, i.e. CuGa2O4, with relatively larger crystallite size, and the presence of Cu4O3 with relatively finer crystallite size may increase the cycle life of the CGO-10 anode material among all the samples. Although CGO-10 is expected to show superior rate performance and cycle stability, CGO-5, CGO-10 and CGO-15 are also expected to show enhanced anodic performance compared to CGO-0. CGO-20, owing to the presence of inactive Ga2O3, may exhibit relatively lower electrochemical performance.\n\n3.2 Morphological studies\nMorphological observations are carried out through SEM micrographs as shown in Fig. 3. It has been observed that CGO-0 showed a beach stone-like morphology with irregular particle shapes. It is clear from Fig. 3 that introduction of gallium into the system promoted the precipitation of Ga phases on top of the CuO particles observed in Fig. 3a. This accumulation of secondary phases is clearly visible in the figure as tiny particles covering the CuO particles, and the coverage of the beach stone-like particles by powder-like particles increased from CGO-5 to CGO-20. In CGO-15 and CGO-20, the Ga phases became dominant and covered almost all of the CuO particles, and the CuO particles became almost invisible under microscopic scanning. The aspect ratios of the CuO particles in all samples are calculated as the ratio between the length of the longest dimension (along the length) of the particle to the diameter along the shortest dimension (along the breadth), as the particles are irregular in shape. The calculated average aspect ratios for all samples are given in Table 2. The aspect ratios of the particles varied irregularly from sample-to-sample and can be correlated with the formation of different binary and ternary oxides of Cu and Ga (CuGa2O4, Cu4O3) and the strain associated with their formation. It is evident that particles with lower dimensions can show relatively enhanced electrochemical performance, and thus it can be presumed that CGO-10, owing to its lower aspect ratio, may exhibit better rate performance.\nFig. 4 shows elemental analyses of the samples carried out through EDAX incorporated in the SEM. The atomic% and weight% of Cu, Ga and O are in accordance with the proportions of Cu and Ga precursors added. The Ga content increased with increasing Ga precursor wt%. Ga wt% in CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 are found to be 0 wt%, 7.2 wt%, 15.2 wt%, 22.7 wt% and 31.9 wt%, respectively. It can be said from these results that Ga incorporation into the base material was successfully carried out, and the deviation of these values from the added wt% of Ga is owing to the fact that the added wt% is based on the amounts of precursor salts used, not on the actual Ga content.\nTEM micrographs of CGO-10 are shown in Fig. 5. These micrographs are consistent with those from SEM analysis. Fig. 5a clearly depicts small particles of Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 on top of bigger particles of CuO. Fig. 5b is a magnified portion of the smaller particle aggregates, and their particle sizes varied in the range of 30–85 nm. An HRTEM image and the SAED pattern of CGO-10 are shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. Lattice fringes are clearly observed in CGO-10, in which the (220) diffraction planes corresponding to Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 have d-spacings of 0.206 and 0.293 nm, respectively. Well defined bright spots formed into rings are observed in the SAED pattern, which shows that these samples are polycrystalline and the grains are monocrystalline. In the SAED pattern of CGO-10, the spots designated as a, b and c correspond to the CuO, CuGa2O4 and Cu4O3 phases and were assigned to the (12), (220) and (200) planes with d-spacings of 0.196, 0.293 and 0.290 nm, respectively. All the d-spacing values found from the SAED pattern of CGO-10 are in good agreement with those found from the corresponding XRD pattern.\n\n3.3 BET analysis\nThe surface area of CGO-10 was obtained from BET N2 adsorption–desorption studies. The N2 adsorption–desorption profiles of CGO-10 are shown in Fig. 6a, and the corresponding pore size distribution is shown in Fig. 6b. As shown in Fig. 6a, CGO-10 showed a type-III isotherm for both the adsorption and desorption processes with an H3 type hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification. H3 type hysteresis is a characteristic of meso sized pores, and the narrow loop appeared with a lower limit of p/p0 = 0.16 up to p/p0 = 0.94, exhibiting the dominance of mesoporosity in the sample. Also, a short and narrow loop appeared at high relative pressures between p/p0 = 0.94 and p/p0 = 0.99, which corresponds to a small amount of nearly macro sized pores. Fig. 6b shows the pore volume distribution as a function of pore width. The surface area of CGO-10 has been obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption profile by following the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) method, and the value was found to be 11.5171 m2 g−1. The average pore diameter was obtained by employing the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) analytical method on the desorption branch, and the pore diameter was found to be 5.2015 nm. The formation of pores on the particle surface may be due to the liberation of water and hydroxyl ions during calcination.\n\n3.4 XPS analysis\nInvestigations of the chemical bonding states of different elements in the CGO-10 sample are carried out through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectrum showed the presence of Cu, Ga and O in the sample (Fig. 7a). The XPS peaks of the elements mentioned above were de-convoluted using the Gaussian fitting function. The Cu-2p (Fig. 7b) scan exhibited four peaks among which two are satellite peaks and designated as S-1 and S-2 centred at 943.6 eV and 963.7 eV, respectively. The Cu-2p scan also showed two strong photoelectron emissions de-convoluted at 935.4 eV and 955.3 eV, corresponding to the Cu-2p3/2 and Cu-2p1/2 electronic levels, respectively. These are the characteristic peaks of Cu(II), and the Cu2+ oxidized charge state in CuGa2O4 exhibited a spin–orbit splitting energy separation of 19.9 eV which matched the previously reported values well. The Ga-2p scan showed two peaks centred at 1118.18 eV and 1145.08 eV corresponding to Ga-2p3/2 and Ga-2p1/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7c, with an energy separation of 26.9 eV which matched the previously reported value well. The Ga-3d scan shown in Fig. 7d exhibits a peak at around 20.08 eV corresponding to Ga-3d5/2. The O-1s XPS scan is shown in Fig. 7e and has two de-convoluted peaks, one centered at 530.2 eV that corresponds to metal–oxygen bonding, and the other one at 531.6 eV, corresponding to surface absorbed O2. The slight shift of the O-1s peak towards higher binding energy than the reported values may be due to an interaction between the binary and ternary oxide phases present in the sample. The observation of all the above described peaks in the sample gives evidence for the presence of CuO and CuGa2O4 in CGO-10.\n\n3.5 Charge/discharge studies\nIn order to investigate the sodium storage behaviour of the CGO composites we examined the galvanostatic charge/discharge behaviour at 0.07 A g−1 between the potential limits 0.01 and 3 V. Fig. 8a presents the first charge/discharge curves of the CGO composites in which the composites delivered charge capacities of 624, 640, 661, 647 and 618 mA h g−1 for CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The charge/discharge profiles of the composites vary from that of pristine CuO which indicates that Cu4O3 also participated in the electrochemical reaction of CuO for sodium-ion storage. It is interesting to note that though the charge/discharge profiles of CGO-10 and CGO-15 are identical, likewise the profiles of CGO-5 and CGO-20, all deviate from that of pristine CuO. The deviation is due to the formation of Cu4O3, CuGa2O4 and Ga2O3 phases in the composites. However, the content of the phases varied when the amount of Ga in the composites was increased from 5 to 20 wt%. Pristine CuO exhibited broad plateaus at around 0.82–0.5 V and 1.7–2.1 V in the discharge and charge curves, respectively. The broad plateau in the discharge curve represents the multiple reduction processes involved in solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the electrode surface: intermediate CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2 phase formation, generation of the Cu2O phase and the decomposition of Cu2O to Cu and Na2O. Similarly, the broad plateau in the charge profile indicates the reverse reaction of the discharge process. The composites exhibit three plateaus, viz. 0.3–0.14, 0.8–0.4 and 1.4–0.9 V in the discharge curve and three plateaus, viz. 0.4–0.78, 0.9–1.6 and 1.7–2.7 V in the charge curve. The three reduction plateaus of the composites are due to the intermediate phase formation of CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2 and SEI film formation, reduction of CuO to Cu2O and further conversion of Cu2O to Cu. The oxidation peaks correspond to the decomposition of the SEI film, the oxidation process of Cu to Cu2O and further oxidation of Cu2O to CuO. The three plateaus in the charge and discharge profiles are obtained at slightly different potentials for all the composites, which can be attributed to the variation in content of the Cu4O3, CuGa2O4 and Ga2O3 phases in different composites. The contents of the electrochemically active Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 phases are higher in CGO-10 and CGO-15 but they are lower in CGO-5 and CGO-20. In CGO-5 and CGO-20, the electrochemically inactive β-Ga2O3 phase dominates the electrochemical process during cycling. The high capacities of CGO-10 and CGO-15 may be ascribed to the fact that the electrochemically active Cu4O3 phase together with the CuGa2O4 phase enhances the capacity of the CuO phase. The Cu4O3 phase is also present in the case of CGO-5 and CGO-20, however, the content of CuGa2O4 is very low and there is more Ga2O3 in CGO-20 (β-Ga2O3 is known to be redox inactive ). Here, the CuGa2O4 phase may act as a matrix to enhance the capacity of CuO during electrochemical reactions.\nFig. 8b depicts the cycling performance of the CGO composites at a current density of 0.07 A g−1 over 500 cycles. The first cycle charge capacities are 624, 640, 661, 647 and 618 mA h g−1 for CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, whereas at the 500th cycle the obtained charge capacities are 183, 319, 481, 415 and 183 mA h g−1, respectively. The corresponding capacity retentions are 29.3, 49.8, 73.1, 64.1 and 29.6%, respectively. The obtained cycling performance clearly indicates that the cycling stability of CuO is greatly enhanced by the electrochemically active Cu4O3 phase together with the CuGa2O4 matrix. The inferior performance of CGO-0, CGO-5 and CGO-20 is attributed to large volume expansion during the electrochemical reaction which resulted in loss of contact between the current collector and the electrode material. In order to investigate the stability of the electrode material after 500 cycles, we carried out ex situ XRD (Fig. 8c), TEM (Fig. 8d), ex situ SEM (Fig. 9a) and HRTEM (Fig. 9b and c) on the CGO-10 electrode. Interestingly, the structure and morphology of CGO-10 are well maintained even after 500 cycles. The ex situ XRD pattern of CGO-10 after cycling showed the characteristic peaks of CGO-10 with minor impurity peaks which may be due to the conductive carbon and binder used for the electrode coating. TEM and SEM images of CGO-10 after cycling are shown in Fig. 8d and 9a, respectively. There is no noticeable change in particle morphology and size even after prolonged cycling of the material. An HRTEM image of CGO-10 after cycling and the corresponding SAED pattern are shown in Fig. 9b and c, respectively. Lattice fringes are clearly observed in CGO-10 after cycling, and the (020) plane of CuO with a d-spacing of 0.171 nm is clearly observed in the HRTEM image of CGO-10 after cycling (from Fig. 9b). The well defined bright spots formed into rings in the diffraction pattern are attributed to the polycrystalline sample and the monocrystalline grains. The spots labelled a, b and c in the SAED pattern of CGO-10 after cycling are assigned to the (11), (400) and (220) diffraction planes corresponding to the CuO, CuGa2O4 and Cu4O3 phases with d-spacing values of 0.253, 0.207 and 0.206 nm, respectively. All the d-spacing values found from the SAED pattern of CGO-10 after cycling are in good agreement with those found from the corresponding XRD pattern. The above obtained results confirmed that the charge/discharge behaviour and cycling stability of the CuO material are greatly enhanced by the Cu4O3 phase and the CuGa2O4 matrix. The rate capability of the CuO/Ga2O3 composites was investigated between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 10a. Compared to the other composites, the CGO-10 composite exhibits better rate capability, with charge capacities of 661, 519, 447, 401, 281, 187 and 96 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.07, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.3, 3.3 and 6.6 A g−1, respectively. It is interesting to note that the cell exhibited a charge capacity of 647 mA h g−1 when the cell is cycled back from high current density to low current density (0.07 A g−1). The rate capability results confirmed that CGO-10 exhibits good rate performance and structural stability at high current densities. Aside from CGO-10, the other composites exhibited poor rate performance at high current densities. The obtained capacities and cycling stability are superior compared to previous literature. In order to further understand the electrochemical reactions of the CGO composites, we carried out cyclic voltammetry studies (Fig. 10b) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V. The cyclic voltammograms are quite consistent with the charge/discharge behaviour of the CGO composites. The cathodic peak was observed at 0.57 V and the anodic peak was observed at 1.95 V for the pristine CuO material. The broad cathodic peak corresponds to multiple reduction processes involved in the decomposition of the electrolyte solvents, i.e. EC and DEC, to form a SEI film on the electrode surface, the formation of an intermediate CuO phase, i.e. CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2, the generation of the Cu2O phase and the decomposition of Cu2O to Cu and Na2O. During the charge process, a broad oxidation peak is observed at around 1.82 V, which corresponds to the oxidation process involved in the formation of the CuO phase from the Cu2O phase. The obtained CV curve of CuO is quite consistent with the previously reported literature. All the composites exhibited three reduction peaks, viz. 1.23, 0.7 and 0.28 V, during discharge and three oxidation peaks at 0.78, 1.28 and 1.98 V during charge. Like the charge/discharge profiles, the CV curves of CGO-10 and CGO-15 are quite similar, while those of CGO-5 and CGO-20 appear to be similar except for the redox peak intensities. The obtained CV profiles of the CGO composites are in accordance with the previously reported literature. The highest capacities of the CGO composites are attributed to the combined redox reactions of CuO and Cu4O3, as we couldn’t identify the peak signatures separately since Cu4O3 also forms a 2CuO + Cu2O composite which itself exhibits several redox peaks according to L. Zhao et al., and the mechanism of storing lithium ions is still not clear. From the CV profiles we clearly confirmed that only the CuO and Cu4O3 phases are involved in the redox reactions, however the CuGa2O4 phase acts as an inactive matrix to stabilize the CuO phase during cycling.\nIn order to gain further insight into the charge/discharge profiles and CV curves of pristine CuO and CGO composites, we carried out EIS analysis and obtained Nyquist plots which are shown in Fig. 10c. The EIS parameters are listed in Table 3. All Nyquist plots show one semicircle in the high frequency region and a line inclined at 45° in the low frequency region, which is called the Warburg region. This Warburg region is a signature of the Na+ ion diffusion process occurring in the electrode material during cycling. Depressed semicircles are observed in the case of CGO-10 and CGO-15, whereas the other CGO composites exhibit semicircles with high Rct (Table 3). This indicates that CGO-10 and CGO-15 exhibit lower impedance as compared to the other CGO composites. From the electrochemical studies we clearly confirmed that the enhanced electrochemical performances of the CGO composites are mainly attributed to the presence of Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 phases, in which the Cu4O3 phase is actively involved in the redox reactions and the CuGa2O4 phase stabilizes the CuO phase by buffering the volume expansion of CuO during cycling.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of pristine CuO and its gallium composites\nA copper precursor solution was prepared by adding 2.815558 g of copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5 H2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) to 120 mL of double distilled water under magnetic stirring. Once a homogeneous solution was obtained, 0.225 M concentrated NaOH solution was mixed into the copper sulphate solution at room temperature. After obtaining a homogeneous solution upon magnetic stirring, the final pH of the solution was found to be 5, and the solution mixture was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave which was then heat treated at 100 °C for 5 h in a muffle furnace. After cooling the solution down naturally to room temperature, the ensuing blue coloured precipitate was filtered and washed with double distilled water and ethanol several times. The obtained precipitate was then dispersed in double distilled water and dried in a hot air oven at 75 °C overnight. The obtained powder sample was then calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to get black coloured copper oxide (CuO) powders whose chemical phase was confirmed through XRD analysis. To prepare the gallium copper oxide composites, gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) was added at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%, whereas CuSO4·5H2O was added at 95, 90, 85 and 80 wt%. Both the gallium and copper precursors were added in the appropriate weight percentages to double distilled water, and 0.225 M NaOH solution was added to this homogeneous precursor solution in all cases. The same synthesis procedure was followed for all weight ratios as described for pristine CuO synthesis. Post-calcination, the powder samples with Ga loaded at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% were named as CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, and these codes are used to refer to them throughout this paper. Scheme 1 shows a schematic illustration containing the synthesis and cell design.\n\n2.2 Physical characterization\nAll the synthesized materials were structurally characterized using a Rigaku Ultima-III X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Morphological and elemental analyses were carried out using a Carl Zeiss-Sigma Scanning Electron Microscope with EDAX provision. HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscope) images and SAED (selected area electron diffraction) patterns of CGO-10, before and after cycling, were obtained using a Jeol/JEM 2100 HRTEM. The composition and the oxidation states of different elements in CGO-10 were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a scan range of 1200 eV. Surface area and pore size analyses of CGO-10 were carried out using N2 adsorption–desorption curves obtained by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, and the data were obtained on a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 Physisorption & Porosimetry system.

The as-obtained homogeneous slurry was coated onto copper foil using an electrode coater and dried under ambient conditions. Circular discs of 18 mm diameter were punched out and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 hours. 2032 type coin cells were finally assembled in an argon filled glove box in which the as-obtained disk was used as the working electrode and a sodium ingot was used as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in 1:1 ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) (1:1 v/v), and Celgard 2400 was used as a separator. The galvanostatic charge/discharge studies were carried out on a programmable battery tester (NEWARE battery analyzer) at various current densities within the potential window between 0.01 and 3 V. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (SP-150, Biologic SAS, France). The CV studies were carried out between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The EIS studies were carried out with an AC voltage signal of 5 mV and a frequency range between 100 kHz and 5 mHz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of pristine CuO and its gallium composites\nA copper precursor solution was prepared by adding 2.815558 g of copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5 H2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) to 120 mL of double distilled water under magnetic stirring. Once a homogeneous solution was obtained, 0.225 M concentrated NaOH solution was mixed into the copper sulphate solution at room temperature. After obtaining a homogeneous solution upon magnetic stirring, the final pH of the solution was found to be 5, and the solution mixture was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave which was then heat treated at 100 °C for 5 h in a muffle furnace. After cooling the solution down naturally to room temperature, the ensuing blue coloured precipitate was filtered and washed with double distilled water and ethanol several times. The obtained precipitate was then dispersed in double distilled water and dried in a hot air oven at 75 °C overnight. The obtained powder sample was then calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to get black coloured copper oxide (CuO) powders whose chemical phase was confirmed through XRD analysis. To prepare the gallium copper oxide composites, gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) was added at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%, whereas CuSO4·5H2O was added at 95, 90, 85 and 80 wt%. Both the gallium and copper precursors were added in the appropriate weight percentages to double distilled water, and 0.225 M NaOH solution was added to this homogeneous precursor solution in all cases. The same synthesis procedure was followed for all weight ratios as described for pristine CuO synthesis. Post-calcination, the powder samples with Ga loaded at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% were named as CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, and these codes are used to refer to them throughout this paper. Scheme 1 shows a schematic illustration containing the synthesis and cell design.\n\n2.2 Physical characterization\nAll the synthesized materials were structurally characterized using a Rigaku Ultima-III X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of pristine CuO and its gallium composites\nA copper precursor solution was prepared by adding 2.815558 g of copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5 H2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) to 120 mL of double distilled water under magnetic stirring. Once a homogeneous solution was obtained, 0.225 M concentrated NaOH solution was mixed into the copper sulphate solution at room temperature. After obtaining a homogeneous solution upon magnetic stirring, the final pH of the solution was found to be 5, and the solution mixture was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave which was then heat treated at 100 °C for 5 h in a muffle furnace. After cooling the solution down naturally to room temperature, the ensuing blue coloured precipitate was filtered and washed with double distilled water and ethanol several times. The obtained precipitate was then dispersed in double distilled water and dried in a hot air oven at 75 °C overnight. The obtained powder sample was then calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to get black coloured copper oxide (CuO) powders whose chemical phase was confirmed through XRD analysis. To prepare the gallium copper oxide composites, gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) was added at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%, whereas CuSO4·5H2O was added at 95, 90, 85 and 80 wt%. Both the gallium and copper precursors were added in the appropriate weight percentages to double distilled water, and 0.225 M NaOH solution was added to this homogeneous precursor solution in all cases. The same synthesis procedure was followed for all weight ratios as described for pristine CuO synthesis. Post-calcination, the powder samples with Ga loaded at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% were named as CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, and these codes are used to refer to them throughout this paper. Scheme 1 shows a schematic illustration containing the synthesis and cell design.\n\n2.2 Physical characterization\nAll the synthesized materials were structurally characterized using a Rigaku Ultima-III X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Morphological and elemental analyses were carried out using a Carl Zeiss-Sigma Scanning Electron Microscope with EDAX provision. HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscope) images and SAED (selected area electron diffraction) patterns of CGO-10, before and after cycling, were obtained using a Jeol/JEM 2100 HRTEM. The composition and the oxidation states of different elements in CGO-10 were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a scan range of 1200 eV. Surface area and pore size analyses of CGO-10 were carried out using N2 adsorption–desorption curves obtained by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, and the data were obtained on a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 Physisorption & Porosimetry system. Pore size distributions were obtained by employing BJH analysis on the desorption branch.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical characterization\nThe working electrode was prepared by using the traditional slurry coating method in which 80% synthesized active material was mixed with 10% super-P carbon and 10% PVDF binder. Here, super-P carbon acts as a conductive additive. N-methylpyrrolidone was used as a solvent to prepare the slurry homogeneously. The as-obtained homogeneous slurry was coated onto copper foil using an electrode coater and dried under ambient conditions. Circular discs of 18 mm diameter were punched out and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 hours. 2032 type coin cells were finally assembled in an argon filled glove box in which the as-obtained disk was used as the working electrode and a sodium ingot was used as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in 1:1 ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) (1:1 v/v), and Celgard 2400 was used as a separator. The galvanostatic charge/discharge studies were carried out on a programmable battery tester (NEWARE battery analyzer) at various current densities within the potential window between 0.01 and 3 V. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (SP-150, Biologic SAS, France). The CV studies were carried out between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.

Particularly, rechargeable SIBs have been regarded as an emerging generation of low-cost and high-performance energy storage systems, owing to the abundant sodium resources, suitable redox potentials and similar intercalation chemistry compared with LIBs. Nevertheless, suffering from the larger cation radius of Na+ (0.102 nm) than that of Li+ (0.076 nm), SIBs usually deliver low capacities, inferior rate capabilities and poor cycling stability. This has sparked great interest in the design of novel high performance anode materials for LIBs and SIBs simultaneously.\nTransition metal chalcogenides, especially transition metal selenides (MSex, M = Mo, W, Zn, Ni, Fe, Co, Sb; x = 1, 2…n), have been widely explored as potential anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, because of their environmentally benign nature, high theoretical capacities (500–1000 mA h g−1), vivid electrochemical activity, rich redox chemistry, and excellent mechanical and thermal endurance. Among them, zinc selenide has been investigated as a promising anode material due to the abundant resources of zinc, a smaller band gap (2.67 eV), and high theoretical Li-storage capacities. However, ZnSe has low electronic conductivity and undergoes enormous volume changes during the charge–discharge process. This makes it a challenge for the utilization of ZnSe as LIB/SIB electrode materials with high performance. To circumvent these drawbacks, several strategies have been undertaken to enhance the electrochemical performance of ZnSe, including designing nanostructured materials and hybrids with nanocarbon and fabricating porous structures. For instance, Park et al. have reported the solid-state synthesis of a hybrid ZnSe/C nanocomposite that delivered a high specific capacity of 705 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 for LIBs. Mai et al. have synthesized a ZnSe microsphere/MWCNT composite via a hydrothermal reaction route, which displayed a high capacity of 382 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 for SIBs. On the other hand, recently, MoSe2 as a typical layered metal chalcogenide has exhibited favorable performance for energy storage devices because of its large interlayer spacing (0.65 nm) and higher electrical conductivity arising from the small bandgap, which accelerates charge transfer during charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the porous carbon and few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure show enhanced capacitance-type contribution, which results in better cycling stability than that of a battery-type electrode. Therefore, it encourages us to extend our studies to fabricate few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–porous carbon composite. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a facile and controllable method to load few-layer MoSe2 and ZnSe nanoparticles simultaneously onto the porous carbon matrix in the form of uniform dispersion and firm adhesion, which are conducive to the insertion/extraction of lithium/sodium ions in a long cycle.\nIn this regard, the utilization of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites as well as derivatives as controllable and flexible precursors or templates for energy storage has emerged as a fascinating approach. Specifically, the MOF-derived nanostructures possess unique characters of porous structures, tunable compositions and well-connected carbon matrices, which displayed fascinating performance when used as anode materials for both LIBs and SIBs. However, it is notable that the Mo-based MOFs are hard to synthesize. The main challenge is that Mox+ with low valence states of x = 2, 3, 4 and 5 is usually unstable, while the most stable form of Mo6+ is generally the molybdate form. As a result, although the Mo-based MOF derivatives are considered to be desired for LIB/SIB applications, their reports are scanty.\nHerein, polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs), H3PMo12O40, in customized cavities of ZIF-8 were fabricated by a simple self-assembly strategy. Then, a facile selenization procedure was adopted to form few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite, as illustrated in Scheme 1. When acting as an anode material for LIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C delivers a high capacity of 1051 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and robust stability by maintaining a superior capacity of 524 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g−1. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a high initial coulombic efficiency of 89% at 0.2 A g−1 and delivers a large capacity of 468 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles for SIBs. Moreover, it achieves high rate capability and excellent long-term cycling performance at a high current density, which shows the admirable electrochemical performance of SIBs.\n\n\nExperimental section\n\nPreparation of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\n0.2195 g (1 mmol) of zinc acetate and 0.3 g of phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (PMA) were dissolved in 40 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution to form a homogeneous gamboge solution under ultrasonication and stirring for 20 min under ambient conditions. The solution was poured into 40 mL of DMF solution containing 0.3284 g (4 mmol) of 2-methylimidazole, subsequently. After stirring for 24 h, the precipitates were washed several times with ethanol solution and deionized water.\nFor the conversion of MOFs to the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite, a certain amount of a precursor (PMA/ZIF-8) was uniformly mixed with selenium powder, and the sample was annealed at 600 °C for 6 h under a 5% H2/95% Ar flow at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. For comparison, the ZnSe@C nanocomposite was prepared by a similar approach without adding the phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (see Scheme 1).\n\nCharacterization\nThe crystal phases of the samples were observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using filtered Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV. The samples were placed in a glass table and the data were analyzed in the range of 10–80°. The morphology characterization of the samples was conducted using SEM (Hitachi 8100) and TEM (FEI F20 S-TWIN). Raman (DXR2xi) were performed with a laser at wavelength of 532 nm and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were tested on a BELSORP-mini type BET analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an ESCALAB MARK II spherical analyzer with Kα radiation as the X-ray source. A CHNSO elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nFor the LIB test, 80 wt% active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), 10 wt% conductive agent (acetylene black) and 10 wt% binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed to obtain uniform slurries, followed by coating on copper foil. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 composed of EC, EMC and DMC with a ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v/v) and the metallic lithium foil served as the electrolyte and reference electrodes, respectively. For SIB test systems, the working electrode consists of active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), super-P and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in deionized water. Na foil and Whatman glass fiber were used as the reference electrode and the separator, respectively. 1 M NaPF6 in DIGYME = 100 vol% was used as the electrolyte. The test cells (CR2025) were kept in an argon-filled glovebox. The amount of the active material in test cells was ca. 1–2 mg. The area of the work electrode was about 1.1 cm2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and electrochemical performance were tested with a LAND CT2001A workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on an Ivium electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the same voltage window in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.\n\nCharacterization of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\nThe XRD patterns of two samples are shown in Fig. 1. The clear diffraction peaks located at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.5°, 65.8° and 72.6° can be indexed well to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) crystal planes of standard cubic ZnSe (JCPDS no. 65-9603). For ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the additional primary diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.4°, 37.9° and 55.9° can be indexed to the (100), (103) and (110) planes of MoSe2 (JCPDS no. 17-0887), respectively. The absence of the (002) plane of MoSe2 is probably due to the formation of a few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure, indicating the greatly suppressed stacking of layered MoS2. In addition, no impurity diffraction peak is observed, implying that the coexistence of ZnSe and MoSe2 was achieved by the transformation of polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs) in the customized cavities of ZIF-8 as a precursor.\nThe morphologies of the ZnSe@C and ZnSe/MoSe2@C samples are characterized by a series of characterization methods. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the ZnSe@C sample. It is composed of a well-defined polyhedral structure with an approximate size of 400 nm. In the case of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the structure of ZIF-8 is greatly changed with the addition of Mo-based POMs as a special stimulus guest. ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a uniform porous nanostructure with a relatively homogeneous distribution, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The SEM results provided valid evidence that a carbon-encapsulated hierarchical hollow porous structure was masterly fabricated by introducing PMA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3a and b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite shows an interior hollow architecture due to the utilization of Mo-based POMs as the guest and removal of excess organic solvent molecules during the selenization process. In this step, Zn2+ clusters react with Se to convert ZnSe nanoparticles and the Mo species in the precursor is reduced in situ from +6 to +4 to form a laminar MoSe2 phase synchronously. Moreover, ZnSe possesses the cubic crystal structure refined to the F3m space group. Besides, MoSe2, as a typical 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenide, exhibits an evident sandwich-like layered structure. Thus, we can clearly observe that few layered molybdenum selenide is uniformly embedded around small zinc selenide nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix (Fig. 3c). As depicted in Fig. 3d, the lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.17 nm match well with the (220) and (331) planes of ZnSe, respectively. Besides, the lattice fringe of MoSe2 is estimated to be 0.64 nm which is consistent with the (002) interlayer spacing. In addition, the particle size of ZnSe in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is ca. 10 nm. Meanwhile, it can also be noticed that the thickness of MoSe2 is about 1–4 layers, which is in accordance with the XRD result for the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite. Therefore, the absence of the (002) crystal plane of MoSe2 in Fig. 1 is due to well encapsulated MoSe2 in the carbon matrix and the few layer structure of MoSe2. Functional POMs are well suited to act as the flexible and tunable guest. Thus, Mo-based POMs play a special responsive role linked to ZIF-8, and employing polymetallic MOF co-precursors provides the extra space to finely harmonize the nanostructures. Besides, the SEM and TEM images of the precursor of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are shown in Fig. S1.† It is found that the hollow porous structure existed before the selenization process and was well maintained after the calcining process. Thereby, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C structure is obtained via continuous growth of PMA/ZIF-8 to derive few-layer MoSe2 around a ZnSe nanoparticle in the carbon matrix, as revealed by the SEM and TEM results, and is beneficial for the increase of surface chemical reactions, enlargement of ion storage sites and shortening of the diffusion paths. Moreover, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) image further provides evidence of the homogeneous distribution of Zn, Mo, Se and C elements (Fig. 4). These results reveal that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is composed of few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nanoparticles and is homogeneously confined in the porous carbon matrix. Meanwhile, EDS analysis demonstrates that the atomic ratio between Zn and Mo is around 1.42:1 (Fig. S2†).\nIn Raman spectra (Fig. S3†), two broad peaks of D and G bands at 1330 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are observed, which are generally assigned to a substantial defect or disordered site and the graphitic structure, respectively. The intensity ratios of the D and G peaks (ID/IG ratios) indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials. The ID/IG ratio of ZnSe/MoSe2@C of 0.94 implies amorphous and disordered structures in the carbon matrix. Similarly, ZnSe@C (ID/IG = 0.96) shows a character of amorphous carbon. In Fig. S4,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a larger BET specific surface area and pore volume (70.1 m2 g−1 and 0.46 cm3 g−1) than those of ZnSe@C (47.7 m2 g−1 and 0.32 cm3 g−1). The large specific surface area and hollow porous structure can increase the electrochemically active sites and the accessibility of the electrolyte for lithium and sodium storage and facilitate Li+/Na+ diffusion.\nThe XPS spectra can reveal useful details on the composition evolution on the surfaces of ZnSe/MoSe2@C (Fig. 5). Two typical peaks at around 1021.55 and 1044.7 eV are observed in Fig. 5a, representing Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and exhibiting characteristics of the Zn2+ selenidation state. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the signals of Mo 3d are resolved into three components at 228.7, 231.8 and 235.4 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 Mo 3d3/2 and Mo–O–C, respectively. Among them, the presence of the primary doublet peaks is trapped at around 228.7 and 231.8 eV, which confirms the existence of Mo4+ in MoSe2. Moreover, two peaks located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV are assigned, which are characteristic of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c. The signal areas were also investigated in the spectra of Se 3d by a deconvolution analysis. The result reveals that the area ratio of Se 3d5/2:Se 3d3/2 is 3:2, and the distance between two separated tracks is 0.9 eV. It can also be ascribed to the typical feature of Se2−, which corresponds to metal–selenium bonds of ZnSe and MoSe2. Three peaks at 284.5, 285.2, and 288.3 eV are recorded from the asymmetric C 1s peak, corresponding to C–C, C–OH/C–O–Mo, and CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 5d). Besides, the atomic content ratio of Zn and Mo in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is estimated to be ca. 1.5:1 through XPS measurements, and corresponds well to the result of EDS analysis. In addition, the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C was carried out on an elemental analyser (Elementar vario EL cube). According to the results of elemental analysis, the carbon contents are ca. 11.5 and 15.6 wt% for ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C, respectively (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S5,† the high-resolution spectra of N 1s showed that the N atom contained the forms of pyridinic N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 eV), and graphitic N (401.2 eV), indicating the existence of the N element in ZnSe/MoSe2@C. Based on the results of the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the N element content on the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite is ca. 6.76 wt%. The introduction of N doping can improve the surface wettability of the carbon composite with the electrolyte, and create more defects and active sites for lithium/sodium storage. The N species mainly derived from the ligand (2-methylimidazole).\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Li-ion batteries\nThe electrochemical properties of the anode were evaluated using half cells in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li+/Li (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the initial three CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. ZnSe/MoSe2@C reveals two obvious irreversible peaks at approximately 1.54 V and near 1.62 V, which belong to the transformation of lithium into interstitials in ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively, in the initial cathodic cycle. Two peaks at 0.87 and 0.59 V are attributed to the formation of Li2Se/Zn and the formation of Li2Se/Mo through further conversion of ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively. In the meantime, the growth of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) causes an initial irreversible capacity loss. The occurrence of the multi-step alloy reaction between Li and Zn is observed below 0.5 V. The slope shape is centered below 0.2 V, which is attributed to sectional Li+ insertion into the porous carbon. Several small oxidation peaks at 0.31 and 0.68 V are recorded, corresponding to the multi-step de-alloying reaction of LiZn alloys in the anodic process. Distinct peaks at 1.35 and 2.51 V can be attributed to the oxidation of Zn and Li2Se into ZnSe and the probable oxidation of Li2Se into selenium (from ZnSe). Meanwhile, the oxidation peak at 2.21 V represents the oxidation of Mo into MoSe2, accompanied by the conversion of LiSe into selenium (from MoSe2) at 1.85 V. The main cathodic peaks are obviously shifted to high potentials and become slightly wider during following cycles, probably because of architecture variation from the conversion reaction and the existence of pseudocapacitive behavior. The intensities and integral areas of peaks are much the same in subsequent laps, suggesting the good reversibility of lithium insertion/extraction reactions in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. The redox process of ZnSe/MoSe2@C can be formulated using multiple steps as in the following equations:\nZnSe:\nMoSe 2 :\nThe typical charge/discharge curves of ZnSe/MoSe2@C at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Li/Li+) are shown in Fig. 6b. The first discharge curve exhibits several small voltage plateaus. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode shows an initial discharge capacity of about 1031 mA h g−1. The capacity irreversibility within the first cycle is caused by the formation of the SEI layer and an irreversible reaction. In the subsequent cycles, the discharge slopes of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode are stable at around 0.5–0.01 V. Compared to that in the first cycle, the discharge capacity still reaches 1051 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, indicating the good reversibility of ZnSe/MoSe2@C during the charge and discharge process. It can be deduced that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C material is suitable to function as a negative electrode material for LIBs. It agrees well with the results of the CV curves, implying the exultant reversible performance.\nThe cycling performances at current densities of 0.2 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 7a and b. They reveal the superior cycling performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode compared to that of the ZnSe@C electrode for LIBs. Obviously, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers high capacities of 1051 mA h g−1 and 874 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 for 150 cycles and 200 cycles, respectively. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode shows relatively poor cycling performance. The discharge capacities are 361 and 490 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. As revealed, the superiority of ZnSe/MoSe2@C in terms of the rate capability is very apparent. Fig. 7c demonstrates that the reversible capacities of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are 701, 660, 538, 460 and 363 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. More strikingly, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode even maintains an increasing capacity of 859 mA h g−1 when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, implying its outstanding reversibility and cycling stability. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode delivered much lower capacities of 441, 297, 237, 202, 165 and 201 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The ZnSe@C electrode also displays a lower capacity of 333 mA h g−1 when the current density is further reduced stepwise to 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a superior stable capacity of 524 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 even after 600 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7d. Impressively, the initial coulombic efficiency of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode reaches 70% and nearly 92% in the 2nd cycle. With cycling, the CEs of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C anode are endearingly increased up to approximately 100% just after following several charge–discharge cycles. This should be beneficial for efficient permeation of the electrolyte and a fast multi-electron transfer process owing to the confinement of few layer MoSe2 cleverly around ZnSe nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix. These features underline the great potential of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as a promising anode for advanced LIBs with long-term cycling properties, especially at high rates.\nTo gain further insight into the reason for the high capacity, the CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 are recorded (Fig. 8a). The correlation of the storage system obeys the following two equations:\nwhere i is the peak current, v stands for the scan rate, and both a and b are regulable constant parameters. According to the relationship between logi and logv of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 8c), the adjustable b values were 0.71 (peak-1), 0.72 (peak-2), and 0.74 (peak-3), respectively, indicating the fast kinetics of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode, which results from the synergistic effects of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive behaviors. In contrast, Fig. 8b and d show lower calculated b values of 0.63 (peak-1), 0.31 (peak-2) and 0.52 (peak-3) for ZnSe@C electrodes. Therefore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode is allocated to the diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitance response, which gives rise to the increased capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C. The above results prove that gradual rising cycle curve of ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 7d) is ascribed to the partial pseudocapacitive contribution.\nIn general, to evaluate the deeper total contribution of the composite, the ratio of the capacitor capacity and diffusion-controlled capacity can be quantitatively calculated based on the following equation:\nwhere k1ν stands for the capacitance-controlled effects and k2ν1/2 corresponds to the diffusion-controlled insertion processes, respectively (Fig. 8e and f). As the scan rate of ν increased (from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1), the capacitive contribution of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode increased from 29%, 37%, 50%, 74% to 82% gradually. In comparison, the ZnSe@C electrode capacitive contributions are 4%, 12%, 18%, 30% and 36%, respectively. The results faithfully prove that few layered MoSe2 and the in situ generated porous carbon network effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode.\nTo analyze the underlying mechanism, EIS measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 9a, the EIS plots of two electrodes are constituted by the internal resistance (Rs), the impedance (Rf) of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge-transfer impedance (Rct).Table 1 shows that the charge transfer resistance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (32.5 Ω) is smaller than that of ZnSe@C (35.2 Ω) due to few layer MoSe2 being confined within the ZnSe–C hollow microsphere and the coated in situ generated carbon matrix, which could accelerate the electrolytic infiltration and diffusion of Li+. Then, for the skew line at the low frequency region, ZnSe/MoSe2@C displays the highest slope angle of the linear Warburg parts, indicating the enhanced ion/electrolyte reaction kinetic diffusion. The special structure could also prevent the volume expansion of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite during Li+ insertion/extraction, which aggressively improves the cycling stabilization of the electrode. The structural and mechanical stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite was confirmed by the SEM analysis of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode after a 50 cycle test at 0.2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 9b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite mainly retains its original morphology and microstructure. The result also reflects that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C sample possesses high reversible structure stability during the lithium storage processes.\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Na-ion batteries\nIn addition to the measurements in LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite also displays good cycling and rate performance for SIBs. The electrochemical properties of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite and the corresponding SIB test results are shown in Fig. 10.\nThe electrochemical reaction mechanism was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 10a). In the first cathodic cycle, the two weak peaks located at ca. 1.23 and 1.62 V can be attributed to the Na+ ion conversion from trigonal prismatic (2H) 2H-MoSe2 interlayers to an octahedral (1T) structure of NaxMoSe2. The formation of Mo/Na2Se results in the appearance of a peak at ca. 0.7 V, while Na+ ions further intercalate into MoSe2 layers. One irreversible peak at around 0.5 V is associated with the formation of the SEI because of the decomposition of the electrolyte. Another strong cathodic peak at ca. 0.28 V is recorded, corresponding to the conversion reaction of ZnSe into Zn/Na2Se, accompanied by the formation of a Na–Zn alloy. In the subsequent anodic scan, the two peaks are attributed to the de-alloying reaction of NaZn alloys (0.28 V) and regeneration of ZnSe (0.98 V). The broad peaks at 1.65 V accompanied by a shoulder at 2.06 V can be assigned to the existence of intermediates and oxidation of Mo into MoSe2. It is worth noting that partial anodic peaks shift to a high potential in the 2nd and 3rd CV cycles, implying that there is an activation process for the electroactive materials in the initial cycle. These CV curves except for the first cycle almost overlap with other, indicating the excellent reversibility. The peak shift in the CV curves matches well with voltage plateaus in the corresponding galvanostatic discharge and charge processes (Fig. 10b). As shown in Fig. 10(b and c), ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows similar low discharge plateaus at about 0.3 V, which corresponds well to the cathode curve in CV graphs. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 532 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Na/Na+). After 50 cycles, ZnSe/MoSe2@C maintains a large reversible capacity of 468 mA h g−1, which is one of the highest values for ZnSe-based anode materials for SIB applications reported so far.\nRate capability is another important aspect in anode materials for SIBs. The rate performances of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C are evaluated at different current densities from 0.1 to 4 A g−1 (Fig. 10d). The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits decent reversible capacities of 456, 389, 400, 376, 352, and 328 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1, respectively. These values are higher than the values of 439, 387, 343, 296, 248, and 196 mA h g−1 for the ZnSe@C electrode at the same current densities. Moreover, ZnSe/MoSe2@C even maintains an increasing capacity when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, revealing great reversibility and cycling stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. To examine the high-rate cycling stability, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode was further cycled at a high current density of 4 A g−1. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode retains an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency, corresponding to negligible capacity loss. The above results verify that ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibits better cycling and rate performance than the ZnSe@C electrode. The stability of the charge transfer process is well studied by EIS analysis within the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential (Fig. 10f), and is helpful in disclosing the reasons why the ZnSe/MoSe2@C Na-ion half-cell can maintain remarkable rate performance based on the electrochemistry. Impedance parameters from an equivalent circuit model are calculated, and they are similar to those of LIBs (Table 2). The Rct and Rf values of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are smaller than those of ZnSe@C before cycling. Moreover, the slant line of the relationship between Zw (real part of the impedance spectra) and ω−1/2 (angular frequency = 2πf) is closely related to the ion diffusion within the anode material. The Warburg coefficients σ are determined from Zwvs. ω−1/2 in the low frequency region. As shown in Fig. S6,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibited a lower slope than ZnSe@C, indicating the facilitation of ion transportation of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Thus, the existence of the hollow porous carbon matrix can improve the structural stability and electronic conductivity of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Such facile migration of Na+ in MOF-derived few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow sphere structure is decent. It demonstrates that a unique multi-component coordination can promote fast ion diffusion kinetics and increase the electrochemical conductivity.\nAs graphically illustrated in the schematic diagram (Scheme 2), lithium/sodium ions are partially stored on the surface of few-layer MoSe2 and the porous carbon matrix in a pseudocapacitive pattern. The rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere exhibits the distinctive high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. On one hand, the unique design theoretically ensures that the architecture efficiently alleviates the volume expansion during the charge–discharge process and prevents aggregation of nanoparticles. On the other hand, owing to the synergistic effect of various components, more capacity storage sites from few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nano-crystals can supply pseudocapacitance-type active sites and shorten the electron transfer paths, thereby enhancing the rate capability. The N doped well-connected carbon matrix can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode, and meanwhile prevent the nano-components from aggregation and pulverization upon long-term cycling and the high-rate charge–discharge process. Notably, the electrochemical performance of the novel few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere electrode is comparable with those of other previously reported related electrodes for LIBs/SIBs (Table S2†).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated by a self-assembly reaction and a post-selenization process. This novel nano-architecture surmounts the sluggish reaction kinetics and relieves the huge volume changes of the anode for LIBs/SIBs. Moreover, few-layer MoSe2 and the carbon matrix obtained by in situ carbonization provide a buffering mechanism and partial pseudocapacitance capacity contribution. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite exhibits a remarkable reversible capacity (1051 mA h g−1 at the 150th cycle) and long-term cycling stability (524 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 600 cycles). Notably, when used as the anode in SIBs, the initial coulombic efficiency can reach a value as high as 89%. Moreover, it delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 4 A g−1 even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. Therefore, we believe that such a strategy of MOF-based host–guest chemistry will exploit an effective avenue to design an advanced few-layer nanostructure confined within an ultra-small nanoparticle–porous carbon matrix nanocomposite for versatile applications, not only in LIBs/SIBs, but also in other fields such as potassium-ion batteries, sensors, electrocatalysts, etc.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

A CHNSO elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nFor the LIB test, 80 wt% active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), 10 wt% conductive agent (acetylene black) and 10 wt% binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed to obtain uniform slurries, followed by coating on copper foil. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 composed of EC, EMC and DMC with a ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v/v) and the metallic lithium foil served as the electrolyte and reference electrodes, respectively. For SIB test systems, the working electrode consists of active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), super-P and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in deionized water. Na foil and Whatman glass fiber were used as the reference electrode and the separator, respectively. 1 M NaPF6 in DIGYME = 100 vol% was used as the electrolyte. The test cells (CR2025) were kept in an argon-filled glovebox. The amount of the active material in test cells was ca. 1–2 mg. The area of the work electrode was about 1.1 cm2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and electrochemical performance were tested with a LAND CT2001A workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on an Ivium electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the same voltage window in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.\n\nCharacterization of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\nThe XRD patterns of two samples are shown in Fig. 1. The clear diffraction peaks located at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.5°, 65.8° and 72.6° can be indexed well to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) crystal planes of standard cubic ZnSe (JCPDS no. 65-9603). For ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the additional primary diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.4°, 37.9° and 55.9° can be indexed to the (100), (103) and (110) planes of MoSe2 (JCPDS no. 17-0887), respectively. The absence of the (002) plane of MoSe2 is probably due to the formation of a few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure, indicating the greatly suppressed stacking of layered MoS2. In addition, no impurity diffraction peak is observed, implying that the coexistence of ZnSe and MoSe2 was achieved by the transformation of polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs) in the customized cavities of ZIF-8 as a precursor.\nThe morphologies of the ZnSe@C and ZnSe/MoSe2@C samples are characterized by a series of characterization methods. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the ZnSe@C sample. It is composed of a well-defined polyhedral structure with an approximate size of 400 nm. In the case of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the structure of ZIF-8 is greatly changed with the addition of Mo-based POMs as a special stimulus guest. ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a uniform porous nanostructure with a relatively homogeneous distribution, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The SEM results provided valid evidence that a carbon-encapsulated hierarchical hollow porous structure was masterly fabricated by introducing PMA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3a and b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite shows an interior hollow architecture due to the utilization of Mo-based POMs as the guest and removal of excess organic solvent molecules during the selenization process. In this step, Zn2+ clusters react with Se to convert ZnSe nanoparticles and the Mo species in the precursor is reduced in situ from +6 to +4 to form a laminar MoSe2 phase synchronously. Moreover, ZnSe possesses the cubic crystal structure refined to the F3m space group. Besides, MoSe2, as a typical 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenide, exhibits an evident sandwich-like layered structure. Thus, we can clearly observe that few layered molybdenum selenide is uniformly embedded around small zinc selenide nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix (Fig. 3c). As depicted in Fig. 3d, the lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.17 nm match well with the (220) and (331) planes of ZnSe, respectively. Besides, the lattice fringe of MoSe2 is estimated to be 0.64 nm which is consistent with the (002) interlayer spacing. In addition, the particle size of ZnSe in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is ca. 10 nm. Meanwhile, it can also be noticed that the thickness of MoSe2 is about 1–4 layers, which is in accordance with the XRD result for the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite. Therefore, the absence of the (002) crystal plane of MoSe2 in Fig. 1 is due to well encapsulated MoSe2 in the carbon matrix and the few layer structure of MoSe2. Functional POMs are well suited to act as the flexible and tunable guest. Thus, Mo-based POMs play a special responsive role linked to ZIF-8, and employing polymetallic MOF co-precursors provides the extra space to finely harmonize the nanostructures. Besides, the SEM and TEM images of the precursor of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are shown in Fig. S1.† It is found that the hollow porous structure existed before the selenization process and was well maintained after the calcining process. Thereby, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C structure is obtained via continuous growth of PMA/ZIF-8 to derive few-layer MoSe2 around a ZnSe nanoparticle in the carbon matrix, as revealed by the SEM and TEM results, and is beneficial for the increase of surface chemical reactions, enlargement of ion storage sites and shortening of the diffusion paths. Moreover, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) image further provides evidence of the homogeneous distribution of Zn, Mo, Se and C elements (Fig. 4). These results reveal that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is composed of few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nanoparticles and is homogeneously confined in the porous carbon matrix. Meanwhile, EDS analysis demonstrates that the atomic ratio between Zn and Mo is around 1.42:1 (Fig. S2†).\nIn Raman spectra (Fig. S3†), two broad peaks of D and G bands at 1330 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are observed, which are generally assigned to a substantial defect or disordered site and the graphitic structure, respectively. The intensity ratios of the D and G peaks (ID/IG ratios) indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials. The ID/IG ratio of ZnSe/MoSe2@C of 0.94 implies amorphous and disordered structures in the carbon matrix. Similarly, ZnSe@C (ID/IG = 0.96) shows a character of amorphous carbon. In Fig. S4,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a larger BET specific surface area and pore volume (70.1 m2 g−1 and 0.46 cm3 g−1) than those of ZnSe@C (47.7 m2 g−1 and 0.32 cm3 g−1). The large specific surface area and hollow porous structure can increase the electrochemically active sites and the accessibility of the electrolyte for lithium and sodium storage and facilitate Li+/Na+ diffusion.\nThe XPS spectra can reveal useful details on the composition evolution on the surfaces of ZnSe/MoSe2@C (Fig. 5). Two typical peaks at around 1021.55 and 1044.7 eV are observed in Fig. 5a, representing Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and exhibiting characteristics of the Zn2+ selenidation state. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the signals of Mo 3d are resolved into three components at 228.7, 231.8 and 235.4 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 Mo 3d3/2 and Mo–O–C, respectively. Among them, the presence of the primary doublet peaks is trapped at around 228.7 and 231.8 eV, which confirms the existence of Mo4+ in MoSe2. Moreover, two peaks located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV are assigned, which are characteristic of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c. The signal areas were also investigated in the spectra of Se 3d by a deconvolution analysis. The result reveals that the area ratio of Se 3d5/2:Se 3d3/2 is 3:2, and the distance between two separated tracks is 0.9 eV. It can also be ascribed to the typical feature of Se2−, which corresponds to metal–selenium bonds of ZnSe and MoSe2. Three peaks at 284.5, 285.2, and 288.3 eV are recorded from the asymmetric C 1s peak, corresponding to C–C, C–OH/C–O–Mo, and CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 5d). Besides, the atomic content ratio of Zn and Mo in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is estimated to be ca. 1.5:1 through XPS measurements, and corresponds well to the result of EDS analysis. In addition, the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C was carried out on an elemental analyser (Elementar vario EL cube). According to the results of elemental analysis, the carbon contents are ca. 11.5 and 15.6 wt% for ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C, respectively (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S5,† the high-resolution spectra of N 1s showed that the N atom contained the forms of pyridinic N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 eV), and graphitic N (401.2 eV), indicating the existence of the N element in ZnSe/MoSe2@C. Based on the results of the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the N element content on the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite is ca. 6.76 wt%. The introduction of N doping can improve the surface wettability of the carbon composite with the electrolyte, and create more defects and active sites for lithium/sodium storage. The N species mainly derived from the ligand (2-methylimidazole).\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Li-ion batteries\nThe electrochemical properties of the anode were evaluated using half cells in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li+/Li (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the initial three CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. ZnSe/MoSe2@C reveals two obvious irreversible peaks at approximately 1.54 V and near 1.62 V, which belong to the transformation of lithium into interstitials in ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively, in the initial cathodic cycle. Two peaks at 0.87 and 0.59 V are attributed to the formation of Li2Se/Zn and the formation of Li2Se/Mo through further conversion of ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively. In the meantime, the growth of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) causes an initial irreversible capacity loss. The occurrence of the multi-step alloy reaction between Li and Zn is observed below 0.5 V. The slope shape is centered below 0.2 V, which is attributed to sectional Li+ insertion into the porous carbon. Several small oxidation peaks at 0.31 and 0.68 V are recorded, corresponding to the multi-step de-alloying reaction of LiZn alloys in the anodic process. Distinct peaks at 1.35 and 2.51 V can be attributed to the oxidation of Zn and Li2Se into ZnSe and the probable oxidation of Li2Se into selenium (from ZnSe). Meanwhile, the oxidation peak at 2.21 V represents the oxidation of Mo into MoSe2, accompanied by the conversion of LiSe into selenium (from MoSe2) at 1.85 V. The main cathodic peaks are obviously shifted to high potentials and become slightly wider during following cycles, probably because of architecture variation from the conversion reaction and the existence of pseudocapacitive behavior. The intensities and integral areas of peaks are much the same in subsequent laps, suggesting the good reversibility of lithium insertion/extraction reactions in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. The redox process of ZnSe/MoSe2@C can be formulated using multiple steps as in the following equations:\nZnSe:\nMoSe 2 :\nThe typical charge/discharge curves of ZnSe/MoSe2@C at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Li/Li+) are shown in Fig. 6b. The first discharge curve exhibits several small voltage plateaus. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode shows an initial discharge capacity of about 1031 mA h g−1. The capacity irreversibility within the first cycle is caused by the formation of the SEI layer and an irreversible reaction. In the subsequent cycles, the discharge slopes of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode are stable at around 0.5–0.01 V. Compared to that in the first cycle, the discharge capacity still reaches 1051 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, indicating the good reversibility of ZnSe/MoSe2@C during the charge and discharge process. It can be deduced that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C material is suitable to function as a negative electrode material for LIBs. It agrees well with the results of the CV curves, implying the exultant reversible performance.\nThe cycling performances at current densities of 0.2 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 7a and b. They reveal the superior cycling performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode compared to that of the ZnSe@C electrode for LIBs. Obviously, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers high capacities of 1051 mA h g−1 and 874 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 for 150 cycles and 200 cycles, respectively. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode shows relatively poor cycling performance. The discharge capacities are 361 and 490 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. As revealed, the superiority of ZnSe/MoSe2@C in terms of the rate capability is very apparent. Fig. 7c demonstrates that the reversible capacities of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are 701, 660, 538, 460 and 363 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. More strikingly, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode even maintains an increasing capacity of 859 mA h g−1 when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, implying its outstanding reversibility and cycling stability. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode delivered much lower capacities of 441, 297, 237, 202, 165 and 201 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The ZnSe@C electrode also displays a lower capacity of 333 mA h g−1 when the current density is further reduced stepwise to 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a superior stable capacity of 524 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 even after 600 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7d. Impressively, the initial coulombic efficiency of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode reaches 70% and nearly 92% in the 2nd cycle. With cycling, the CEs of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C anode are endearingly increased up to approximately 100% just after following several charge–discharge cycles. This should be beneficial for efficient permeation of the electrolyte and a fast multi-electron transfer process owing to the confinement of few layer MoSe2 cleverly around ZnSe nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix. These features underline the great potential of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as a promising anode for advanced LIBs with long-term cycling properties, especially at high rates.\nTo gain further insight into the reason for the high capacity, the CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 are recorded (Fig. 8a). The correlation of the storage system obeys the following two equations:\nwhere i is the peak current, v stands for the scan rate, and both a and b are regulable constant parameters. According to the relationship between logi and logv of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 8c), the adjustable b values were 0.71 (peak-1), 0.72 (peak-2), and 0.74 (peak-3), respectively, indicating the fast kinetics of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode, which results from the synergistic effects of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive behaviors. In contrast, Fig. 8b and d show lower calculated b values of 0.63 (peak-1), 0.31 (peak-2) and 0.52 (peak-3) for ZnSe@C electrodes. Therefore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode is allocated to the diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitance response, which gives rise to the increased capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C. The above results prove that gradual rising cycle curve of ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 7d) is ascribed to the partial pseudocapacitive contribution.\nIn general, to evaluate the deeper total contribution of the composite, the ratio of the capacitor capacity and diffusion-controlled capacity can be quantitatively calculated based on the following equation:\nwhere k1ν stands for the capacitance-controlled effects and k2ν1/2 corresponds to the diffusion-controlled insertion processes, respectively (Fig. 8e and f). As the scan rate of ν increased (from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1), the capacitive contribution of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode increased from 29%, 37%, 50%, 74% to 82% gradually. In comparison, the ZnSe@C electrode capacitive contributions are 4%, 12%, 18%, 30% and 36%, respectively. The results faithfully prove that few layered MoSe2 and the in situ generated porous carbon network effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode.\nTo analyze the underlying mechanism, EIS measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 9a, the EIS plots of two electrodes are constituted by the internal resistance (Rs), the impedance (Rf) of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge-transfer impedance (Rct).Table 1 shows that the charge transfer resistance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (32.5 Ω) is smaller than that of ZnSe@C (35.2 Ω) due to few layer MoSe2 being confined within the ZnSe–C hollow microsphere and the coated in situ generated carbon matrix, which could accelerate the electrolytic infiltration and diffusion of Li+. Then, for the skew line at the low frequency region, ZnSe/MoSe2@C displays the highest slope angle of the linear Warburg parts, indicating the enhanced ion/electrolyte reaction kinetic diffusion. The special structure could also prevent the volume expansion of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite during Li+ insertion/extraction, which aggressively improves the cycling stabilization of the electrode. The structural and mechanical stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite was confirmed by the SEM analysis of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode after a 50 cycle test at 0.2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 9b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite mainly retains its original morphology and microstructure. The result also reflects that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C sample possesses high reversible structure stability during the lithium storage processes.\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Na-ion batteries\nIn addition to the measurements in LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite also displays good cycling and rate performance for SIBs. The electrochemical properties of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite and the corresponding SIB test results are shown in Fig. 10.\nThe electrochemical reaction mechanism was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 10a). In the first cathodic cycle, the two weak peaks located at ca. 1.23 and 1.62 V can be attributed to the Na+ ion conversion from trigonal prismatic (2H) 2H-MoSe2 interlayers to an octahedral (1T) structure of NaxMoSe2. The formation of Mo/Na2Se results in the appearance of a peak at ca. 0.7 V, while Na+ ions further intercalate into MoSe2 layers. One irreversible peak at around 0.5 V is associated with the formation of the SEI because of the decomposition of the electrolyte. Another strong cathodic peak at ca. 0.28 V is recorded, corresponding to the conversion reaction of ZnSe into Zn/Na2Se, accompanied by the formation of a Na–Zn alloy. In the subsequent anodic scan, the two peaks are attributed to the de-alloying reaction of NaZn alloys (0.28 V) and regeneration of ZnSe (0.98 V). The broad peaks at 1.65 V accompanied by a shoulder at 2.06 V can be assigned to the existence of intermediates and oxidation of Mo into MoSe2. It is worth noting that partial anodic peaks shift to a high potential in the 2nd and 3rd CV cycles, implying that there is an activation process for the electroactive materials in the initial cycle. These CV curves except for the first cycle almost overlap with other, indicating the excellent reversibility. The peak shift in the CV curves matches well with voltage plateaus in the corresponding galvanostatic discharge and charge processes (Fig. 10b). As shown in Fig. 10(b and c), ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows similar low discharge plateaus at about 0.3 V, which corresponds well to the cathode curve in CV graphs. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 532 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Na/Na+). After 50 cycles, ZnSe/MoSe2@C maintains a large reversible capacity of 468 mA h g−1, which is one of the highest values for ZnSe-based anode materials for SIB applications reported so far.\nRate capability is another important aspect in anode materials for SIBs. The rate performances of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C are evaluated at different current densities from 0.1 to 4 A g−1 (Fig. 10d). The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits decent reversible capacities of 456, 389, 400, 376, 352, and 328 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1, respectively. These values are higher than the values of 439, 387, 343, 296, 248, and 196 mA h g−1 for the ZnSe@C electrode at the same current densities. Moreover, ZnSe/MoSe2@C even maintains an increasing capacity when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, revealing great reversibility and cycling stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. To examine the high-rate cycling stability, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode was further cycled at a high current density of 4 A g−1. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode retains an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency, corresponding to negligible capacity loss. The above results verify that ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibits better cycling and rate performance than the ZnSe@C electrode. The stability of the charge transfer process is well studied by EIS analysis within the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential (Fig. 10f), and is helpful in disclosing the reasons why the ZnSe/MoSe2@C Na-ion half-cell can maintain remarkable rate performance based on the electrochemistry. Impedance parameters from an equivalent circuit model are calculated, and they are similar to those of LIBs (Table 2). The Rct and Rf values of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are smaller than those of ZnSe@C before cycling. Moreover, the slant line of the relationship between Zw (real part of the impedance spectra) and ω−1/2 (angular frequency = 2πf) is closely related to the ion diffusion within the anode material. The Warburg coefficients σ are determined from Zwvs. ω−1/2 in the low frequency region. As shown in Fig. S6,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibited a lower slope than ZnSe@C, indicating the facilitation of ion transportation of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Thus, the existence of the hollow porous carbon matrix can improve the structural stability and electronic conductivity of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Such facile migration of Na+ in MOF-derived few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow sphere structure is decent. It demonstrates that a unique multi-component coordination can promote fast ion diffusion kinetics and increase the electrochemical conductivity.\nAs graphically illustrated in the schematic diagram (Scheme 2), lithium/sodium ions are partially stored on the surface of few-layer MoSe2 and the porous carbon matrix in a pseudocapacitive pattern. The rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere exhibits the distinctive high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. On one hand, the unique design theoretically ensures that the architecture efficiently alleviates the volume expansion during the charge–discharge process and prevents aggregation of nanoparticles. On the other hand, owing to the synergistic effect of various components, more capacity storage sites from few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nano-crystals can supply pseudocapacitance-type active sites and shorten the electron transfer paths, thereby enhancing the rate capability. The N doped well-connected carbon matrix can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode, and meanwhile prevent the nano-components from aggregation and pulverization upon long-term cycling and the high-rate charge–discharge process. Notably, the electrochemical performance of the novel few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere electrode is comparable with those of other previously reported related electrodes for LIBs/SIBs (Table S2†).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The solution was poured into 40 mL of DMF solution containing 0.3284 g (4 mmol) of 2-methylimidazole, subsequently. After stirring for 24 h, the precipitates were washed several times with ethanol solution and deionized water.\nFor the conversion of MOFs to the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite, a certain amount of a precursor (PMA/ZIF-8) was uniformly mixed with selenium powder, and the sample was annealed at 600 °C for 6 h under a 5% H2/95% Ar flow at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. For comparison, the ZnSe@C nanocomposite was prepared by a similar approach without adding the phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (see Scheme 1).\n\nCharacterization\nThe crystal phases of the samples were observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using filtered Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV. The samples were placed in a glass table and the data were analyzed in the range of 10–80°. The morphology characterization of the samples was conducted using SEM (Hitachi 8100) and TEM (FEI F20 S-TWIN). Raman (DXR2xi) were performed with a laser at wavelength of 532 nm and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were tested on a BELSORP-mini type BET analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an ESCALAB MARK II spherical analyzer with Kα radiation as the X-ray source. A CHNSO elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nFor the LIB test, 80 wt% active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), 10 wt% conductive agent (acetylene black) and 10 wt% binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed to obtain uniform slurries, followed by coating on copper foil. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 composed of EC, EMC and DMC with a ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v/v) and the metallic lithium foil served as the electrolyte and reference electrodes, respectively. For SIB test systems, the working electrode consists of active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), super-P and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in deionized water. Na foil and Whatman glass fiber were used as the reference electrode and the separator, respectively. 1 M NaPF6 in DIGYME = 100 vol% was used as the electrolyte. The test cells (CR2025) were kept in an argon-filled glovebox. The amount of the active material in test cells was ca. 1–2 mg. The area of the work electrode was about 1.1 cm2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and electrochemical performance were tested with a LAND CT2001A workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on an Ivium electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the same voltage window in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.\n\nCharacterization of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\nThe XRD patterns of two samples are shown in Fig. 1. The clear diffraction peaks located at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.5°, 65.8° and 72.6° can be indexed well to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) crystal planes of standard cubic ZnSe (JCPDS no. 65-9603). For ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the additional primary diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.4°, 37.9° and 55.9° can be indexed to the (100), (103) and (110) planes of MoSe2 (JCPDS no. 17-0887), respectively. The absence of the (002) plane of MoSe2 is probably due to the formation of a few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure, indicating the greatly suppressed stacking of layered MoS2. In addition, no impurity diffraction peak is observed, implying that the coexistence of ZnSe and MoSe2 was achieved by the transformation of polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs) in the customized cavities of ZIF-8 as a precursor.\nThe morphologies of the ZnSe@C and ZnSe/MoSe2@C samples are characterized by a series of characterization methods. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the ZnSe@C sample. It is composed of a well-defined polyhedral structure with an approximate size of 400 nm. In the case of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the structure of ZIF-8 is greatly changed with the addition of Mo-based POMs as a special stimulus guest. ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a uniform porous nanostructure with a relatively homogeneous distribution, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The SEM results provided valid evidence that a carbon-encapsulated hierarchical hollow porous structure was masterly fabricated by introducing PMA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3a and b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite shows an interior hollow architecture due to the utilization of Mo-based POMs as the guest and removal of excess organic solvent molecules during the selenization process. In this step, Zn2+ clusters react with Se to convert ZnSe nanoparticles and the Mo species in the precursor is reduced in situ from +6 to +4 to form a laminar MoSe2 phase synchronously. Moreover, ZnSe possesses the cubic crystal structure refined to the F3m space group. Besides, MoSe2, as a typical 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenide, exhibits an evident sandwich-like layered structure. Thus, we can clearly observe that few layered molybdenum selenide is uniformly embedded around small zinc selenide nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix (Fig. 3c). As depicted in Fig. 3d, the lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.17 nm match well with the (220) and (331) planes of ZnSe, respectively. Besides, the lattice fringe of MoSe2 is estimated to be 0.64 nm which is consistent with the (002) interlayer spacing. In addition, the particle size of ZnSe in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is ca. 10 nm. Meanwhile, it can also be noticed that the thickness of MoSe2 is about 1–4 layers, which is in accordance with the XRD result for the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite. Therefore, the absence of the (002) crystal plane of MoSe2 in Fig. 1 is due to well encapsulated MoSe2 in the carbon matrix and the few layer structure of MoSe2. Functional POMs are well suited to act as the flexible and tunable guest. Thus, Mo-based POMs play a special responsive role linked to ZIF-8, and employing polymetallic MOF co-precursors provides the extra space to finely harmonize the nanostructures. Besides, the SEM and TEM images of the precursor of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are shown in Fig. S1.† It is found that the hollow porous structure existed before the selenization process and was well maintained after the calcining process. Thereby, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C structure is obtained via continuous growth of PMA/ZIF-8 to derive few-layer MoSe2 around a ZnSe nanoparticle in the carbon matrix, as revealed by the SEM and TEM results, and is beneficial for the increase of surface chemical reactions, enlargement of ion storage sites and shortening of the diffusion paths. Moreover, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) image further provides evidence of the homogeneous distribution of Zn, Mo, Se and C elements (Fig. 4). These results reveal that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is composed of few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nanoparticles and is homogeneously confined in the porous carbon matrix. Meanwhile, EDS analysis demonstrates that the atomic ratio between Zn and Mo is around 1.42:1 (Fig. S2†).\nIn Raman spectra (Fig. S3†), two broad peaks of D and G bands at 1330 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are observed, which are generally assigned to a substantial defect or disordered site and the graphitic structure, respectively. The intensity ratios of the D and G peaks (ID/IG ratios) indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials. The ID/IG ratio of ZnSe/MoSe2@C of 0.94 implies amorphous and disordered structures in the carbon matrix. Similarly, ZnSe@C (ID/IG = 0.96) shows a character of amorphous carbon. In Fig. S4,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a larger BET specific surface area and pore volume (70.1 m2 g−1 and 0.46 cm3 g−1) than those of ZnSe@C (47.7 m2 g−1 and 0.32 cm3 g−1). The large specific surface area and hollow porous structure can increase the electrochemically active sites and the accessibility of the electrolyte for lithium and sodium storage and facilitate Li+/Na+ diffusion.\nThe XPS spectra can reveal useful details on the composition evolution on the surfaces of ZnSe/MoSe2@C (Fig. 5). Two typical peaks at around 1021.55 and 1044.7 eV are observed in Fig. 5a, representing Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and exhibiting characteristics of the Zn2+ selenidation state. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the signals of Mo 3d are resolved into three components at 228.7, 231.8 and 235.4 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 Mo 3d3/2 and Mo–O–C, respectively. Among them, the presence of the primary doublet peaks is trapped at around 228.7 and 231.8 eV, which confirms the existence of Mo4+ in MoSe2. Moreover, two peaks located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV are assigned, which are characteristic of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c. The signal areas were also investigated in the spectra of Se 3d by a deconvolution analysis. The result reveals that the area ratio of Se 3d5/2:Se 3d3/2 is 3:2, and the distance between two separated tracks is 0.9 eV. It can also be ascribed to the typical feature of Se2−, which corresponds to metal–selenium bonds of ZnSe and MoSe2. Three peaks at 284.5, 285.2, and 288.3 eV are recorded from the asymmetric C 1s peak, corresponding to C–C, C–OH/C–O–Mo, and CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 5d). Besides, the atomic content ratio of Zn and Mo in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is estimated to be ca. 1.5:1 through XPS measurements, and corresponds well to the result of EDS analysis. In addition, the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C was carried out on an elemental analyser (Elementar vario EL cube). According to the results of elemental analysis, the carbon contents are ca. 11.5 and 15.6 wt% for ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C, respectively (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S5,† the high-resolution spectra of N 1s showed that the N atom contained the forms of pyridinic N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 eV), and graphitic N (401.2 eV), indicating the existence of the N element in ZnSe/MoSe2@C. Based on the results of the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the N element content on the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite is ca. 6.76 wt%. The introduction of N doping can improve the surface wettability of the carbon composite with the electrolyte, and create more defects and active sites for lithium/sodium storage. The N species mainly derived from the ligand (2-methylimidazole).\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Li-ion batteries\nThe electrochemical properties of the anode were evaluated using half cells in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li+/Li (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the initial three CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. ZnSe/MoSe2@C reveals two obvious irreversible peaks at approximately 1.54 V and near 1.62 V, which belong to the transformation of lithium into interstitials in ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively, in the initial cathodic cycle. Two peaks at 0.87 and 0.59 V are attributed to the formation of Li2Se/Zn and the formation of Li2Se/Mo through further conversion of ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively. In the meantime, the growth of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) causes an initial irreversible capacity loss. The occurrence of the multi-step alloy reaction between Li and Zn is observed below 0.5 V. The slope shape is centered below 0.2 V, which is attributed to sectional Li+ insertion into the porous carbon. Several small oxidation peaks at 0.31 and 0.68 V are recorded, corresponding to the multi-step de-alloying reaction of LiZn alloys in the anodic process. Distinct peaks at 1.35 and 2.51 V can be attributed to the oxidation of Zn and Li2Se into ZnSe and the probable oxidation of Li2Se into selenium (from ZnSe). Meanwhile, the oxidation peak at 2.21 V represents the oxidation of Mo into MoSe2, accompanied by the conversion of LiSe into selenium (from MoSe2) at 1.85 V. The main cathodic peaks are obviously shifted to high potentials and become slightly wider during following cycles, probably because of architecture variation from the conversion reaction and the existence of pseudocapacitive behavior. The intensities and integral areas of peaks are much the same in subsequent laps, suggesting the good reversibility of lithium insertion/extraction reactions in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. The redox process of ZnSe/MoSe2@C can be formulated using multiple steps as in the following equations:\nZnSe:\nMoSe 2 :\nThe typical charge/discharge curves of ZnSe/MoSe2@C at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Li/Li+) are shown in Fig. 6b. The first discharge curve exhibits several small voltage plateaus. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode shows an initial discharge capacity of about 1031 mA h g−1. The capacity irreversibility within the first cycle is caused by the formation of the SEI layer and an irreversible reaction. In the subsequent cycles, the discharge slopes of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode are stable at around 0.5–0.01 V. Compared to that in the first cycle, the discharge capacity still reaches 1051 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, indicating the good reversibility of ZnSe/MoSe2@C during the charge and discharge process. It can be deduced that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C material is suitable to function as a negative electrode material for LIBs. It agrees well with the results of the CV curves, implying the exultant reversible performance.\nThe cycling performances at current densities of 0.2 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 7a and b. They reveal the superior cycling performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode compared to that of the ZnSe@C electrode for LIBs. Obviously, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers high capacities of 1051 mA h g−1 and 874 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 for 150 cycles and 200 cycles, respectively. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode shows relatively poor cycling performance. The discharge capacities are 361 and 490 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. As revealed, the superiority of ZnSe/MoSe2@C in terms of the rate capability is very apparent. Fig. 7c demonstrates that the reversible capacities of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are 701, 660, 538, 460 and 363 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. More strikingly, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode even maintains an increasing capacity of 859 mA h g−1 when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, implying its outstanding reversibility and cycling stability. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode delivered much lower capacities of 441, 297, 237, 202, 165 and 201 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The ZnSe@C electrode also displays a lower capacity of 333 mA h g−1 when the current density is further reduced stepwise to 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a superior stable capacity of 524 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 even after 600 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7d. Impressively, the initial coulombic efficiency of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode reaches 70% and nearly 92% in the 2nd cycle. With cycling, the CEs of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C anode are endearingly increased up to approximately 100% just after following several charge–discharge cycles. This should be beneficial for efficient permeation of the electrolyte and a fast multi-electron transfer process owing to the confinement of few layer MoSe2 cleverly around ZnSe nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix. These features underline the great potential of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as a promising anode for advanced LIBs with long-term cycling properties, especially at high rates.\nTo gain further insight into the reason for the high capacity, the CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 are recorded (Fig. 8a). The correlation of the storage system obeys the following two equations:\nwhere i is the peak current, v stands for the scan rate, and both a and b are regulable constant parameters. According to the relationship between logi and logv of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 8c), the adjustable b values were 0.71 (peak-1), 0.72 (peak-2), and 0.74 (peak-3), respectively, indicating the fast kinetics of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode, which results from the synergistic effects of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive behaviors. In contrast, Fig. 8b and d show lower calculated b values of 0.63 (peak-1), 0.31 (peak-2) and 0.52 (peak-3) for ZnSe@C electrodes. Therefore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode is allocated to the diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitance response, which gives rise to the increased capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C. The above results prove that gradual rising cycle curve of ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 7d) is ascribed to the partial pseudocapacitive contribution.\nIn general, to evaluate the deeper total contribution of the composite, the ratio of the capacitor capacity and diffusion-controlled capacity can be quantitatively calculated based on the following equation:\nwhere k1ν stands for the capacitance-controlled effects and k2ν1/2 corresponds to the diffusion-controlled insertion processes, respectively (Fig. 8e and f). As the scan rate of ν increased (from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1), the capacitive contribution of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode increased from 29%, 37%, 50%, 74% to 82% gradually. In comparison, the ZnSe@C electrode capacitive contributions are 4%, 12%, 18%, 30% and 36%, respectively. The results faithfully prove that few layered MoSe2 and the in situ generated porous carbon network effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode.\nTo analyze the underlying mechanism, EIS measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 9a, the EIS plots of two electrodes are constituted by the internal resistance (Rs), the impedance (Rf) of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge-transfer impedance (Rct).Table 1 shows that the charge transfer resistance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (32.5 Ω) is smaller than that of ZnSe@C (35.2 Ω) due to few layer MoSe2 being confined within the ZnSe–C hollow microsphere and the coated in situ generated carbon matrix, which could accelerate the electrolytic infiltration and diffusion of Li+. Then, for the skew line at the low frequency region, ZnSe/MoSe2@C displays the highest slope angle of the linear Warburg parts, indicating the enhanced ion/electrolyte reaction kinetic diffusion. The special structure could also prevent the volume expansion of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite during Li+ insertion/extraction, which aggressively improves the cycling stabilization of the electrode. The structural and mechanical stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite was confirmed by the SEM analysis of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode after a 50 cycle test at 0.2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 9b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite mainly retains its original morphology and microstructure. The result also reflects that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C sample possesses high reversible structure stability during the lithium storage processes.\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Na-ion batteries\nIn addition to the measurements in LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite also displays good cycling and rate performance for SIBs. The electrochemical properties of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite and the corresponding SIB test results are shown in Fig. 10.\nThe electrochemical reaction mechanism was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 10a). In the first cathodic cycle, the two weak peaks located at ca. 1.23 and 1.62 V can be attributed to the Na+ ion conversion from trigonal prismatic (2H) 2H-MoSe2 interlayers to an octahedral (1T) structure of NaxMoSe2. The formation of Mo/Na2Se results in the appearance of a peak at ca. 0.7 V, while Na+ ions further intercalate into MoSe2 layers. One irreversible peak at around 0.5 V is associated with the formation of the SEI because of the decomposition of the electrolyte. Another strong cathodic peak at ca. 0.28 V is recorded, corresponding to the conversion reaction of ZnSe into Zn/Na2Se, accompanied by the formation of a Na–Zn alloy. In the subsequent anodic scan, the two peaks are attributed to the de-alloying reaction of NaZn alloys (0.28 V) and regeneration of ZnSe (0.98 V). The broad peaks at 1.65 V accompanied by a shoulder at 2.06 V can be assigned to the existence of intermediates and oxidation of Mo into MoSe2. It is worth noting that partial anodic peaks shift to a high potential in the 2nd and 3rd CV cycles, implying that there is an activation process for the electroactive materials in the initial cycle. These CV curves except for the first cycle almost overlap with other, indicating the excellent reversibility. The peak shift in the CV curves matches well with voltage plateaus in the corresponding galvanostatic discharge and charge processes (Fig. 10b). As shown in Fig. 10(b and c), ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows similar low discharge plateaus at about 0.3 V, which corresponds well to the cathode curve in CV graphs. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 532 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Na/Na+). After 50 cycles, ZnSe/MoSe2@C maintains a large reversible capacity of 468 mA h g−1, which is one of the highest values for ZnSe-based anode materials for SIB applications reported so far.\nRate capability is another important aspect in anode materials for SIBs. The rate performances of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C are evaluated at different current densities from 0.1 to 4 A g−1 (Fig. 10d). The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits decent reversible capacities of 456, 389, 400, 376, 352, and 328 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1, respectively. These values are higher than the values of 439, 387, 343, 296, 248, and 196 mA h g−1 for the ZnSe@C electrode at the same current densities. Moreover, ZnSe/MoSe2@C even maintains an increasing capacity when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, revealing great reversibility and cycling stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. To examine the high-rate cycling stability, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode was further cycled at a high current density of 4 A g−1. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode retains an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency, corresponding to negligible capacity loss. The above results verify that ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibits better cycling and rate performance than the ZnSe@C electrode. The stability of the charge transfer process is well studied by EIS analysis within the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential (Fig. 10f), and is helpful in disclosing the reasons why the ZnSe/MoSe2@C Na-ion half-cell can maintain remarkable rate performance based on the electrochemistry. Impedance parameters from an equivalent circuit model are calculated, and they are similar to those of LIBs (Table 2). The Rct and Rf values of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are smaller than those of ZnSe@C before cycling. Moreover, the slant line of the relationship between Zw (real part of the impedance spectra) and ω−1/2 (angular frequency = 2πf) is closely related to the ion diffusion within the anode material. The Warburg coefficients σ are determined from Zwvs. ω−1/2 in the low frequency region. As shown in Fig. S6,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibited a lower slope than ZnSe@C, indicating the facilitation of ion transportation of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Thus, the existence of the hollow porous carbon matrix can improve the structural stability and electronic conductivity of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Such facile migration of Na+ in MOF-derived few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow sphere structure is decent. It demonstrates that a unique multi-component coordination can promote fast ion diffusion kinetics and increase the electrochemical conductivity.\nAs graphically illustrated in the schematic diagram (Scheme 2), lithium/sodium ions are partially stored on the surface of few-layer MoSe2 and the porous carbon matrix in a pseudocapacitive pattern. The rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere exhibits the distinctive high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. On one hand, the unique design theoretically ensures that the architecture efficiently alleviates the volume expansion during the charge–discharge process and prevents aggregation of nanoparticles. On the other hand, owing to the synergistic effect of various components, more capacity storage sites from few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nano-crystals can supply pseudocapacitance-type active sites and shorten the electron transfer paths, thereby enhancing the rate capability. The N doped well-connected carbon matrix can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode, and meanwhile prevent the nano-components from aggregation and pulverization upon long-term cycling and the high-rate charge–discharge process. Notably, the electrochemical performance of the novel few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere electrode is comparable with those of other previously reported related electrodes for LIBs/SIBs (Table S2†).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

It is obvious that the rGO agglomerates together and large-sized SnO2/rGO blocks can be observed in the H-SnO2/rGO composite. After the addition of the ionic liquid [BMIM]N(CN)2, a more uniform 2D flake-like morphology was obtained due to the stabilization effect of [Bmim]N(CN)2 for rGO during the hydrothermal process (Fig. 1a and b). On the one hand, the [Bmim] cation can be attracted by the anion groups of the GO layers. The electrostatic interaction between positive [Bmim] and negative GO facilitates the insertion of [Bmim]N(CN)2 between GO layers, leading to the better dispersion of GO. On the other hand, [Bmim]N(CN)2 plays a great role as a surfactant, which helps to inhibit the aggregation of the SnO2 nanoparticles during the hydrothermal process, leading to an ultrafine morphology of the obtained IL-SnO2/N-rGO as shown in Fig. 1d. The particle size distribution is shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. S2† with H-SnO2/rGO (Fig. 1f) as a comparison. It is obvious that the average particle size of IL-SnO2/N-rGO is 3–7 nm, while that of the SnO2 nanoparticles in H-SnO2/rGO mainly ranges between 5 and 9 nm. The smaller-sized structure might be more favorable for the high rate capability due to its ultrafine particle sizes with a shorter transport distance for e− and Na+ transport as well as a larger electrode/electrolyte area. Moreover, the smaller particle size will benefit the kinetics of the electrode by increasing the faradaic reactions occurring at the surface of the material. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 1c also shows the detailed morphology of SnO2 nanoparticles on the rGO sheets. It can be observed that SnO2 nanoparticles uniformly anchored on the N-rGO sheets. Notably, the tightly wrapped rGO on SnO2 can act as a buffer layer to alleviate the volume expansion during the charge/discharge process, leading to an impressive cycling stability. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO were investigated as shown in Fig. 1h and Fig. S1c,† respectively. The interplanar spacings of 0.335 nm and 0.264 nm are attributed to the (110) and (101) planes of SnO2. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1g) further demonstrates the polycrystalline structure of SnO2 and all diffraction rings are indexed to the diffraction peaks of the (110), (101), (211) and (301) planes in the rutile SnO2 phase. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 1i) confirm the uniform distribution of C, N, O, and Sn elements in the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite.\nThe composition and crystal structure of the prepared IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO composites were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 2a. It is clear that all the diffraction peaks of both IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO are well-indexed to the rutile structure of SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445). For the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite, broader and lower intensity peaks can be observed than those of the H-SnO2/rGO composite, indicating the smaller size of SnO2 particles in the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite. Although diffraction peaks for N-rGO were not observed obviously in XRD, the existence of N-rGO could be verified using the Raman spectra in Fig. 2b. Two peaks located at 1345 and 1585 cm−1 are attributed to the disorder-induced D and graphitic G bands of reduced graphene oxide. The intensity ratios of the D band and G band (ID/IG) for IL-SnO2/N-rGO (1.30) and H-SnO2/rGO (1.45) are both higher than that of GO (0.85), indicating the successful reduction of GO. Notably, the ID/IG reflects the crystallinity of carbon materials. The lower ID/IG ratio (1.30) of IL-SnO2/N-rGO indicates the higher crystallinity of rGO than that of H-SnO2/rGO (1.45), which can effectively enhance the kinetics of the electrode.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to further clarify the chemical structure and the chemical bonding configuration of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO (Fig. S3†), with IL-N-rGO (Fig. S4†) as the control material synthesized by the same ionic liquid assisted process but without SnO2. As shown in Fig. 2c, the survey spectrum of IL-SnO2/N-rGO demonstrates the presence of Sn, O, C and N elements. Two peaks located at 495.2 eV and 486.7 eV in Fig. 2d are ascribed to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 for SnO2 in the composite, which is also observed in H-SnO2/rGO (Fig. S3b†). Fig. 2e shows the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s, in which five peaks at 284.3 eV, 284.9 eV, 285.8 eV, 287.6 eV and 288.5 eV can be assigned to C–C, CN, C–N, CO and O–CO, respectively. The existence of CN and C–N indicates the polymerization of N(CN)2 anions during the hydrothermal and calcination processes. Furthermore, the high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in Fig. 2f displays four peaks, which correspond to NC (398.5 eV) in the cyclic structure, pyridinic N (399.6 eV), pyrrolic N (400.2 eV) and quaternary structure N (400.8 eV), respectively. It is notable that the N of CN in the cyclic structure/–CN and pyridinic N are primary types in the composite, also indicating its polymerization under high temperature conditions. The similar high-resolution spectra of C and N in IL-N-rGO (Fig. S4†) also demonstrate the great role of the N(CN)2 anions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were adopted to further study the structural configuration of IL-SnO2/N-rGO. As shown in Fig. 2g, the characteristic peaks of –CH3 (2926 cm−1), –CH2– (2853 cm−1), CC (1633 cm−1), C–N (1568 and 1465 cm−1) and CN (1314 cm−1) can be observed in IL-SnO2/N-rGO, which can be assigned to N-rGO. It is worth mentioning that the content of N in the composite is evaluated to be 12.6 at% from the XPS data. The high content of N doping will enable a surface-controlled process, which will ensure the pseudocapacitive Na+ storage contribution. Then, the total contents of SnO2 in IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shown in Fig. 2i. The TGA curve of H-SnO2/rGO displays two stages of weight loss. The weight loss of 1.1% below 100 °C is due to the removal of absorbed water, and the subsequent loss of 18.4% can be assigned to the combustion of rGO in the composite. Correspondingly, IL-SnO2/N-rGO shows a different TGA curve. The weight of absorbed water is about 1.3% and the weight of N-rGO is about 34.6%, which is higher than that of H-SnO2/rGO. The increased weight of rGO and the different loss curve both demonstrate the introduction of the N element and the polymerization of the N(CN)2 anions. Nitrogen isothermal adsorption/desorption measurements (Fig. S5†) were performed to further study the porous structure of IL-SnO2/N-rGO, H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO. It can be observed that H-SnO2/rGO exhibits a different isothermal curve from IL-SnO2/N-rGO and IL-N-rGO. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller calculation shows that the specific surface areas of IL-SnO2/N-rGO, H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO are 43.2 m2 g−1, 31.1 m2 g−1, and 40.9 m2 g−1, respectively. The higher surface area indicates the introduction of polymerized N(CN)2 anions. Pore size distributions were further analyzed by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT). Both IL-SnO2/N-rGO and IL-N-rGO possess a broad distribution in the mesopore range. Correspondingly, H-SnO2/rGO displays a narrow pore size centered at 5 nm. The higher surface area and wide distribution of mesopores are also desired for a fast kinetics of Na+ storage.\nThe electrochemical properties of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anode electrode in sodium ion batteries were first evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharge/charge tests in the voltage range of 0.005–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). In the first cathodic scanning, the reduction peaks ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 V can be attributed to the formation of an irreversible solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) and the irreversible conversion reaction of SnO2 to Sn. The reduction peaks between 0.5 V and 0.005 V are assigned to the alloying reaction of Na+ and Sn to NaxSn. Subsequently, wider peaks can be observed from 1.0 to 0.2 V, which could be attributed to the multi-step alloying reaction between Na and Sn. In addition, we noted that H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO did not exhibit obvious peaks between 1.0 and 0.2 V, indicating their poor electrochemical performances (Fig. S6 and S7†). In the anodic scanning, two obvious peaks located at 0.6 V and 1.2 V can be observed which are assigned to the reversible oxidation of Sn. The galvanostatic discharge/charge test displays a similar electrochemical process as CV curves. As displayed in Fig. S8,† IL-SnO2/N-rGO exhibits a high irreversible capacity in the initial cycle which can be attributed to the formation of the SEI and the irreversible conversion reaction of SnO2 to Sn. The low coulombic efficiency might be reduced by designing heterostructures, modifying the electrode, or adding electrolyte additives to suppress the formation of the SEI. From the second cycle, the charge and discharge capacities decrease to 449 mA h g−1 and 541.5 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.92%. The almost overlapped profiles in the following two cycles demonstrate its impressive reversibility (Fig. 3b).\nThe rate capability of SnO2/N-rGO for SIBs is then evaluated from 0.05 A g−1 to 2 A g−1 with H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO as a comparison as shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. S9.† It is apparent that the capacities of H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO decline rapidly as the current density increases (only 34.5 mA h g−1 80 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, respectively). By contrast, IL-SnO2/N-rGO exhibits much higher specific capacities of 494.6 mA h g−1, 427.8 mA h g−1, 377 mA h g−1, and 310 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 A g−1, respectively. Even at a high current density of 2 A g−1, SnO2/N-rGO still delivers a high capacity of 261.8 mA h g−1. It is noteworthy that when the current density returns to 50 mA g−1, a discharge capacity recovers to as high as 535.3 mA h g−1, indicating the good stability of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anode. The cycling stability of the electrode material is another significant parameter for performance judgment and it was evaluated at 500 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 3d. It can be observed that even at a rate of 500 mA g−1, a reversible capacity close to 189 mA h g−1 (ca. a decay of 0.264 mA h g−1 per cycle) was still obtained after 500 cycles, indicating the impressive cycling stabilities of IL-SnO2/rGO.\nThe structure stabilities were examined by ex SEM for the IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO electrodes after 30 cycles, respectively. As shown in Fig. S12 (a) and (b),† the cycled IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite retained its pristine morphology and no obvious cracks and agglomeration were observed on the surface of the material. However, the SEM image of H-SnO2/rGO shows that the electrode structure was severely damaged and the material aggregates together during cycling. The above analysis results further demonstrated the good connections between SnO2 particles and rGO in the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite. The uniform distribution of SnO2 on N-rGO could maintain the structure stabilities and the existence of the N-graphene layer can act as the buffer layer to accommodate the volume change of SnO2, resulting in excellent cycling and rate performance in sodium ion batteries.\nIn order to figure out its high-rate and long-life performance, we studied the redox pseudocapacitance contribution in both IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO electrodes by investigating the kinetics of the electrode based on CV tests. As shown in Fig. 4a, the CV curves of IL-SnO2/N-rGO exhibit a uniform shape for Na+ insertion/extraction processes from 0.1 mV s−1 to 1 mV s−1, indicating the same electrochemical reactions. The pseudocapacitive effect brought by the N-doped graphene and ultrafine nanoparticles was revealed by analyzing the b value using the i = avb formula. The b value can be obtained from the slope of the logi − logv plots. Typically, b = 0.5 indicates a diffusion-controlled process, while b = 1.0 represents a capacitive process. As shown in Fig. 4b, the b value of IL-SnO2/N-rGO is as high as 0.91 and 0.87 for peak 1 and peak 2, respectively, suggesting the high ratio of the contribution of capacitive processes. Moreover, we studied other b values at different potentials as shown in Fig. S11.† It is obvious that IL-SnO2/N-rGO shows higher b values than that of H-SnO2/rGO, revealing the more rapid reaction rate of IL-SnO2/N-rGO. The capacitive contributions at different scan rates were further quantified by using the formula i = k1v + k2v1/2. Based on the quantification, the capacitive contribution of 74% at 0.1 mV s−1 can be obtained and the percentage enlarges with the increased scan rate as shown in Fig. 4c. When the scan rate increases to 1 mV s−1, the contribution increased to 89% as revealed from the red region in Fig. 4d. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further employed to demonstrate the fast kinetics of IL-SnO2/N-rGO. Fig. S12† shows the Nyquist plots at open circuit voltages in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 mHz. Both plots are made up of a semicircle and a straight line. The diameter of the semicircle in the high-frequency region reveals the charge transfer resistance, of which we can see a lower value in IL-SnO2/N-rGO compared to that in H-SnO2/N-rGO. Moreover, the straight line in the low-frequency region can be attributed to the Warburg impedance. The steeper slope presents a nearly ideal capacitive behavior in IL-SnO2/N-rGO, indicating a characteristic of superior Na+ diffusion.\nIn consideration of the impressive performance of IL-SnO2/N-rGO in half batteries, a full SIB cell was assembled using IL-SnO2/N-rGO as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF, a theoretical capacity of 130 mA h g−1) as the cathode. Fig. 5a shows the galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles of IL-SnO2/N-rGO and NVPOF electrodes in half cells and the assembled full cell. The full cell was cycled in the range of 1.0–4.2 V and shows an average output voltage of around 2.5 V. The rate performance shown in Fig. 5b reveals that capacities of 270 mA h g−1 at 0.12 A g−1, 210 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1, 183 mA h g−1 at 0.6 A g−1, 159 mA h g−1 at 1.2 A g−1 and 133 mA h g−1 at 2.4 A g−1 are obtained. The cycling performance of the full cell at 0.3 A g−1 was evaluated as shown in Fig. 5c. It can be seen that the full cell keeps a specific capacity of 156.8 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, with a capacity retention of 74.3%. The above results proved the feasibility of the practical use of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anode.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The prepared graphene oxide was dispersed in moderate deionized water to form a graphene oxide suspension (15 mg mL−1). Then, 6 ml ionic liquid ([BMIM]N(CN)2) was added into the above GO suspension to form a homogeneous solution mixture (IL-GO suspension) under ultrasonication. At the same time, 0.225 g SnCl2·2H2O was dissolved in 3 ml deionized water by agitating. Then, SnCl2 solution was dropped into the IL-GO suspension slowly and after that, the resulting solution mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature on a magnetic stirrer. The final solution was poured into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept for 12 h at 180 °C. A black solid product was collected by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water several times. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum conditions, the precursor was calcined at 500 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere in a tube furnace. H-SnO2/rGO was prepared without an ionic liquid for comparison. IL-N-rGO was prepared without adding SnCl2·2H2O.\n\nMaterial characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared materials. The surface morphology and structure of the prepared material were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on a Nova Nano SEM 450 and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on a Tecnai G2 F30. Raman spectra were obtained using a Raman spectrometer (a Digilab FTS3500). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed on an ESCALAB250 electron spectrometer under the measurement conditions of Al Kα radiation (15 kV, 150 W, 500 μm). Thermogravimetric (TG) data were obtained using the DSC1 instrument under air from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nThe electrode was obtained by mixing 70% active material, 20% Super P as a conducting agent and 10% polyvinylidene fluoride as a binder in moderate N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP). The obtained slurry was coated on a copper foil and then the electrode was dried at 80 °C and kept for 16 h under vacuum. The loading mass of active materials in each electrode is around 2.0–2.5 mg cm−2. And the specific capacity in our work was calculated based on the mass of the SnO2/rGO composite. The half cells were assembled with the as-prepared electrode as the working electrode, glass fiber as the separator, sodium as the counter/reference electrode and 1 M NaClO4 in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte in an argon-filled glove box (O2 ≦ 0.1 ppm, H2O ≦ 0.1 ppm). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out between 0.005 and 3 V on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at different scan rates. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument in the potential window of 0.005–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). The electrochemical impedance was tested on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at an amplitude voltage of 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\nFor the Na-ion full cell tests, Na3V2(PO4)2O2F was used as the cathode material. The cathode was prepared by mixing 70% Na3V2(PO4)2O2F material, 20 wt% acetylene black, and 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) dissolved in deionized water. Then, the slurry was pasted on aluminum foil. The preparation process of the anode for the full cell is the same as the electrode for the half cell while the binder was replaced by 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The mass ratio of the cathode to anode was 3:1. Before full-cell fabrication, all anodes should be pre-sodiated chemically. The pre-sodiation for the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anodes can stabilize the electrode surface and activate the materials. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument between 1.0 and 4.2 V.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The obtained slurry was coated on a copper foil and then the electrode was dried at 80 °C and kept for 16 h under vacuum. The loading mass of active materials in each electrode is around 2.0–2.5 mg cm−2. And the specific capacity in our work was calculated based on the mass of the SnO2/rGO composite. The half cells were assembled with the as-prepared electrode as the working electrode, glass fiber as the separator, sodium as the counter/reference electrode and 1 M NaClO4 in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte in an argon-filled glove box (O2 ≦ 0.1 ppm, H2O ≦ 0.1 ppm). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out between 0.005 and 3 V on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at different scan rates. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument in the potential window of 0.005–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). The electrochemical impedance was tested on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at an amplitude voltage of 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\nFor the Na-ion full cell tests, Na3V2(PO4)2O2F was used as the cathode material. The cathode was prepared by mixing 70% Na3V2(PO4)2O2F material, 20 wt% acetylene black, and 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) dissolved in deionized water. Then, the slurry was pasted on aluminum foil. The preparation process of the anode for the full cell is the same as the electrode for the half cell while the binder was replaced by 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The mass ratio of the cathode to anode was 3:1. Before full-cell fabrication, all anodes should be pre-sodiated chemically. The pre-sodiation for the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anodes can stabilize the electrode surface and activate the materials. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument between 1.0 and 4.2 V.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The prepared graphene oxide was dispersed in moderate deionized water to form a graphene oxide suspension (15 mg mL−1). Then, 6 ml ionic liquid ([BMIM]N(CN)2) was added into the above GO suspension to form a homogeneous solution mixture (IL-GO suspension) under ultrasonication. At the same time, 0.225 g SnCl2·2H2O was dissolved in 3 ml deionized water by agitating. Then, SnCl2 solution was dropped into the IL-GO suspension slowly and after that, the resulting solution mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature on a magnetic stirrer. The final solution was poured into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept for 12 h at 180 °C. A black solid product was collected by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water several times. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum conditions, the precursor was calcined at 500 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere in a tube furnace. H-SnO2/rGO was prepared without an ionic liquid for comparison. IL-N-rGO was prepared without adding SnCl2·2H2O.\n\nMaterial characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared materials. The surface morphology and structure of the prepared material were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on a Nova Nano SEM 450 and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on a Tecnai G2 F30.

In the first step, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, glucose, and melamine were annealed at 800 °C to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. The XRD pattern is displayed in Fig. 1a, in which the diffraction peaks are in good accordance with metallic Co. Then, CoS2@GC@B-CNT was acquired after thermal treatment via a sulfidation process. From the XRD pattern of CoS2@GC@B-CNT (Fig. 2a), the major peaks of CoS2@GC@B-CNT corresponded to CoS2. The wide diffraction peak at 26.1° is observed and corresponds to the (002) plane of graphite. The morphology of the carbon nanotubes is unchanged before and after the sulfidation process (Fig. 1b and 2b). The TEM images confirm that CoS2 nanoparticles are completely encapsulated in B-CNT (Fig. 2c and d) and the void in the B-CNT could buffer the volume change of CoS2 in the course of the conversion reaction. Furthermore, B-CNT could provide facile electronic and ionic transport, improving the conductivity of the material. Fig. 2e shows that the CoS2 nanoparticles are surrounded by GC, and the lattice spacing of 0.247 and 0.226 nm associate with the interplanar distance of the (210) and (211) planes, respectively. In the meantime, the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm ascribes to the interplanar distance of the (002) plane of carbon. The GC originating from the catalysis of Co nanocrystals during the thermal treatment can improve the electrical conductivity and prevent the agglomeration of CoS2 nanoparticles. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 2f) further demonstrate that the CoS2 nanoparticles were encapsulated in B-CNT. The carbon content in CoS2@GC@B-CNT is confirmed to be 41.9% (Fig. 3). For comparison, bare CoS2 particles and CoS2 composite mixed with commercial CNT (CoS2/CNT) were prepared and the XRD patterns are displayed in Fig. S1.† To characterize the porous structure in detail, N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out (Fig. 4). The Co@GC@B-CNT possesses a mesoporous structure and the size of the majority of pores is about 2.0 nm (Fig. 4a). After the sulfidation process, the pore size distribution curve of the CoS2@GC@B-CNT displays that the pore size of samples is about 3.5 nm (Fig. 4b). The increased pore volume is due to the etching effect of H2S derived from thiourea decomposition during the sulfidation process, which can expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, contributing to the sodiation/desodiation process.\nThe surface chemistry of CoS2@GC@B-CNT was analysed by XPS (Fig. S2†). The Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 5a) is divided into two groups of peaks. The first group of peaks at 779.2, 780.0, and 781.4 eV is associated with the spin–orbit peaks of Co 2p3/2. The peak at 779.2 eV is assigned to Co2+ and 781.4 eV is put down to the satellite peak of Co 2p3/2. Additionally, the peak at 780.0 eV is attributed to the existence of Co–NH bonds. Another group of peaks at 795.0 is assigned to the Co 2p1/2 level and 799.0 eV corresponds to its satellite peak. The S 2p spectrum is made up of two peaks (Fig. 5b), the peak at 163.6 eV is assigned to S 2p3/2, while the peak at 164.8 eV is contributed by S 2p1/2. The C 1s spectrum includes two fitting peaks (Fig. 5c); they are C–C (284.8 eV) and C–N (285.8 eV). On the basis of XPS analysis, it can be confirmed that CoS2 nanoparticles have been favorably prepared, which is unanimous in the previous XRD and TEM analyses. Fig. 5d shows that the N 1s spectrum evinces the attendance of pyridinic (399.3 eV), pyrrolic (400.0 eV) and graphitic (401.9 eV) types of N. N doping could introduce more defective sites, which boost the sodium storage performance.\nThe CV test of CoS2@GC@B-CNT was conducted at 0.2 mV s−1 (Fig. S3†). The oxidation and reduction peaks are presented in the first cycle. The oxidation peaks are put down to the production of NaxCoS2 and CoS2. Moreover, the reduction peaks in the first cycle are different from those in the later cycles, which mainly ascribes to the activation process. In the second and third cycles, the peaks (0.89 and 1.36 V) stem from the conversion reaction (CoS2 + 4Na → Co + 2Na2S) and the peak at 0.52 V implies that Na+ intercalates into the GC. Fig. 6a displays first three charge and discharge curves. CoS2@GC@B-CNT delivers a reversible capacity of about 550 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. To clarify the capacity contribution of B-CNT, CoS2@GC@B-CNT was treated by an acid to remove CoS2. The XRD pattern (Fig. S4a†) shows that most of the CoS2 particles were removed by HCl and the morphology of the carbon nanotubes is not varied (Fig. S4b†). The electrochemical performance of individual B-CNT was measured at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S4c and d†); the capacity was approximately 150 mA h g−1 during 100 cycles. The carbon content of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is 41.9% (Fig. 3). Through calculation, the capacity contribution of carbon is about 62 mA h g−1, which indicates that the main capacity of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is contributed to CoS2. In Fig. 6b and S5,† the cycling performances of CoS2@GC@B-CNT, CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 are measured at 0.1 A g−1. It is obvious that the cycling stability of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is the best among them. The CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 present significant capacity fading during cycling, which indicates that CoS2 is the main capacity source of CoS2@GC@B-CNT.\nFig. 6c shows the rate performance of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. CoS2@GC@B-CNT shows the discharge capacities of 564.3, 518.5, 486.5, 471.0, 455.9, 438.0, 419.6 mA h g−1 at the rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The CoS2@GC@B-CNT electrode can hold 512.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Fig. 6d displays the relevant charge and discharge curves of CoS2@GC@B-CNT, which suggests its superior rate capability. In contrast, CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 electrodes show much lower capacities (Fig. S6†). The CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 samples retained capacities of 58.9 and 36.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. Fig. 6e exhibits a long-term cycling property of CoS2@GC@B-CNT, which demonstrates a capacity of 432.6 mA h g−1 after 900 cycles at 5 A g−1 and the capacity retention of 95.9%. In particular, the electrochemical property of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is eminent among other cobalt sulfide-based electrodes in the carbonate ester-based electrolyte for SIBs (Table S1†). The outstanding electrochemical performance is ascribed to the novel structure design of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. The synergetic actions of GC and B-CNT can improve the electrical conductivity, prevent the particle agglomeration and maintain structural stability of CoS2@GC@B-CNT during the sodiation/desodiation process. The EIS tests were investigated before and after different numbers of cycles. The Nyquist plots of the CoS2@GC@B-CNT electrode exhibit a semicircle and a following linear slope (Fig. 7). The semicircle region ascribes to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The Rct decreases after 50 cycles. Furthermore, after 100 cycles, the Rct displays just a small increase, suggesting a stable structure and good conductivity of the electrode. The reason can be ascribed to the composite electrode decorated with GC and B-CNT.\nTo investigate the cause of the good cycling stability of CoS2@GC@B-CNT electrode, the cells were disassembled at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. The CoS2@GC@B-CNT sustains structural integrity (Fig. 8a), further confirming the outstanding cycling performance of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. The detailed inner structure is shown in Fig. 8b where the CoS2 nanoparticles are encapsulated in B-CNT. Fig. 8c displays that the CoS2 nanoparticles are still surrounded by GC, which confirms that GC is stable during the charge/discharge process. Therefore, high stability is observed due to the double protection of GC and B-CNT. The elemental mapping images give the elemental distribution of Co, S, and C, which indicates that the CoS2 particles are still encapsulated in B-CNT (Fig. 8d). In contrast, CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 present large volume expansion during the sodiation/desodiation process (Fig. S7†), which results in poor electrochemical properties.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.8 g), glucose (0.1 g) and melamine (8.0 g) were blended together in 50 mL deionized water under stirring for 1 h. The solution was dried at 80 °C for 1 h and annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in Ar gas to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. Then, 0.1 g of Co@GC@B-CNT and an appropriate amount of thiourea were placed in two separate crucible boats and treated at 450 °C for 4 h with thiourea at the upstream side in the pipe furnace under Ar atmosphere. In order to prepare B-CNT, the CoS2@GC@B-CNT samples were treated in 6.0 M HCl solution for 8 h under stirring, washed by deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To gain bare CoS2, 1.0 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and an appropriate amount of thiourea powder were annealed by the same protocol as for the synthesis of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. For the CoS2/CNT composite, 0.0581 g CoS2 was mixed with 0.0419 g commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe structures were detected through an XRD (Bruker D8 Advanced) operated within the 2θ range of 10–70°. The percentage of carbon in CoS2@GC@B-CNT was measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis. The samples were oxidized and annealed from 30 to 850 °C in air by a TG equipment (NETZSCH STA44C). The morphology was studied by SEM (HITACHI-SU8220) and TEM (JEM-2100F) with an EDS elemental mapping. XPS was tested by an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Analyzer ASAP 2460 equipment.\n\nElectrochemical tests\nThe anode electrodes were obtained by mixing the active material, Super-P and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 by weight). The slurry was coated on a Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of active materials based on the total weight of CoS2 and carbon was about 1.0–1.5 mg cm−2. The separator was a Whatman (GF/B) glass fiber. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (v/v = 1:1) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate. Sodium discs were the opposite electrode. Coin cells (CR 2032) were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox. Constant current charge/discharge measurements were checked on a battery test station (Neware Electronic Co.) from 0.01 to 3.00 V. CV was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760D) between 0.01 and 3.00 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1.

First, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.8 g), glucose (0.1 g) and melamine (8.0 g) were blended together in 50 mL deionized water under stirring for 1 h. The solution was dried at 80 °C for 1 h and annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in Ar gas to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. Then, 0.1 g of Co@GC@B-CNT and an appropriate amount of thiourea were placed in two separate crucible boats and treated at 450 °C for 4 h with thiourea at the upstream side in the pipe furnace under Ar atmosphere. In order to prepare B-CNT, the CoS2@GC@B-CNT samples were treated in 6.0 M HCl solution for 8 h under stirring, washed by deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To gain bare CoS2, 1.0 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and an appropriate amount of thiourea powder were annealed by the same protocol as for the synthesis of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. For the CoS2/CNT composite, 0.0581 g CoS2 was mixed with 0.0419 g commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe structures were detected through an XRD (Bruker D8 Advanced) operated within the 2θ range of 10–70°. The percentage of carbon in CoS2@GC@B-CNT was measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis. The samples were oxidized and annealed from 30 to 850 °C in air by a TG equipment (NETZSCH STA44C). The morphology was studied by SEM (HITACHI-SU8220) and TEM (JEM-2100F) with an EDS elemental mapping. XPS was tested by an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Analyzer ASAP 2460 equipment.\n\nElectrochemical tests\nThe anode electrodes were obtained by mixing the active material, Super-P and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 by weight). The slurry was coated on a Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of active materials based on the total weight of CoS2 and carbon was about 1.0–1.5 mg cm−2. The separator was a Whatman (GF/B) glass fiber. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (v/v = 1:1) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate. Sodium discs were the opposite electrode. Coin cells (CR 2032) were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox. Constant current charge/discharge measurements were checked on a battery test station (Neware Electronic Co.) from 0.01 to 3.00 V. CV was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760D) between 0.01 and 3.00 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1.

First, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.8 g), glucose (0.1 g) and melamine (8.0 g) were blended together in 50 mL deionized water under stirring for 1 h. The solution was dried at 80 °C for 1 h and annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in Ar gas to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. Then, 0.1 g of Co@GC@B-CNT and an appropriate amount of thiourea were placed in two separate crucible boats and treated at 450 °C for 4 h with thiourea at the upstream side in the pipe furnace under Ar atmosphere. In order to prepare B-CNT, the CoS2@GC@B-CNT samples were treated in 6.0 M HCl solution for 8 h under stirring, washed by deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To gain bare CoS2, 1.0 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and an appropriate amount of thiourea powder were annealed by the same protocol as for the synthesis of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. For the CoS2/CNT composite, 0.0581 g CoS2 was mixed with 0.0419 g commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe structures were detected through an XRD (Bruker D8 Advanced) operated within the 2θ range of 10–70°. The percentage of carbon in CoS2@GC@B-CNT was measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis. The samples were oxidized and annealed from 30 to 850 °C in air by a TG equipment (NETZSCH STA44C). The morphology was studied by SEM (HITACHI-SU8220) and TEM (JEM-2100F) with an EDS elemental mapping. XPS was tested by an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Analyzer ASAP 2460 equipment.\n\nElectrochemical tests\nThe anode electrodes were obtained by mixing the active material, Super-P and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 by weight). The slurry was coated on a Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of active materials based on the total weight of CoS2 and carbon was about 1.0–1.5 mg cm−2. The separator was a Whatman (GF/B) glass fiber. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (v/v = 1:1) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate. Sodium discs were the opposite electrode. Coin cells (CR 2032) were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox. Constant current charge/discharge measurements were checked on a battery test station (Neware Electronic Co.) from 0.01 to 3.00 V. CV was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760D) between 0.01 and 3.00 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. EIS was performed at frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 MHz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Hard carbon is widely recognized as one of the most attractive and ideal anode materials for SIBs. However, the potential required for sodium ions to insert into hard carbon is very close to that for sodium plating, resulting in sodium dendrites, which raise safety concerns. Moreover, the reaction of electrode materials with sodium through alloying or conversion mechanisms always results in serious volume changes in the process of sodium insertion and extraction. Therefore, insertion-type transition-metal oxides as anodes have attracted much attention owing to their suitable operating potentials and minor volume expansion. Recently, embedded titanium/vanadium/molybdenum based oxides with layered structures have been studied as anode materials for SIBs, such as layered Na2Ti3O7, tunnel Na2Ti6O13 ( ) and spinel Li4Ti5O12. In addition, post-spinel structured materials have been proposed, which show ultra-stable cycle performances via highly reversible sodium-ion insertion/desertion through large-size tunnels. Recently, in Zhou's group, NaVSnO4 ( ) and NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 ( ) have been prepared and they have been shown to possess robust cycle lifetimes (more than 10000 cycles) and discharge plateaus of 0.84 V and 0.7 V, respectively. Meanwhile, in our group, Na0.76Mn0.48Ti0.44O2 has been developed, which holds an initial discharge capacity of 103.4 mAh g−1, shows a superb rate capability and retains 74.9% capacity after 600 cycles. The large radius of the redox active metal center could optimize the tunnel size and thus boosting the electrochemical performance. It is also a big challenge to find further suitable active centers for insertion-type transition metal oxides as anodes of SIBs. Besides, a host of published reports have said that germanium-based materials can be used as alloy anodes for SIBs with highly reversible sodium storage properties and satisfactory ionic/electronic conductivity. However, it is unclear to us whether Ge could act as an active center in a transition-metal oxide anodes.\nIn this work, we fabricated a tunnel-type NaGe3/2Mn1/2O4 (NGMO) material. When used as the anode of SIBs, it delivers a sustained discharge capacity of 200.32 mAh g−1. Compared with NaVSnO4 ( ) and NaV1.25Ti0.75O4, NGMO delivers a lower safety voltage of 0.36 V. Pure Na4Ge9O20 (NGO) as a comparative sample, only exhibits a capacity of 24.8 mAh g−1, which is far inferior to that of NGMO. During discharge and charge process, reversible redox reactions around Ge center occur, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The introduction of Mn in the NGMO improves the reversibility of the Ge redox performance.\nThe structure of NGMO was carefully characterized by XRD, and Rietveld refinement was performed as depicted in Fig. 1. The main Bragg peaks of NGMO could be assigned to space groups of P1(2) and I41/a(88), which were fitted to give lattice parameters of a = 10.56/15.04 Å, b = 11.18/15.04 Å, and c = 9.22/7.39 Å, and a volume of 811.2/1672.2 Å3, respectively. Na4Ge9O20 has a typical tunnel structure, which consists of polymerized Ge/MnO4 tetrahedra connected with Ge/MnO6 octahedra. Four Ge/MnO6 octahedra are connected together by sharing edges to form a tetrameric (Ge/Mn)4O16 cluster. Each cluster is connected to six GeO4 tetrahedra, and adjacent clusters are connected by GeO4 tetrahedra. Na atoms are located in the channels and have elongated Na–O bonds. This highly stable crystal structure can effectively accelerate the migration of sodium ions. Fig. 2 shows the low and high magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of NGMO, which is composed of particles of different sizes from 1 to 3 μm; the larger particles are the result of sintering at high temperature. SEM images of NGO with different magnifications are given in Fig. S1,† and show that the average particle size of NGO is 1 μm.\nThe morphology and fine structure were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3a and b show the low magnification TEM images. It can be seen from the images that NGMO has an irregular sheet-like morphology with particle sizes from 250 nm to 2 μm. As shown in Fig. 3c, the lattice spacing of the (200) plane is 4.55 Å. In the SAED pattern of Fig. 3d, the red line corresponds to the (020) plane in NGMO, and the lattice spacing is 13.100 Å. These results clearly demonstrate that NGMO exhibits good crystallinity. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results, and Raman and infrared spectra (IR) are provided in Table S1 and Fig. S2.† The results indicate that the atomic ratio of Na:Ge:Mn is close to 1:1.5:0.5 and that there is little sodium loss. The Raman and IR peaks in the high frequency region are attributed to stretching vibrations of Ge–O–Ge and the peaks between 600 and 400 cm−1 are attributed to the bending vibrations of Ge–O–Ge in NGMO.\nGalvanostatic electrochemical measurements were evaluated in a voltage range of 0.05–2.0 V, with the current density of 20 mA g−1. Fig. 4a and b show the discharge and charge profiles of NGMO and NGO, respectively. Because of the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in the initial cycle, the electrochemical behaviour tends stabilize in the second cycle, so voltage profiles are given from the second cycle; the first cycles of the discharge–charge curves of NGMO and NGO materials are given in Fig. S3.† It can be seen intuitively that both NGMO and NGO have low voltage platforms, while NGMO has the smaller polarization. In Fig. 4a, we notice a reversible voltage profile in the second cycle with discharge capacity of 200.32 mAh g−1 for NGMO. Only NGMO has a flat potential platform and delivers an ultra-low plateau potential. It can be seen from Fig. 4b that NGO shows a capacity of 24.8 mAh g−1, obvious polarization at the 20th cycle and increased capacity due to the surface side-effect. Fig. 4c indicates that the capacity retention of the NGMO electrode after 50 cycles is 86.2%, which is superior to that of NGO; the coulombic efficiency of NGMO is also provided in Fig. S4.† To further understand the redox reactions along with the discharge/charge process in NGMO, Fig. 4d displays the differential capacity versus voltage (dQ/dV) curve. The clear anodic peak at 0.33 V and cathodic peak at 0.81 V correspond well with the redox reactions of NGMO.\nThe electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of fresh and cycled electrodes of NGMO and NGO, with a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz, are shown in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5a, it is obvious that the charge-transfer resistance of the fresh NGMO electrode is lower than that of NGO. This indicates that the migration of charges in the NGMO material occurs more easily than in NGO, which also facilitates the shifting of ions on the surface and inside of the electrodes of NGMO. In Fig. 5b, NGMO electrode in its 10th cycle exhibits a smaller charge-transfer resistance than both NGO and the NGMO fresh electrode, indicating that the surface of NGMO more readily forms a stable SEI film. The EIS results were fitted by the model shown in Fig. S5.† The fitting results are provided in Table S2.† The resistances of the fresh and cycled electrodes of NGMO and NGO are composed of an internal resistance (Rs), the resistance of the surface film (SEI) (Rf; a small semicircle in the high frequency region), the resistance of the charge transfer (Rct; another opposite semicircle in the middle frequency region), and the Warburg resistance (W; an oblique line in the low frequency region). Both the fresh and cycled electrodes of NGMO deliver lower charge transfer resistance than NGO. Meanwhile, the transfer resistance of the cycled NGMO electrode is lower than that of the fresh electrode and its slope at low frequency is higher than that of the fresh one (Table S2†). All these results show that NGMO has lower resistance and better electronic/ionic conductivity than NGO.\nThe evolution of the chemical valence states of the 150-times discharged electrodes were observed by XPS and SEM as provided in Fig. S6.† It is generally clear that the electrode surface was covered with a thick SEI layer after discharging. Ar plasma etching was used to obtain the internal information. The Ge 3d core-level of the discharged NGMO electrode with and without etching is shown in Fig. S7.† Before etching, the peaks of the Ge 3d core-level could be fitted to Ge1+ and Ge2+. After etching, (Fig. S7c†), the peaks at 30.8 eV and 30.2 eV were also associated with Ge1+ and Ge2+, respectively. This result indicates that the valence of Ge decreases as a whole and that there is no obvious difference between the etched and non-etched samples. The reversible redox reactions of Ge remain stable even after cycling. Meanwhile, the Mn 2p core-level spectra are shown in Fig. S7d–f.† For the Mn 2p core level, owing to the spin orbit coupling, the valence states of Mn comprise two couples including Mn3+ and Mn2+ (Fig. S7e and f†). The binding energies of Mn3+ are 642.37 eV and 654.04 eV, and the binding energies of Mn2+ are 640.71 eV and 652.18 eV. Similarly, after discharging, the binding energies of Mn3+ are 642.40 eV and 654.06 eV, and those for Mn2+ are 640.69 eV and 652.20 eV, indicating that there are no changes in Mn binding energies before and after etching. This is in good agreement with results in previous reports. All results also show that a thin SEI layer has been formed, favoring ions transfer on the repeatedly cycled electrode. It can be seen from the refined XRD results that NGMO consists of Ge4+, Mn2+ and Mn3+, and combined with XPS analysis, the results show that the valence states of Mn does not change for the discharged NGMO electrode. Ge displays electrochemical activity in NGMO, and Mn exhibits good chemical stability in the framework.\n\n\nConclusions\nTunnel-type NGMO has been prepared and investigated as an anode for SIBs for the first time. The discharge/charge curve shows an ultra-low operating potential and high capacity. The second discharge capacity of NGMO reaches 200.32 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, while pure NGO only delivers a capacity of 24.8 mAh g−1. Ge is involved in redox reactions in NGMO upon Na insertion/extraction, and the valence state of the Mn element experiences no change during discharging and charging. The Mn serves as a stabilizer in the framework during cycling; the introduction of Mn can significantly boost the reversible Na-storage capability of NGMO. This work indicates that Mn can participate in the Na-storage mechanism in inserted materials, and it provides a guideline for designing stable tunnel-structure Ge-based insertion-type anodes for SIBs.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Microstructure\nAs displayed in Fig. 1, the integrated preparation process is schematically described. Specifically, the Zn–G microspheres were obtained via the coordination reaction between zinc ions and glycerol. After the reflux condensation of the Zn–G precursor as a template with ammonium metavanadate, Zn–V–OH could be prepared and it inherited the spherical nanostructure. Finally, with the calcination of Zn–V–OH in air and subsequent carbon coating, the as-produced Zn3V3O8/NC microspheres assembled by nanosheets were successfully fabricated.\nTo verify the structural features during the whole synthetic process, powder XRD measurements of the products were conducted. As displayed in Fig. 2a, the hierarchical Zn–G precursor prepared by the hydrothermal method was validated to be glycerin zinc, in which all the peaks were in good agreement with C3H6O3Zn (JCPDS card no. 23-1975), different from some other amorphous metal–glycerin salts, such as Co–G, Mn–EG, and Mo–G. Similar to the above metal–glycerin salts, the proportion of organic components in Zn–G was approximately 50%, which could be proved by the TGA curve displayed in Fig. 2b. A good complexation reaction may occur between zinc ion and glycerol, followed by forming crystallographic C3H6O3Zn. With a self-assembly mechanism, the Zn–G nanosheets and microplates were first obtained, accompanied with the formation from nanoplates to microspheres. The specific process can be expressed by the following eqn (1):\nSubsequently, the XRD pattern of Zn–V–OH is displayed in Fig. 2c, from which we can conclude that the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O microspheres were successfully synthesized due to all the diffraction peaks corresponding to the JCPDS card no. 50-0570. In addition, the weight loss of about 11.6% of Zn–V–OH after annealing in air (Fig. 2d) might be assigned to the removal of absorbed and crystal water. The mechanism for the formation of Zn–V–OH can be described as the following eqn (2):\nAfter annealing the Zn–V–OH in air, the ZnVO mixed metallic oxide was obtained. As shown in Fig. S1,† all the main diffraction peaks at 16.7°, 25.8°, 28.6°, 28.7° and 29.5°, 34.9°, 36.0°, 43.1° can be indexed to the (11), (02), (002), (13) planes of Zn2V2O7 (JCPDS card no. 29-1396) and (131), (122), (320), (042) planes of Zn3(VO4)2 (JCPDS card no. 34-0378), respectively. There was no detection of residues, which validated that the hydroxide component had completely reacted with oxygen gas during the high-heat treatment. Finally, the PPY-decorated ZnVO composite was treated in argon gas under high temperature, and the two-phase ZnVO was transformed to single-phase Zn3V3O8. As shown in Fig. 2e, the five dominant peaks appearing at 30.1°, 35.5°, 43.1°, 56.9°, and 62.5° were completely consistent with the (220), (311), (400), (511), (440) planes of Zn3V3O8 (JCPDS card no. 31-1477). To further determine the loading amount of nitrogen-doped carbon in Zn3V3O8/NC, the TGA curve was obtained and is displayed in Fig. 2f, demonstrating an obvious two-step weight loss. Specifically, the decrease of 3.8 wt% below 200 °C may be due to the dissipation of absorbed water, while the other 19.3 wt% loss could be attributed to the oxidation of carbonaceous species. It is worth noting that the valence state of vanadium in ZnVO was +5, higher than that in Zn3V3O8/NC (+3 and +4 for vanadium), which could be ascribed to the reduction reaction originating from carbon at high temperature.\nThe specific chemical bonds and characteristic groups were explored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Fig. S2a† displays the absorption spectrum of Zn–G self-assembled microspheres. The peaks below 1000 cm−1 were considered the fingerprint area, representing the out-of-plane flexural vibration of the C–H bond. The existence of primary and secondary hydroxyls could be verified by the peaks at 1064 and 1124 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, the two absorption peaks located at 1323 and 1353 cm−1 could be assigned to a nitro group (–O–NO2) due to the side reactions between the nitric acid by-product from zinc nitrate and excessive glycerol, which will form a variety of nitroglycerides, followed by their complete disappearance after the final oxidation reactions. Also, the peak at 1380 cm−1 was due to the in-plane bending vibration of C–H bond in methyl (–CH3). Notably, the peaks appearing from 2700 to 3000 cm−1 could be ascribed to the stretching vibration of C–H bond, among which the two peaks at 2845 and 2936 cm−1 indicated the presence of methylene (–CH2–). Then, the wide and large absorption band at approximately 3388 cm−1 demonstrated a multi-molecular association because of the hydrogen bonds formed between the hydroxyl groups (–OH). At the same time, the strong board peak appearing at about 3440 cm−1 in the FTIR curve of Zn–V–OH (Fig. S2b†) indicated the presence of –OH and absorbed water, corresponding to the XRD analysis shown in Fig. 2c. Furthermore, the fitted FTIR curve of the ZnVO/PPY composite suggested the formation of a successful hybrid of polypyrrole (Fig. S2c†). To be specific, the stretching vibration of –NH– could be reflected by the broad absorption peak at about 3450 cm−1, while the C–N and vibration of pyrrole ring may be verified by the peaks located at 1622 and 1037 cm−1. The out-of-plane deformation vibrations of C–H in the pyrrole ring could be represented by the two peaks at 938 and 1386 cm−1.\nAdditionally, laser Raman spectroscopy was performed to characterize the key features of the components for Zn3V3O8/NC. As displayed in Fig. S3b,† two obvious sharp peaks were located at 1355 and 1572 cm−1, which could be ascribed to the D band and G band of carbon, respectively. Generally, the D band reflects sp3 hybridized carbon atoms and the defects content, while the G band is generated from the in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms. The intensity ratio of the D band and G band (ID/IG) represents the defect density. To be specific, the ID/IG value of 1.06 here suggested some degree of disorder and defects for N-doped carbon. What is more, the wide peak between 2690–2910 cm−1 was consistent with the 2D band of carbon species, which was the second-order Raman peak of double phonon resonance, indicating the multi-layer feature.\nFESEM measurements were introduced to further explore the morphology and structural characteristics of the materials during the whole process. Fig. 3a–c display the SEM images of the compact self-assembled Zn–G microspheres with the diameter of 10–20 μm, assembled by Zn–G microplates with the thickness of about 1 μm. As observed from the magnified image (Fig. 3c), the secondary microplates originated from the stacking of subordinate fluffy multi-layer nanosheets, demonstrating the hierarchical system of Zn–G microspheres, and further confirming the above-mentioned self-assembly reaction mechanism. Then, as illustrated in Fig. S4,† the Zn–V–OH intermediate obtained by a reflux process of Zn–G microspheres displayed a similar structure as Zn–G, except that the size and thickness of the secondary microplates were denser and thinner, which may be due to the successful vanadization of Zn–G. As displayed in Fig. 3d–f, after severe heat treatment in air, the ZnVO mixed oxides inherited the basic morphology of Zn–V–OH microspheres. Interestingly, the ZnVO microspheres possessed a smaller diameter than Zn–V–OH microspheres, which may be ascribed to the close stacking of nanosheets further converted from nanoplates. Finally, the Zn3V3O8/NC microsphere composite maintained a hierarchical structure, as can be seen in Fig. 3g–i, with some N-doped carbon particles in the cross-section and on the edge of the nanosheets. Additionally, the as-conducted EDS mappings of Zn3V3O8/NC for the different elements verified the even distribution of Zn, V, O, and N (Fig. S6†), illustrating the uniform hybridization of N-doped carbon.\nTEM measurements were performed to further study the internal structure and lattice of the material. The related images of Zn3V3O8/NC after serious ultrasonic treatment are displayed in Fig. 4. Stacked nanosheets with plenty of nanopores and mesopores can be distinctly observed in Fig. 4a and b, exhibiting a narrow pore width distribution in the range of 2–20 nm. The formation of abundant pores mainly occurred during the oxidation of Zn–V–OH. The vast H2O and –OH existing in the Zn–V–OH crystals could be converted into gases and released under heat treatment. As shown in Fig. 4c, when higher magnification was applied, the clear boundary between the crystal and non-crystal could be distinguished, indicating the interface of the Zn3V3O8 and amorphous N-doped carbon. Furthermore, the lattice fringe spacings (Fig. 4d) could be obviously measured as 0.253, 0.210, and 0.149 nm, which were ascribed to the (311), (400), and (440) lattice planes of Zn3V3O8, respectively. In addition, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 4d) displayed distinct and regular diffraction spots, thus also revealing that Zn3V3O8 was well crystallized and its nature was single crystals.\nMoreover, BET-based N2 absorption–desorption measurements were carried out for the Zn3V3O8/NC composite. As noted in Fig. S7a,† a typical type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop of the H4 type could be obtained, demonstrating a meso/microporous texture in the Zn3V3O8/NC hybrid. As a result, a large specific surface area of 53.2 m2 g−1 and a pore width distribution between 3 nm and 37 nm (Fig. S7b†) could be obtained, which corresponded well with the TEM analysis results (Fig. 4a and b). The porous structure facilitates the transport of Li+ and Na+ as well as shortens the path for the ions and electrons.\nThe concrete chemical composition of the Zn3V3O8/NC composite could be further demonstrated with the assistance of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum of the product, as illustrated in Fig. 5a, confirmed the presence of Zn, V, O, C, and N with no other impurities. As displayed in the Zn 2p spectrum (Fig. 5b), two distinct peaks located at the binding energies of 1021.5 and 1044.3 eV were observed, which could be indexed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively. The curve-fitting of the V 2p spectrum (Fig. 5c) showed that each peak could be divided into two parts. To be specific, the binding energies of 516.1 and 522.9 eV belong to V3+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, while the peaks located at 517.2 and 524.5 eV validated the presence of V4+. Meanwhile, the atomic ratio of V3+ to V4+ was nearly 2 according to the XPS quantitative analysis, which was consistent with the theoretical components in the Zn3V3O8 compound, in which the molar ratio of V3+ to V4+ was 2:1. The presence of the N element could be illustrated by the high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s in Fig. 5d. The pyridinic N (398.6 eV) and pyrrolic N (400.1 eV) were revealed to be present in the carbon layer, which endows vast defects for fast ion diffusion. As shown in Fig. 5e, three peaks could be distinctly seen after the refined fitting of the C 1s spectrum. Specifically, the peaks at 284.5 and 285.4 eV could be ascribed to sp2-bonded CC and C–O (C–O–C), respectively, which originated from the carbonization of PPY in the argon atmosphere. The remaining fitted peak located at 288.5 eV was assigned to the CO (CN). Moreover, the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 5f) could be fitted into two peaks located at 530.1 and 531.5 eV, representing the lattice O and absorbed O on the surface of the materials, respectively.\n\n3.2. Zn3V3O8/NC as anode materials for LIBs\nDiverse electrochemical tests were conducted to estimate the performance of Zn3V3O8/NC as an anode material for LIBs. As displayed in Fig. 6a, several oxidation and reduction peaks could be distinctly observed from the initial three cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, which were measured between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. During the first cathodic scan, a broad and strong peak between 0.02 and 0.54 V as well as a weak peak from 0.61 to 1.05 V could be obviously identified, which were ascribed to the transformation from Zn3V3O8 to LiyVOx and ZnO, accompanied with the reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn and then the formation of Li–Zn alloy. Furthermore, an irreversible generation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) membrane and decomposition of the electrolyte occurred simultaneously in this process, which resulted in an irreversible specific capacity and lower Coulomb efficiency in the first cycle. Subsequently, the following anodic charging process proceeded with some oxidation peaks. To be specific, the wide peak at around 1.30 V may be assigned to the oxidation of Zn0 to Zn2+ and V2+ to V3+, respectively. In addition, the peak located at ∼0.32 V corresponded to the delithiation of Li–Zn alloy to Zn. Then, the further oxidation of V3+ into V4+ could be verified from the peak appearing at ∼2.5 V. Notably, the mixed mechanisms of the prepared anode were confirmed once again. During the second and third cycles, the good coincidence of CV curves confirmed the superior reversibility of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode after the formation of the SEI membrane.\nThe current density dependent on the specific capacity of the Zn3V3O8/NC and ZnVO anodes for LIBs are displayed in Fig. 6b, which reflects the rate performance of the anodes. As shown in Fig. 6b, the Zn3V3O8/NC anode delivered capacities of 875, 766, 689, 643, and 597 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. Especially, when an abrupt current density of 5000 mA g−1 was applied, a relatively high Li-ion insertion capacity of 489 mA h g−1 could still be maintained. By contrast, the ZnVO anode showed an inferior rate behavior with only a capacity of 64 mA h g−1 at the current density of 5000 mA g−1. Importantly, when the rate current was decreased from 5000 to 100 mA g−1 again, a capacity of 1030 mA h g−1 was available on the Zn3V3O8/NC anode, larger than the initial 875 mA h g−1, which could be attributed to the activation of the anode material during the incipient several cycles, corresponding to the increase in specific capacitance in the stability cycling test shown in Fig. 6g. The outstanding rate performance of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode might be related to the unique hierarchical nanostructure, nano/mesoporous feature and hybridization of N-doped carbon, which helped alleviate the agglomeration of the Zn3V3O8 active material and facilitated the charge transport.\nTo illustrate the underlying mechanisms of Zn3V3O8/NC for its superior electrochemical properties, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted. The Nyquist plots with the range from 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz consisted of a slanted line in the low-frequency region, which is considered as a linear Warburg part, and a depressed semicircle in the high/medium-frequency region, respectively. Moreover, the EIS curves could be well fitted by the simplified equivalent circuit model exhibited in Fig. 6c. The whole circuit consisted of the electrolyte resistance (RS), the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and the Warburg impedance controlled by lithium-ion diffusion (ZW). To be specific, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) changed from 272.7 Ohm to 108.1 Ohm after 50 cycles, which showed the gradual activation, small volume expansion, and promoted conductivity during the charge–discharge process. Notably, the results verified that the N-doped carbon and porous Zn3V3O8 composites effectively were beneficial to the cycling stability and rate performance.\nTo further estimate the mechanism of lithium-ion storage, CV curves at diverse sweep rates between 0.1 and 1.0 mV s−1 were plotted and are displayed in Fig. 6d. Two redox peaks were found, centered at about 1.2 and 0.8 V in accordance with peak 1 and peak 2, respectively. To qualitatively describe the relationship between the increasing peak current i and the scan rate ν, the formula i = aνb is introduced in to the evaluation, which can be transformed into log|i| = loga + blog|ν|, where a and b are constants. When the b value is equal to 0.5 or 1.0, a completely diffusion-controlled faradaic kinetics or a pseudocapacitive charge-storage mechanism can be confirmed, respectively. In Fig. 6e, the b values for peak 1 and peak 2 were calculated to be 0.75 and 0.79, which reflected that the charge-storage behavior comprised the above two mechanisms and was affected by a pseudocapacitive process. Subsequently, to further analyze the dominant role of the pseudocapacitive charge-storage mechanism quantitatively, another formula described as i/ν1/2 = κ1ν1/2 + κ2 (or i = κ1ν + κ2ν1/2) can be utilized to display the ratio of the capacitive contribution (κ1ν) to the total current. As shown in Fig. 6f and S8,† there was an upward trend for the proportion of capacitive contribution, which gradually reached 79.8% at the scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1, thus indicating the origination of the excellent rate performance.\nThe cycling stability (Fig. 6g and Fig. S9†) and galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) properties (Fig. 6h and Fig. S10b†) of the Zn3V3O8/NC and ZnVO anode for LIBs were also explored by galvanostatic tests. At a current density of 200 mA g−1, the initial specific discharge and charge capacity of Zn3V3O8/NC anode were 1103 and 993 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 6g). The smaller initial coulombic efficiency of ∼90% (61% for the ZnVO anode) suggested the formation of the SEI membrane in Zn3V3O8/NC consumed less electrolyte. Meanwhile, the Zn3V3O8/NC anode delivered a capacity of 1434 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles, much higher than that of the ZnVO anode (730 mA h g−1). Interestingly, during the initial 15 cycles, an attenuation of the capacity appeared, followed by a continuous increase until ∼130 cycles. This phenomenon has also been observed in other reported vanadium oxides anode for LIBs. Remarkably, the persistent increase could be interpreted as indicating the activation of the anode materials and the promotion of Li-ion accessibility. Also, the N-doped carbon may generate more defects, thereby increasing the active sites and further improving the Li-ion storage. In contrast, the ZnVO anode suffered a 10% capacity loss from 170 to 200 cycles due to the degradation of the bare ZnVO oxide during the conversion reaction.\n\n3.3. Zn3V3O8/NC as anode materials for SIBs\nIn addition to the application of lithium-ion batteries, the as-prepared Zn3V3O8/NC showed superior electrochemical properties as an anode for SIBs, which could be verified by diverse tests in half-cell configurations against sodium tablets. Fig. 7a exhibits the initial three CV curves in the range of 0.01 and 3.0 V versus Na/Na+ at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. For the first discharging process, a wide reduction peak was observed located between 0.85 and 1.28 V, which might well be attributed to the formation of the SEI layer and the reversible phase transformation between the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases, in accordance with the insertion and extraction of Na+. The sharp and intense peak occurring at ∼0.05 V could be ascribed to the insertion of Na+ into carbon materials. On the contrary, the obvious peak at ∼0.07 V in the oxidation process was due to the extraction of Na+ from the above N-doped carbon materials. In addition, a distinct hump-like peak between 0.5 and 1.75 V depicted the oxidation in the charging process. During the subsequent two cycles, the curves almost overlapped, manifesting the electrochemical stability of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode.\nAdditionally, the rate performance of the Zn3V3O8/NC composite for sodium storage was analyzed in Fig. 7b. Reversible specific capacities of 345, 312, 263, 207, and 140 mA h g−1 were delivered at 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. Furthermore, although after suffering an abrupt ultrahigh current switching from 2000 mA g−1 to 100 mA g−1, the capacity of 351 mA h g−1 could be regained, which was even slightly higher than the initial value. From the above analysis, the superior rate performance could be assigned to the hierarchical porous structure of Zn3V3O8 and the decoration of N-doped carbon, which facilitated the fast diffusion of Na+ from the materials.\nSimilar to the Li-ion half-cell, the mechanism of sodium-ion storage could also be explored by analyzing the composition of the CV current. As exhibited in Fig. 7c, the CV curves at the different scan rates between 0.1 and 1.0 mV s−1 maintained three redox peaks located at about 1.4, 0.4, and 0.6 V, which were denoted as peaks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In Fig. 7d, the b values of 0.967, 0.935, and 0.961 were in accordance with the as-mentioned three peaks, which demonstrated that the charge-storage mechanism of Zn3V3O8/NC composites in Na-ion half-cells tended to be due to the capacitance-controlled behaviors. A high proportion of 76.3% (Fig. 7e) could be achieved at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Subsequently, when the scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1 was implemented, as shown in Fig. 7f, the ratio even increased to 92.4%, verifying the source of the outstanding rate performance.\nTypical GCD profiles of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode for SIBs at the current density of 200 mA g−1 are exhibited in Fig. 7g. During the first cycle, Zn3V3O8/NC delivered 693 mA h g−1 and 302 mA h g−1 discharge capacity and charge capacity, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 43.6%. It is worth mentioning that the capacity loss could also be ascribed to the irreversible reactions, accompanied with the formation of the SEI membrane. During the next several hundred cycles, almost the same discharge capacity and charge capacity of approximately 320 mA h g−1 could be obtained stably, further revealing a high coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Specially, as distinguished from the GCD curves of Li-ion cells shown in Fig. 6h, the de-/sodiation processes of the N-doped carbon hybrids could be reflected by two plateaus (Fig. 7g), which could not be observed with the Li-ion cell. According to the group of pseudocapacitive materials, the Zn3V3O8/NC composite as an anode for SIBs shows both a pseudocapacitive behavior and the redox reactions of N-doped carbon. Taking advantage of this special mechanism, the conundrum of the tardy kinetics of Na+ transport and serious volume change could be alleviated to a great extent.\nAs for the cycling stability profiles shown in Fig. 7h, when at a low current density of 200 mA g−1, the Zn3V3O8/NC composite retained a specific capacity of 309 mA h g−1 with almost no decrease. Even after 1000 cycles at a large current density of 500 mA g−1, a capacity of 269 mA h g−1 was maintained, illustrating the structural stability and low pulverization of the materials (Fig. S11†). The long-term cycling performance further validated the superiority of the reversible pseudocapacitive behavior for charge storage.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Synthesis of zinc–glycerol (Zn–G) precursor. Typically, complexation between metal ions and glycerol was adopted to prepare the Zn–G precursor. Specifically, 0.5 mmol zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 8 ml glycerol were added into 40 ml isopropanol, followed by strong stirring, and then the mixed colorless transparent solution was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon autoclave, and maintained at 180 °C for 8 h. After centrifugation and vacuum drying, the Zn–G precursor was collected successfully.\n2.1.2. Preparation of zinc pyrovanadate (Zn–V–OH) and mixed zinc vanadate (ZnVO). To further obtain the zinc pyrovanadate (Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O, designated as Zn–V–OH), 60 mg as-synthesized Zn–G precursor was decanted to a flask, accompanied with adding 90 ml ethanol. Subsequently, 20 ml ammonium metavanadate aqueous solution (20 mM) was introduced drop by drop. Consequently, the zinc pyrovanadate could be derived through a condensing reflux reaction for 3 h at a specific temperature. After treatment at the high temperature of 400 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for 2 h in a muffle furnace, the as-prepared Zn–V–OH product was further oxidized to mixed zinc vanadate (ZnVO), which included the two crystal phases Zn2V2O7 and Zn3(VO4)2.\n2.1.3. Fabrication of ZnVO/polypyrrole (ZnVO/PPY) and Zn3V3O8/nitrogen-doped carbon (Zn3V3O8/NC) composites. In order to coat polypyrrole (PPY) on the surface of the ZnVO oxides, a chemical oxidation polymerization method was conducted to synthesize polypyrrole from the pyrrole monomer. In a typical synthesis process, 2.1 mg sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added into 20 ml distilled water, followed by dispersing the above ZnVO in it with ultrasonication. Then, 21 μl pyrrole was injected into the obtained suspension by pipette with magnetic stirring for 1 h. Next, 2 ml ammonium persulfate (0.1 M) was mixed to the solution little by little, both as an initiator and oxidant. After reacting for 3 h, a black precipitate could be harvested, which was labeled as ZnVO/PPY composite. The final Zn3V3O8/nitrogen-doped carbon (Zn3V3O8/NC) composites could be achieved by annealing ZnVO/PPY at 500 °C for 3 h in a N2 atmosphere.\n\n2.2. Microstructural characterization\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/Max2550) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) between 10° and 80° was used to probe the crystal structures. To subtly explore the morphologies and interior microstructures, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi, S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-2010) were employed. In addition, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system (ECSALAB 250) furnished with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) was used to verify the valence states of the specific elements. The Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw system at 514 nm in the range of 200–1800 cm−1. Also, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (NETZSCH STA409) curve was performed in the range of 25 °C to 750 °C. The pore-size distribution and nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves were acquired by BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) and BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) methods, with the data obtained from a surface area analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2460).\n\n2.3. Assembly of lithium-ion half-cells and sodium-ion half-cells\nThe electrochemical performances were assessed using CR2016-type coin cells, which were assembled in a glove box (MIKROUNA, Germany) filled with 99.999% Ar gas. Lithium tablets were treated as the counter electrode in the cells. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the Zn3V3O8/NC, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a proportion of 7:2:1 on the surface of Cu foil, which were considered as the active material, conductive agent, and polymer binder, respectively. N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) served as the solvent to form a paste. Then, the electrode was dried at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum. In addition, the separator was commercial Celgard 2300 and the electrolyte was 1.0 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC, 1:1 v/v).\nThe basic process and environment for assembly of the sodium-ion half-cells were similar to for the above lithium-ion half-cells, except that CR2032-type coin cells were used instead of CR2032-type cells, the counter electrode was sodium tablets, a specific glass fiber was introduced as the separator, and the electrolyte was 1.0 M NaClO4 dissolved in diethyl carbonate/ethylene carbonate/(DEC/EC, 1:1 v/v), with 10 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate.\n\n2.4. Electrochemical measurements\nA CHI760E electrochemical workstation was widely used to perform the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements, for which the conditions were in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V versus Li/Li+ and Na/Na+ with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and over the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz at an amplitude of 5 mV, respectively. Finally, the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cycling stability, and rate performance tests were conducted on a multichannel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 Structure characterization\nThe XRD patterns of pristine and Y-doped (different molar ratios) samples are shown in Fig. (1a), indicating that a single O3-phase was synthesized and Y3+ was doped into the crystal structure successfully. The corresponding diffraction peaks can be identified as an Rm (no 166) space-group, which is in accordance with the α-NaFeO2 structure. However, there is a minor amount of Y2O3 phase formed when the amount of doped Y3+ was increased to 0.03. As can be seen from Fig. 1(b), the (003) peak shifts left when the doped amount is 0.01 and 0.02 because of the larger radius of Y3+ (0.90 Å) than Mn4+ (0.53 Å), so we can conclude that the interplanar spacing can be enlarged, which can also be confirmed by the refined crystallographic data. Subsequently, there is a right shift when Y-doped content increases to 0.03 and 0.04, which may be attributed to partial Y3+ has not doped into the crystal structure completely (due to the formation of Y2O3). In addition, the XRD patterns of NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xAlxFe0.33O2 are shown in Fig. S1,† demonstrating that all cathode materials show high phase purity and good crystallinity. Fig. 1(c) shows the (003) peak of Al-0.04 doped sample only has a slight left shift due to the smaller radius of Al3+ (0.535 Å) than Y3+ (0.90 Å).\nThe Rietveld refinement profiles and crystal structures of all samples are established in Fig. 2. The calculated crystallographic parameters of the pristine, Y0.02-doped, and Al0.04-doped samples are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the lattice parameters a, c, and cell volume all increase with the introduction of Y and Al, which may be attributed to the larger size of Y3+ and Al3+ ions compared to Mn4+ ions. However, the spacing of the transition metal layer for NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 and NaNi0.33Mn0.29Al0.04Fe0.33O2 is slightly smaller than that of the pristine material, which can be attributed to the more dominant role of stronger Y–O and Al–O bond than ion radius. Furthermore, the d-spacing of the Na layer has increased, which not only can enhance Na+ diffusion coefficient but also mitigate lattice strain during the process of Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. Simultaneously, the strength of Y–O and Al–O is stronger than Mn–O according to bond energy values at 298 K, therefore, the total transition metal–oxygen bonding of both doped materials are much stronger than that of the undoped one. For this reason, the stability of the layered structure was greatly enhanced for the Y and Al-doped samples. Moreover, the transition metal–oxygen bond of the Y-doped sample is stronger than the Al-doped sample, resulting in a more stable crystal structure for the Y-doped material.\nFig. 3 shows the elemental mapping images of the Y0.02-doped sample for Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, and Y. These elements are all distributed uniformly throughout the material, and the signal of element Y is weak due to its relatively low content compared with that of Ni, Mn, and Fe. The homogeneous distribution of Y throughout the particles also indicates that Y3+ has been doped into the crystal structure successfully. In addition, the elements of the Al0.04-doped sample are also distributed uniformly in Fig. S2.†\n\n3.2. Electrochemical performance\nIn order to investigate the effects of Y/Al substitution on the specific discharge capacity and cycle stability, all the electrodes were cycled in the voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V. Fig. 4(a) demonstrates the cycling stability of the NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xYxFe0.33O2 cathode materials and the effects of different molar ratios of Y-dopant on the cycling performance at 2 C after 2 cycles of activity at 0.2 C (1 C = 125 mA g−1). Obviously, all samples exhibited approximately the same initial capacity, while the specific discharge capacity of the pristine cathode was only 28.6 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles and the specific capacities of Y0.01, 0.02, 0.03 0.04 doped electrodes were about 39.1, 98.3, 85.1, and 83.9 mA h g−1, respectively, which are greatly increased compared to the pristine electrode. Moreover, it can be seen that the capacity retention at 2 C for the NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xYxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) cathode materials after 200 cycles were 22.3, 27.8, 72.8, 61.2 and 62.9%, respectively, which indicate that Y-doping improves cycling stability greatly. In particular, the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 material showed the best discharge specific capacity and cycle stability, the inferior properties of the Y0.03, 0.04-doped materials can be attributed to the formation of Y2O3 phase impurities, the lower doping amount results in faster capacity attenuation for the Y0.01-doped sample. For this reason the Y0.02-doped sample was selected as the representative for further testing. Fig. 4(b) shows the cycling stabilities of the NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xAlxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) materials, the Al-doped electrodes all exhibited enhanced specific capacity and cycle stabilities, especially for the Al0.04-doped sample. The comparison of cycle performances for the Y0.02-doped and Al0.04-doped cathodes is shown in Fig. 4(c), it can be seen that both doped samples exhibited better performances and NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 had the best cycle stability, which can be attributed to stronger transition metal–oxygen bond strength that result in a more stable crystal structure.\nFor the purpose of investigating the role of Y and Al doping on rate performance, the pristine, Y0.02-doped, and Al0.04-doped cathodes were cycled at different current densities between 1.5 and 4.2 V (Fig. 4(d)). The discharge capacities of the pristine were 168.6, 143.5, 127.2, 102.6, 14.5, and 0.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. In contrast, for the Y0.02-doped cathode material, the corresponding discharge capacities were 151.6, 147.3, 136.7, 124.9, 107.1, and 65.6 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. It is obvious that the Y0.02-doped cathode exhibited superior rate capability than the pristine, particularly under larger current densities. In addition, we can also see that the rate performance of the Al0.04-doped cathode had improved compared to the pristine, but was not as excellent as the Y0.02-doped cathode that possessed larger interplanar spacing. The superior rate capability of NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 may be largely due to increased interlayer spacing d, so that the sodium ion diffusion resistance is reduced which in turn improves the rate capability. This is consistent with the larger Na+ diffusion coefficients calculated by the subsequent PITT measurements.\nFig. 5(a) and (b) display the voltage vs. specific capacity plots for the pristine and Y0.02-doped cathodes at 50th and 150th cycles, respectively. We can clearly see that the gaps between the plateau regions of charge and discharge for Y0.02-doped NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 are much smaller compared with the pristine material. This result indicates that the Y0.02-doped cathode has lower polarization, and the process of charge and discharge is nearly reversible. In addition, as is shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), compared with the pristine cathode, the Y0.02-doped NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 shows higher discharge capacity and the plateau of discharge voltage decreased slower throughout the whole cycling process. Furthermore, the discharge voltage of the Y0.02-doped electrode decreased by 13.5%, while for the pristine electrode decreased by 35.8%. According to the results, it can be concluded that the problem of voltage reduction for NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 has been alleviated effectively by a small amount Y3+ substitution.\n\n3.3 Mechanism analysis\nIn order to study the reaction mechanism and the role of Y-doping on electrochemical kinetic properties, the cyclic voltammograms of the pristine and Y0.02-doped electrodes in the potential range of 1.5–4.2 V versus Na+/Na at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 were measured. The CV profiles shown in Fig. 6 represent two pairs of reversible redox couples, corresponding to the two-stage reaction of Na ion extraction/insertion. As for the pristine, an obvious oxidation peak can be located at 3.080 V along with a reduction hump at 2.814 V, which are associated with the electrochemical redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+. The other oxidation peak located at 4.150 V along with the reduction hump at 3.769 V, which can be attributed to the redox processes of Fe3+/Fe4+. Moreover, the gap between both redox couples for the pristine (0.266 V) is wider than the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 (0.220 V), indicating a lower polarization, better redox reversibility, and enhanced Na+ diffusion behavior with the introduction of Y3+.\nTo investigate the influence of Y3+ substitution on the kinetics of sodium ion intercalation/deintercalation into cathodes, EIS tests were used to study the interface stability between electrolyte and cathode. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the Nyquist plots of the pristine and Y0.02-doped cathodes before and after 200 cycles, which each is composed of a single semicircle at high-frequency associated with the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a quasistraight line at low frequency ascribed to the Warburg impedance (Zw). It is clearly seen that Rct of the Y0.02-doped electrode (300.63 Ω) was significantly decreased compared with the pristine electrode (653.33 Ω) before cycling (Table S1†). This result is consistent with the post-cycling sample, the Rct of the Y0.02-doped sample was 342.89 Ω, while the pristine material was 975.07 Ω (Table S2†). The above phenomenon is because of enhanced reaction kinetics and rapid charge transfer at the interface between electrode/electrolyte. Simultaneously, the degree of increase in resistance of the Y0.02-doped electrode (42.26 Ω) is much smaller than the pristine (321.74 Ω) after 200 cycles, which can be attributed to enhanced layered structure stability. Based on these, it can be concluded that excellent rate performance and cycling stability were achieved in the doped material.\nThe PITT measurements were carried out on the electrodes to determine the sodium ions diffusion coefficient (DNa+) in the voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V. The Na+ diffusion coefficients can be calculated by the following equation on the basis of Fick's second law: DNa+ = −[dln(I)/dt] [4L2/π2 ], where I is the titration current, t is the step time, and L is the characteristic diffusion (the thickness of the cathode active material).Fig. 7(c) and (d) demonstrate the PITT curves of the pristine and Y0.02-doped samples during Na+ insertion/deinsertion between 1.5 and 4.2 V. It is worth mentioning that the calculated sodium ions diffusion coefficients of the Y0.02-doped cathode were close to 10−9 cm2 s−1, which are much higher than the pristine during the discharge process. The functional introduction of Y3+ into the crystal structure plays an important role in increasing the layer spacing (d) and reducing the sodium ion migration barrier, so the Na-ion diffusion coefficients have been improved. This result is in accordance with the remarkably enhanced rate property exhibited by the doped material.\nFig. 8(a) and (b) show the size and morphologies of the as-synthesized pristine and Y0.02-doped particles, respectively. It is observed that the sizes of all particles are in the range of 0.2–1 μm. Simultaneously, almost all particles are plate-like and polyhedral for both samples, and the surface of the Y0.02-doped material looks smoother than those of the pristine particles. To further confirm the effectiveness of the substitution of Y on particle integrity and mechanical stability, SEM images of the pristine and Y0.02-doped samples were collected after 200 cycles and are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). It is apparent that the phenomenon of particle exfoliation can be observed in the pristine, this is because of the larger strain between domains induced by structural expansions with Na+ intercalation in the crystal structure. However, the particles of the Y0.02-doped sample still maintain excellent integrity after experiencing long-term sodiation and desodiation, which can be attributed to superior layered structure stability that possesses higher transition metal–oxygen bond energy, so the cycling stability was improved significantly.\nIn order to investigate the stability of the oxygen and the thermal stability, XPS O 1s spectra and DSC results were collected for the samples (the pristine and Y0.02-doped). As shown in Fig. 9(a), the O 1s peaks represent the fact that there are lattice and surface oxygen existing in the electrode materials. Table S1† summarizes the relative contents of lattice and surface oxygen for both samples. Compared with pristine, the ratio of lattice oxygen/surface oxygen in NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 was improved greatly, which demonstrates that the substitution of Mn4+ with Y3+ plays a crucial role in stabilizing oxygen anions in the crystal structure. Due to the introduction of Y3+, the transition metal–oxygen bond becomes stronger, which improves the stability of layered structure. Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry curves of both cathode materials charged to 4.2 V are shown in Fig. 9(b). The thermal decomposition temperature (the exothermic peak) of NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 has increased by 25.08 °C, which proves that cation substitution has a great effect on mitigating lattice oxygen release and inhibiting the irreversible loss of oxygen. In addition, the heat generation of the Y0.02-doped sample was 81.8 J g−1, much lower than the 102.9 J g−1 of the pristine material. We can draw the conclusion that the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 material possesses better thermal stability.\nTo further demonstrate the role of Y element on the ability of the cathode material's resistance to electrolyte corrosion, the cathodes were stored in fresh electrolyte for 15 days after being charged to 4.2 V, and then inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used to measure the contents of dissolved transition metal ions in the electrolyte. As shown in Table 3, the leached metal ions for the pristine material were 0.0139, 0.0820, and 0.1085 mg kg−1 for respective ions, this is much higher than those for the Y0.02-doped sample (0.0094, 0.0674, and 0.0928 mg kg−1). Therefore, the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 material can protect transition metal ions from leaching, and thereby improve the cycling stability and rate performance.\nTo investigate the relationship of the excellent electrochemical performance and the Na deintercalation/intercalation reaction mechanism, ex situ XRD were collected to examine the crystal structure at various charge and discharge states during the first cycle. Fig. 10(a) and (b) show the ex situ XRD patterns of NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 and NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 along with the first charge and discharge curves, respectively. As sodium ions were extracted from the O3-NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2, the diffraction peak of the (003) peak moves to a lower angle and splits into two at 3.4 V, indicating the formation of a new hexagonal P3 phase induced by the gliding of the [Ni0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33]O2 slab (Fig. 10(a)). Simultaneously, the (101), (102) peaks shift right and the (104) peak disappears gradually, which also demonstrated the coexistence of hexagonal O3 and P3 phases. Upon further sodium removal from the lattice (until charged to 4.2 V), only the P3 single phase is observed along with constantly increasing d-spacing. During the discharge process, there is a reversible phase transformation process, the (003) peak moves to a higher angle and also split into two peaks when discharging to 3.4 V. In particular compared to the uncycled state, the (003) peak has a slight left shift upon discharged to 1.5 V. Overall, the pristine NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 material experienced sequential phase transitions of O3–O3 + P3–P3–O3. By contrast, as shown in Fig. 10(b), the (003) peak of NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 still maintained intact shape, showing that the new P3 phase is less developed (when charged to 3.4 V). It should be noted that a much larger fraction of the O3 phase was observed in the Y-doped sample than in Y-free sample when the cathode was discharged to 3.4 V, which can also be ascribed to the splitting of the (003) peak. Furthermore, the phase transitions of the Y-doped NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 are much more reversible than the pristine according to the coincidence degree of the (003) peak between the uncycled state and when discharged to 1.5 V (the pristine shift left 0.12°, while the Y0.02-doped shift left 0.06°). These results indicate that Y-doping can facilitate reversible phase transition, which is consistent with improved cycle performance and layered structure stability.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Preparation of materials\nNaNi0.33Mn0.33−xYxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) and NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xAlxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) cathode materials were synthesized by a simple sol–gel method. Polyethylene glycol and citric acid were dissolved in deionized water, and then stoichiometric amounts of nickel acetate, manganese acetate, iron nitrate, and yttrium nitrate (aluminum nitrate) were added into the above solution under constant stirring. The resultant mixed solution was aged at 80 °C for 5 h and then dried at 120 °C overnight to obtain the porous gel. Finally, the dried gel was grinded adequately and calcined at 900 °C for 12 h subsequently to obtain the final materials.\n\n2.2 Sample characterizations\nThe crystal structures and material compositions were determined by a Persee XD2 equipment using Cu Kα radiation in the range of 10°–70° (a step width of 0.01°). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi to characterize the valence states of Ni, Fe, Mn, Y and Al ions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a Hitachi SU8010 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 F20) was used to collect the elementary mapping images.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nA uniform slurry was formed by combining the active materials, conductive additive, poly (vinylidene fluoride) in a ratio of 75:15:10. Then the slurry was uniformly coated onto Al foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h. CR2025 coin cells were assembled in an atmosphere of high-purity argon, using Na disks as the counter electrode, glass fiber (Whatman) 1.0 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) as separator and the electrolyte, respectively. An automatic galvanostat (NEWARE) was used to measure the property of galvanostatic charge–discharge at various current densities (1 C = 125 mA g−1) in a voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V at room temperature. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) tests were carried out on a Metrohm Autolab instrument.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Preparation of materials\nNaNi0.33Mn0.33−xYxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) and NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xAlxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) cathode materials were synthesized by a simple sol–gel method. Polyethylene glycol and citric acid were dissolved in deionized water, and then stoichiometric amounts of nickel acetate, manganese acetate, iron nitrate, and yttrium nitrate (aluminum nitrate) were added into the above solution under constant stirring. The resultant mixed solution was aged at 80 °C for 5 h and then dried at 120 °C overnight to obtain the porous gel. Finally, the dried gel was grinded adequately and calcined at 900 °C for 12 h subsequently to obtain the final materials.\n\n2.2 Sample characterizations\nThe crystal structures and material compositions were determined by a Persee XD2 equipment using Cu Kα radiation in the range of 10°–70° (a step width of 0.01°). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi to characterize the valence states of Ni, Fe, Mn, Y and Al ions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a Hitachi SU8010 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 F20) was used to collect the elementary mapping images.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nA uniform slurry was formed by combining the active materials, conductive additive, poly (vinylidene fluoride) in a ratio of 75:15:10. Then the slurry was uniformly coated onto Al foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h. CR2025 coin cells were assembled in an atmosphere of high-purity argon, using Na disks as the counter electrode, glass fiber (Whatman) 1.0 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) as separator and the electrolyte, respectively. An automatic galvanostat (NEWARE) was used to measure the property of galvanostatic charge–discharge at various current densities (1 C = 125 mA g−1) in a voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V at room temperature. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) tests were carried out on a Metrohm Autolab instrument.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\n\n2.1 Synthesis and characterization of In2S3/C nanofibers\nIn2S3/C nanofibers were prepared by a simple method of electrospinning. Fig. 1 reveals the synthesis procedure of the In2S3/C nanofibers, which can be summarized in the following three steps. Firstly, the precursor solution was electrospun to form a nanofiber membrane. Afterwards, the nanofiber membrane was pre-oxidized in air, which can stabilize the structure of the nanofibers. Finally, the stabilized nanofibers were successively vulcanized and carbonized in a N2 atmosphere. In this calcination process, thiourea was decomposed into CS2, acting as the sulfur source of In2S3. More specific details about the experiment can be found in the ESI.†\nThe crystallographic structure of the as-prepared In2S3/C nanofibers was manifested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and is shown in Fig. 2a. All the identified diffraction peaks agree with tetragonal In2S3 (JCPDS card no. 25-0390) without an impure phase, indicating that In2S3 was successfully synthesized by the electrospinning method. The inset of Fig. 2b shows the crystal structure of In2S3. There are plenty of vacancies in the In2S3 crystal due to the incomplete coordination of S atoms. These vacancies can provide transport channels for Li+/Na+ ions. In the Raman scattering spectrum (Fig. 2b), there are two peaks at about 1340 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 corresponding to the D peak (the disordered structure of carbon) and the G peak (the graphitic structure of carbon), respectively. The intensity ratio of D to G (ID/IG) is 1.19, indicating the nature of amorphous carbon with partial graphitization. There are some defects in the amorphous carbon structure providing some active sites for the storage of Li+/Na+ ions. In addition, in the low Raman shift range, the peaks located at 244.3 (A1g), 307.2 (A1g), 367.3 (A1g), 326.7 (F2g), and 264.7 cm−1 (E1g) are consistent with the typical Raman modes of In2S3.\nThe electronic valence and composition of the In2S3/C nanofibers were detected with X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) analysis. Fig. 3a shows the full spectrum of the In2S3/C nanofibers, revealing that the In2S3/C nanofibers contain four elements of In, N, C, and S. In the high-resolution In 3d XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b), the two peaks located at 444.9 and 452.5 eV correspond to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 of In3+ in In2S3, respectively. Fig. 3c shows that the high-resolution S 2p spectrum has two peaks at 163.2 and 162.4 eV, which are consistent with S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2− in In2S3, respectively. In Fig. 3d, the two peaks at 286.0 eV and 284.6 eV of the C 1s spectrum can be fitted to the C–N bonds and C–C bonds, respectively. The presence of the C–N bonds manifests that N elements from PVP and PAN have been successfully incorporated into the carbon matrix. The doping of nitrogen can provide more electrons for the π-conjugated system of carbon, thereby improving the electronic conductivity of the composite. The N 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 3e reveals that N mainly exists in the form of pyridinic N (398.0 eV), pyrrolic N (399.7 eV), and graphitic N (400.1 eV), which further implies that nitrogen was successfully doped into the carbon nanofibers (5.6 at% nitrogen content determined with XPS composition analysis). Among them, the defects in the carbon matrix caused by pyridinic N and pyrrolic N can provide some active sites for the intercalation of Li+ and Na+ ions.\nThe carbon content of the In2S3/C nanofibers was determined through the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the results are shown in Fig. 3f. It can be seen from Fig. 3f that there is a slight weight loss below 200 °C, which is ascribed to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water and free water. The main weight loss of In2S3 occurs between 500 °C to 600 °C, which can be attributed to the oxidation of carbon and In2S3 in air. Subsequently, the TG curve tends to be flat, and the final total weight loss is 36.6%. XRD characterization of the combustion products (Fig. S1†) indicates that the final residue was identified as In2O3; therefore, the content of In2S3 in the composite can be calculated to be 74.4%.\nThe morphology of the as-prepared In2S3/C nanofibers was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The FE-SEM image of the precursor fibers in Fig. S2† shows that the nanofibers have a smooth fiber surface and uniform fiber diameter of about 350–400 nm. After calcination, the FE-SEM images of the In2S3/C nanofibers (Fig. S3a and b†) with rough surfaces can be observed at low magnification, and the diameter of the nanofibers is about 320–370 nm. Under high magnification (Fig. 4a and b), it can be intuitively observed that the surface of the nanofiber is covered with a layer of floc and has been identified as a composite of In2S3 nanoparticles and a thin layer of amorphous carbon using TEM analysis below. The two curves in Fig. 4c represent the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the In2S3/C nanofibers and the pore size distribution, respectively. The distinct hysteresis loop located at low and middle pressures indicates that there are many micropores and mesopores inside the material, which is consistent with its pore size distribution. The specific surface area and the pore volume were calculated to be 162.5 m2 g−1 and 0.098 cm3 g−1, respectively. The large specific surface area and porous structure can buffer the volume expansion caused by the electrochemical reaction; in the meantime, it can also increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode.\nFig. 4d and e show the TEM image and the high-resolution TEM image of the In2S3/C nanofibers, respectively. The legible lattice fringes with a space of 6.1 Å correspond to the (1 0 3) plane of tetragonal In2S3, which is in agreement with the XRD result. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) image in the inset of Fig. 4e reveals clear diffraction points indicating the high crystallinity of In2S3. It can be seen from Fig. S4a† that there is a layer of floc on the fiber surface, which also confirms the result of the SEM analysis. When the red rectangular frame in Fig. S4a† is enlarged, it can be observed that there are some black crystal particles in the floc (as shown by the yellow dashed frame in Fig. S4b†). The high-resolution image (Fig. S4d†) of the black crystal particles in the red rectangle in Fig. S4c† and the interplanar crystal spacing statistical tables (the inset in Fig. S4d†) are shown in Fig. S4d.† The lattice fringes with a pitch of 3.2 Å corresponding to the (109) plane of tetragonal In2S3 can be identified. Therefore, the floc on the fiber surface should be composed of In2S3 nanoparticles and a thin layer of amorphous carbon. Fig. 4(g–j) display the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping of C, In, S, and, N with the test area corresponding to the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image in Fig. 4f. It can be seen directly that the four elements C, In, S, and N are uniformly distributed in the nanofibers. However, some light spots can be observed in the elemental mapping of In and S (as shown by the red dashed box in Fig. 4f, h and i), which correspond to the In2S3 particles in the floc on the fiber surface.\n\n2.2 Lithium storage performance and lithium storage mechanism\nTo elucidate the lithium storage mechanism of In2S3, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ex situ XRD have been employed to research the phase transition during the electrochemical reaction. The CV curves in the voltage range from 0.01 to 3.0 V can be seen in Fig. 5a. The reduction peak corresponding to the conversion reaction of In2S3 to In and Li2S is located at 0.99 V in the first cathodic scan (eqn (1)), which can be confirmed by ex situ XRD characterization in Fig. 5b. When discharged to 0.4 V, a weak diffraction peak appeared at 65.2°, which matched the (4 0 0) plane of Li2S. Moreover, the diffraction peaks at 33.0°, 36.3°, 39.1°, 54.5°, 63.2°, and 67.0° correspond to the (1 0 1), (0 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 1 2), (1 0 3), and (2 1 1) planes of tetragonal In, respectively. The cathodic peaks at 0.68 V in the first scan are related to the irreversible formation of the SEI film, and the cathodic peaks below 0.6 V may be attributable to the In–Li alloying reaction (eqn (2)). In Fig. 5b, two weak diffraction peaks appeared at 32.0° and 34.3° when discharged to 0.01 V, and disappeared when the voltage was charged to 0.4 V, which can be attributed to the (4 2 2) and (5 1 1) planes of cubic In3Li13, respectively. Therefore, the anodic peaks between 0.1 and 0.7 V correspond to the step-by-step dealloying reaction. The broad oxidation peak at 1.05 V in the CV curve (Fig. 5a) corresponds to the conversion of In to In2S3. However, the peak intensity decreases with an increase of the number of cycles, implying the poor reversibility of the reverse conversion reaction during the charging process. Therefore, In was only partially converted to In2S3 during the reverse conversion reaction. When the voltage is charged to 1.6 and 3.0 V, a diffraction peak appears at 33.2°, which corresponds to the (0 0 12) plane of In2S3 (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the diffraction peak of In can also be clearly observed in the ex-situ XRD pattern at cha-3.0 V, which once again confirms that In2S3 is only partially reversible. The conversion reactions per metal center are accompanied by multiple electron transfers, which makes the conversion from In2S3 to Li2S and In in the initial lithiation process largely irreversible. The low reversibility of the conversion reaction gives rise to the first irreversible capacity loss and a gradual decrease in the capacity during the initial several cycles. It is worth adding that the irreversible formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film is also responsible for the first irreversible capacity loss.\nTo sum up, the lithium storage mechanism of In2S3 could be elucidated as eqn (1) and (2). 14.67 moles of Li+ ions and electrons are stored in one mole of In2S3, and the maximum theoretical capacity of In2S3 can be calculated to be 1206 mA h g−1.\nThe electrochemical performance of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode was investigated by the galvanostatic discharge/charge test. Fig. 5c shows the rate performance of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode at diverse current densities in the range of 50–2000 mA g−1. The In2S3/C nanofiber anode experiences an obvious capacity decrease during the first several cycles, which is consistent with the CV test result. Fortunately, even at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, the In2S3/C nanofiber anode maintains a high discharge specific capacity of 301.2 mA h g−1, and after the current density was restored to 50 mA g−1, the specific capacity rapidly went back to 624.3 mA h g−1.\nThe cycling performance of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode at 50 mA g−1 and the corresponding first three discharge/charge profiles can be seen in Fig. 5d and Fig. S6,† respectively. The initial discharge and charge specific capacities are 1184.2 and 696.4 mA h g−1, respectively, meaning that the initial coulombic efficiency is about 58.8%. The low reversibility of the conversion reaction and the irreversible formation of the SEI film are the main reasons for the 41.2% irreversible capacity loss. After 100 cycles, the In2S3/C nanofiber anode delivered a high discharge specific capacity of 642.4 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 95.1% (based on the second discharge specific capacity of 675.2 mA h g−1). Beyond that, the In2S3/C nanofiber anode also shows ultra-long cycle life at 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5e), maintaining a discharge specific capacity of 312.5 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.5% (based on the second discharge specific capacity of 388.3 mA h g−1). Compared with those of In2S3 materials in published articles, the electrochemical performance of the In2S3/C nanofibers in LIBs has been significantly improved. In the first several cycles, a minor specific capacity fade was observed at both 50 and 1000 mA g−1. The capacity fade could be mainly ascribed to the low reversibility of the conversion reaction and the separation of the In2S3 floccules from the fiber framework, which will be explained in subsequent articles.\nThe electrode reaction kinetics was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. S8† shows the Nyquist plots, which include two depressed semicircles and a sloping line and the corresponding simulated curves of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode after 1 and 20 cycles at 50 mA g−1. Specifically, the high-frequency semicircle is related to the SEI film resistance as Rsei, the semicircle in the intermediate-frequency region is related to the charge-transfer resistance as Rct, and the sloping line is due to the ion-diffusion process in the solid phase. The simulated curves are obtained by constructing an equivalent circuit model (the inset in Fig. S8†). The simulated impedance parameters are listed in Table S1.† The In2S3/C nanofiber anode showed small impedance after 1 cycle and a negligible increase after 20 cycles. Moreover, the EIS of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 (corresponding to Fig. 5e) was also tested. After experiencing an ultra-long cycle, the continuous consumption of the electrolyte during repeated cycles leads to an increase of the Rs value (25.9 Ω after 600 cycles), which may be the reason why the specific capacity gradually decreases after 300 cycles. However, its Rct value on behalf of the charge transfer resistance is still only 20.3 Ω; the small Rct value indicates that the electrode structure of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode has not been destroyed after undergoing an ultra-long cycle. The small Rct value benefits mainly from the carbon matrix that fully encapsulates the In2S3 nanoparticles and enhances their electrical conductivity.\n\n2.3 Sodium storage performance and sodium storage mechanism\nThe electrochemical performance of the In2S3/C nanofibers in SIBs was tested in Na half-cells. The electrochemical reaction mechanism of In2S3 was investigated by CV and ex situ XRD analysis. The CV curves of the first three cycles can be seen in Fig. 6a. In the first cathodic scan process, the two strong reduction peaks at 0.38 V and 0.54 V can be attributed to the conversion from In2S3 to In and Na2S (eqn (3)) and the formation of the SEI film, respectively. The ex situ XRD pattern in Fig. 6b confirms the formation of the orthorhombic Na2S phase (the corresponding diffraction peak is located at 36.4°) and tetragonal phase (after discharging to 0.4 V). The reduction peak below 0.2 V and the oxidation peak at 0.49 V in all cycles may be attributed to the In–Na alloying reaction (eqn (4)) and the inverse dealloying reaction, respectively, which can also be confirmed by ex situ XRD results. A weak diffraction peak appeared at 21.0° when discharged to 0.01 V, which is absent when charged to 1.6 V; it could be assigned to the (1 1 1) plane of cubic NaIn. In addition, Fig. S5† shows the high-resolution In 3d spectrum at dis-0.01 V, which can be deconvoluted into three species. The peaks at 443.7 and 451.5 eV can be attributed to the metal indium. The metal indium peak shifted slightly to a lower binding energy, and two small peaks at 443.2 and 451.0 eV appeared, which may be due to the formation of NaIn, which caused the binding energy shift. Indium has less electronegativity than sodium, and it is easier for indium to obtain electrons. The density of the outer electron cloud increases and the shielding effect on the nucleus increases, thereby reducing the binding energy. During the charging process, the two peaks at 13.2° and 26.9° may be attributed to the (1 1 0) plane and the (2 2 1) plane of tetragonal Na8In2S7 (4Na2S + In2S3 ⇌ Na8In2S7), respectively. The intensity of the two peaks gradually disappears when the voltage increases to 2.5 V, which may be ascribed to the instability of Na8In2S7 at high voltage, resulting in its decomposition. The formation of In2S3 is a multi-step reversible conversion process corresponding to the oxidation peaks of 0.8 V and 1.2 V in the CV curve. When the voltage charges to 1.6 V, a diffraction peak reappears at 33.2° which can be attributed to the (0 0 12) plane of In2S3. In summary, 8 moles of electrons and Na+ ions are stored in one mole of In2S3, indicating that the maximum theoretical capacity of In2S3 can be calculated to be 658 mA h g−1.\nIn the subsequent CV scans, the shift of the reduction peak position may be put down to the phase transition and the formation of the SEI film. Beyond that, the CV curves overlap very well during the subsequent scans, indicating that the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode has high electrochemical reversibility.\nThe rate performance of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode was evaluated at diverse current densities in the range of 50–2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 6c). The In2S3/C nanofiber anode delivers a high specific capacity of 388.5 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. Even if the applied current density increased to 2000 mA g−1, the capacity of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode can still be maintained at 235.6 mA h g−1. Then, the specific capacity quickly recovered to 344.7 mA h g−1 after the current density recovered to 50 mA g−1.\nThe cycle performance of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode in SIBs and the corresponding first three discharge/charge profiles were tested at 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 6d and S7†). The In2S3/C nanofiber electrode delivers the first discharge and charge specific capacities of 683.6 and 393.7 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, respectively, meaning that the initial coulombic efficiency is about 57.6%. The large first irreversible capacity fade is mainly to blame for the formation of the SEI film. After the initial few cycles, the coulombic efficiency was maintained close to 100%, manifesting that the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode has good stability and reversibility. The In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can maintain a high specific capacity of 372.4 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, and its capacity retention is 94.1% (based on the second discharge specific capacity of 395.9 mA h g−1). The In2S3/C nanofiber electrode also showed long-term cyclability (Fig. 6e), which maintained a specific capacity of 261.7 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 97.3% (based on the second discharge specific capacity of 269.1 mA h g−1). The cycle life of the In2S3/C nanofibers in SIBs has been significantly increased compared with the published article in which the In2S3 composite was used as an anode for SIBs.\nThe EIS was performed to investigate the electrode reaction kinetics of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode in SIBs. Fig. S9† displays the Nyquist plots and corresponding simulated curves (simulated impendence parameters can be seen in Table S2†) of the In2S3/C nanofiber anode. The Rs value is small with negligible increase. The addition of 5% FEC additive to the electrolyte of SIBs generated the formation of a compact SEI film on the surface of the electrode, which resulted in a large Rsei, however, without significant increase after 20 cycles. The large Rct value is ascribed to the large sodium ion radius. Interestingly, there is no obvious increase in the Rct value after 20 cycles, indicating a stable electrode structure in SIBs.\n\n2.4 Characterization of the after-cycled In2S3/C nanofiber electrode\nIn order to clarify the reason why the In2S3/C nanofiber anodes have excellent electrochemical properties in LIBs and SIBs, the morphology and microstructure of the after-cycled In2S3/C nanofiber anode were observed by TEM and EDX elemental mapping. First, the Li half-cell and Na half-cell that have been subjected to the rate performance test (corresponding to Fig. 5c and 6c) were disassembled, and then the electrolyte residue on the electrode surface was rinsed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Finally, the active materials coated on the copper foil were collected and dispersed by sonication in absolute alcohol. It can be seen in Fig. 7a and f, which show the TEM images of the after-cycled electrodes cycling in the Li half-cell and Na half-cell, that the after-cycled In2S3/C nanofiber anode retains the initial fibrous morphology after cycling at high current densities. Fig. 7b–e and g–j show the EDX elemental mapping of the after-cycled electrodes cycling in the Li half-cell and Na half-cell. In the fiber region, all elements (C, In, S, and N) are evenly distributed without visible light spots, which is different from the elemental mapping of the pristine In2S3/C nanofibers. The disappearance of the light spots in the element mapping of In and S may be ascribed to the large volume expansion during the alloying reactions, which causes the separation of In2S3 floccules from the fiber surface. No obvious elemental light spots implies that no agglomeration of In2S3 occurs during the electrochemical reaction. These phenomena including the unbroken fiber structure, uniform element distribution, and no agglomeration manifest that the carbon fiber framework has robust mechanical flexibility to adequately protect the In2S3 nanoparticles during repeated cycles.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nAs shown in Scheme 1b, ML-Bi@NCSs were prepared via the preorganization of the super assembly of Bi(III) with citrate anions and dicyandiamide via complexation interactions in organic solvents and a subsequent high-temperature solid-phase reaction process. Bi(III), with an extra-nuclear electron configuration of [Xe]4f145d106s, could act as a Lewis acid to accept electron pairs forming high-coordination-number complexes due to both the large radius (1.17 Å) and the strong tendency of deformation of the electron cloud and polarization of the electronic distribution. Electron-donating groups, involving carboxylate oxygen, hydroxyl oxygen, sulfur of sulfides, and nitrogen of amines, could be the coordinating ligands of Bi(III) complexes. In the present work, utilizing the strong chelation ability and capacity of Bi(III), the precursors of Bi and nitrogen-doped carbon were firstly pre-organized into super-assemblies via complexation of Bi(III) with citrate anions and dicyandiamide in DMF, affording a stacked sheet-like nanostructure when evaporating to dryness (as shown in Fig. S1†). The multi-layered nanosheet structure of the obtained N-doped carbon material is inherited from stacked sheet-like precursors during the high-temperature pyrolysis process, probably accompanied by the formation and decomposition of the layered carbon nitride intermediate owing to thermo-polymerization and pyrolysis of dicyandiamide. Meanwhile, ammonia and reductive carbon were generated, inducing the carbothermal reduction of Bi(III) to Bi0 and the anchoring and segregation of Bi0 nanoparticles from each other, respectively, on the carbon layers. As a result, 3D multi-layered Bi/N-doped carbon nanosheets were formed with Bi nanospheres intercalated between each two layers of the layered structure of NCSs.\nThe morphology and structure of ML-Bi@NCSs were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Fig. 1. The low-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1a) shows the stacked layered structure with microscale lateral dimensions (∼2 μm). As shown in Fig. 1b, the thickness of the nanosheets is estimated to be about 30 nm, and the open interlayer space (interlayer distance: 60–90 nm) can guarantee rapid electrolyte penetration and ion transport, which is very favorable for high-rate capability. Importantly, a large number of Bi nanospheres exist in the interlayer space and are well anchored on the surface of nanosheets with a relatively homogeneous distribution. This is beneficial for buffering the volume expansion and contraction of the Bi metal upon sodiation/desodiation. Meanwhile, the structural strain generated upon Na+ insertion/extraction is well buffered owing to the unique interlayer structures. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images confirm the homogeneous distribution of elements Bi, C, N and O with the corresponding content of 70.51 wt%, 20.97 wt%, 0.10 wt% and 8.41 wt% (Fig. S2†), respectively.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was used to further investigate the structure and composition of ML-Bi@NCSs. As shown in Fig. 1e, the homogeneously distributed nanospheres with an average diameter of 10–20 nm are further identified. A regular spherical structure overlaps at different focal lengths, as shown in Fig. 1f, suggesting the distribution of nanospheres in both sides of the NCSs. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of single layered ML-Bi@NCSs shows that the lattice spacing of Bi nanospheres is 0.23 nm, assigned to the (110) plane of Bi metal (Fig. 1g). The diffractions rings (Fig. 1h) in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern are indexed to (012), (104), (110), (015), (113), (202), (024), (107), (116), and (122) planes of Bi metal (rhombohedral phase), respectively. The elemental mapping images from TEM (Fig. S3†) reveal a homogeneous distribution of the element nitrogen in the carbon nanosheet. The presence of the oxygen element is probably attributed to the partial oxidation of Bi nanospheres. In the obtained ML-Bi@NCSs, active components are well-organized and connected with NCSs, thus forming a 0D⊂2D hierarchical structure. Such a point (Bi spheres)-to-face (NCSs) contact can not only guarantee the stability of active nano-building blocks but also ensure high-efficient electron transfer capability.\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of ML-Bi@NCSs is shown in Fig. S4a.† All the diffraction peaks in the pattern can be well indexed to hexagonal Bi metal (JCPDS no. 85-1329). As shown in the Raman spectrum (Fig. S4b†), the characteristic peaks of carbon are clearly observed at about 1347 and 1590 cm−1 with an intensity ratio (ID/IG) of 1:1, which can be ascribed to the bond stretching of the sp3 hybrid of disordered carbon (D-band) and in-plane vibration of the sp2 hybrid of crystalline carbon (G-band), respectively. The broad peak (G′-band) located at 2755.3 cm−1 could be attributed to the layered structure of the carbon matrix. The full survey of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the as-prepared composite as shown in Fig. 2a further confirms the presence of Bi, C and N. In the high-resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. 2b), the peak at 157.0 eV is attributed to the Bi metal (Bi 4f7/2), and the peaks at 163.9 eV (Bi 4f5/2) and 158.6 eV (Bi 4f7/2) with an energy gap of 5.3 eV are considered to be a transition layer of Bi–O bonds, which is also indexed in O 1s at 529.6 eV as shown in Fig. 2c, between the Bi metal and the carbon layer. The presence of Bi2O3 may be due to the unavoidable oxidation of highly active Bi in the nanoscale during the process of preparation and storage. In the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s (Fig. 2d), the two peaks located at 286.5 and 288.3 eV can be ascribed to C–O/CO bonds, which is consistent with the analysis results of the peaks at 539.8 eV, 532.7 eV and 530.95 eV in high-resolution spectra of O 1s (Fig. 2c). The peaks at 285.1 and 284.5 eV correspond to CC–C/C–N and C–C bonds, respectively. In high-resolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 2e), the peaks at 406.2 eV, 400.5 eV and 398.3 eV are attributed to CN–O, C–N (pyrrolic/quaternary N) and CN (pyridinic N) bonds, indicating that nitrogen atoms are successfully doped into the carbon matrix. The diagram of various nitrogen species in the carbon skeleton is revealed in Fig. 2f, and nitrogen doping can improve the electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix and provide more sodium storage sites. Fig. S4c and d in the ESI† reveals that the BET specific surface area and pore size of ML-Bi@NCSs are 19 m2 g−1 and 9 nm with a typical mesoporous structure, respectively. To further identify the content of ML-Bi@NCSs, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in air (Fig. S5†), and the weight ratio of the N and C content in the as-prepared composite can be estimated to be about 21.5 wt% based on eqn (S1).†\nThe sodium storage performance of ML-Bi@NCSs was evaluated by galvanostatic charge and discharge tests. For comparison, another Bi/N-doped carbon sheet (Bi NPs/NC) was also prepared by mixing with the Bi NPs and N-doped carbon sheets (Fig. S6†). Fig. 3a shows the typical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode for the first five cycles with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1. In the first cathodic scan, four peaks (0.61 V, 0.48 V, 0.38 V and 0.035 V) are clearly observed, indicating a sodiation reaction process from Bi to Na3Bi. Moreover, the broad peaks of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode between 0.05 V and 0.3 V are observed and disappear in the subsequent scans, which are attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and formation of the SEI layer on the surface of active materials. These peaks are not observed in the Bi NPs/NC electrode (Fig. S7†), which may be due to high activity of the obtained ML-Bi@NCSs. In the first anodic process, two sharp peaks (0.61 and 0.75 V) are corresponded to the desodiation process from Na3Bi to NaxBi. After the first cycle, corresponding cathodic and anodic peaks shift close to each other, and the current values increase gradually, indicating high electrochemical activity of the electrode materials.\nFig. 3b shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. A long slope (V) and a small plateau (V) are observed in the first discharge curve, which is ascribed to the sodiation process and the formation of SEI film. This is in good agreement with the above CV profiles, which is different from the Bi NPs/NC electrode containing two obvious plateaus as shown in Fig. S8.† The initial discharge and charge capacities of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode are 783.2 and 511.8 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 65.3%. After the first cycle, the ML-Bi@NCS electrode exhibits two plateaus at 0.70 V and 0.48 V in the discharge process, and two plateaus at 0.6 V and 0.75 V in the charge process, respectively, implying the two-step reaction process of sodiation/desodiation. In the subsequent cycles, the discharge and charge profiles show almost the same electrochemical behaviors, indicating superior sodium storage reversibility. Besides, the ML-Bi@NCS electrode also shows an attractive high-rate capability, as shown in Fig. 3c. The ML-Bi@NCS electrode shows a better rate capability than the Bi NPs/NC electrode, and its coulombic efficiency remains nearly 100% during the whole process even at high current densities, suggesting the excellent reversibility of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode. However, the Bi NPs/NC electrode exhibits poor reversibility with excessive coulombic efficiency over 100%. On increasing current density from 0.2 to 30 A g−1, reversible capacities of 378, 376, 373, 368, 361, 349, 340, 327, and 317 mA h g−1 were obtained for our ML-Bi@NCS electrode (Fig. 3d), respectively. Even at a very high current density of 30 A g−1, it still delivers a highly reversible capacity of 288 mA h g−1. When the current density is reduced back to 0.2 A g−1, a reversible capacity of 370 mA h g−1 can be well recovered, revealing excellent Na+ storage recoverability. To our knowledge, such a rate capability is much better than those of the previously reported Bi-based anode for SIBs (Fig. 3e) including Bi@graphene, arrayed Bi nanorod bundles, Bi@C microspheres, Bi/CFC, Bi-NS@C, bulk Bi, 1D Bi/C nanofibers, Bi nanoflakes/Ni foam, Bi@C nanoplates, Bi@N–C, Bi–C/CF, Bi-RGO, and porous Bi/N–C.\nIn addition to high-rate capability, long cycle life is a very significant property for advanced SIBs as well, but its realization remains a big challenge for the alloy-based anode owing to large Na+ radius and huge volume change of normally over 250% upon sodiation and desodiation. In this work, we examined the long-term cycling measurement at various current densities and mass loadings from 5 to 20 A g−1 for the resulting ML-Bi@NCSs. As shown in Fig. 3f, the ML-Bi@NCS electrode exhibits a high capacity retention of 96.3% after 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1, much higher than that of the Bi NPs/NC electrode (80.7%). A specific capacity of 343 mA h g−1 for ML-Bi@NCSs is obtained after 3000 cycles, higher than that of Bi NPs/NC (255 mA h g−1). The coulombic efficiency of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode is always close to 100%, revealing superior Na+ storage reversibility. Furthermore, long cycle life tests at high mass loadings for ML-Bi@NCSs were also investigated (Fig. 3g). The obtained product can still deliver a high reversible capacity of 295 and 217 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1 with a mass loading of 3.1 and 5.3 mg cm−2, respectively. To further demonstrate superior battery performance of the as-prepared ML-Bi@NCS electrode, ultralong cycling behaviors at a ultra-high current density of 10 and 20 A g−1 were also measured, as shown in Fig. 3h and i. The reversible specific capacities of Bi@NCSs are 347 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1 (capacity retentions: 95.8%) and 309 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles at 20 A g−1 (capacity retentions: 90.6%). Such findings fully reveal that the unique hierarchical hybrid structure built from 0D ultrasmall nanospheres and highly conductive 2D NCSs as well as their robust coupling and multi-layered structure assembly should account for the above excellent sodium storage performance, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The battery performance of ML-Bi@NCSs for the sodium-ion battery anode is compared to that of the reported bismuth metal based electrode as listed in Table 1. Our electrode presents higher discharge specific capacity and better cycle performance with high current density and mass loading than most of the reported Bi-based electrodes after long cycles.\nTo understand the reaction kinetics of ML-Bi@NCSs, CV measurements at different scan rates were carried out (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4a, the potential of anodic and cathodic peaks shifts regularly only in small amounts to the opposite direction with an increase in sweep rate, indicating good reversibility and slight polarization of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode. Furthermore, the logarithm of anodic and cathodic peak currents (I) is proportional to the logarithm of the scan rate (v) with slope values (b) between 0.5 and 1 according to eqn (S2) and (S3)† (Fig. 4b), indicating a process controlled by both surface capacitive behavior and diffusion. The pseudocapacitive contribution ratio of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode can be calculated with eqn (S4) and (S5).† As shown in Fig. 4c, its pseudocapacitive contribution ratio reaches 98.3% of the total capacity at a sweep rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The high capacitive contribution ratio of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode can be attributed to the 3D multi-layered hybrid nanostructure assembly of 0D Bi nanospheres and 2D nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets, and the stacked layers with nanospheres in the open interlayers can offer more active sites to adsorb/desorb Na+ ions rapidly during the fast sodiation/desodiation processes at large current densities. In addition, the pseudocapacitive contribution ratio of the total capacity rises gradually with an increase in sweep rates (Fig. 4d), because the Na+ ion diffusion rate meets the neutralization requirements with electronics. Compared with the Bi NPs/NC electrode (Fig. S9†), the ML-Bi@NCS electrode shows a higher pseudocapacitive contribution ratio, indicating higher capacity during the rate test, especially at a large current density. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4e, according to the Randles–Sevcik equation (eqn (S6)†), the peak current (Ip) is proportional to the square root of sweep rate (v), and the ML-Bi@NCS electrode shows a bigger diffusion coefficient (2.51 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) than that of the Bi NPs/NC electrode (1.47 × 10−4 cm2 s−1), indicating the faster sodium-ion extraction/insertion of ML-Bi@NCSs at large current density.\nThe galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was used to analyze the changing regularity of diffusion coefficient (DGITTNa+). According to eqn (S7),† the diffusion coefficient (DGITTNa+) values are calculated ranging from 10−7 to 10−4 cm2 s−1, which is consistent with the CV results. As shown in Fig. 4f, the diffusion coefficient (DGITTNa+) decreases and becomes stable gradually at the first two discharge platforms during the sodiation process, which is attributed to the blocking channels and increasing length for the diffusion of sodium ions along with the volume expansion of crystal cells. During the desodiation process, the diffusion coefficient (DGITTNa+) values at the last two charge platforms present an inverse regularity due to the gradually clearing obstacles on the diffusion channels and the decreasing diffusion length for sodium ions. The longer platforms and higher diffusion coefficients (DGITTNa+) of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode suggest a higher accommodation capacity for sodium ions and the faster sodiation process than the Bi NPs/NC electrode. In addition, the high diffusion coefficient (DGITTNa+) of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode is much stable at the end of the sodiation process and decreases gradually at the beginning of the desodiation process, which can be ascribed to the unique structure of orderly stacked N-doped carbon sheets with a high surface capacitive behavior for the sodium storage.\nIn order to further investigate charge transfer kinetics, the Nyquist plots of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode for the fresh and cycled state were fitted with the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz, and the results are presented in Fig. 5a–d. The Nyquist plots are composed of a depressed semicircle in the high frequency region and an inclined line in the low frequency region, which is related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the diffusion processes of sodium ions, respectively. The equivalent circuit and fitting data of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the ML-Bi@NCS electrode are shown in Fig. S11 and Table S1,† respectively. In the fresh cell, the ohmic resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode (Fig. 5a) are around 33.01 and 62.11 Ω, respectively. After the activation process (the 1st cycle) as shown in Fig. 5b, Rs and Rct in the ML-Bi@NCS electrode reduce to 2.01 and 1.7 Ω, corresponding to the formation of stable SEI layers on the surface of electrode materials owing to its unique 0D⊂2D⊂3D multi-layered hybrid nanostructures. Thus, there is no evident change for Rs and Rct of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode after the 1st and the 100th cycle (Fig. 5c). In contrast, the Bi NPs/NC electrode needs to undergo several tens of cycles for forming relatively stable SEI film on the surface of electrode, thus leading to a large difference of electrolyte resistance for the 1st cycle and the 100th cycle (Fig. 5b and c). After 100 cycles, the SEI interface layer of Bi NPs/NC gradually becomes stable, resulting in similar Rs and Rct data to those of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode in Fig. 5c. After 3000 cycles, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the Bi NPs/NC electrode has significantly increased to 16.5 Ω, and the ohmic resistance (Rs) also slightly increases at a current density of 5 A g−1 (Fig. 5d), which is attributed to the pulverization of the free Bi nanospheres with the limited supporting role of the N-doped carbon matrix. Noticeably, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the ML-Bi@NCS electrode decreases to 0.24 Ω, and the ohmic resistance (Rs) is still stable during the cycling, suggesting its stable SEI film and high transfer rate of electrons and Na+ ions.\nFig. 5e–g shows the SEM images and digital photos of the Bi NPs/NC electrode and the ML-Bi@NCS electrode for SIBs after 3500 cycles at 5 A g−1 compared with the fresh electrode. The fresh electrode possesses a smooth surface, and the dried slurry is attached on the Cu current collector uniformly (Fig. 5e). However, for the Bi NPs/NC electrode, Bi particles agglomerate into large particles and cannot form strong physical contacts with N-doped carbon sheets, causing insufficient space to buffer the volume expansion of active materials during cycling, especially at a high current density over 5 A g−1. As shown in the insert image of the Bi NPs/NC electrode in Fig. 5f, fast sodiation/desodiation processes produce a large structural stress, which cannot be eliminated or buffered in time, resulting in the separation of active components from the binder and the conductive agent, and finally exfoliation from the current collector. By observing the residual material on the current collector with SEM, many big holes and bare N-doped carbon sheets appear, suggesting the degradation of electrochemical performance of the Bi NPs/NC electrode after long-term cycling. In contrast, the exfoliation phenomenon of the ML-Bi@NCS electrode is not obvious, even if a small amount of pulverized particles and eroded holes can be observed on the surface of the electrode in Fig. 5g, which is probably attributed to the powerful supporting and buffering effect of the unique structure for the Bi nanospheres with volume expansion/contraction. Compared with the EDS mapping (Bi, C, and N) of the Bi NPs/NC (a–c) and ML-Bi@NCS electrode (d–f) after 3500 cycles at 5 A g−1, there are no obvious differences on the signal intensities of carbon and nitrogen elements between the Bi NPs/NC (Fig. S12b and c†) and ML-Bi@NCS electrode (Fig. S12e and f†), but the signal intensity of the Bi element on the ML-Bi@NCS electrode (Fig. S12d†) is much stronger than that on the Bi NPs/NC electrode (Fig. S12a†), which is well consistent with the result of a lot of active materials falling off the current collector as shown in Fig. 5f. Such results confirm that the as-prepared multi-layered unique hybrid nanoarchitectures are obviously robust enough to endure repeated Na+ insertion/extraction processes, leading not only to superior high-rate capability, but also to excellent long cycling life.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\nSynthesis of ML-Bi@NCSs sample\nBriefly, 1.5 mmol bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, ≥99.0%, Sinopharm reagent), 1.5 mmol citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, ≥99.8%, Sinopharm\xa0reagent) and 100 mg of dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, ≥98.0%, Sinopharm\xa0reagent) were mixed with 15 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (C3H7NO, ≥99.5%, Sinopharm\xa0reagent). Then, the mixture was magnetically stirred for 12 h at 70 °C to evaporate the solvent to dryness adequately. Finally, the resultant composite was pre-sintered for 1 h at 350 °C and directly programmed heated up to 600 °C for 2 h for further sintering in an argon atmosphere with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The N-doped carbon was obtained during the same fabrication process just without bismuth nitrate pentahydrate.\n\nSynthesis of the Bi NPs/NC sample\nFirstly, 50 mL of NaBH4 aqueous solution (3 mM) was dripped in 50 mL of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O aqueous suspension (3 mM) slowly with a magnetic stirring speed of 500 rpm, and held for 1 hour. Then, the Bi NPs were obtained after centrifugation and following the vacuum drying procedure. Finally, the Bi NPs/NC sample was obtained by mixing the Bi NPs sample with N-doped carbon. The weight ratio is 78.5:21.5, which is the same as that of the TGA result of the ML-Bi@NCSs sample.\n\nMaterials characterization\nXRD data were recorded using an X-ray powder diffractometer (MiniFlex 600, Rigaku, Japan). The morphology and EDAX data of samples were recorded on a SEM (MIRA3, TESCAN, Czech and Helios NanoLab G3 UC, FEI, America) and a TEM (Titan G260-300). XPS was performed using a Thermo Fischer EscaLab Xi+ spectrometer equipped with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energy of the XPS data was calibrated with reference to the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) arising from adventitious carbon. Raman spectrum analysis was conducted on a WITec alpha300 R Raman Spectrometer. The laser power on the sample is 10 mW. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (STA 449F3, NETZSCH, Germany) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 30 to 900 °C in air. The N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was carried out on a JW-BK200C (Beijing JWGB Sci.&Tech. Co., Ltd) gas adsorption analyser at 77 K after the sample was first degassed at 448 K overnight. Specific surface areas and mesopore size distribution were obtained based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and BJH analysis of the desorption branches of the isotherm, respectively.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nThe active materials, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder, and super P Li (70, 20, and 10 wt%, respectively) were prepared as a mixed slurry with a solvent of deionized water. The deionized water was made using a pure water machine (HHitech, ECO-S15Q) with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm. The mixed slurry was coated on the Cu foil (as the working electrode) and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The mass loading of the active material on electrode film was 1 ± 0.2, 3.1 and 5.3 mg cm−2. The counter electrode and reference electrode were both trimmed sodium chips. The electrolyte was 1 M NaPF6 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME). The assembly process of two-electrode (CR2032) coin cells was performed in an argon-filled glove box (Super 1220/750, Mikrouna, Shanghai, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were both recorded using an electrochemical workstation (CS 2350, Corrtest, Wuhan, China). EIS was carried out in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an amplitude of 5 mV. The CVs were between 0.01 V and 1.5 V (vs. Na+/Na). Galvanostatic charge–discharge and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements were carried out on a battery testing system (BTS4008, Neware, Shenzhen, China) between 0.01 and 1.5 V at a current density of 50 mA g−1 (power-on for 500 s and then power-off for 3000 s). During the long-term cycle process, the cells were pre-treated by charging/discharging for at least 1 cycle with a small current density of 0.1 A g−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nAs shown in Scheme 1, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) polyhedra consisting of Co2+ and 2-methylimidazolate linkers were firstly carbonized in an inert atmosphere to generate ultrafine Co nanocrystals uniformly distributed into the simultaneously formed nitrogen/oxygen co-doped carbon matrix (denoted as Co@NC). Owing to the catalysis of the generated Co nanocrystals, several short-range graphene layers grow on their surface during the carbonization process. Moreover, the resulting carbon matrix exhibits channel-connected porous structures because of the release of gaseous molecules (H2O, NO2, etc.) from the decomposition of the ligands. Then, the above obtained sample was subjected to a hydrothermal oxidation process to transform Co to Co3O4 (denoted as Co3O4@NC), and then etched with acid to obtain NOPCP with nanographite domains and large numbers of channel-connected cavities. Therefore, the resulting NOPCP can not only improve the structural stability for ion insertion and extraction, but also can be beneficial for the fast transfer of ions and electrons, improving the electrochemical performances for LIBs/SIBs.\nZeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) were synthesized through the coprecipitation of Co2+ and 2-methylimidazolate at room temperature (a detailed experimental procedure is described in the ESI†). The power X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S1†) is consistent with the simulated one for ZIF-67. The resulting ZIF-67 material exhibits a regular polyhedral morphology with size approximately 1μm (Fig. S2†). Based on the thermogravimetric analysis under a nitrogen flow (Fig. S3a†), ZIF-67 was carbonized at 600 °C to generate ultrafine Co nanocrystals distributed in the carbon matrix (Fig. S4 and 5†). The Co nanocrystals can be easily oxidized into Co3O4 in the thermal process (Fig. S6†), and the morphology has not changed (Fig. S7†). After the removal of Co3O4 by acid etching, as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1a and b), the final sample (denoted as NOPCP-600) can be successfully obtained without any damage to the morphology. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that a large number of cavities are distributed in the carbon matrix and are connected to each other through channels. In addition, it is clearly seen that there are several low-range graphene layers on the inner surface of the cavities (Fig. 1e and f). Furthermore, the corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 1g–i) of resulting NOPCP-600 show that the nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms are uniformly distributed in the carbon matrix. In comparison, NOPCP-700 exhibits a similar morphology to that of NOPCP-600 (Fig. S8†). In addition, on the basis of the TG curve of Cu-BTC (Fig. S2b†), pure carbon polyhedra (denoted as PCP) were synthesized through the direct carbonization of Cu-BTC followed by Fe3+ etching. As shown in Fig. S9,† the as-prepared PCP shows a polyhedral morphology similar to that of Cu-BTC.\nFig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of NOPCP-600, NOPCP-700 and PCP. In the patterns of NOPCP-600 and NOPCP-700, the two peaks at 25 and 44° can be indexed to the (002) and (101) lattice planes of graphite, and the peaks are so sharp and strong, indicating a high degree of graphitization. Nevertheless, PCP displays a typical characteristic of amorphous carbon. As shown in Fig. 2b, the Raman spectrum of NOPCP-600 shows the coexistence of two obvious peaks, which can be attributed to the representative D-band (1345 cm−1) and G-band (1590 cm−1) peaks of carbon materials, respectively. The peak for the D-band is stronger than that for the G-band (ID/IG = 1.06), indicating the highly disordered and defective structures of NOPCP-600, which can provide active sites (defects and edge doping sites) for the sorption of both Li+ and Na+.Fig. 2c shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of NOPCP-600. NOPCP-600 exhibits a type IV adsorption isotherm with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of 373 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 1.34 cm3 g−1. Moreover, the average pore size is 14.42 nm. These porous characteristics are beneficial for the transfer of the electrolyte and ions in NOPCP-600 and provide additional capacitive contribution for both LIBs and SIBs. The surface chemical composition and valence state of NOPCP-600 were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2d, the survey spectrum shows three distinct peaks, corresponding to O 1s, N 1s and C 1s, respectively. Furthermore, the N and O contents in NOPCP-600 are approximately 10.66 and 15.0 at%, respectively. This result also demonstrates the successful introduction of O and N atoms into the carbon matrix. The N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2e) can be deconvoluted into three peaks, pyridinic N (N-5, 398.7 eV), pyrrolic N (N-5, 400.0 eV) and graphitic N (N-Q, 400.7 eV). The N-5 and N-6 contents measured from the fitting result of N 1s are 19.57 and 31.58%, respectively, and they serve as electrochemical active sites for the sorption of Li+ and Na+ to enhance the capacity of NOPCP-600 for both LIBs and SIBs. Furthermore, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2f) can be deconvoluted into three peaks located at binding energies of 531.3, 532.4 and 533.5 eV, which can be attributed to CO, C–O–C or C–OH and COOH, respectively. With an increase of the carbonization temperature, as shown in Fig. S9,† the contents of N and O in NOPCP-700 decrease to 2.56 and 12.97 at%, respectively. In addition, PCP only has two elements, C and O (Fig. S10†). These oxygen-based groups are also beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical performance of carbon materials. Therefore, these unique structural characteristics ensure that NOPCP could have excellent electrochemical performance for both LIBs and SIBs.\nThe electrochemical performance of NOPCP-600 was evaluated in half-cells versus Li/Li+ and Na/Na+, respectively. NOPCP was first investigated as an anode material for LIBs. Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of NOPCP-600 at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (vs. Li/Li+). Two broad peaks at approximately 1.50 and 0.75 V only appear in the first cathodic curve, and can be attributed to the generation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) films and the sorption of Li+ with active sites (defects and edge doping sites) in NOPCP-600. Moreover, the anodic peak at approximately 1.25 V can be assigned to the desorption of Li+ in NOPCP-600. Besides, after the initial cycle, the CV curves overlap well, implying the excellent reversibility of the NOPCP-600 electrode. Fig. 3b shows the charge/discharge profiles of NOPCP at 0.1 A g−1. The initial discharge and charge capacities of NOPCP-600 are 2062 and 1479 mA h g−1, respectively, resulting in an initial coulombic efficiency of 56.85%. The initial capacity fading can be attributed to the formation of SEI films caused by the large specific surface area of NOPCP-600 and the occurrence of irreversible reactions. The cycling stability of NOPCP-600 was further investigated at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 3c). NOPCP-600 still recovers a discharge capacity of 1663 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles, which is approximately 99.17% of the second discharge capacity. After 5 cycles, it is found that the coulombic efficiency remains above 95%, indicating a good cycling stability. For comparison, the reversible capacities for NOPCP-700 and PCP are 1277 and 590 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 over 80 cycles, respectively. Rate capability and long-term cycling stability are two other important parameters to evaluate electrode materials for practical applications in batteries. Fig. 3d shows the rate capability of NOPCP-600 at various current densities from 0.1 to 1.6 A g−1. It can deliver reversible capacities of 1437, 1251, 1105, 970 and 775 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 A g−1, respectively. When the current density is decreased back to 0.1 A g−1 again, a discharge capacity of 1679 mA h g−1 can be retained after 100 cycles. In order to investigate the long-term cycling performance of NOPCP-600, a high current density of 2 A g−1 was applied as shown in Fig. 3e. A high reversible discharge capacity of 667 mA h g−1 can still be achieved even after 1000 cycles, indicating a good reversibility of NOPCP-600. The NOPCP-600 electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability at both low and high current densities, which is superior to those of other carbon-based anodes for LIBs (Table S1†).\nNOPCP-600 was also investigated as an anode material for SIBs. Fig. 4a shows the initial three CV curves of NOPCP-600 at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. A broad peak at approximately 1.5 V appears in the first cathodic process and disappears in the subsequent cycles, which can be attributed to the formation of SEI films and the occurrence of other side reactions. In addition, the broad peak at approximately 0.25 V can be ascribed to the insertion of Na+ into the interlayer of graphite and the sorption of Na+ with active sites (defects and edge doping sites) in NOPCP-600. Notably, the subsequent CV curves overlap well, suggesting an excellent reversibility of the NOPCP-600 electrode. Fig. 4b shows the charge/discharge profiles of the NOPCP electrode with various cycles at 0.1 A g−1. The first charge capacity of 426 mA h g−1 can still be maintained with an initial coulombic efficiency of 30.41%. The initial capacity fading can be assigned to the other side reactions and the formation of SEI films, which is consistent with the results of CV. After 100 cycles, NOPCP-600 exhibits a discharge capacity of 313 mA h g−1. For comparison, the reversible capacities for NOPCP-700 and PCP are 238 and 210 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 over 80 cycles, respectively. In addition, NOPCP-600 shows a superior rate performance. As shown in Fig. 4d, it delivers reversible capacities of 358, 315, 272, 250, 234, and 220 mA h g−1 at various current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 A g−1, respectively. When the current density was decreased back to 0.1 A g−1, a reversible capacity of 305 mA h g−1 was maintained after 80 cycles, indicating the good stability of NOPCP-600 at various current densities. The long-term cycling stability of NOPCP-600 at a high current density at 1 A g−1 for SIBs was further evaluated (Fig. 4e). A reversible capacity of 228 mA h g−1 can still be maintained after 2000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%, implying the good reversibility of NOPCP-600. As shown in Fig. 3e and 4e, with an increase of the cycle number, the capacity shows a gradual increase for both LIBs and SIBs during cycling, which is attributed to the gradual activation of the porous structure. This characteristic is common in a large number of porous materials. NOPCP-600 exhibits excellent sodium-storage performance, which is superior to those of other carbon-based anodes for SIBs (Table S2†).\nTo better understand the Li+- and Na+-storage mechanism in NOPCP-600, its electrochemical kinetics was investigated by CV measurements. Fig. 5a and d show the CV curves of NOPCP-600 at different scan rates ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 mV s−1 for both LIBs and SIBs, respectively. Generally, it is considered that the capacitive process and diffusion-controlled process co-exist in porous electrode materials for both LIBs and SIBs. According to the power-law, the contribution ratio of capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes can be described by the following equations:\nwhere i and v are the peak current and the corresponding scan rate, respectively, and a and b represent the constants in the equation. The value of b reflects the electrochemical mechanism for the storage of Li+ and Na+. The value of b approaches to 0.5, indicating an ideal diffusion-controlled process. Meanwhile, the value of b approaching to 1 suggests the capacitive process. As shown in Fig. S12,† the b values at the anodic and cathodic peaks are 0.68 and 0.79 for LIBs, respectively. Meanwhile, for SIBs, as shown in Fig. S13,† the b values at the anodic and cathodic peaks are 0.73 and 0.79, respectively. These results indicate that NOPCP-600 makes a large capacitive contribution to the total capacity for both LIBs and SIBs. Therefore, the capacitive contribution can be further calculated according to the following equation: where i(V) is the current value at a certain voltage, and k1v and k2v1/2 correspond to the contribution from the capacitive and diffusion controlled processes, respectively. Fig. 5b and e show the capacitive contribution at 2 mV s−1 for both LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The capacitive contributions for LIBs are 25, 31, 35, 44 and 60% at scan rates of 0.2, 0.6, 1, 2 and 5 mV s−1, respectively (Fig. 5c). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 5f, the values for SIBs are 41, 50, 57, 64 and 77%, respectively. In addition, as shown in Fig. S14 and S15,† both PCP and NOPCP-700 show a large capacitive contribution to both Li/Na storage performances. It is well known that the capacitive contribution plays a vital role in fast ion diffusion and rapid electron transfer. NOPCP-600 contains lots of well distributed channel-connected cavities with their inner surface decorated with a large number of N and O atoms, which is beneficial for ion diffusion and transport and provides extra active sites for the sorption of Li+ and Na+. In addition, NOPCP-600 with a large BET surface area and high heteroatom doping content (N and O) exhibits an enhanced capacitive effect, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance for both LIBs and SIBs.\nIn order to further explore the superior cycling stability of NOPCP-600, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out to investigate NOPCP-600, NOPCP-700 and PCP during the discharge/charge processes. In Fig. S16a and S17a,† it is clearly seen that the kinetic characteristic of NOPCP-600 for both LIBs and SIBs is superior to those of NOPCP-700 and PCP, demonstrating a relatively low diffusion barrier in NOPCP-600. Moreover, the EIS curves (Fig. S16b and S17b†) of NOPCP-600 for both LIBs and SIBs are hardly changed after 100 cycles, implying its high reversible stability. The diffusion kinetics of the Na+ diffusion coefficient (DNa+) was further explored by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). As shown in Fig. S18 and S19,† NOPCP-600 exhibits a higher DNa+ than NOPCP-700 and PCP during the discharge/charge processes, confirming that NPCs-600 exhibits the fastest kinetics performance owing to its unique structure containing large numbers of channel-connected cavities with their inner surface decorated with a large number of N and O atoms, which can provide a large number of active sites (defects and edge doping sites) for the sorption of Li+/Na+.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Material synthesis\nAll chemicals used in the experiment are of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Typically, 328 mg of 2-methylimidazole and 249 mg of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate were separately dispersed in 25 ml of methanol with magnetic stirring for 3 min and then mixed under stirring at room temperature. After aging at room temperature for 24 h, the resulting purple sample was collected by centrifugation, washed with methanol, and finally dried in a vacuum oven overnight. Then, the purple sample was further carbonized in N2 at 600 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to form Co nanoparticles embedded in a porous carbon matrix. 30 mg of the carbonized sample was ultrasonically dispersed in 30 ml of water, and 2 ml of hydrogen peroxide was added into the above solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting sample was collected by centrifugation, and etched with hot nitric acid. The etched sample (denoted as NOPCP-600) was washed with plenty of water until pH = 7, then washed with ethanol, and finally dried in a vacuum oven overnight. In order to explore the effect of the carbonization temperature on the potassium storage performance of the resulting carbon material, NOPCP-700 was synthesized under the same conditions as those of NOPCP-600 except for the carbonization temperature of 700 °C. For comparison, a pure carbon material (denoted as PCP) was synthesized through the direct carbonization of Cu-BTC in N2 at 600 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 followed by the etching process with Fe3+.\n\n2.2. Characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all as-prepared samples were collected in the range from 10 to 70° by using a X-ray diffractometer (Japan Rigaku D/MAX-γA) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700 M) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) were performed on all as-prepared samples to investigate their microstructures and morphologies. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Shimadzu-50 thermoanalyser under flowing N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The specific surface area and pore structure were measured by using a sorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) at 77 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were collected by using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Raman spectra were recorded in the range from 200 to 3000 cm−1 on a LABRAM-HR Raman spectrometer under 532 nm laser excitation.\n\n2.3. Electrochemical measurements\nThe as-prepared sample was examined as an anode material for lithium/sodium ion batteries. The lithium/sodium-storage performance was measured using a CR2032 coin-type cell assembled in an argon-filled glove box with the concentrations of oxygen and moisture below 1 ppm (MBRAUN UNILAB PRO, SP (1800/780)). The homogeneous slurry for the working electrodes was prepared by mixing the as-prepared sample (80%), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 10%), and carbon black (10%) with the addition of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Finally, the homogeneous slurry was coated on a copper current collector, and transferred to a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The loading mass of the working electrode is about 0.8 mg. Li and Na were used as the counter electrodes for LIBs and NIBs, respectively. For LIBs, the Celgard 2400 polypropylene film was used as the cell separator, and the electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 in volume). For NIBs, glass fiber (GF/D) from Whatman was used as the separator, and the electrolyte was 1 M NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC:DEC = 1:1) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The electrochemical performances for LIBs/NIBs were measured by a galvanostatic charge/discharge technique in the range of 0.01–3.0 V at different current densities using a battery testing system (Neware). Electrochemical CV measurements were performed on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Material synthesis\nAll chemicals used in the experiment are of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Typically, 328 mg of 2-methylimidazole and 249 mg of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate were separately dispersed in 25 ml of methanol with magnetic stirring for 3 min and then mixed under stirring at room temperature. After aging at room temperature for 24 h, the resulting purple sample was collected by centrifugation, washed with methanol, and finally dried in a vacuum oven overnight. Then, the purple sample was further carbonized in N2 at 600 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to form Co nanoparticles embedded in a porous carbon matrix. 30 mg of the carbonized sample was ultrasonically dispersed in 30 ml of water, and 2 ml of hydrogen peroxide was added into the above solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting sample was collected by centrifugation, and etched with hot nitric acid. The etched sample (denoted as NOPCP-600) was washed with plenty of water until pH = 7, then washed with ethanol, and finally dried in a vacuum oven overnight. In order to explore the effect of the carbonization temperature on the potassium storage performance of the resulting carbon material, NOPCP-700 was synthesized under the same conditions as those of NOPCP-600 except for the carbonization temperature of 700 °C. For comparison, a pure carbon material (denoted as PCP) was synthesized through the direct carbonization of Cu-BTC in N2 at 600 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 followed by the etching process with Fe3+.\n\n2.2. Characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all as-prepared samples were collected in the range from 10 to 70° by using a X-ray diffractometer (Japan Rigaku D/MAX-γA) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700 M) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) were performed on all as-prepared samples to investigate their microstructures and morphologies. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Shimadzu-50 thermoanalyser under flowing N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The specific surface area and pore structure were measured by using a sorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) at 77 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were collected by using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Raman spectra were recorded in the range from 200 to 3000 cm−1 on a LABRAM-HR Raman spectrometer under 532 nm laser excitation.\n\n2.3. Electrochemical measurements\nThe as-prepared sample was examined as an anode material for lithium/sodium ion batteries. The lithium/sodium-storage performance was measured using a CR2032 coin-type cell assembled in an argon-filled glove box with the concentrations of oxygen and moisture below 1 ppm (MBRAUN UNILAB PRO, SP (1800/780)). The homogeneous slurry for the working electrodes was prepared by mixing the as-prepared sample (80%), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 10%), and carbon black (10%) with the addition of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Finally, the homogeneous slurry was coated on a copper current collector, and transferred to a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The loading mass of the working electrode is about 0.8 mg. Li and Na were used as the counter electrodes for LIBs and NIBs, respectively. For LIBs, the Celgard 2400 polypropylene film was used as the cell separator, and the electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 in volume). For NIBs, glass fiber (GF/D) from Whatman was used as the separator, and the electrolyte was 1 M NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC:DEC = 1:1) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The electrochemical performances for LIBs/NIBs were measured by a galvanostatic charge/discharge technique in the range of 0.01–3.0 V at different current densities using a battery testing system (Neware). Electrochemical CV measurements were performed on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Channel 1 contains a Tween surfactant/kerosene solution (solution 1), channel 2 contained a mixture of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and NaNO3 in deionized water (solution 2). The two solutions were connected through a T-fitting. Due to the immiscibility of kerosene and water, the flow is segmented, i.e., each segment contains alternating mixtures of channel 1 or 2. Preliminary experiments were carried out to produce an emulsion inside the tubes. Fig. S1† indicates ultrasonicating of both mixtures to be sufficient to form an emulsion. Channel 3 contains kerosene (solution 3), which passes an oil bath with T = 180 °C. After passing the oil bath, the hot kerosene and the emulsion were mixed by a T-segment. The resulting mixture was collected, and water and kerosene were removed through a spiral-type condenser. The final product was obtained by heating the resulting powder under argon for 4 hours at 800 °C. Fig. 2 illustrates the sequence of the synthetic steps schematically.\nCompared to the emulsion/drying techniques, the reaction time could be reduced by a factor 8. The most time-consuming steps were the combination of solution 1 and 2, and combining the resulting emulsion with solution 3. By setting appropriate flow rates for each channel, we were able to avoid long reaction times and quadruple the yield (1.28 g h−1) within a given time period. The post-treatment, i.e. the removal of the solvent and heating in the oven, generally takes longer than the synthesis of the precursors. However, since the post-treatment is identical for both, flask and microfluidic synthesis, it is not taken into account in this comparison.\nThe final product was obtained by heating the residue under argon (to avoid oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr4+ or Cr6+) for 4 hours at 800 °C after removing water and kerosene. An annealing temperature of 800 °C was needed to obtain single-phase NaCrO2. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns (Fig. 3) of the products obtained at different annealing temperatures (400–700 °C) always showed the formation of NaCrO2 with minor impurities (Fig. 3). The XRPD pattern for of a typical product obtained at an annealing temperature below 400 °C is shown in Fig. S2.† The synthesis was carried out on a ten-fold scale compared to the flask synthesis.\nRietveld refinements of the product obtained by annealing at 800 °C (Fig. 4A) shows the formation of a highly crystalline product. The published crystal structure data were used as a starting point for the Rietveld refinements. The atom positions were held constant. Lattice parameters, anisotropic peak broadening and preferred orientation were refined. Further information is provided in Table S1 (ESI†). For Na1−xCrO2 (x = 0) the O3-structure type of is preferred because of the stochiometry. With increasing x, the P2-Type is favored.\nA HRTEM image of a single crystal platelet (Fig. 4B) shows well-defined lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 5.33 Å corresponding to the (003) plane. The corresponding diffraction pattern shows a single set of reflections confirming that the particles are either single crystalline or contain several domains sharing identical facets. SEM images confirm the platelike morphology of the particles (Fig. S2A†), and the elemental mapping (Fig. S2B and C†) shows the presence of Na and Cr. The HRTEM overview (Fig. S3†) image shows the formation of polydisperse platelets with diameters between 58 and 340 nm (further information in Table S2†). XPS survey spectra show the presence of Na, Cr and O surface species (Fig. 4C). The high-resolution image of the Cr 2p spectrum shows the positions at 577 eV (2p3/2) and at 587 eV (2p1/2) (Fig. 4D), compatible with the presence of Cr3+(peak positions for Cr4 are located at 580 eV and latter 588 eV).\nNucleation and growth of NaCrO2 require a short annealing at 400 °C (Fig. 3). The XPRD pattern and Raman spectrum of the oily pre-annealed intermediate (Fig. 5A and B) show only the presence of NaNO3 (melting point of 308 °C). NaNO3 is a well-known medium in melt-assisted synthesis. Materials synthesis in the liquid phase utilizes (similar as solution chemistry) a “solvent” where the diffusion of the reactants is no longer the limiting factor of the reaction and product formation is controlled by the nucleation barrier. Thus, salt melt synthesis emerges as an important complementary route to conventional liquid phase synthesis, because it allows lowering the reaction temperatures of conventional solid state reactions from 800–1000 °C to the operational temperature range of the salt melt (here ∼350 °C).\nThe vibration bands at 1385 (ν3) and 725 cm−1 (ν4) and the band at 185 cm−1 can be assigned to the Eg modes and the libration mode of the nitrate anion. The vibration at 1068 cm−1 belongs to the A1g (ν4). Two vibrations of the annealed product (Fig. 5C) at 450 and 572 cm−1 (A1g) are compatible with the Cr–O vibrations in NaCrO2. No vibrations of the starting compound NaNO3 occurred after annealing, i.e., indicating that the transformation is complete.\nThe reactants Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and NaNO3 are dispersed in reverse micelles, which are aggregates of the amphiphile in the hydrocarbon kerosene. The polar head groups of the surfactant molecules point toward the center of the aggregate and form a core that can solubilize the reactants in water. These “waterpools” or “nanoreactors” can vary in size and form the medium that encapsulates the reactants during emulsion-drying. During the removal of water and kerosene in the spiral type condenser, the micelles precipitate while the reactants are still encapsulated and intermixed on an atomic level and in an appropriate ratio. The synthesis of metal and semiconductor clusters or VS2 nanotubes have been reported in reverse micelle systems.\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) data Fig. S6† confirm the formation of Tween micelles in water with micelle diameters of 38 nm ± 1 nm (Tween#85 in Kerosene) and 44.9 nm ± 1 nm (Tween#85 in DI water). Error bars represent standard deviation over radii of all measured angles, as there is no significant q2-dependence. The observed isotropic scattering does not allow us to extract information other than the radius of gyration from the DLS data, but Tween#85 was reported to form spherical micelles in the concentration range used for synthesis. DLS measurement with nitrates of the transition metals dissolved in water was not possible because the absorption of the laser by the transition compounds was too high to allow recording meaningful DLS data. Likewise, laser scanning microscopy images of the NaNO3/Cr(NO3)3 reactant mixture inside Tween micelles (Fig. S5†) are compatible with an isotropic morphology of the micelles.\nThe “nanoreactors” reduce transport distances to dimensions on the order of a few nanometers, compared to transport lengths in the range of a few micrometers in conventional solid-state reactions. It is even more crucial when one recalls that the diffusion coefficients in the solid state typically are typically the range of 10−16 to 10−12 cm2 s−1. As a result, solid-state reactions require high thermal activation and long reaction times. The shortening of transport paths and subsequent reaction in NaNO3 salt melts bypasses the diffusion-controlled formation of the oxidic products in solids and makes nucleation the rate-determining step of the reaction.\nThe Tween micelles collapse upon heating. NaNO3 melts at 308 °C and serves as (i) a low-melting flux and (ii) a Na+ supply for the solid state reaction of Cr(NO3)3 to NaCrO2. The final step of the thermal decomposition of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O occurs at ≈450 °C. This explains why no NaCrO2 was obtained for temperatures below 400 °C. The surfactant is oxidized by the remaining nitrate ions to CO2 and H2O. Laser scanning microscopy images of the pre-annealed sample (Fig. S6A and B†) show isotropic precursor “droplets” in support of our working hypothesis.\nThe 23Na solid state NMR spectrum of the pre-annealed sample (Fig. 5D black) shows a single resonance at δ = −8.01 ppm (with respect to solid NaCl), which perfectly matches to the sodium signal in NaNO3. This sharp spectral line disappears in the 23Na-NMR spectrum of the annealed product (Fig. 5D red) which confirms the complete transformation of the starting product. Instead, three broad 23Na resonances appear in the NMR spectrum indicating three new sodium environments. Measurements at different spinning frequencies were carried out to distinguish the centerband from the spinning sideband envelope (Fig. S7A and B†). Assuming that the major 23Na shift contribution arises due to the chromium ions in the first coordination sphere and that there are no significant interactions between the paramagnets at ambient temperature the significant low field shift of ca. −270 ppm of one of the 23Na lines is due to the hyperfine interaction with Cr3+. Fig. 5E shows the polarization mechanism related with the negative sign of the spin density transferred to the Na 3s orbital. Two unassigned sodium resonances appear in the 23Na NMR spectrum of the annealed product. Their shifts are in the spectral range for sodium in diamagnetic compounds. These bands have no correspondence in the X-ray diffraction pattern. The IR spectra (which can detect crystalline and non-crystalline species) do not show vibrational bands of chromate, nitrate, nitrate or peroxide anions or organic groups.\nFurther confirmation for the success of the synthesis comes from a comparison of the 1H-NMR spectra (Fig. S8†) of pre-annealed and annealed samples. Proton resonances originating from the surfactant molecules involved in micelle formation in the product mixture are clearly present in the pre-annealed product, whereas these signals disappear in the 1H NMR spectrum of the product after annealing at 800 °C. The respective C–H vibrations after annealing are absent in the FTIR spectra (Fig. S9†).\nFig. 5F shows the TG/DTG/DSC traces of the pre-annealed product. In order to avoid the oxidation of Cr3+ to higher oxidation states inert gas conditions were used. The TG trace reveals a mass loss of 64.1% in 5 different stages. The first stage corresponds to a mass loss of 10.5%. The DSC trace shows an endothermic process at around 100 °C indicating the evaporation of water as an explanation of the first stage mass loss. The 2nd stage mass loss of 13.9% at ∼135 °C is attributed to kerosene evaporation. Bello et al. reported an onset temperature of 135 °C for pure kerosene. The third stage shows a significant mass loss of about 20.4% in the temperature range from 260 to 340 °C. The DSC curve shows an exothermic reaction with a minimum at 307 °C, compatible with a combustion of tween 85. The fourth and fifth stage are very broad indicating compound pyrolysis. The overall mass loss during the fourth stage is 14.5% and 5.9% during the fifth stage between 340 and 850 °C. Taking into account the XRPD pattern in Fig. 3, the formation of NaCrO2 already occurs ∼400 °C, indicating a reduction of NaNO3 with a concomitant oxidation of the organic (Tween) components, because the thermal decomposition of NaNO3 (to NaNO2 and ½ O2) only occurs between 570 and 760 °C.\nTherefore stages 4 and 5 are attributed to a decomposition of the pyrolysis products formed by the decomposition of tween 85 in stage 3, but also to the decomposition of NaNO3 and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O. The decomposition temperature for NaNO3 may vary depending on the heating rate, composition of the sample, amount of surfactant and other factors.Fig. 5 shows the formation of the micelles, and their decomposition together with NaNO3 leading to the formation of NaCrO2 as final product.\nThe setup for the synthesis of NaCrO2 was used for the synthesis of the layered oxides NaxMO2 (x ≤ 1) to show that a wider range of materials can be prepared using the setup. Except for the metal precursor, neither the composition of the single solutions, nor the flow rate or the setup was changed. Fe(NO3)3, Co(ac)2 and Al(NO3)3 were used as metal precursors for the synthesis of β-NaFeO2, Na0.74CoO2 and NaAlO2. Fig. 6 shows the XPRD patterns for each compound with the corresponding reference. The structure of NaFeO2 depends on the temperature and the starting material (Fe2O3). α-Fe2O3 (hematite) leads only to β-NaFeO2, while γ-Fe2O3 (maghemite) led to α-NaFeO2. Below 760 °C the modification is metastable. α-NaFeO2 was considered as possible product, but it was disproved by the Rietveld refinement.\nNaCo0.74O2 was formed when Co(ac)2 was used as metal precursor, as shown by the XRPD pattern with the corresponding reference in Fig. 6. The reason for the Na deficiency is that oxidation to Co4+ occurs during the reaction in air. Na2O is formed as a by-product of this reaction in minor amounts (weak reflections marked with an asterisk *). The P2-type of NaxCoO2 exists in a wide compositional range. It dominates the phase diagram from x = 0.3–1, so it can be assumed that the P2-type is more likely to be formed. Likewise, NaAlO2 could be prepared using Al(NO3)3 as Al precursor (Fig. 6). However, considering the amorphous background, all that can be said with certainty is that the crystalline portion of the product has the targeted composition. The XRPD patterns in Fig. 6 show that layered oxides NaMO2 (M = trivalent main group and 3d transition metals) can be prepared by a generalized segmented flow approach using an identical setup, flow rates and reaction/annealing temperatures in very high yields and in relatively short reaction times.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

NaNO3 (>99% Sigma Aldrich), Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (99% Acros Organics), Tween #85 (Sigma Aldrich), kerosene (reagent grade Sigma Aldrich), deionized water, fluorinated ethylene propylene tube with 1/16′′ OD and 1 mm ID (Fisher Scientific), peristaltic pump reglo ICC (Ismatec), ultrasonic bath (Elma S 30 H).\nFlask synthesis. Before the synthesis 50 μL of Tween #85 was diluted in 50 mL of kerosene and stirred in a 100 mL beaker for 24 hours at room temperature to form the micelles. 2.5 mmol of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 2.5 mmol of NaNO3 were diluted in 50 mL of deionized water and stirred in a second beaker at room temperature. The oil mixture was transferred into a 250 mL flask, and the aqueous solution was introduced to the oil mixture through a dropping funnel with a rate of 3–5 droplets per second. The precursor was obtained by dropping the emulsion into hot kerosene (170–180 °C). Remaining water and kerosene were removed through a spiral-type condenser. The powder was heated in an argon oven at 800 °C for 4 hours to form the product.\nSegmented flow synthesis. Before the synthesis 500 μL of Tween #85 was diluted in 500 mL of kerosene and stirred in a 500 mL beaker for 24 hours at room temperature to form the micelles. 25 mmol of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 25 mmol of NaNO3 were diluted in 500 mL of deionized water and stirred in a second beaker at room temperature. Kerosene was added in a third beaker. The overall tube length was 6 m. The first segment (3 m) was put in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature, the second segment (3 m) was heated in an oil bath to 170–180 °C. The three solutions were pumped separately, the flow rate for the aqueous and the kerosene/Tween #85 solution were 1 mL min−1, the flow rate for the kerosene was 4.0 mL min−1. The two solutions were connected through a T-fitting. The resulting emulsion and kerosene were connected through another T-fitting. Water and kerosene were removed after the reaction through a spiral type condenser. The powder was heated in an argon oven at 800 °C for 4 hours to form the final product. Fe(NO3)3, Co(ac)2 and Al(NO3)3 were used as metal precursors for the layered oxides NaMO2 (M = Fe, Co, Al), while all other parameters were kept the unchanged.\nPowder X-ray diffraction. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a STOE Stadi P diffractometer equipped with a Dectris Mythen 1k detector in transmission mode using Mo Kα1 radiation. Crystalline phases were identified according to the PDF-2 database using Bruker AXS EVA 10.0 software. Full pattern profile fits (Pawley/Rietveld) were performed with TOPAS Academic 6.0 applying the fundamental parameter approach.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM mages for determining the size and morphology were acquired on a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope operating at 120 kV (LaB6 filament), equipped with a Gatan US1000 CCD-camera (16-bit, 2048 × 2048 pixels), using the Gatan Digital Micrograph software. Samples for TEM were prepared by placing one drop (10 μL) of a diluted solution in deionized water (0.1 mg mL−1) on a carbon-coated copper grid and by letting it dry at room temperature. Size evaluation of individual particles on the TEM images was performed with ImageJ.\nHigh resolution transmission electron microscopy. The Samples were prepared adding a drop of diluted precursor in deionized water on a carbon coated copper grid. The samples were measured with the FEI Tecnai F30 ST TEM at 300 kV acceleration voltage equipped with a Gatan US4000 4k CCD camera.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images for demonstrating the presence of chromium and sodium on the surface were acquired on a FEI Nova NanoSEM with a EDX-detector (EDAX-Pegasus X4M). The samples were coated with gold before investigation and observed at 5 kV.\nIR spectroscopy. ATR-IR spectra were measured on a Nicolet iS10 Spectrometer manufactured by Thermo Scientific. The spectra were recorded in a frequency range from 650 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 1.4 cm−1 per data point.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD instrument using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source.\nLaser scanning microscopy. The measurements were performed on a Keyence Model VK-8710 color 3-D laser scanning microscope equipped with CF Plan Lenses – 10×/20×/50×/100×.\nTGA/DSC. The measurements were performed on a Netzsch STA 409 PC/PG. The analysis was recorded in a temperature range from 35 °C to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under argon atmosphere.\nSolid-state NMR spectroscopy. All solid state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance 400 DSX NMR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstteten, Germany) at 1H frequency of 399.87 MHz and 23Na frequency of 105.74 MHz. A commercial three-channel 4 mm Bruker probe head was used for all experiments. The 1H and 23Na NMR spectra were recorded at 10 kHz magic angle spinning (MAS) in both cases averaging 32 transients with 8 s and 5 s recycle delay respectively.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Before the synthesis 50 μL of Tween #85 was diluted in 50 mL of kerosene and stirred in a 100 mL beaker for 24 hours at room temperature to form the micelles. 2.5 mmol of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 2.5 mmol of NaNO3 were diluted in 50 mL of deionized water and stirred in a second beaker at room temperature. The oil mixture was transferred into a 250 mL flask, and the aqueous solution was introduced to the oil mixture through a dropping funnel with a rate of 3–5 droplets per second. The precursor was obtained by dropping the emulsion into hot kerosene (170–180 °C). Remaining water and kerosene were removed through a spiral-type condenser. The powder was heated in an argon oven at 800 °C for 4 hours to form the product.\nSegmented flow synthesis. Before the synthesis 500 μL of Tween #85 was diluted in 500 mL of kerosene and stirred in a 500 mL beaker for 24 hours at room temperature to form the micelles. 25 mmol of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 25 mmol of NaNO3 were diluted in 500 mL of deionized water and stirred in a second beaker at room temperature. Kerosene was added in a third beaker. The overall tube length was 6 m. The first segment (3 m) was put in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature, the second segment (3 m) was heated in an oil bath to 170–180 °C. The three solutions were pumped separately, the flow rate for the aqueous and the kerosene/Tween #85 solution were 1 mL min−1, the flow rate for the kerosene was 4.0 mL min−1. The two solutions were connected through a T-fitting. The resulting emulsion and kerosene were connected through another T-fitting. Water and kerosene were removed after the reaction through a spiral type condenser. The powder was heated in an argon oven at 800 °C for 4 hours to form the final product. Fe(NO3)3, Co(ac)2 and Al(NO3)3 were used as metal precursors for the layered oxides NaMO2 (M = Fe, Co, Al), while all other parameters were kept the unchanged.\nPowder X-ray diffraction. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a STOE Stadi P diffractometer equipped with a Dectris Mythen 1k detector in transmission mode using Mo Kα1 radiation. Crystalline phases were identified according to the PDF-2 database using Bruker AXS EVA 10.0 software. Full pattern profile fits (Pawley/Rietveld) were performed with TOPAS Academic 6.0 applying the fundamental parameter approach.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM mages for determining the size and morphology were acquired on a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope operating at 120 kV (LaB6 filament), equipped with a Gatan US1000 CCD-camera (16-bit, 2048 × 2048 pixels), using the Gatan Digital Micrograph software. Samples for TEM were prepared by placing one drop (10 μL) of a diluted solution in deionized water (0.1 mg mL−1) on a carbon-coated copper grid and by letting it dry at room temperature. Size evaluation of individual particles on the TEM images was performed with ImageJ.\nHigh resolution transmission electron microscopy.

Results and discussion\nThe Fe/Co-CN precursor XRD pattern (Fig. S1, ESI†) reveals its Fe/Co-CN properties. With the crosslinked chitosan and freeze dry treatment, the as-prepared Fe/Co-CN precursor formed large-scale nanosheets with a connected network structure, as shown in Fig. S2a and b.† XRD confirms the subsequent product after the selenation reaction. The sample is well compatible with cubic FeSe2 (PDF#21-0432) and hexagonal CoSe2 (PDF#53-0449) from the XRD pattern, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The prominent peaks at 24.5°, 29.2°, 30.9°, 34.7°, 36.2°, 37.2°, 40.4°, 44.3°, 47.9°, 53.7°, 57.3°, 59.4°, 63.8°, 72.9°, and 76.5° correspond to the FeSe2 lattice planes of (110), (011), (101), (111), (120), (200), (210), (121), (211), (031), (131), (310), (122), (132) and (240), respectively. In addition, except for the plentiful overlapping peaks of CoSe2, the prominent peak at 50.7° can be indexed to the (002) plane of CoSe2. These proved the successful synthesis of Fe/Co-CN-based bimetallic selenides. The component proportion and valence bond of the samples were explored using XPS. FeSe2/CoSe2-CN exhibits the notable six element peaks of C, N, O, Fe, Co, and Se, as shown in the survey spectrum in Fig. S3.† The peaks at 780.7 and 795.3 eV in the Co 2p range (Fig. 1b) were assigned to Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 in CoSe2, respectively. The Co–O of Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals is responsible for the peaks at 784.8 eV and 800.6 eV, respectively, attributed to the local oxide layer on a superficial level. Moreover, the anti-bond orbits among Co and Se molecules are displayed by two separate satellite sign peaks of Co 2p. The two peaks positions at 711.1 and 724.2 eV are the signals of Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, and can be distinguished in the Fe 2p range (Fig. 1c). In addition, in the Se section, the two peaks at 56.5 and 55.6 eV fit nicely to Se 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively (Fig. 1d).\nAfter selenation, the product as a whole is in the nanosheet shape covered with an external connected network structure (Fig. 2a and b). From the TEM image (Fig. 2c and d), it is clearly seen that the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN nanosheets are permeable in design with a good deal of void of 20 nm. It is estimated that the porous-organized nanosheets are valuable for quick ion/electron movement and volume expansion reduction. Further observation of the HRTEM image of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN shows two obvious interplanar distributions with a spacing of 0.310 nm and 0.248 nm, which is confirmed by the (011) crystal plane of FeSe2 and (120) phase plane of CoSe2, respectively (Fig. 2e). The distinct rings with yellow lines from the electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN can be seen (Fig. S4, ESI†), indexing to the (121) and (400) planes from inside to outside. The homogeneous distribution of C, N, Fe, Co, and Se elements in the STEM and related elemental mapping pictures (Fig. 2f–l) clearly supports the formation of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN nanosheets. Pure FeSe2-CN and CoSe2-CN were made in the same way, for comparison. The XRD and SEM measurements of the Fe-CN precursor (Fig. S5 and S6†) reveal its Fe crystal and nanosheet features. The Fe-CN precursor transforms into cubic FeSe2 (PDF#21-0432) with a porous nanosheet structure after selenation (Fig. S7 and S8†). Similarly, a nanosheetlike Co-CN precursor is obtained (Fig. S9 and S10†). Furthermore, nanosheets, such as CoSe2-CN, can be produced (Fig. S11 and S12†). The Raman spectra in Fig. S13† show a couple of distinct peaks at 1346 cm−1 (D peak) and 1579 cm−1 (G peak), which predict an imperfect initiated amorphous carbon and crystalline graphite, respectively. FeSe2/CoSe2-CN has an ID/IG of roughly 1.17. Fig. S14† shows thermogravimetric (TG) curves obtained to determine the carbon content. The carbon content of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN is about 26.1%, according to the weight of residues from the curves.\nWe systematically examined the electrochemical performance and mechanism of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN for SIBs. CV measurement was first performed at 0.1 mV s−1. The steep reduction signals at 1.5 V and 1.74 V result from the Na ion insertion into the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN to create NaxFeSe2 and NaxCoSe2 in the first cathodic process, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The conversion reactions from NaxFeSe2 and NaxCoSe2 to Fe, Co, and Na2Se, trailed by the creation and construction of a familiar solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI), are also represented by the reduction peaks at 0.52 V and 0.76 V. The first cycle displays two reduction peaks at 0.5 and 1.1 V, which disappear in the subsequent scans and thus possibly correspond to the irreversible intercalation of Na+ and the formation of SEI. The peaks at 1.5 V, 1.75 V, and 1.94 V on the following anodic curve are due to partial Fe and Co transformation into FeSe2 and CoSe2, respectively. In addition, Na2Se is largely converted to Se. In the following four cycles, CV spectra with minimal variations are observed, demonstrating that FeSe2/CoSe2-CN possesses high electrochemical reversibility. The first discharge and charge specific capacities of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN at 0.2 A g−1 are 596 mA h g−1 and 450 mA h g−1, respectively, with a calculated first coulombic efficiency of 75.5% (Fig. 3b). In SIBs, FeSe2/CoSe2-CN has a long life cycle (Fig. 3c). After 1000 cycles (1 A g−1), the specific capacity of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN is 494 mA h g−1, while CoSe2-CN and FeSe2-CN only show 398 mA h g−1 and 299 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively (Fig. S15†). The improved sodium storage of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN can be attributed to the large specific surface area, abundant active sites and the synergistic effects between FeSe2 and CoSe2. Fig. 3d and e demonstrate the rate performance of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN. The specific capacities of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN are 436, 411, 396, 385, 375, and 364 mA h g−1, respectively, for 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g−1, which are equivalent to the rate performances of produced pure FeSe2-CN and CoSe2-CN (Fig. S16†). Furthermore, in FeSe2/CoSe2-CN, FeSe2-CN, and CoSe2-CN, the distinct and comparable stage from the charge–discharge curves is clearly recognizable; a characteristic of transition metal selenide-based electrodes for sodium storage. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Fig. 3f, the rate performance of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN outperforms that of conventional FeSe2 and CoSe2-based electrodes. In addition, the long-cycle stability at 10 A g−1 is assessed (Fig. 3g). It was demonstrated that a capacity of 350 mA h g−1 can be achieved even after 1000 cycles. The magnificent cycling performance is due to the stable porous nanosheet structure of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN. Equivalent circuits were used to measure and fit electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (Fig. S17†). The diffusion of Na+ is reflected by the linear trend in the low frequency region. The FeSe2/CoSe2-CN anode has a charge transfer resistance of 23 Ω, which is substantially lower than that of FeSe2-CN (34 Ω). The steeper slope of the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN electrode implies that the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN possesses better transport/diffusion kinetics with Na+ and electrons. A post-mortem examination of the cycled FeSe2/CoSe2-CN anode was further carried out. As seen in Fig. S18,† the nanosheetlike FeSe2/CoSe2-CN was also found, suggesting its stability in SIBs.\nThe cyclic voltammetry curve was investigated at various scan rates (0.2 to 1.0 mV s−1) (Fig. 4a). The observed force is obtained from the peak current (i) and scan rate (v): i = avb and log(i) = blog(v) + log(a). The slope in Fig. 4b is used to find the value of b in the equation. In general, b ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with b demonstrating the level of diffusion control or surface capacitive control. Fig. 4b shows that the b values are 0.94, 0.95, 0.99, 0.87, and 0.98, respectively, by fitting the peaks from CV curves of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN, which are close to 1.0, showing that the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN electrode surface or near surface has strong pseudo capacitance features in reaction kinetics. The formula i(v) = k1v + k2v0.5 was used to quantify the surface pseudo capacitance properties of the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN electrode, where k1v represents the capacity of pseudo capacitance contribution, and k2v0.5 is the ion diffusion contributive capacity. According to calculations, the k1v value in the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN electrode at a sweep speed of 2.0 mV s−1 is 99.3% (Fig. 4c). Besides, at 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mV s−1, the k1v values are 97.5%, 98.4%, 97.7%, and 98.5%, respectively, as shown in Fig. S19.†Fig. 4d summarizes the k1v values at various scan speeds. For scan rates from 0.2 to 2 mV s−1, k1v was determined to be 96.8%, 97.5%, 97.9%, 98.4%, 98.6%, 99.1%, and 99.3%, respectively. Obviously, the values appear to ascend with increased sweep speed. This can be attributed to the synergistic activity of FeSe2 and CoSe2, which promotes ion/electron transport at the same time.\nIn Na ion full cells, the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode was employed to couple with FeSe2/CoSe2-CN. The XRD pattern of Na3V2(PO4)2O2F, as shown in Fig. S20,† demonstrates a usual NASICON-type structure. Furthermore, the SEM image shows that Na3V2(PO4)2O2F is made of nanocuboids, which is advantageous for sodium storage. The charging/discharging curves of a full cell at 0.1 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 5a, and show that it is possible to reach a high discharge capacity of 320 mA h g−1. Fig. 5b shows the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN/Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cell cycle stability. It can be seen that after 40 cycles, a capacity of 297 mA h g−1 is maintained. Furthermore, a full cell can adequately illuminate a LED gadget (inset of Fig. 5b). Fig. 5c shows the rate capabilities. At 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 A g−1, specific capacities of 354, 372, 374, 367, 356 and 346 mA h g−1 were attained, respectively. When it returns to 0.1 A g−1, the initial discharge specific capacity is restored. Its computed power and energy densities are equivalent (Fig. 5d). The full cell, for example, has an energy density of 109 W h kg−1 at a power density of 207 W kg−1. When the power density is increased to 3896 W kg−1, 96 W h kg−1 energy density is still produced, which is the best among other transition metal selenide-based electrodes.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\nMaterial fabrication\nFirst, 200 mg chitosan was dissolved in a mixture of 15 mL deionized water and 5 mL glacial acetic acid, and the solution was stirred for 24 h at 25 °C. Thereafter, 0.5 mmol K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.5 mmol K3Co(CN)6 were ultrasonically dissolved in 2 mL deionized water, and then added to the solution from the first step with ultrasonic dispersion, followed by freeze-drying for 24 h. The freeze-dried products were collected and calcined at 700 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The products were then washed several times and vacuum dried. The product was mixed with selenium powder at a mass ratio of 1:2 and calcined at 400 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to obtain FeSe2/CoSe2-CN.\n\nMaterial characterization\nX-ray diffraction was used to characterize the crystal structure of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN (XRD, Bruker, D/MAX-2000, Cu K). Hitach (SU-9010) was used to obtain the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN. On an HRTEM, Tecani G-20, images of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN were obtained for (high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM). XPS (ESCALAB, 250Xi) was also utilized.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nIn general, FeSe2/CoSe2-CN, polyvinylidene fluoride and carbon black were used to make the electrode. Their weight distributions were 70%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. The slurry was then equally applied on the Cu sheets and dried in a vacuum stove for 12 h at 100 °C. After that, the electrode sheets were squeezed with a force of around 10 MPa and sliced into circular sheets. The mass loading of the active material was ∼5 mg, and was then constructed in a glove box into coin-type cells. The counter electrode was a sodium sheet, while the electrolyte used was NaPF6 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (1.0 M). A Neware battery test system was used to evaluate cycle and rate performance (0.01–3 V). CV was done at various scan rates on an electrochemical workstation. To assemble the sodium-ion full cell, FeSe2/CoSe2-CN and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F with a weight ratio of 1:(4.5–5), respectively, were connected. To ensure the creation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase layer, the anode electrode was pre-sodiated in a half-cell for five discharge/charge cycles at 0.1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V before assembling the full cell. The electrolyte and separator were identical to those used in the half-cells.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The product was mixed with selenium powder at a mass ratio of 1:2 and calcined at 400 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to obtain FeSe2/CoSe2-CN.\n\nMaterial characterization\nX-ray diffraction was used to characterize the crystal structure of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN (XRD, Bruker, D/MAX-2000, Cu K). Hitach (SU-9010) was used to obtain the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN. On an HRTEM, Tecani G-20, images of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN were obtained for (high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM). XPS (ESCALAB, 250Xi) was also utilized.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nIn general, FeSe2/CoSe2-CN, polyvinylidene fluoride and carbon black were used to make the electrode. Their weight distributions were 70%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. The slurry was then equally applied on the Cu sheets and dried in a vacuum stove for 12 h at 100 °C. After that, the electrode sheets were squeezed with a force of around 10 MPa and sliced into circular sheets. The mass loading of the active material was ∼5 mg, and was then constructed in a glove box into coin-type cells. The counter electrode was a sodium sheet, while the electrolyte used was NaPF6 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (1.0 M). A Neware battery test system was used to evaluate cycle and rate performance (0.01–3 V). CV was done at various scan rates on an electrochemical workstation. To assemble the sodium-ion full cell, FeSe2/CoSe2-CN and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F with a weight ratio of 1:(4.5–5), respectively, were connected. To ensure the creation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase layer, the anode electrode was pre-sodiated in a half-cell for five discharge/charge cycles at 0.1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V before assembling the full cell. The electrolyte and separator were identical to those used in the half-cells.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nThe synergistic effect of both Zn and Fe in refining the nanostructure will help improve electrochemical performance by providing a porous structure. Further, porosity also facilitates accommodation of strain produced due to insertion of Na+ ions and structural changes taking place during charge/discharge cycles. Powdered X-ray diffraction as in Fig. 1 was employed to identify the phase upon the synthesis of ZnFe2O4. The diffraction peak in XRD for spinel structure ZnFe2O4 in the same fashion as ZnCo2O4 (ref. ) are well matched with ICSD No. 01-073-1963. The strong intensity and narrow peak width in XRD pattern show high crystallinity and purity as seen from ICSD No. 01-073-1963 and there is no peak that could be matched with any impurity. The crystallite size of the prepared ZnFe2O4 powder was determined using Williamson–Hall method from (022), (113), (004), (115), and (044) diffraction peaks. The crystallite size of prepared ZnFe2O4 particles is calculated to be 13 nm.\nMorphological studies of ZnFe2O4 was conducted through SEM at different magnifications vis-à-vis 5000×, 20000× and 200000× which show spherical nodules. The low resolution SEM image in Fig. 2a shows homogenous growth of spherical particles. The high resolution SEM image in Fig. 2b shows two kinds of large and small spherical particles. From Fig. 2b and c, it is evident that the spheres with 200 nm and 1 μm diameter dimensions have been synthesized with a flaky homogeneous surface. The porosity, which is beneficial for efficient catalytic properties can be seen in Fig. 2b with voids in between the nanoparticles.\nThe nanostructures were further investigated by TEM. Fig. 3a shows the TEM images where small nanoparticles join to form a big single nanosphere which is important for high surface area facilitating the diffusion of electrolyte and is in agreement with SEM micrographs. At high magnification grain boundaries are discernible. The composite grain formed by agglomeration is composed of many spherical shaped nanoparticles as small as 5–10 nm in size embedded in a matrix growing along (111), (022), and (113) plane as revealed in the inset of Fig. 3b where the corresponding d-spacing was calculated to be 0.4995, 0.2645, and 0.3066 nm. High porosity promotes possible applications as electrode materials for SIBs.\nThe pore size distribution of ZnFe2O4 is determined by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model as shown in Fig. 4. The BJH model demonstrates a wide distribution of pores from 3 to 21 nm with a peak centred at 9.2 nm, suggesting a mesoporous structure of ZnFe2O4 spheres. The ZnFe2O4 nanosphere demonstrated a specific surface area of 32 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.13 cm3 g−1. A large surface area together with significant porosity allows for more space accommodation and structural evolution during cycles, affecting its rate and cycling performance. The specific surface area for the ZnFe2O4 nanosphere as well as the pore size distribution was carried out by conducting nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms as given in Fig. 4 inset which indicates a type IV isotherm pointing towards he the existence of a porous structure as is revealed in SEM and TEM images.\nGalvanostatic profiling of ZnFe2O4 was conducted at room temperature at 50 mA g−1 in a potential range of 0.005–3.0 V shown in Fig. 5a. The as-synthesized anode composite delivers discharge and charge capacities in 1st cycle as 729 and 478 mA h g−1 respectively. While the low charge capacity at the first cycle is ascribed to the development of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the electrode. This corresponds to a coulombic efficiency of 66%. In the 2nd cycle, the values of discharge and charge capacities are recorded as 470 and 460 mA h g−1, respectively and thereafter the capacities are stabilized in the subsequent cycles indicating high stability for sodium ion extraction and insertion. The change in slope with the corresponding considerable capacity loss after the 1st cycle is compatible with the shifting of the peaks in the CV (Fig. 7a). Sodium insertion in ZnFe2O4 proceed through conversion reaction as given in eqn (1)–(3). Na2O product is formed during sodiation process which hinders the reversible sodium extraction. Hence, the effective coating on ZnFe2O4 would be suitable to reduce the irreversibility and improve the cycle life.\nAs shown in Fig. 5b, the values of discharge and charge capacities at 1st cycle are 729 and 478 mA h g−1, respectively. While at the 100th cycle, discharge/charge capacities plummet to 288 and 284 mA h g−1, respectively. The coulombic efficiency at 1st and 100th cycles was calculated to be 66 and 98%, respectively and hence high coulombic efficiency is achieved at high cycle number indicating high cyclability and reversibility for sodium ions. Noteworthy is the fact that the coulombic efficiency improves over the number of cycles and almost similar coulombic efficiencies for charge and discharge cycles points towards following the same reaction over and again as given in ref. for LIBs.\nEIS data for ZnFe2O4 anode is carried out to determine the charge transfer resistance Rct before cycling (pristine state) and after cycling of the sodium ions. The Randles equivalent circuit is given in the inset showing parameters such as resistance of solution (Rs), Constant phase element accounting for inhomogeneity of the electrode (CPE), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and Warburg resistance (W). The Fig. 5c shows that Rct value increases substantially from 135 Ω in a pristine state to 533 Ω in cycled. The increase in Rct is related to structural changes in the electrode and polarization effects during cycling of sodium ions which hinders the effective transfer of electrons and thus raises Rct values. This also verifies the formation of SEI in Fig. 5a during the first charge cycle.\nRate performance of ZnFe2O4 electrode in a range of 0.005–3.0 V at 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 A g−1 current densities is conducted with 10 cycles per step as displayed in Fig. 6b. The specific capacities were calculated to be 410, 327, 215, 167, 113, and 78 mA h g−1 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 A g−1 current densities, respectively. It is worthy to reveal that the high rate capability of the ZnFe2O4 electrode is achieved without arduous coating methods.\nCV experiments were performed to observe the redox reaction between 0.005–3.0 V potential at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 7. It is clearly visible that the 1st CV cycle is distinct from the subsequent cycles. The peak appearing at 1.3 V is attributed to the appearance of SEI formation at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The conversion/alloying of Na with Zn to form NaZn corresponding to a peak at around 0.1 V which leads to an increase in the discharge capacity as seen in Fig. 5a at the respective electrode and corroborates well with these results showing a high reduction current. The peak at 0.4 V is due to the reduction of NaxZnFe2O4 to Zn and Fe whereas the anodic peaks at 1.25 and 1.5 V are due to dealloying of ZnNa and subsequent oxidation of Zn2+ and Fe2+ where Fe2+ will transfer to its most stable oxidation state of Fe3+. After the first cycle, the second and third cycle shows diminished peaks as a layer has already been deposited resulting in reduced cathodic and anodic currents. However, the CVs after the 1st cycle appear at the same potentials suggesting good structural stability of the electrode and cyclability of SIBs. Fig. 7b shows a graph of current vs. potential at different scan rates where the curves increase in scan rate demonstrating a conductive surface with deposition of Na+ from the electrolyte solution and back to solution by dealloying reaction and oxidation of the metals. Thus, the diffusion coefficient of Na+ ion can be calculated by considering the Randle–Sevcik equation in Fig. 7c which allows plotting current vs. sqrt of scan rate and a straight line equation is applied and DNa for Na+ is determined from the slope. The sodium diffusion coefficient was determined to be 2.615 × 10−15 cm2 s−1 from CV which agrees well with the diffusion coefficient calculate from GITT profile. The DNa+ value for ZnFe2O4 anode is comparable with the reported Na2V6O16·nH2O (2.46 × 10−14 cm2 s−1) and higher than TiNb2O7 (2.0 × 10−20 cm2 s−1) anodes.\nGalvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) is used to probe the kinetics of sodium ions during insertion/extraction process in ZnFe2O4 anode and allows to determine DNa at different equilibrium potential state. Fig. 8 shows the potential response of ZnFe2O4 anode in a range of 0.005–3.0 V as a function of time in hours for de/sodiation process to happen cycled at 0.1 mA g−1. The equilibrium potential state is reached in 1 hour for each applied potential step. The potential of the electrode is affected by each current pulse (10 min) during the charge/discharge cycle inserting and extracting Na+ ions. By making use of Fick's second law of diffusion and presuming that sodium ion follows the law, the diffusion coefficient is calculated from the equation as:\nwhere τ is the pulse time at the time when the current density is applied, mB is the loading of composite in grams, VM is the molar volume in cm3 mol−1 and is taken as constant during calculations, MB is the molecular weight in g mol−1, S is the effective surface area determined by BET calculations and ΔEs and ΔEτ are the change in step steady state potential and change in the cell potential at pulse time τ.\nThe values depict that the sodium ions face sluggish kinetics at deep discharge from OCP values initially and hence DNa+ values at the beginning and end of the discharge process are calculated to be 6.492 × 10−14 and 6.18 × 10−16 cm2 s−1 which is attributed to structural changes in the electrode. The same trend can be seen at the charging process where DNa+ values at the beginning and end of the charge process are determined to be 1.106 × 10−12 and 9.51 × 10−12 cm2 s−1. The formation of conversion reactions is the main cause of sluggish kinetics which is the reason behind developing a kinetic barrier impeding the electron and ion transport at charge/discharge cycles.\nXAS is a powerful technique to monitor the oxidation states and coordination environment of metal sites. Mechanistic elucidation of the reactions happening at the interface to understand and improve the electrochemical performance is imperative to our progression in battery future technology. Here, ex situ techniques such as XRD and XANES have been employed to probe the reaction mechanism at the surface of the electrode. The XRD peak in Fig. 9a for the pristine electrode are shown demonstrating well matched peaks with no impurities. However, after sodiation amorphous-like structure is obtained. Fig. 9b and c show XANES of Fe and Zn K edge for pristine, full discharged, recharged after sodiation/desodiation and standard Fe and Zn metallic foils. In Fig. 9b, the pristine Fe edge spectrum is noticed at high energy which is due to Fe3+. The Fe K edge XANES also shows a small pre edge which is attributed to the distorted Fe–O octahedra. The discharge ZnFe2O4 electrode XANES spectrum moves towards lower energy which is an indication of the reduction mechanism of Fe and consistent with Na+ insertion in the anode material. The same can be observed for Zn XANES discharge electrode spectra in Fig. 9c. While recharged ZnFe2O4 electrode moves toward higher energy, indicating oxidation of Fe and Zn due to extraction of Na ions. The discharged spectra for both Fe and Zn XANES spectra are dissimilar with the respective metallic foils entailing an incomplete reduction as is evidence by the reduced specific capacity for the anode material. Hence, it can be deduced from XANES spectra that both metal Fe and Zn contribute to the electrochemical performance of the material by their participation in reversible oxidation and reduction reactions.\nHigh angle annular dark field imaging (HAADF) photograph of a single particle involved in the sodiation of the material is shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen from line profile for single particles in Fig. 10f that an intense line spectra are shown for single particles such Fe, Zn, O and Na at K series of X-rays which corroborates well with Fig. 10a–e. Shapes of particles are more defined and more intense colored during Na+ are insertion in the material. Further, sodiation process does not alter the morphology which is the indication of the stability of ZnFe2O4 spherical particles.\nFig. 11 shows the EDS mapping photographs of Fe, O, Zn, and Na of the recharged ZnFe2O4 electrode. All the elements were observed in mapping, however, sodium is noticed with less intense as can be indicated in Fig. 11f. Moreover, sodium is more intense around the edges of particles which is as a result of the establishment of thick SEI layer. Hence, EDS mapping results show the presence of high intense sodium contents in fully discharged particle and less intense in fully recharged particle.\nIn summary, porous ZnFe2O4 nanospheres have shown promising cycling and rate performance as anode for SIBs and a detailed comparison of ZnFe2O4 electrode is shown in Table 1. Further, reaction kinetics and mechanism is revealed using electrochemical characterization and advanced synchrotron based spectroscopy which provides insight into the material.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\nSynthesis of ZnFe2O4\nZinc dichloride (ZnCl2), iron trichloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), sodium acetate (CH3COONa), and glycerol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich all with analytical grade. ZnFe2O4 was synthesized with a hydrothermal method. Briefly, two separate aqueous solutions of ZnCl2 (0.5614 g dispersed in 40 ml of deionized water) and FeCl3·6H2O (2.1586 g dispersed in 40 ml of deionized water) were prepared with a continuous magnetic stirring. 20 ml of glycerol was added in both solutions followed by slow addition of CH3COONa (3.2 g) in the mixture. The solution was stirred for 2 h and then transformed to a 200 ml Teflon-lined autoclave which was transformed to oven and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. The precipitates were collected using a centrifuge at 5000 rpm and rinsed several times with deionized water and ethanol. The precipitates were dried in the oven at 80 °C for overnight prior characterization.\n\nCharacterizations\nX-ray diffraction method was used to observe the crystalline structure of material using Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with Mo Kα wavelength. The diffraction was recorded as ring image and later converted to 1D peak pattern. The converted XRD 1D pattern was then transformed to Cu Kα radiation wavelength for comparison with a standard pattern. The morphology of ZnFe2O4 particles was monitored using scanning electron microscopy (JEOL 7600F). Microstructure and elemental mapping analysis of ZnFe2O4 were conducted at transmission electron microscopy (G2 F20 FEI, Tecnai). The specific area and porosity in ZnFe2O4 particles were measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) approach by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K at a Tristar II 3020.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nGalvanostatic properties of ZnFe2O4 electrodes were assessed using coin type CR-2032 cells. The ZnFe2O4 electrodes were prepared by mixing the ZnFe2O4 powder, Super P carbon, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder in a weight ratio of 7:2:1. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was added to the above mixture in a proper amount to get homogenous slurry. The prepared slurry was spread on copper metallic foil followed by drying, hot roll-pressing, and vacuum drying. Coin cells were fabricated in argon filled glove box using sodium metal foil as a counter electrode, porous glass fiber as a separator, and 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate and fluoroethylene carbonate in 96:4 wt% ratio as the electrolyte. The electrochemical properties such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the prepared cells were determined on a potentiostat CH (600E) instrument. EIS measurements were taken using coin cells in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with a voltage amplitude of 0.007 V.\nThe electrodes were prepared by dis-assembling the coin cell at fully discharged and recharged states to measure the ex situ characterizations. The obtained anodes were carefully cleaned with NMP and vacuum dried. Ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was measured at the 10C beamline of Pohang Light Source. The beamline consists of Si(111) double crystal monochromator and harmonics were reduced by 40% of the peak intensity. Zn and Fe metallic foils were employed as a reference. All the data were recorded in transmittance mode. Ex situ TEM (Talos™ STEM F200X) of the electrodes was taken by scratching the electrode materials from copper foil.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

A slight difference between the POMs are observed due to the cations around the cluster. The counter cations of the POM usually stabilize the negative charge and influence the self-assembly process. Considering that H+ has an even smaller ionic radius compared to Na+, we would expect shifts in the 2 theta values and lattice contraction. Fig. 1a shows the FT-IR spectra with the identified peaks of the Keggin structure in the range of 731, 873, 950, and 1049 cm−1 which are attributed to intra-octahedral oxygen M–Oc–M, inter-octahedral oxygen M–Ob–M, terminal oxygen M–Od (where M = Mo and V) and central oxygen P–Oa of the Na-POM. The corresponding metal to oxygen bonding is displayed in the inset image. On the other hand, for the H-POM the bands are shifted to the higher wavenumbers 779, 879, 956, and 1051 cm−1. The difference in the wavenumbers is due to the effect of electronegativity of large Na+ ions around the cluster. Therefore, the FT-IR spectrum confirms the successful formation of the Keggin structure of H-POM and Na-POM. TGA illustrates the weight loss of the H-POM and Na-POM starting above 45 °C and continuing to 240 °C, which indicates the removal of lattice bound water molecules from the cluster, given in Fig. 1b. Both the H-POM and Na-POM undergo the gradual weight loss of 15% and 10%, but the Na-POM shows smaller weight loss than the H-POM.\nThe FE-SEM and HR-TEM images of the H-POM in Fig. 2a and b show the spherical cluster formation, whereas the Na-POM shows a rod-like morphology with 100–200 nm diameters in the size of unequal lengths in both FE-SEM and HR-TEM studies as given in Fig. 2c and d. The rod formation of the Na-POM rather than the H-POM cluster formation enhances the electrochemical properties. The XPS measurement of the H-POM is already given in our previous work. The fitted XP spectrum of the Na-POM cluster is given in Fig. 3a–e. The binding energy of 133.9 eV corresponds to the phosphorus in the 5+ oxidation state. The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 3c is deconvoluted into two peaks at 233.1 eV and 236.2 eV which correspond to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 for Mo in the 6+ oxidation state. The peak at 517.8 eV is assigned to the V5+ species in V 2p3/2 spectra in Fig. 3d.\nThe XP spectra of Na 1s with a peak at 1071.2 eV, as shown in Fig. 3, confirm the sodium ions around the cluster. Thus the spectrum of the Na-POM shows the existence of P, Mo, V, and O, further confirming the formation of the Na5[PMo10V2O40] Keggin structure. Additionally, further to analyze the number of sodium ions around the cluster, flame photometry with higher solution concentration is performed. The experimental molar ratio of sodium of 7.15% relates to the theoretical molar ratio of 6.22%. The variance in the molar concentration of sodium ions results from the water. Based on these characterization results the desired Keggin clusters H5PMo10V2O40 and Na5PMo10V2O40 are formed successfully and further employed as electrodes for Na-ion batteries.\n\nElectrochemistry\nTo understand the electrochemical behavior of the H-POM and Na-POM, the CV, GCD, and impedance studies are performed. The charge/discharge profiles of the H-POM and Na-POM for the initial twenty cycles are given in Fig. 4a and b. For the H-POM, as shown in Fig. 4a only one plateau region in both charge and discharge states shows the reduction/oxidation of molybdenum alone.\nThe specific discharge capacity for the H-POM is 23 mA h g−1 at 0.1C in the initial cycle due to the lack of the reduction of the V5+ to V4+ and the charge/discharge life cycle of the H-POM at 0.1C for 100 cycles is given in Fig S3.† In Fig. 4b, the plateau at 2.7 V for the Na-POM in the first discharge cycle indicates the intercalation of sodium ions between the intercluster regions as shown in Fig. S2† by the reduction of higher valent molybdenum. But there is no distinct voltage plateau for the redox behavior of vanadium in the following cycles. The reason is, in the super-reduced state (i.e. discharge process), the outer and inner V–O increases, which results in the expansion/change in the geometries. This results in the lack of redox behavior of vanadium during the Na+ ion intercalation. Similarly, the two charge plateaus at 3.0 V and 4.2 V correspond to the oxidation of Mo4+ to Mo6+ and V4+ to V5+ for the Na-POM. Thus, it is indicated that the sodium ions de-intercalated from the intercluster cavities during oxidation. After the 1st cycle, the charge/discharge curves tend to show the plateaus in the same voltage regions, indicating better reversibility, with minimal capacity fading between the consecutive cycles. But practically the specific capacity was maintained at 46 mA h g−1 after twenty cycles. In Fig. 4d, the irreversible capacity loss and low coulombic efficiency (CE) in the initial and the following cycles are mainly due to the decomposition of the electrolyte and formation of the electrode–electrolyte interfacial (EEI) layer during the insertion/extraction which is common in most of the cathode materials. Another strong reason for the major capacity fading is the dissolution of the POM cluster which is also reported in other POM based electrode materials. The Na-POM shows higher specific discharge capacity when compared to the H-POM. The reason behind this fact is that the more dispersive nature of Na+ ions results in the feasible movement of the large Na+ ions intercalated within the intercluster regions. Due to the large expansion in the core structure and the bigger size of cations, the Na+ ions are bound less effectively to the anionic core which makes them easily accessible for stress-free exchange during charge–discharge studies, which is also explained and proved from the computational studies. The charge/discharge life cycle of the Na-POM at 0.1C and 1C rate for 100 cycles is studied and given in Fig. S4 and S5.† The irreversible capacity after 100 cycles at a 1C rate was maintained at 41 mA h g−1 as shown in Fig. 4e. Compared with the 0.1C rate, at higher current rate (say 1C), the less bound Na+ ions (known interaction distances from the DFT studies given in Table S1†) to the anionic core may activate faster and result in minimal capacity loss throughout the cycling.\nThe initial specific charge capacity of 174 mA h g−1 at 0.1C corresponds to 55% theoretical capacity (ca. 319 mA h g−1) contribution of 12 electron reduction per Na-POM cluster. The theoretical capacity of 319 mA h g−1 is the result of 22 electrons resulting from the redox couple of ten Mo6+/Mo4+ and two V5+/V4+. The major difference in the theoretical and the practical capacity is the result of partial reduction of the Mo6+/Mo4+ redox couple which is placed in the outer ring of the cluster. Instead of ten, only a few Mo6+/Mo4+ redox couples undergo the reaction, which results in the 10 electron transfer. Due to the larger ionic radius of Na+, rather than 22 Na+ ions, only 12 sodium ions are intercalated in the intercluster cavities. During the discharge process the Na-POM experiences huge volume expansion as a result of sodium ion intercalation in the intercluster cavities. In the DFT studies, the geometry of the Na-POM and its intercluster interaction in charged and super reduced states (i.e. [PMo10V2O40]27−) are explained. So instead of 22 electrons, only 12 electron transfers take place during the charge/discharge process. The above results indicate that the POM cluster behaves as an electron sponge and the Na-POM shows better electrochemical properties.\n\nEx situ studies\nAfter cycling, the Na-POM cells are de-crimped and the electrodes are separated and washed with dimethyl carbonate inside a glovebox. The electrodes are sonicated in the water medium, where the Na-POM dissolves in water and is later recovered by vacuum drying. The morphological changes, structural evolution and redox reaction during the charge/discharge process are studied from the ex situ PXRD, HRTEM and XPS studies. In Fig. 5a the spectra after 1st discharge are given, where the signal for Mo 3d is deconvoluted into two peaks at 236.9 eV and 233.9 eV corresponding to the Mo6+ oxidation state of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2, and also the existence of signals at 231.9 eV and 229.6 eV corresponds to the Mo4+ oxidation state. The presence of Mo6+ in the POM cluster corroborates the partial reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+. And the V 2p spectra given in Fig. 5a (right) centered at 516.4 eV clearly indicated the presence of V4+ in the POM. This validates that during the 1st discharge, all ten Mo6+ species don't undergo the reduction process and the two V5+ species undergo reduction. Thus it can be said that during discharge the reduction of Mo and V happens simultaneously with the insertion of Na+ ions around the intercluster regions, whereas after charging the presence of Mo6+ and V5+ as shown in Fig. 5b in the XP spectra indicates the reversibility of the POM cluster with the insertion/extraction of Na+ ions in the intercluster regions. FT-IR studies for the recovered samples are performed in transmission mode with KBr pellets. The ex situ FT-IR studies given in Fig. 5c show the important Mo–O bond shifts after charge and discharge processes. During the first discharge the absorption peak shifts to a lower wavelength as compared to that before the cycling process. The red shift of inter-octahedral oxygen M–Ob–M and terminal oxygen M–Od (where M = Mo and V) from 873, 950 cm−1 to 866, 948 cm−1 indicates the reduction/oxidation of Mo and V ions. The slight change in the peaks is the result of the decrease in the M–O stretching energy, attributed to the redox reaction of Mo6+/Mo4+ and V5+/V4+. In the following charge process, the wavenumber again shifts to a higher wavenumber, indicating the Na+ ions. The reversible shifts in the respective peaks indicate the reversibility of the Na-POM with multi-redox properties even after the charge/discharge process. The above results validated that the POM cluster is stable, reversible, and supports multi-electron transfer during the cycling performance. Fig. 5d shows the TEM images of the Na-POM after the 1st cycle and 100 cycles. The Na-POM exhibits a rod shape even after 100 cycles and in Fig. 5d(i), (iii) and (iv) the presence of individual particles with the sp carbon and PVDF is seen and the absence of agglomeration or change in the particle size is evident. Comparing the TEM images with that of the pristine Na-POM, no significant differences are observed and no specific damage or deposit is visible. The rod shape of the electrode could be essentially preserved even after cycling for a long time. This result illustrates the constructive merit of the Na-POM as a cathode for Na-ion batteries.\n\nNa+ ion kinetics\nThe Na+ ion kinetics in the Na-POM cluster is evaluated at the different scan rates of CV from 0.1 to 1.25 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 6a. The different scan rate CV shows the quasi rectangular shape stretching in the anodic area, whereas there is no distinguishable peak in the cathodic area. The energy storage system involves two distinct processes namely, (1) diffusion controlled process, in batteries, and (2) surface controlled process, in capacitors. From the linear relationship between the response peak current (mA) and the scan rate (v), the kinetics is predicted by the below equation,\nwhere a and b are variable parameters between 0.5 and 1.0. A b value of 0.5 corresponds to the diffusion controlled process, and a b value of 1.0 corresponds to the capacitive process. For our system from the plot of log scan rate vs. log peak current, a slope is obtained in Fig. 6b which corresponds to b = 0.5, implying the diffusive behavior of the Na-POM. The diffusive process of the battery also contributes to the electron sponge behavior. The EIS spectra for both the H-POM and Na-POM before and after cycling are illustrated in Fig. 6c in a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz. The Na-POM displays a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rch) than the H-POM. In the Na-POM the diameter of the semicircle increases after cycling; this results in the continuous formation of an SEI layer on the electrodes, followed by the increased internal resistance. This results in the increased resistance after cycling, accompanied by the capacity fading.\n\nDFT studies on the POM cluster\nDFT simulations and the optimization of various structures are gaining widespread attention due to their high accuracy in predicting complex experimental structures. In our previous work, we have analyzed the H5[PMo10V2O40] cluster for LIB application. The current structure in this study is very similar to the previous material. Similarly, to compare the structural changes happening during the charging/discharging process, we analyzed POM5/POM27− anionic clusters. During the charging process, there are 5 Na+ ions in the vicinity of the POM and in the discharging state, there are 27 Na+ cations surrounded by the POM core. Hence, the respective charges of the anionic clusters are 5 and 27 negative state. This charge/discharge process corresponds to the exchange of 22 electrons. An earlier report on the Na-POM suggests the presence of sodium cations in the inter-cluster space. So the cations are placed in the vicinity of the anionic cluster and all the elements in the clusters are freely optimized (i.e. there are no constraints applied). The structures of POM5− and POM27− are given in Fig. 7b and c, respectively. The POM structure with excess electrons is termed “super-reduced” POM.\nFrom Fig. 7b and c, it is clear that the outer Mo–O distance increases from 1.70 to 1.76 Å and the inner Mo–O distance reduces from 2.58 to 2.46 Å on the transition from POM5− to POM27−. There is no significant change in the central part of the POM (i.e. P–O distance). Both inner and outer V–O distances are enhanced in the POM27− compared to the POM5− structure. The peripheral and internal V–O bonds in the POM core significantly affect the geometries during the charging and discharging process. It is found from our calculation that the O–O (end to end, shown inFig. 7b and c) distance of the super-reduced form of the POM has enhanced and thus the structure of the super-reduced POM is expanded. This is contradicting with the previous report of super-reduced POM ([PMo12O40]27−), where they found a reduction in the size of the POM27−. These structural changes occurring during the charging/discharging process lead to a higher charge capacity of the Na-POM and hence make it a better material for rechargeable battery systems.\nAlso, we analyzed different properties such as BE and charge transfer of Na5[PMo10V2O40]. There are five Na+ cations surrounding each anionic core of the cluster; during the optimization the cations are stabilized in the inter-cluster cavity. The optimized geometry of the Na-POM is given in Fig. S2† which explains the occupancy of Na+ ions in the inter-cluster space. Fig. 7a is the optimized geometry of a single unit cell of the Na-POM. After optimization, the changes in the crystal structure are noted and the corresponding volume change is calculated. From Table S1,† it is clear that there is a huge change in the lattice parameters and volume of the Na-POM. The Na-POM structure is expanded about 36% from the original crystal structure. The corresponding volume change in the H-POM was 12.12%. The large expansion of the Na-POM is due to the relatively larger size of Na+ when compared to H+. The expanded anionic core can affect the binding of cations to the cluster. So we calculated the complexation energy between cations and the anionic cluster. The BE between anions and cations is found to be −32.91 eV for the Na-POM. Due to the large expansion in the core structure and bigger size of cations, the Na+ ions are bound less effectively to the anionic core. The calculated BE for H+ in the H-POM is −100.65 eV. It is very important to note that the complexation energy of the Na-POM structure is significantly very less compare to the H-POM. Due to the dispersive nature of Na+ ions, they can easily diffuse on the surface and flow between the electrodes during the redox reaction. This interesting phenomenon makes the charge/discharge process more efficient compared to the H-POM. From this result, it is clear that the Na+ bound to the anionic cluster has a major impact on the electron transfer process compared to the H+. To quantify the charge transfer between Na+ and anionic clusters, we performed Lӧwdin population analysis for the optimized geometries. The charge corresponding to anions and cations is −3.63 and 3.63 a.u for the Na-POM. The charge transfer potential is significantly higher compared to that of the H-POM (−0.642 and 0.642 a.u.) structure. This higher charge transfer can be correlated with the less charge transfer resistance observed experimentally from the EIS. The less complexation energy and more charge transfer of the Na-POM make it a good electrochemical material for Na-ion batteries.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nXRD measurements were performed to obtain the influence of excessive Mn/Ti co-substitution. As shown in Fig. 1a, the sharp and narrow peaks in the spectrum indicate good crystallinity. In addition, there are no impurity peaks in the diffraction patterns and the XRD patterns are clearly assigned to the Rc space group (PDF#00-053-0018) with a framework of the NASICON structure, which proves that Mn/Ti co-substitution has no influence on the NVP crystal structure. Obviously, the characteristic peaks of the doped samples have an offset to a smaller degree compared with the NVP, demonstrating that Mn2+ and Ti4+ have successfully entered the NVP structure. According to Bragg's law, the lattice spacing increases after Mn/Ti co-doping. Specifically, the larger Mn2+ ion (0.82 Å) occupying the V3+ site plays an important role to support the structure. While the relatively smaller Ti4+ ion (0.605 Å) in contrast to the local V3+ further increases the internal crystal space. Furthermore, to detect the cell parameter values of all the samples, the XRD result data are refined by the Highscore software shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S2.† The cell parameters are listed in Table 1. The refined XRD data shows that the volume of the unit cell for all the samples increases with the co-doping amount of Mn and Ti. This result is consistent with the variation trend presented in the insert of Fig. 1a. The increase in the volume of the crystal cell for Mn/Ti co-doped samples is derived from the comprehensive results of Mn/Ti co-substitution. In short, Mn/Ti co-doping causes a synergistic effect on the crystal characteristics, resulting in a stable construction with enlarged volume without destroying the crystal structure. At the same time, co-doping facilitates the expansion of the migration channels for Na+, thereby promoting the transmission rate of Na+. Therefore, the Mn/Ti co-doped composites will greatly enhance the dynamics of the modified materials.\nMoreover, the ICP-AES measurement is explored to verify the precise elemental doping concentration of all samples revealed in Table S1.† Obviously, the substitution ratios obtained by ICP-AES are so close to the theoretical compositions, indicating the successful synthesis of the targeted co-substituted Na3V2−xMnxTix(PO4)3/C@CNT samples.\nTo further detect the change in the lattice constant of MnTi0.15@CNTs, we used DFT calculations to check it. The model for the structures of all the samples by DFT calculation is revealed in Fig. S3† and the unit cell parameters calculated by DFT are shown in Table S2.† The values of a and c of the co-doped samples both enlarge with the increase in doping amount. Compared with NVP, the unit cell volume of the doped samples also increases gradually, which is consistent with the results obtained from the XRD refinement using the High-score software.\nTo further clarify the appearance characteristic of the samples, SEM images are revealed in Fig. S4† and Fig. 2. The comparison of the morphological features of all the samples at different magnifications is presented in Fig. S4.† All composites show a similar configuration with agglomerated active particles, possessing irregular morphologies. This is because that NVP is a multi-element metal salt. Under the action of strong static electricity, the anions and cations easily gather together and form micron-sized large particles at ultra-high crystallization temperature. Notably, the co-doped samples have a smaller grain size than the pure NVP composite, suggesting that these modified materials can provide a shorter pathway for ionic and electronic transportation. According to Fig. 2a, the distribution of the MnTi0.15@CNT sample is uniform. It shows clearly that the carbon nanotubes are attached to the surfaces of active particles or inserted into the bulk. As shown in Fig. 2b, the MnTi0.15@CNT sample has plentiful carbon nanotubes attached and evenly distributed among the grains. The morphology is relatively complete compared with other samples. The EDS image displayed in Fig. 2c detects the presence and the distribution density of the atoms including Na, Mn, Ti, V, P, O and C. For comparison, the EDX spectrum and mapping images of NVP are performed and the results are shown in Fig. S5 and S6.† Obviously, the Na, V, P, O and C elements are uniformly distributed in the particle, which confirms that Mn and Ti are successfully doped into the sample and evenly distributed over the sample.\nTo explore whether the carbon nanotubes are successfully mixed into the sample, and whether the lattice stripes of the samples are consistent with NVP, the samples are tested by TEM. The resulting graphs are analyzed using the Digital micrograph software. As shown in Fig. 2d, it can be seen from the TEM image that the surface of the particles is covered with a carbon layer and tubular CNTs are attached to the surface. These carbon-based materials can construct an effective conductive framework to accelerate the transportation of electrons. Moreover, as presented in Fig. 2e, the selected lattice spacing of this sample is 0.372 nm, which matches well with the (006) of the NVP system. The result is obtained from Fig. S7a.† Besides, the fast flourier transform images (FFT) (Fig. S7b†) indicate that the sample has an obvious RC rhombus structure.\nIn order to further detect the contents of CNTs, a TG test on doped samples is carried out and the results are shown in Fig. S8.† All curves show the same trend and the carbon content of MnTi0.05@CNTs (Fig. S8b†), MnTi0.15@CNTs (Fig. S8c†) and MnTi0.20@CNTs (Fig. S8d†) is about 11%. It demonstrates that the doping amount of CNTs in these samples is the same. Moreover, the mass loss rate of NVP (Fig. S8a†) is only 5%, which demonstrates that the content of CNTs is kept at 6% for the co-doped samples except for the carbon source added in the preparation of the precursor.\nFurthermore, the XPS test is performed to determine the chemical state of elements in the MnTi0.15@CNT sample. The survey spectrum in Fig. S9† demonstrates that Mn and Ti have been successfully doped into the NVP bulk. The orbits of each element are V2p, C1s, Mn2p, and Ti2p. Through the XPS solid surface analysis, elemental composition, atomic valence and surface energy spectral analyses are obtained. After fitting the original date (Fig. 3a), the fitted peaks are located at 641.4 eV and 653 eV, which agree well with Mn2+ 2p1/2 and Mn2+ 2p3/2. Moreover, the satellite peaks located at 645.8 eV and 655.8 eV indicate that there is a separation energy of 4.4 eV for Mn2+ 2p1/2 and 2.8 eV for Mn2+ 2p3/2. As shown in Fig. 3b, the peaks of Ti2p are 464.5 eV and 458.5 eV, which prove the existence of Ti4+ 2p1/2 and Ti4+ 2p3/2. Besides, the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 3c) is split into four peaks, including 284.8, 286, 289 and 291 eV, which are respectively corresponding to the four bonds of C–O, C–O, CO and π–π*. The fitted results show that the peaks of V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 are 523.8 eV and 516.4 eV, respectively, in Fig. 3d, demonstrating that vanadium is trivalent in the V–O band. These results indicate that Mn and Ti are successfully doped into the crystal, and when a positive divalent Mn replaces the trivalent V site, the loss of electrons causes a part of the hole in the V–O covalent bond, resulting in beneficial p-type doping. In addition, when positive tetravalent Ti replaces the trivalent V sites, the excess electrons also participate in the electronic transport, introducing the favorable n-typing substitution.\nMoreover, BET measurement is carried out to explore the surface area and pore size of all samples. The BET plots of MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs, MnTi0.20@CNTs, and NVP are shown in Fig. 3e and Fig. S10a,† whose surface values are 17.230 m2 g−1, 23.796 m2 g−1, 22.198 m2 g−1 and 16.035 m2 g−1, respectively. Notably, the co-doped samples have a larger specific area than the pure NVP sample. A large specific surface area can effectively increase the contact area between the active material and the electrolyte. MnTi0.15@CNT possesses the biggest surface area, indicating it can provide the most active sites for the de-intercalation of Na+. The aperture nature of all the samples is presented in Fig. 3f and Fig. S10b.† Obviously, the pore size of MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs, MnTi0.20@CNTs and NVP are 11.249 nm, 8.156 nm, 10.088 nm and 8.238 nm, respectively, indicating that all composites possess the mesoporous feature. The smaller pore size and the porous structure can facilitate electrolyte penetration, speeding up the transmission of sodium ions in the structure and then improving the electrochemical performance of the battery.\nThe influence of Mn/Ti substitution and CNT enwrapping on the electrochemical performance of NVP is manifested through the rate properties and the cycling stability of all the samples. Fig. 4a shows the initial charge and discharge curve of the assembled batteries composed of all the samples at 0.1 C recorded from 2.3–4.1 V vs. Na+/Na. When sodium ions are deintercalated at the M2 site, as shown in the figure, a voltage plateau appears at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na, which matches the redox reaction of the V3+/V4+ couple. The polarization voltage of MnTi0.15@CNTs is smaller than those of other samples. Battery polarization is the potential difference caused by the irreversible electrode electromotive force deviating from the balanced electrode potential during the electrode process. Thus, a small polarization voltage means a good reversible effect. The polarization voltage of NVP is significantly higher than those of the co-doped samples. The diffusion path of Na+ can be expanded after doping with Mn and Ti, which speeds up the de/intercalation process. When the cut-off voltage is 2.3 V, the initial capacity of NVP, MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs, MnTi0.20@CNTs are 69.4, 91.8, 97.92, and 96.04 mA h g−1, respectively. MnTi0.15@CNTs exhibit the best electrochemical performance. It also demonstrates that Mn/Ti co-doping accompanied with CNT enwrapping can increase the specific capacity effectively. Fig. 4b shows the specific capacities at different rates of 1, 2, 5, 9, 12, 15 and 1C. It is obvious that the specific capacity of NVP is much lower than that of the co-doped samples. The initial capacities of MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs, MnTi0.20@CNTs and NVP are 83.71, 91.21, 89.4 and 67.4 mA h g−1 at 1C, respectively. Compared with the specific capacity at different 1C rates, the capacity retention values of MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs, MnTi0.20@CNTs and NVP are 99.6%, 100%, 99.7% and 99.5%, respectively, which indicate that the Mn/Ti co-doped cathodes can effectively improve the reversible performance of the battery, and the rate performance of MnTi0.15@CNTs achieves the best.\nFig. 4c shows the cycle performance at 1C of all samples. All tests are performed within the voltage range of 2.3–4.1 V. The overall trend of Mn/Ti co-doped samples is much gentler than that of NVP. Quantifying this trend, the initial capacities of NVP, MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs and MnTi0.20@CNTs are 82.9, 87.23, 88.48 and 83.8 mA h g−1 at 1C. The capacity retention values of MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs, and MnTi0.20@CNTs are obtained as 86%, 89% and 87%, which are much higher than 55% of NVP. Clearly, the stability of Mn/Ti co-doped electrodes is better than that of NVP at 1C, and MnTi0.15@CNTs is the best of all electrodes. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of MnTi0.15@CNTs is revealed in Fig. 4c, maintaining about 99% in the prolonged process, indicating the excellent electrochemical reversibility of the optimized MnTi0.15@CNT composite. In summary, MnTi0.15@CNTs have better sodium storage performance than the other samples. Furthermore, to explore the superior cycle performance of MnTi0.15@CNTs at higher rate densities, the assembled half-cell was tested at 5C and 15C as shown in Fig. 4d. Significantly, the specific capacity remains relatively stable at 5C and 15C. It can provide a high reversible capacity of 83.24 mA h g−1 at 5C and retain a value of 60.74 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 73.0%. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency retains a high level of nearly 99%, demonstrating the stabilized reversibility even at a high rate. When cycling at 15C, it presents an initial capacity of 77.45 mA h g−1 and keeps as 59.5 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles, suggesting a great retention value of 76.8%. Based on the superior cyclic performance of MnTi0.15@CNTs at a high rate, the cycling property at ultra-high rates of 90C and 180C are tested and the results are shown in Fig. 4e. It is obvious that the graph keeps gentle. The reversible capacity of MnTi0.15@CNTs is 70.3 and 68.2 mA h g−1 at 90 and 180C. After 1000 cycles, MnTi0.15@CNTs still deliver a high capacity of 59.5 and 53.8 mA h g−1 at 90C and 180C with a retention ratio of 82.5% (90C) and 78.9% (180C). Although suffering from a long cycle at high rates, the retention ratio of capacity still remains stable. During the 1000th cycle, the capacity attention ratio of MnTi0.15@CNTs is relatively low (0.018% for 90C and 0.021% for 180C), suggesting the stabilized crystal structure of the modified MnTi0.15@CNT electrode. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of MnTi0.15@CNTs remains at around 99% during 1000 cycles at 90C and 180C. Compared with the coulombic efficiency at 1C and 5C, the curve fluctuates more obviously. In particular, at 180C, the curve has a wider range of fluctuations up and down. This phenomenon may result from the intensive stimulation of super high current and this large current leads to the fast de-intercalation of Na+, thus affecting the stability of the positive electrode material structure. Notably, the coulombic efficiency value still remains within the range of about 99%. It can be concluded that even at high rates, MnTi0.15@CNTs still maintain a striking electrochemical performance during the prolonged process. From the electrochemical performance of the battery, the reversible capacity of the battery is greatly improved after doping with Mn and Ti, and the battery capacity remains stable under high rates and long cycles. It can be proved that the stability of the doped sample is also good over a long period. Moreover, TEM tests of MnTi0.15@CNTs after 1000 cycles at 90C were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. S11.† The FFT images and distribution images are analyzed using the Digital Micrograph software. Notably, the lattice space of 0.91 nm shown in the figure corresponds to the (024) crystal plane of the NVP system. It demonstrates that the crystal structure is hardly damaged after the prolonged cycles at a high current density value of 90C, indicating the significantly enhanced structure of the optimized MnTi0.15@CNT composite. Furthermore, Table 2 shows the contrast of electrochemical performance among MnTi0.15@CNTs and other modified NVP samples. Obviously, the optimized MnTi0.15@CNT electrode presents a superior sodium storage property both in rate capability and cyclic performance.\nThe CV curves of all electrodes are revealed in Fig. 5 to evaluate the kinetic characteristics. Obviously, there is one pair of oxidation and reduction peaks for all electrodes as shown in Fig. 5a, indicating that the reaction is reversible. The positions of the oxidation and reduction peaks of each sample are similar, which is at about 3.5 and 3.3 V, respectively. Obviously, the peak intensity of the MnTi0.15@CNT sample is higher, indicating that the reversibility of this sample is better. Fig. 5b shows the CV curve at different scan rates of MnTi0.15@CNTs. The intensity of the peak and acreage gradually increase with the increase in the sweeping speed, which is due to the existence of electric double layer capacitors and the current through the capacitor has a linear relationship with the sweep speed. Fig. S12(a and c†) shows the CV curves of MnTi0.05@CNTs and MnTi0.20@CNTs. Fig. 5c is obtained after linear fitting of the peak value at each sweep speed. The peak current at each sweep speed is linearly related to the square root of the sweep speed. According to the slope value obtained by fitting the graph, the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions can be calculated from formula (1).\nIn formula (1), n, A, C and v represent the number of electrons transferred, contact area, Na+ concentration and the scan rate. The value of n and A are equal to 2 and 2.0096 cm2. The calculated DNa+ values are listed in Table 3. It can be observed from Table 3 that the charge–discharge diffusion coefficient of MnTi0.15@CNTs is the highest, which is 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that of NVP. Meanwhile, it is proved that Mn and Ti co-doping can greatly improve the mobility of sodium ions.\nPseudocapacitance is a reversible electrochemical reaction that occurs on the surface of the electrode material, and the pseudocapacitance reaction can be divided into three reversible electrochemical processes, including redox reaction, insertion/extraction mechanism and underpotential deposition. Through dynamic calculations, we can explore the relationship between the scan rate (v, mV s−1) and the resulting current response (i, A). If the current i changes with the 0.5th power of v, the battery behavior is dominated; if the current i is linear with v, then the reaction is a surface control process, which is a kind of capacitive behavior. It can be observed from Fig. S12(e–g†) that the peak current and sweep speed have a linear relationship. It can be expressed by the function Ip = avb. When the value of b is 0.5, it exhibits battery behavior. If the value of b equals 1, it will exhibit pseudo-capacitance properties. It can be seen from Fig. S12(e–g†) that the b value lies between 0.5–1, so it shows battery behavior and pseudocapacitance properties. The contribution rate of pseudocapacitance behavior to charge storage can be calculated by formula (2).\nwhere v is the scan rate and k1 and k2 are adjustable parameters. When the value of k is obtained, a smooth curve is used to connect the specified voltage and k1v to the card to perform the nonlinear fitting. Integrating the fitted closed curve is useful to calculate the area. The ratio of the two areas is the pseudocapacitance contribution rate. As shown in Fig. 5d, the pseudocapacitance contribution rate of MnTi0.15@CNTs at 2 mV s−1 is 55%. It is higher than that of the pure NVP sample, indicating that the high pseudocapacitance contribution rate helps Na+ achieve rapid charge storage at high current densities, thereby exhibiting rapid sodium storage and high capacity.\nFurthermore, EIS measurement is carried out to explore the influence of Mn/Ti co-doping on the electrochemical behaviors of all electrodes. Fig. 6a reveals the AC impedance spectrum of all samples. By comparing with the equivalent circuit diagram, the fitted results of Rct values are listed in Table 4. The low-frequency region can reflect the migration process of Na+. After fitting the low-frequency region (Fig. 6b), the calculated values of DNa+ were obtained based on Formulae (3) and (4), as shown in Table 4.\nAs shown in Table 4, the Rct values of MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs, and MnTi0.20@CNTs are much lower than that of NVP/C. Notably, the MnTi0.15@CNT sample possesses the minimum Rct value compared with other samples, indicating that Mn/Ti co-doping can effectively increase the electronic conductivity in the electrochemical reactions. When the doping amount is 0.15, the best performance is achieved. Moreover, the DNa+ value of the MnTi0.15@CNT electrode is 2.01 × 10−14 cm2 s−1, which is much higher than that of NVP/C, demonstrating the superior kinetic capability of the modified MnTi0.15@CNT sample, coinciding well with the distinctive sodium storage property revealed in Fig. 4.\nGalvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) technology is used to effectively determine the variation trend of DNa+ with the changes in the state-of-charge (SOC). The GITT test is mainly composed of constant current and relaxation, including standing, charging/discharging, and standing in one cycle. The battery is activated twice before the GITT test at 0.1 C, aiming to ensure the stability and activity of the electrode materials. Fig. 7a shows the overall GITT curves of MnTi0.15@CNTs during the charge and discharge process. A platform appears at 3.4 V during the charging and discharging procedure, resulting from the phase transition and sodium transport being in equilibrium. It corresponds to the voltage platform of NVP shown in Fig. 4a. In order to describe the relationship between the potential E and the time T, Fick's second law is used as follows:\nIn formula (5), all constants can be obtained from experimentation or experience value. The detailed single procedure for GITT measurement during the charge and discharge process is revealed in Fig. 7b and c, from which we can obtain the values of ΔES and ΔEτ. Besides, Fig. S13a and S13b† demonstrate that the square root of time and potential show a linear relationship, resulting in the simplification of formula (5) to formula (6). According to Fick's second law, the change in the trend of DNa+ in the charging and discharging process is shown in Fig. 7d. Obviously, DNa+ reaches its minimum value at 3.4 V during the charge and discharge process. This fits well with the voltage platform in Fig. 7a, which is caused by the interaction of Na+ with the skeleton framework during the phase transition between Na3V2(PO4) and Na1V2(PO4).\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthesis route\nThe experimental process is shown in Fig. S1.† All samples were prepared by a conventional sol–gel method. Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, C12H28O4Ti, C6H8O7·H2O, NaH2PO4, and NH4VO3 were used as raw materials. C6H8O7·H2O was used as the reductant and complexing agent. Firstly, we calculated the required amount of each source material according to the ratio. Then Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, C12H28O4Ti, and NaH2PO4 were added into the NH4VO3 solution prepared in advance. At the same time, the solution was kept stirring at 80 °C. The color changes during the mixing process. Simultaneously, we used a cell crusher to prepare CNT dispersion. Subsequently, we added the CNT dispersion into the mixture and it was kept stirring for 0.5–1 h until the solution was left with 20–30 mL. Then we removed the remaining sticky matter from the beaker, and the mixture was cooled to room temperature. After freeze-drying, the sample needed to be initially burned at a termination temperature of 450 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for 4 h. The final heat treatment was performed at 700 °C with the same heating rate for 6 h. For comparison, pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 was also synthesized by the same sol–gel method, and the raw material were C6H8O7·H2O, NaH2PO4 and NH4VO3. The process was similar to the preparation route of Na3V2−xMnxTix(PO4)3/C@CNT materials. The obtained Na3V2−xMnxTix(PO4)3/C@CNTs(x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.20) are abbreviated as NVP, MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs and MnTi0.20@CNTs.\n\n2.2 Characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was utilized to determine the crystal structure of the samples. The particle size and morphology were obtained from the scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope (SEM/TEM) tests. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to detect the elemental valence of the samples. The specific surface and pore diameter of the sample were measured by the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method. The carbon content of the samples was detected by thermogravimetric (TG) measurement. The concentrations of Mn and Ti of all the samples were quantitatively measured using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical performance tests\nThe electrochemical performance of all samples was evaluated by assembling CR2016 coin type half-cells in a glovebox filled with Ar gas. Active materials, carbon black and PVDF were dispersed into an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution according to the mass ratio of 7:2:1 to prepare a slurry as the cathode and the mixture was poured into the ball mill tank and ground for 4 h to get a uniform slurry. The slurry was smeared on the surface of the aluminum foil by a coating machine and then was vacuum dried for 12 h. The dried pole pieces were punched into a wafer with a diameter of 16 mm. The wafer was used as the cathode and the sodium flakes were used as the anode. 1 M NaClO4, EC/DEC (1:1) and 5% FEC were used as the electrolytes. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles were recorded by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e, China), and the voltage range of the CV curve was 2.3–4.1 V. The scan rate of CV tests was 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mV s−1. Electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted with the frequency range of 10 MHz–100 MHz by an electrochemical workstation. The Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) and the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were tested using a LAND-2001A test instrument conducted within 2.3–4.1 V (potential vs. Na/Na+) at room temperature.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthesis route\nThe experimental process is shown in Fig. S1.† All samples were prepared by a conventional sol–gel method. Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, C12H28O4Ti, C6H8O7·H2O, NaH2PO4, and NH4VO3 were used as raw materials. C6H8O7·H2O was used as the reductant and complexing agent. Firstly, we calculated the required amount of each source material according to the ratio. Then Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, C12H28O4Ti, and NaH2PO4 were added into the NH4VO3 solution prepared in advance. At the same time, the solution was kept stirring at 80 °C. The color changes during the mixing process. Simultaneously, we used a cell crusher to prepare CNT dispersion. Subsequently, we added the CNT dispersion into the mixture and it was kept stirring for 0.5–1 h until the solution was left with 20–30 mL. Then we removed the remaining sticky matter from the beaker, and the mixture was cooled to room temperature. After freeze-drying, the sample needed to be initially burned at a termination temperature of 450 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for 4 h. The final heat treatment was performed at 700 °C with the same heating rate for 6 h. For comparison, pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 was also synthesized by the same sol–gel method, and the raw material were C6H8O7·H2O, NaH2PO4 and NH4VO3. The process was similar to the preparation route of Na3V2−xMnxTix(PO4)3/C@CNT materials. The obtained Na3V2−xMnxTix(PO4)3/C@CNTs(x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.20) are abbreviated as NVP, MnTi0.05@CNTs, MnTi0.15@CNTs and MnTi0.20@CNTs.\n\n2.2 Characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was utilized to determine the crystal structure of the samples. The particle size and morphology were obtained from the scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope (SEM/TEM) tests. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to detect the elemental valence of the samples. The specific surface and pore diameter of the sample were measured by the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method. The carbon content of the samples was detected by thermogravimetric (TG) measurement. The concentrations of Mn and Ti of all the samples were quantitatively measured using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical performance tests\nThe electrochemical performance of all samples was evaluated by assembling CR2016 coin type half-cells in a glovebox filled with Ar gas. Active materials, carbon black and PVDF were dispersed into an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution according to the mass ratio of 7:2:1 to prepare a slurry as the cathode and the mixture was poured into the ball mill tank and ground for 4 h to get a uniform slurry. The slurry was smeared on the surface of the aluminum foil by a coating machine and then was vacuum dried for 12 h. The dried pole pieces were punched into a wafer with a diameter of 16 mm. The wafer was used as the cathode and the sodium flakes were used as the anode. 1 M NaClO4, EC/DEC (1:1) and 5% FEC were used as the electrolytes. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles were recorded by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e, China), and the voltage range of the CV curve was 2.3–4.1 V. The scan rate of CV tests was 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mV s−1. Electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted with the frequency range of 10 MHz–100 MHz by an electrochemical workstation. The Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) and the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were tested using a LAND-2001A test instrument conducted within 2.3–4.1 V (potential vs. Na/Na+) at room temperature.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nFig. 1a schematically depicts the complete manufacturing process for ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. First, ZIF-8 with a regular dodecahedral structure containing a Zn source is prepared by the solvothermal method. Next Mo ions are adsorbed on the surface of the obtained ZIF-8 by soaking in ammonium molybdate solution. Subsequently, one-step pyrolysis selenization treatment is applied to ultimately produce ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. During the process, rich heterointerfaces can be formed between ZnSe and MoSe2, and organic functional groups are converted to N-doped carbon. These favor the Na ion transportation. The XRD pattern and morphology of the as prepared ZIF-8 are shown in Fig. S1.† The even polyhedral structure with an edge length of ∼250 nm can be clearly seen. Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. The remarkable peaks at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.6°, 65.8° and 72.6° can be assigned to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) planes of cubic ZnSe (PDF #37-1463), while the other distinct peaks located at 13.6°, 31.6°, 37.1°, 38.4° and 55.9° can be assigned to the (003), (101), (104), (015) and (110) planes of cubic MoSe2 (PDF #20-0757). This clear two-phase crystal structure indicates that we have successfully constructed the heterojunction of ZnSe and MoSe2. The synthesized ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is further characterized by XPS. The Se 3d, Mo 3d, C sp3, N and Zn 2p peaks appear in the full XPS survey spectrum of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. To be specific, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Mo 3d of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC are shown in Fig. 1c. The peaks at about 228.7 and 231.9 eV in the samples are fitted to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, suggesting the existence of Mo(IV). The Zn 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 1d show two prominent peaks (1021.2/1044.2 eV), which are well matched with the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 spin orbitals of ZnSe, respectively. In the Se 3d XPS spectra the peaks fit nicely to 3d3/2 (55.4 eV) and 3d5/2 (54.4 eV) characteristic of Se in ZnSe/MoSe2 (Fig. 1e). The C–C sp2 and C–C sp3 show two separate peaks in the C 1s curve (Fig. 1f) at 284.9 and 286.5 eV, respectively. The N 1s curve (Fig. 1g) shows three characteristic peaks at 398.7 eV, 399.9 eV and 401.2 eV, which can be indexed to the pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, respectively. The pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen atoms make up a large fraction, which can cause numerous defects and, as a result, a significant increase in active reaction sites, as well as improve the hybrid's conductivity.\nFESEM, TEM, and HRTEM examinations are used to investigate the precise morphological and structural information of the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC product. ZnSe/MoSe2@NC has a homogeneous microspheric structure with an edge length of around 3 μm, as per the SEM images shown in Fig. 2a and b. It can be clearly observed that the regular dodecahedron is covered by the nanosheets with a thickness of around 30 nm from the TEM image (Fig. 2c and d). It can be speculated that the MoSe2 nanosheets are successfully transformed on the surface of the Zn-polyhedron. Clearly visible at the edges are the lattice fringes with internal spacings of 0.288 nm and 0.67 nm. Further analysis confirms them to be the (200) crystal plane of ZnSe and the (003) phase plane of MoSe2 (Fig. 2e), respectively. The electron diffraction pattern of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC clearly shows five rings (Fig. 2f), indexed to the (110), (107), (015) and (012) planes of MoSe2 and the (111) plane of ZnSe from outside to inside. The homogeneous distribution of Mo, Zn, Se, C, and N elements in the high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF)-scanning TEM (STEM) and related elemental mapping images (Fig. 2g) supports the synthesis of the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC hybrid. Pure ZnSe and MoSe2 are produced and analyzed by XRD and SEM measurements for comparison (Fig. S3 and S4†). The BET surface area of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is calculated to be 44.09 m2 g−1, suggesting that the porous property of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC can be maintained after thermal treatment. This is advantageous for Na+ storage.\nIn order to explore the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC, initially, a CV test is performed using a voltage range of 0.01–3 V and a sweep speed of 0.1 mV s−1. Fig. 3a shows the test results from the first three cycles. The steep reduction peaks at 0.31 and 0.72 V during the first cathodic process are caused by Na+ insertion into ZnSe/MoSe2@NC and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. During the process, NaxZnSe and NaxMoSe2 are generated. The other two reduction peaks at 0.99 and 1.75 V correspond to the conversion event that produces Na2Se, Zn, and Mo. In addition, subsequent cycles show CV spectra with minimal variations, demonstrating that ZnSe/MoSe2@NC has high electrochemical reversibility. The GCD curves show that the first discharge/charge specific capacities of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC are 667.1 mA h g−1/453.2 mA h g−1 under a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 3b), with a calculation of the first coulombic efficiency of 68.1 percent. At the same time, the plateau of the curve is consistent with the above CV results. After 100 cycles, ZnSe/MoSe2@NC produces a specific capacity of 401.8 mA h g−1 for cycling performance at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, ZnSe/MoSe2@NC demonstrates outstanding rate capability (Fig. 3d and e). Specific capacities of 438.9, 413.1, 396.1, 383.3, 370, and 350 mA h g−1 are reached at rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g−1, respectively. The capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC returns to 426.2 mA h g−1 when the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1. Based on the rate performance of pure ZnSe and MoSe2 (Fig. S6 and S7†), ZnSe/MoSe2@NC apparently shows more competitive Na ion storage, which is attributed to the excellent structure and heterogeneous interface effect of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. The excellent rate capability of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is the best among the previously reported transition metal selenides for SIBs (Fig. 3f). The ZnSe/MoSe2@NC also exhibits a good ultra-cycle life at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 3g). After 1500 repeated discharge/charge cycles, the capacity would stabilize at 345.7 mA h g−1 with good reversibility.\nReaction kinetics analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC in SIBs is further conducted. As shown in Fig. 4a with CV curves obtained at different scan speeds ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1, six peaks can be defined from the CV curves of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. The rules are generally followed between peak current i and scan rate ν: i = aνb and log(i) = blog(ν) + log(a). The b in this equation is the slope in Fig. 4c and b values are generally between 0.5 and 1.0. The mechanism of sodium storage can be judged according to the value of b: when the b value is 0.5, it indicates that sodium storage is a bulk intercalation reaction. If the b value is close to 1.0, then the electrochemical kinetics are determined by the surface or near surface pseudo capacitance reaction. The b values obtained by fitting the positive and negative peaks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 0.53, 0.98, 0.99, 0.99, 0.85, and 0.74, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4c. The majority of b values are far greater than 0.5, which shows that the reaction kinetics of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC electrode materials is mostly determined by the pseudo capacitance of the surface or near surface. The contribution of surface pseudo capacitance to battery capacity can be calculated quantitatively using the following formula: i(ν) = k1ν + k2ν0.5, which is a general definition. The contribution percentage of pseudo capacitance at 0.2 mV s−1 sweep speed is 83.09 percent, according to calculations (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4d and S8† also show the contribution ratio of the surface pseudo capacitance of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC at different scan speeds. For scan speeds of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mV s−1, the ratios of pseudo capacitive contributions are calculated to be 74.64 percent, 83.09 percent, 86.48 percent, 89.01 percent, 90.44 percent, and 91.87 percent, respectively. The contribution ratio of pseudo capacitance increases as the sweep speed increases. Such a high capacitive contribution of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is due to the layered and porous structure, greatly shortening the ion/electron transport distance. Additionally, the excellent electrical conductivity also speeds up the transportation of electrons. ZnSe and MoSe2 could promote the ion and electron transport at the same time, which contributes to the performance of SIBs.\nThe GCD curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC/Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cell at 0.1 A g−1 is shown in Fig. 5a. The nearly overlapping charge–discharge curves show the excellent reversibility of the SIB full battery. Fig. 5b depicts that a capacity of 288.2 mA h g−1 can be maintained after 50 repeated discharge/charge cycles by the full cell, indicating the high cycle life. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC/Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cell can clearly illuminate an LED device (inset of Fig. 5b), suggesting that it has promising applications. As is vividly shown in Fig. 5c, the discharge specific capacities of 301.8, 275.2, 252.1, 239.5, 202.4 and 190.3 mA h g−1 are gained at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. And when the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, it can still recover the initial discharge specific capacity, which shows its good rate performance in full cells. The relationship between power and energy density of SIBs in other documented studies is shown in Fig. 5d. In the Ragone plot, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC anode-based full cell exhibits the highest energy density of 175.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1, demonstrating the potential for application of the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC anode in SIB full cells.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Synthesis of ZIF-8\nThe solution approach was used to make ZIF-8 from zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2). The following was the precise preparation procedure: solution A was prepared by ultrasonically dissolving 810 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in 20 mL methanol. 721.6 mg C4H6N2 was dissolved in 20 mL methanol at the same time, and solution B was prepared uniformly using ultrasound. The B solution was promptly added to the A solution after mixing, and the mixture was agitated constantly for 24 hours, centrifuged, washed 3 times (ethanol), and dried overnight in a 60 °C oven to yield ZIF-8.\n\n2.2. Synthesis of the Zn/Mo-ZIF precursor\nIn 20 mL N,N-dimethylformamide, 0.1 g ZIF-8 was dissolved. After complete dissolution, to the combined solution was added 0.1 g ammonium molybdate and agitated for 30 minutes. Then it was heated for 6 hours at 150 °C in a 50 mL stainless steel high-pressure reaction kettle. After cooling, the products were recovered by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 minutes, washed multiple times, and kept in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 24 hours.\n\n2.3. Synthesis of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC\nZn/Mo-ZIF and selenium powder were thoroughly combined at a mass ratio of 1:2, then calcined at 600 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1 under an inert atmosphere, and then annealed for 2 h to get ZnSe–NC@MoSe2–NC. To obtain pure ZnSe, ZIF-8 and selenium powder (mass ratio: 1:2) were calcined under the same conditions. For preparing MoSe2, 79 mg selenium powder was stirred continuously for 1 h, then dissolved in 5 mL hydrazine standard solution, and 0.12 g sodium molybdate dihydrate was dissolved in deionized water (20 mL). The mixture was heated at 200 °C for 12 hours in a 50 mL stainless steel high-pressure reactor. To acquire the MoSe2 sample, the powder was chilled and centrifuged, washed and dried for 24 hours (60 °C). Finally it was kept for two hours in a tube furnace at 600 °C.\n\n2.4. Material characterization\nIn this experiment, a total of 5 different structural and morphological characterization methods were used for ZnSe/MoSe2@NC, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi, SU-9010) for observing the clear morphology and lattice fringe of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D/MAX-2000, Cu Kα), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement (ASAP 2020) and XPS (ESCALAB, 250Xi).\n\n2.5. Electrochemical measurements\nMetal sodium was employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode in the half cell, while the working electrode was made up of the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC active material, conductive carbon black, and binder in a 7:2:1 ratio, with the addition of an appropriate amount of N-methylpyrrolidone as solvent. After grinding and coating for 30 min, the electrode was vacuum dried at 60 °C for 10 h. The active material mass loading is about 0.6–0.8 mg cm−2. Battery assembly was done in a glove box. The electrolyte was NaClO4 with a molar concentration of 1 M. In this experiment, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were obtained on an electrochemical workstation. The constant current charge–discharge (GCD) test of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC was performed with a battery test system manufactured by Neware. The voltage range was from 0.01 V to 3.0 V. The full cell assembly is similar to the half-cell assembly; the weight ratio of ZnSe/MoSe2@NC (anode) and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (cathode) is 1:4. Then they were coupled to assemble a SIB full cell in a glove box. Before assembling the full cell, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC was pre-sodiated in a half-cell for 5 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 to ensure the formation of a stable SEI film. The electrolyte (150 μL) and separator were the same as those of half cells. The energy density calculation of the full cell is according to the total mass of the anode and cathode, as well as the median voltage of the batteries. The voltage window of the full cell testing is 1.2–3.8 V.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nTo examine the crystal structure and composition of the prepared samples, XRD measurements were carried out, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 1(a). For GO/MoS2, the observed (002), (100) and (110) characteristic diffraction peaks (2H-MoS2 JCPDS card No. 37-1492) can be found in the GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) samples. It can be found that the structural characteristics of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) share similarities. The differences are since the N plasma treatment influences the structure of MoS2. The diffraction peaks corresponding to the (002) crystal surface of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) obviously shift to a lower angle (2θ = 8.8°) compared to the original Go/MoS2 (2θ = 13.6°). According to the Bragg's equation, nλ = 2dsinθ, where n, λ, d, and θ, respectively, represent a positive integer, the incident X-ray wavelength, the spacing distance, and the diffraction angle. The d corresponding to the first XRD peak represents the layer spacing of MoS2. GO/MoS2 shows the (002) peak at 2θ = 13.6° in the Cu Kα line (λ = 0.15418 nm) as the incident light, corresponding to an interlayer distance of 0.65 nm. XRD patterns of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) clearly show the shift of the (002) peak to 8.8°, corresponding to an interlayer distance of 0.98 nm. The increased distance of 0.33 nm matches well with the size of NH4+ with a hydrogen bond diameter of about 0.35 nm. Additionally, the peaks of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) are weak compared with GO/MoS2. This indicates that MoS2 nanosheets are few-layer structures without restacking. Compared with GO/MoS2, the (100) and (110) peaks of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) have offset to the left. This indicates that the (100) and (110) peaks in diffraction expanded, which may derive from the defect formation along the basal planes of MoS2. After N plasma treatment, a new peak that is assigned to graphene emerges at about 2θ = 22°, which indicates the destruction of the interlayer structure of GO, and GO is effectively reduced to rGO. And the intensity of the peak becomes weak, which demonstrates that N plasma treatment reduces the crystallinity of the samples.\nFig. 1(b) shows the Raman images of GO/MoS2, GO/MoS2 (ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE). In the Raman spectrum, the A1g and E12g peaks represent the out-of-plane vibrational modes and in-plane vibrational modes of 2H-phase molybdenum sulfide, which are characteristic peaks of MoS2. As shown in the enlarged part of Fig. 1(b), the peaks of A1g and E12g of the sample are located at 400 cm−1 and 374 cm−1, respectively, indicating that the MoS2 in the sample is the structure of 2H phase. The D peak and G peak are attributed to the vibration of carbon in the sp2 orbital. The G peak corresponds to the E2g phonon vibration in the center of the Brillouin zone. The D peak is a defect peak caused by stretching of carbon at sp2 atoms. The two vibrational peaks at 1344 and 1591 cm−1 of the GO/MoS2 sample correspond to the D-band and G-band of graphene. The D and G bands of the GO/MoS2(ISE) and rGO/MoS2(ISE) samples appear at 1344/1344 and 1583/1576 cm−1, respectively. Through observation and calculation, the intensity ratio of the N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE) peaks is the largest (ID/IG = 1.06), followed by GO/MoS2 (ISE) (ID/IG = 1.05), and the ID/IG value (ID/IG = 1.005) of GO/MoS2 is the smallest. ID/IG is the intensity ratio between the D and G peaks, and this ratio can be used to describe the intensity relationship between these two peaks. The D peak represents the defects in the lattice, so the larger this value is, the more defects in graphene. And a previous study points out that the atom substitution defects inside and outside the graphene face formed by nitrogen atoms can improve the graphene conductivity.\nScheme 1 shows the synthesis flow of GO/MoS2 (ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE), and introduces the principle of the expansion of the interlayer spacing. In the hydrothermal process, L-cysteine will decompose in high temperature solution to obtain H2S and NH3, in which H2S serves as the source of sulfur for MoS2, and it is also a reducing agent, reducing MoO42− to MoS2, which can also partially reduce GO to rGO. NH3 will exist in the form of NH4+ in the solution and will be embedded in the interlayer of MoS2 during the formation of MoS2, consequently increasing the interlayer spacing of MoS2 from the initial 0.62 nm to 0.98 nm; the interlayer spacing increased by 0.36 nm. According to previous reports, the diameter of NH4+ is about 0.35 nm, which also agrees well with these results. In this way, MoS2 nanosheets can be grown vertically and closely on GO, and this can be observed in Fig. 2d, and furthermore MoS2 with fewer layers and larger interlayer spacing is obtained. These vertical MoS2 nanosheets with few layers and large interlayer spacing are tightly attached on the GO surface, which is conducive to electron transport and Na+ ion diffusion.\nFig. 2(a–c) depict a general view of the microstructure of GO/MoS2, GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) observed by SEM, respectively. The SEM image of GO/MoS2 shows a 3D flower-like appearance, which consists of several layers of petals stacked on top of each other. As can be seen from Fig. 2(b and c), GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) display similar morphology and structure, and the petal-like hybrid nanosheets are partially overlapped or crosslinked to form a three-dimensional structure, and GO/rGO is attached to the MoS2 nanosheets.\nAccording to the low-magnification TEM images (Fig. 3(a and b)), the GO/rGO and MoS2 nanosheets can be identified. The brighter region is GO/rGO, and the dark region represents MoS2. The narrower MoS2 region on GO/rGO, compared to an average size of about 100 nm, indicates that the MoS2 nanosheets grow vertically on the GO sheets. In the TEM image, GO was observed. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the GO and MoS2 are connected tightly. The GO is evenly distributed around the layered structure MoS2. The structures and morphologies of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) are similar. The interlayer spacing of the MoS2 (002) plane was 0.68 nm. From Fig. 3(c and d), it can be confirmed that MoS2 nanosheets are uniformly grown vertically on GO and rGO, and the measured MoS2(002) interlayer spacing is 0.98 nm, indicating the expansion of the interlayer spacing. Moreover, the number of layers of MoS2 is less than 5 layers, which is less than that of MoS2 studied in the past (usually more than 10 layers). This also proves that L-cysteine can inhibit the growth of MoS2 on the (002) surface during the hydrothermal process. The elemental distribution images of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) are shown in Fig. S2(c and d) (ESI†), corresponding to Fig. 2(b and c), respectively. It can be seen that MoS2 dominates and the C element is evenly distributed indicating that MoS2 grows uniformly on GO. This structure not only provides a buffer for the volume deformation of MoS2, but also increases the overall electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the content of N element was enhanced after plasma treatment.\nTo study the effect of the enlarged interlayer spacing and plasma treatment on the electrochemical performance of the samples, GO/MoS2, GO/MoS2 (ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE) were used to assemble SIBs, respectively. We assembled the coin cell with GO and rGO as the anode material, respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). GO exhibits a capacity of 5 mA h g−1 while rGO exhibits a capacity of 19 mA h g−1. The experimental results show that GO and rGO contribute very little to the capacity. As is shown in the charge–discharge curve in Fig. 4(a), at the current density of 100 mA g−1, the initial discharge specific capacity of GO/MoS2 is 720 mA h g−1, and it drops to 360 mA h g−1 after 51 cycles. This indicates the bad cycling stability of GO/MoS2. Subsequently, we studied the rate performance and cycling stability of GO/MoS2, GO/MoS2 (ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE). Fig. 4(b and c) show the charge–discharge curves of the first three cycles at 100 mA g−1 and the others obtained at 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1 respectively. From the Fig. 4(b), we can understand that at the current density of 100 mA g−1, the first cycle discharge specific capacity of GO/MoS2(ISE) is 840 mA h g−1, and the charging specific capacity is 500 mA h g−1. The corresponding first cycle discharge/charge specific capacity of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) is 1100/600 mA h g−1. The discharge specific capacity in the first cycle is significantly higher than that of charge mainly because of the formation of an SEI film, which basically remains the same in the subsequent cycles. In contrast, the specific capacity of N-rGO/MoS2 is higher than that of both GO/MoS2 (ISE) and GO/MoS2 in the first cycle, indicating that the expansion of the interlayer spacing and plasma treatment is beneficial to the improvement of the Na-ion storage capacity of the material. The capacity decays of N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE) and GO/MoS2 (ISE) in the first three cycles are faster than that of GO/MoS2 at the current density of 100 mA g−1. This is because the higher the capacity the material has, the more ions are stored, and the damage to the structure is larger, so the high capacity of the material shows the more obvious capacity decay in the first few cycles, which is a common phenomenon.\nFrom the rate performance in Fig. 4(d), we can conclude that compared with GO/MoS2, both GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) show brilliant rate performance; when going back from 2000 mA g−1 to 100 mA g−1, the capacity of the battery at 100 mA g−1 barely did not decrease compared with the original. In particular, the N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) exhibits the specific capacity of 477, 432, 377, and 334 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1 respectively, indicating its high rate capability, which is significantly higher than that of GO/MoS2 and GO/MoS2(ISE) with only 98 and 211 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1.\nTo test the cycling stability of the samples, the battery was cycled for 300 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 4(e). The N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) shows the best cycling stability with an excellent specific capacity of 540 mA h g−1, which is in distinct contrast with that of the slightly decreased GO/MoS2 (ISE), and the rapidly decreasing GO/MoS2. After 300 cycles, the capacity retention rate of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) reaches an ultra-large percentage of 97.13%, and the average decline percentage per cycle is close to 0.01%, which benefits from the expanded interlayer spacing remitting the volume change during the charge and discharge processes.\nThe cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments are performed at various sweep rates of 0.2 mV s−1 within 0.01–3.00 V, revealing the redox mechanisms and capacitive contributions of GO/MoS2 (ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE) (Fig. 5(a and b)). As displayed in Fig. 5(a), during the initial discharge process, the reduction peak at around 0.81 V is due to the intercalation of sodium ions into MoS2 and generates the intermediate NaxMoS2. With the progress of the negative sweep, after ∼0.40 V, the intermediate product NaxMoS2 undergoes new electrochemical decomposition to form Na2S and Mo. Subsequently, the reduction peak around 0.01 V is about the organic electrolyte being irreversibly decomposed to form a solid electrolyte membrane (SEI) and resulting in specific capacity loss. It is similar to the sodium storage principle of MoS2 reported in previous work. During the following charging process, a small oxidation peak appeared at about 0.70 V, which may be due to insufficient de-sodiumization of NaxMoS2. A broad oxidation peak appeared at 1.80 V, corresponding to the conversion reaction from Mo formation to MoS2. During the second discharge process, the original two peaks disappeared, and two new peaks appeared at 1.43 V and 0.71 V, which were related to the formation of Na2S and the combination of Na and Mo metal.Fig. 5(b) shows the CV curves of the first three cycles of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE). The basic redox mechanism of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) remains unchanged compared to GO/MoS2(ISE). It is worth noting that the peak of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) at 0.01 V is sharper and stronger than that of GO/MoS2(ISE) in the first cycle. This is mainly due to the good adsorption capacity of oxide graphene for Na+ ions, indicating that N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) has faster Na+ ion diffusion kinetics. For the subsequent cycling process, the CV curve almost coincides with the second cycle, indicating that the GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) have better stability during the repetitive sodium ion insertion/extraction process.\nIn order to further analyze the electrochemical properties, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed. Fig. 6(a) shows the equivalent circuit diagram of the samples, which includes contact resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg impedance (Zw). According to the equivalent circuit in Fig. 6, the Rct of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) is 583 Ω and 141 Ω respectively. The Rct of GO/MoS2 is much larger than both. It can be concluded that N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) possesses outstanding charge transfer ability. The contact resistances Rs of these three samples are similar, and this is due to the use of the same battery structure and electrolyte. According to the slope σ of the linear fitting line, the ion transport rate of the sample can be identified (σ is the diffusivity of the samples). The σ of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) and GO/MoS2(ISE) is 286 and 468 Ω s−1, respectively, which contrasted sharply with that of GO-MoS2 (1847 Ω s−1), indicating that the Na+ ion diffusion coefficient of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) is 1.64/6.46 times higher than that of GO/MoS2(ISE)/GO/MoS2. Therefore, the N plasma treatment and the increases in the interlayer spacing in MoS2 by the intercalation of NH4+ can effectively increase the diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions.\nFig. 7(a and b) show the CV curves of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) at different scan rates from 0.2 to 2 mV s−1. According to the equation i = aυb, where i is the peak current at the corresponding scan rate (υ, mV s−1), and a and b are empirical parameters, the degree of capacitive effect can be characterized by the equation log(i) = log(a) + blog(υ), as shown in Fig. 7(c and d). By calculation, the b values of the four peaks corresponding to the N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) are 1.04, 1.01, 0.85 and 0.86, respectively; and the values of GO/MoS2(ISE) are 0.855, 0.883, 0.761, and 0.775, respectively, indicating that N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) has superior capacitive kinetics. According to the formula i(V) = k1υ + k2υ1/2, where k1 and k2 are the determined values, k1υ represents capacitance contribution, and k2υ1/2 represents diffusion contribution, the percentage of capacitance and diffusion contribution at a certain scan rate can be obtained. This pseudocapacitive contribution originates from the extraction and intercalation of sodium ions between the MoS2 layers. Fig. 7(e and f) show the capacitance contribution of GO/MoS2(ISE) at 1 mV s−1. According to the calculations, the capacitive contributions for scan rates of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0 mV s−1 are 53%, 59%, 62%, 65%, 68% and 78%, respectively. Fig. 7(g and h) show the capacitance contribution of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) at 1 mV s−1. According to the calculations, the capacitive contributions for scan rates of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0 mV s−1 are 61%, 65%, 69%, 72%, 74% and 83%, respectively. The intrinsically fast Na+ transport and notable capacitance contribution of N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) work together to achieve a good electrochemical kinetic. The better electrochemical kinetic properties bring a better rate performance to N-rGO/MoS2(ISE)-based SIBs.\nBased on the above kinetics characterizations and analyses, it can be concluded that compared with the conventional GO/MoS2, the electrochemical performance of GO/MoS2 (ISE) synthesized by L-cysteine assisted hydrothermal synthesis has been significantly improved, both in Na+ storage capacity and cycling stability. The reasons for N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) obtaining such excellent electrochemical performance, mainly are: (1) the insertion of NH4+ makes the interlayer spacing larger, which can benefit the storage of ions, diminishing the resistance of Na+ transport, and reducing the damage to the material structure during the de-intercalation process; (2) the number of synthesized MoS2 layers is small, which can well alleviate the volume expansion during the charge and discharge process; (3) plasma treatment achieved N doping of graphene and MoS2, and reduced GO to rGO, thereby enhancing the electrical conductivity of the composites.\nTo investigate the storage mechanism of reversible sodium ion de-embedding, we performed ex situ XRD and XPS characterizations. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the ex situ XRD of N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE). The characteristic peak of MoS2 shifts to a lower angle during the discharge process; this is because the sodium ions are gradually inserted into the layers of MoS2, resulting in the layer spacing expansion. Along with the extraction of sodium ions in the charging process, the peak gradually returns to the initial state. It can be concluded that the sodium storage mechanism of MoS2 is highly reversible. However, since the XRD diffraction peaks of N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE) powder samples are inherently faint, and less on the electrode, we cannot accurately characterize the changes of diffraction peak positions under different charging and discharging states by ex situ XRD. To better determine this storage mechanism, we perform the ex situ XPS test (Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig, S7(a) (ESI†) shows the ex situ XPS fine spectra of Mo. Three peaks at 228.98 eV, 232.43 eV and 235.93 eV, correspond to Mo 3d5/2, Mo 3d3/2 of Mo+4 and a small amount of Mo+6, respectively. With the discharge process, the characteristic peak binding energy of Mo4+ decreases and increases in the following charge process, which is consistent with the reversible electrochemical reaction. This demonstrated that the insertion/extraction of Na+ in N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE) is accompanied by the valence state change of Mo during the discharge charging process. The binding energy and the percentage of peak area of Mo6+ increase with the electrochemical reaction process corresponding to the lower first-period Coulomb efficiency of N-rGO/MoS2 (ISE), and some of the Mo elements cannot reversibly undergo the valence change. Fig. S7(b) (ESI†) shows the reversible characteristic peak change of S. The binding energy increased during the discharge process, which derives from the elevated valence state of Mo during the discharge process. The ex situ XPS spectra of C 1s (Fig. S7(c), ESI†) remain stable during the charging and discharging process, indicating that GO did not participate in the electrochemical reaction.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthesis of materials\nSynthesis of GO/MoS2: graphene oxide was synthesized by the modified Hummers’ method. 30 mg of synthesized graphene oxide was added to 60 mL of deionized water, and the graphene oxide was completely dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication for 2 h in an ice bath. Subsequently, 1.7655 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 1.5225 g of thiourea were added in sequence, and the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h. After completion, the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL reaction kettle and kept at 220 °C for 24 h. A black precipitate was obtained, which was washed three times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation to obtain GO/MoS2 samples.\nSynthesis of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE): 30 mg of graphene oxide was taken and added to 22.5 mL of deionized water. Then it was sonicated in an ultrasonic machine for 1 h to make it fully dispersed in deionized water. Next, 300 mg of L-cysteine and 150 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O were added to the above graphene oxide dispersion, respectively. After stirring uniformly for 0.5 h, 22.5 mL of absolute ethanol was then added, and the resulting solution was poured into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and keep at 220 °C for 24 h. The resulting black precipitate was collected by suction filtration, washed three times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, respectively, and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12 h. GO/MoS2(ISE) was obtained. It was then put into a glass tube, nitrogen was passed for a period of time until the glass tube was filled with nitrogen, and it was treated with a plasma device for 40 min. The conditions of the treatment are nitrogen flow 100 mL min−1, the pressure in the glass tube is set to 40 Pa, and the power is set to 120 W. The obtained sample is labeled as N-rGO/MoS2(ISE).\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe crystal structures and phases of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) scanning at ambient temperature using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 5 to 80°. The morphology of the samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Inspect F50), and the elemental composition of the samples was analyzed by X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The internal microstructure and structure of the samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) at 200 kV, and the change of interlayer spacing was analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out under 532 nm laser light on a confocal Raman microscopy spectrometer (LabRAM HR UV-Visible). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the content of MoS2 and graphene in the N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) composites. The thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG209 F3) under air atmosphere, the heating rate was 10 °C min−1, and the temperature range was 20–650 °C. The content of MoS2 in N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) is about 61.1% by calculation. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Fisher Scientific k-alpha model spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (hυ = 1486.6 eV). The equipment used to test the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms was a Micrometritics TriStar II 3020M from Micron Instruments, Inc.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical test was carried out with the help of CR2032 coin cells. The active material (GO/MoS2(ISE) or N-rGO/MoS2(ISE)), acetylene black and PVDF were mixed uniformly in a certain ratio (8:1:1, wt%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and blended for 24 h on a magnetic mixer to obtain a slurry. Then, it was evenly coated on copper foil and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Then the copper foil was cut with a microtome to obtain a 12 mm round electrode sheet. Then, we assembled a CR2032 coin cell in a glove box with a metallic sodium sheet as the counter electrode and a glass fiber (Whatman) membrane as the separator. The electrolyte consisted of a mixture of 1 M NaClO4 in EC/DMC (1:1, V%) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC).\nCharge and discharge experiments were performed at room temperature using the NEWARE battery test system (Wuhan, Wuhan NEWARE Technology Co., LTD) in the voltage range of 3–0.01 V, and different current densities and other electrochemical properties were set. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a rate of 0.2 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua) with an alternating voltage amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthesis of materials\nSynthesis of GO/MoS2: graphene oxide was synthesized by the modified Hummers’ method. 30 mg of synthesized graphene oxide was added to 60 mL of deionized water, and the graphene oxide was completely dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication for 2 h in an ice bath. Subsequently, 1.7655 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 1.5225 g of thiourea were added in sequence, and the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h. After completion, the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL reaction kettle and kept at 220 °C for 24 h. A black precipitate was obtained, which was washed three times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation to obtain GO/MoS2 samples.\nSynthesis of GO/MoS2(ISE) and N-rGO/MoS2(ISE): 30 mg of graphene oxide was taken and added to 22.5 mL of deionized water. Then it was sonicated in an ultrasonic machine for 1 h to make it fully dispersed in deionized water. Next, 300 mg of L-cysteine and 150 mg of Na2MoO4·2H2O were added to the above graphene oxide dispersion, respectively. After stirring uniformly for 0.5 h, 22.5 mL of absolute ethanol was then added, and the resulting solution was poured into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and keep at 220 °C for 24 h. The resulting black precipitate was collected by suction filtration, washed three times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, respectively, and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12 h. GO/MoS2(ISE) was obtained. It was then put into a glass tube, nitrogen was passed for a period of time until the glass tube was filled with nitrogen, and it was treated with a plasma device for 40 min. The conditions of the treatment are nitrogen flow 100 mL min−1, the pressure in the glass tube is set to 40 Pa, and the power is set to 120 W. The obtained sample is labeled as N-rGO/MoS2(ISE).\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe crystal structures and phases of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) scanning at ambient temperature using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 5 to 80°. The morphology of the samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Inspect F50), and the elemental composition of the samples was analyzed by X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The internal microstructure and structure of the samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) at 200 kV, and the change of interlayer spacing was analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out under 532 nm laser light on a confocal Raman microscopy spectrometer (LabRAM HR UV-Visible). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the content of MoS2 and graphene in the N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) composites. The thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG209 F3) under air atmosphere, the heating rate was 10 °C min−1, and the temperature range was 20–650 °C. The content of MoS2 in N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) is about 61.1% by calculation. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Fisher Scientific k-alpha model spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (hυ = 1486.6 eV). The equipment used to test the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms was a Micrometritics TriStar II 3020M from Micron Instruments, Inc.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical test was carried out with the help of CR2032 coin cells.

Results and discussion\nThe detailed synthetic process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. First, Fe-tris-based brucite-type metal hydroxide nanosheets (Fe-tris NSs) were synthesized by a facile mixing method using iron chloride solution and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane solution. Then the dark-green colored solution turned to a brown colored solution subsequently becoming positively charged Fe-tris NSs. After washing and drying, the as-prepared Fe-tris NSs were self-assembled with negatively charged polystyrene beads (PSBs) and graphene oxide (GO) to form sandwich-like Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO. Finally, Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO was phosphorized at 430 °C via chemical vapor reaction and annealed at 600 °C to produce an expanded sandwich-like porous nanocomposite with thin iron-phosphide nanosheets in between rGO (denoted as expanded FeP NSs@rGO). During the annealing process, the PSBs located in between FeP NSs and rGO layers were thermally decomposed and simultaneously reacted with the surface of FeP NSs. From the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement results shown in Fig. S2,† the PSBs are decomposed at 350 °C, and all the samples are fully decomposed, with no residual material left after 600 °C. In this process, the phosphorus–oxygen bonds in the inevitably produced oxidized iron-phosphide (Fe-POx) were broken and further resulted in the formation of iron-phosphide (FeP). Furthermore, the expanded porous structure provided not only plenty of channels to promote electrolyte penetration leading to excellent Na ion diffusion property but also effective accommodation of volume expansion leading to excellent cycling and structural stability. Also, the rGO layers are beneficial for preventing the restacking of FeP NSs and enhancing electric conductivity. For comparison, we synthesized densely packed FeP NSs@rGO without PSB treatment.\nThe morphology and microstructure of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO were examined based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2a shows that negatively charged PSBs are well attached to the positively charged Fe-tris NSs through electrostatic interactions and this can be seen from Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO possessing a layer-by-layer assembled structure. As shown in Fig. 2b and S1,† after the phosphorization and annealing process, each FeP NSs@rGO is well separated and stacked with adequate void space without aggregation. It is expected that this sandwich-like porous structured nanocomposite provides void space to accommodate the volume changes of FeP NSs during the charge/discharge process while maintaining mechanical stability. On the contrary, Fe-tris NSs@GO and FeP NSs@rGO (Fig. 2c and d) can be seen to possess a densely packed bulk structure. This structure can be vulnerable to maintaining shape. As shown in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image and related height profiles (Fig. S3a and b†), the average topographic height of Fe-Tris NSs is about ∼4 nm, which possesses a noticeable thickness. To achieve a favourable electrostatic assembly between the surfaced charged samples, the surface charges of Fe-tris NSs, GO, and PSBs were investigated by zeta potential measurements (Fig. 2e). In the case of Fe-tris NSs, an unusually high positively charged surface was detected with a net charge of 30.14 mV. The result resembles the amine group of Fe-tris NSs, which is functionalized by tris-NH2 during the synthesis step. In contrast, the zeta potentials of GO and PSBs indicated a negatively charged surface with the net charge of −27.8 mV and −37.6 mV, respectively. After mixing Fe-tris NSs and PSBs, a positively charged surface was detected with a net charge of 19.3 mV. Therefore, assembly between the Fe-tris NSs, GO and PSBs was easily triggered under neutral conditions via electrostatic interactions.\nThe expanded sandwich-like porous structured nanocomposite of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO samples was subjected to the nitrogen isothermal adsorption/desorption measurement (Fig. 2f) and expanded FeP NSs@rGO resembled a type IV with a H3 type hysteresis loop. Remarkably, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of expanded FeP NSs@rGO was calculated to be 209.1 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of FeP NSs@rGO (149.3 m2 g−1). Based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model (Fig. S4†), the well-defined morphology of expanded FeP NSs@rGO indicates the presence of abundant mesopores with a narrow pore size distribution. In contrast, FeP NSs@rGO has a non-uniform pore size distribution. The large surface area and abundant mesopores ensure a shortened ion diffusion pathway, increased reactive sites, and better electrolyte accessibility resulting in effective charge/discharge kinetics.\nA detailed examination of expanded FeP NSs@rGO was initiated using TEM analysis (Fig. 3a). In the following images, FeP NSs and rGO NSs are not clearly distinguished, because FeP NSs and rGO NSs are densely stacked by electrostatic attraction. To investigate the detailed morphologies and chemical compositions of expanded FeP NSs@rGO, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping measurements were conducted. HR-TEM was initiated to determine the crystal structure of expanded FeP NSs@rGO (Fig. S5†). The lattice distance of 0.272 nm for FeP NSs corresponding to the (011) plane can be observed and rGO is composed of 5–6 layers with a (002) plane layer spacing of 0.34 nm. EDS mapping of expanded FeP NSs@rGO (Fig. 3c–f) shows the elements of P (Fig. 3d), C (Fig. 3e), and Fe (Fig. 3f). The result demonstrates the facile development of iron-phosphide with well-attached rGO NSs which can benefit the overall electrochemical performance. The corresponding EDS mapping (Fig. S6a–d†) also shows the representation of the given elements (C, P, and Fe) and FeP NSs are well attached with rGO NSs. The total weight of carbon in expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO was measured by elemental analysis (EA) (Table S1†). The amount of carbon in expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO was estimated to be 5.37 wt%, and 5.03 wt%, respectively.\nAn additional analysis of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO was conducted using Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4a). The recognizable sharp peaks at 440 and 595 cm−1 were determined as the minor vibration of FeP, which further explained the previous HRTEM examination (Fig. S5†). The obvious peaks at 1345, 1582 and 2698 cm−1 are the D, G and 2D bands of graphitic carbon, respectively, indicating reduced graphene oxide. The ratio between the intensity of the D and G band (ID/IG) is determined as 0.845, with 0.831 representing the level of the defective nature of carbon within expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO, respectively. The crystallographic structures of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO nanocomposites are displayed in Fig. 4b. The XRD patterns exhibited distinct diffraction peaks of the orthorhombic FeP phase, matching the JCPDS card no. 65-2595 without any impurities.\nTo clearly demonstrate whether PSBs played an important role in synthesizing iron phosphide, the chemical composition and valence states of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Fig. S7a and b† show the wide-scan XPS survey spectra, which exhibit the XPS peaks from Fe, P, O, and C elements. The Fe 2p high-resolution spectrum is shown in Fig. 5a and d. The two deconvoluted peaks at 710.2 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 723.6 eV (Fe 2p1/2) indicate the presence of Fe2+, while two other peaks at 715.4 (Fe 2p3/2) and 726.1 eV (Fe 2p1/2) are ascribed to the Fe3+ state, which might be created owing to the unavoidable oxidation during the synthesis process and created by the surface oxidation of FeP in the presence of air and water. Also, the peaks at 706.6 and 720.0 eV are attributed to Fe–P bonding, which confirms the successful formation of FeP during the phosphorization process. From the results, the expanded FeP NSs@rGO sample has 36.9% of the iron-phosphide, but the FeP NSs@rGO sample has only 22.3%. In the P 2p spectrum shown in Fig. 5b and e, the doublets at 129.7 eV can be assigned to the iron phosphide and the broad feature at 133.8 eV corresponds to P–O bonds which are also attributed to the unavoidable oxidation during the synthesis process and the exposure to air and water. From the results, the expanded FeP NSs@rGO sample has 52.3% of iron-phosphide, but the FeP NSs@rGO sample has only 21.6%. As shown in Fig. 5c and f, the O 1s spectrum revealed peaks at 530.7, and 533.1 eV which respectively correspond to metal bonding (M–O), and carbonates (C–O), respectively. The metal bonding (M–O) can be assigned to P–O and Fe–O bonds, which are possibly from oxidized iron-phosphide (Fe-POx). The difference in the iron-phosphide content between the two samples can be directly related to the electrochemical performance. As shown in Fig. S7c and d,† the C 1s peak can be divided into three different components. The most intense peak at 284.5 eV corresponds to C–C/CC, and the others at 283.9 eV, and 285.6 eV correspond to C–P bonds attributed to the phosphide distributed in the nanocomposites, and O–CO bonds, respectively. The result from C 1s reveals the existence of graphitic carbon of rGO. The XPS result suggests that the PSBs, which are located in between Fe-tris NSs and rGO, can assist in the complete conversion of Fe-tris NSs to FeP. The reasons can be hypothesized as follows: (1) the PSBs widen the interplanar distance between the FeP NSs and offer plenty of void space allowing the H3P gas to easily attach to the surface of FeP NSs which are deep in the nanostructure. (2) Although surface oxidation is inevitable, it can be mitigated by the carbothermic reduction of PSBs during the annealing process. After the FeP NSs@rGO@PSBs is annealed at 600 °C, more iron-phosphide (FeP) is exposed and the oxidized iron-phosphide (Fe-POx) is partially removed by the carbothermic reduction as evidenced by XPS measurements (Fig. 5).\nThe electrochemical performances of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO electrodes are investigated. Fig. 6a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the as-prepared expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode from the first to the fifth cycles at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the potential window of 0.001–3 V (vs. Na/Na+). From the initial sweeping scan process, the cathodic peak appears around 0.48 V, which is ascribed to the conversion reaction of FeP to Fe and Na3P (FeP + 3Na+ + 3e− → Fe + Na3P) and the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers. After that, the cathodic peak localized at 0.94 V corresponds to the sodiation reaction. During the following anodic scan, there are broad anodic peaks at 1.9 to 2.1 V, which correspond to the desodiation reaction of Na3P (Fe + Na3P → FeP + 3Na+ + 3e−). The well-matched CV indicates good reversibility of the electrochemical reactions of expanded FeP NSs@rGO during repeated sodium ion insertion–extraction. For comparison, the CV result of the FeP NSs@rGO electrode is almost the same as that of the expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode but the cathodic–anodic peaks are slightly shifted (Fig. S8†). These results indicated that the sodiation–desodiation kinetics of the expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode is faster than that of the FeP NSs@rGO electrode, because of the large surface area.\nIn relation to the XPS data, the relationship between the ratio of FeP/FePOx and the specific capacity was investigated. The galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO electrodes are shown in Fig. 6b and S9,† respectively. The first discharge–charge capacities of the expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode are 1306.7 and 912.2 mA h g−1, respectively, with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 69.8%. The plateau located around 0.5 V in the initial discharge process is related to the sodiation process of FeP, and the SEI layer formation on the surface of the electrode material, which is well consistent with the CV curves. For comparison, the initial discharge–charge capacities of FeP NSs@rGO are 916.8 and 658.1 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. S9†), with an ICE of 71.8%. This demonstrates a noticeable capacity loss of ∼27.9% and it could be because of the low ratio of FeP/FePOx. The relatively low ICE of expanded FeP NSs@rGO could be derived from the high irreversible capacity by creating a SEI layer on the large surface area. Furthermore, the galvanostatic profiles show a similar shape from 2 to 100 cycles, exhibiting the good cycling stability of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO electrodes, however the difference in specific capacity appears large. From these results, it was confirmed that FePOx could have an important effect on the specific capacity of active materials.\nThe rate performance of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO electrodes at various current densities (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g−1) is shown in Fig. 6c. For the expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode, reversible specific capacities of 916.1, 810.0, 713.9, 615.8, 547.4, and 440.9 mA h g−1 can be reached at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, it can recover back to 858.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, even after cycling at a high current density. In contrast, the rate capability of the FeP NSs@rGO electrode delivers lower reversible specific capacities of 656.3, 524.4, 418.7, 234.6, 125.3, and 49.0 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g−1, respectively.\nThe cycling performance of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO electrodes was estimated at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 6d). The expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode exhibits good cycle retention maintaining the high reversible capacity of 644.4 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with a cycle retention of 85.4%. After the initial capacity loss, the columbic efficiency of expanded FeP NSs@rGO increases to almost 100%, indicating excellent reversibility for sodium storage. On the other hand, the FeP NSs@rGO electrode exhibits a lower capacity of 251.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with a cycle retention of 20.1%. The improved rate capability and cycling stability of expanded FeP NSs@rGO are due to the synergetic effects of rGO, FeP NSs, PSBs. Introducing rGO can not only improve the electrical conductivity but also prevent the electrode from aggregation during cycling. Also, ultrathin FeP nanosheets with an average thickness of ∼4 nm can shorten the sodium-ion diffusion length and alleviate the mechanical stress from the volume expansion and maximize the utilization of active materials. Furthermore, the void space derived from PSBs increases the surface area, resulting in a shortened sodium ion diffusion pathway, increased reactive sites, and better electrolyte accessibility. In particular, a promising capacity of 916.1 mA h g−1 is achieved at 0.1 A g−1. As can be seen from the XPS data, this can be due to the increased content of iron-phosphide which is reduced from oxidized iron-phosphide (Fe-POx).\nAs shown in Fig. S10a,† the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was conducted to understand the electron transport kinetics and the resistances involved. The measurements were conducted 10 times and EIS plots were fitted using the equivalent circuits (Fig. S10b†). According to the EIS fitting results (Table S2†), the Rct value of expanded FeP NSs@rGO (72.12 ± 1.34 Ω cm−2) was smaller than that of FeP NSs@rGO (78.28 ± 5.24 Ω cm−2). We compared the rate performance of various metal-phosphide based anode materials (Fig. 6e). Such a superior specific capacity of expanded FeP NSs@rGO is one of the highest values reported previously for metal-phosphide anode materials for SIBs.\nIn order to directly evaluate the advantages of the expanded stacking structure for enhancing the structural stability of the electrode, the structures of the expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs@rGO electrodes after cycling were also examined by SEM as shown in Fig. S11.† After the cycling, the pure FeP NSs in the expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode are converted into nanospheres which grow along with the rGO layer because of plenty of void space. However, for the densely packed structure of the FeP NSs@rGO electrode, rGO sheets cannot sufficiently prevent the volume expansion of FeP NSs and FeP NSs are converted into microspheres comprising numerous nanoparticles through pulverization/aggregation. The conclusion is that the morphology of the cycled active materials can influence the reversible efficiency such as rate capability and cycling stability. As the active material size increases, sodium ion and electrolyte diffusion and penetration significantly decrease, thus slowing down the reaction kinetics.\nTo further estimate the sodium kinetics of the expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode, CV tests at various scanning speeds from 0.5 to 2 mV s−1 were conducted (Fig. 7a). As the scanning rate increased, the anodic/cathodic peaks gradually deviate from the original peak position due to ohmic resistance. According to the previous studies, the relationship between the peak current (i) and the square root of the scan rate (v) can be calculated from the following eqn (1) and (2).\nIn the above equations, a and b are the adjustable value. The b-value can be calculated from the fitting line (Fig. 7b). In general, the b-value of 0.5 represents the electrochemical reaction mainly relies on diffusion-controlled behavior, and the b-value of 1 represents surface-capacitive behavior. For expanded FeP NSs@rGO, the b-values of anodic and cathodic peaks are 0.753 and 0.762, respectively. These results indicate that the charge storage in expanded FeP NSs@rGO is related to surface-capacitive behavior. For more details, the surface-capacitive contribution versus the scan rate can be calculated from eqn (3) and (4).\nk 1 v 1/2 and k2v represent the diffusion contribution and surface-capacitive contribution, respectively. Fig. 7c shows the surface-capacitive contribution for the expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode at 1.5 mV s−1. The surface-capacitive contributions are 54.1%, 58.3%, 63.4%, 69.1% and 75.6% at different scan rates of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mV s−1, respectively (Fig. 7d). These results further prove that the electrochemical kinetics of expanded FeP NSs@rGO is mainly controlled by the surface-capacitive behavior. The fast sodium kinetics is derived from the introduction of PSBs and rGO with a large surface area and high electric conductivity in expanded FeP NSs@rGO.\nIn addition, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test was conducted to characterize the sodium-ion diffusion coefficient (DNa+). The sodium-ion diffusion coefficient was calculated using eqn (5).\nIn the equation, τ, mB, VM, MB, and S are the pulse time, mass, molar volume, and molar mass of the active material, and the active surface area of the electrode, respectively. Also, ΔES is the voltage change between the single-step and ΔEτ is the voltage change during the constant current pulse. Fig. S12a and b† show the GITT profiles and DNa+ at the different potentials of expanded FeP NSs@rGO. From the results, DNa+ of expanded FeP NSs@rGO is ∼10−12 cm2 s−1.\nAs shown in Fig. S13,† the ex situ XRD measurement was conducted to investigate the electrochemical reaction process and phase transformation during the first discharge/charge cycle. During the first discharge process, the peaks of Na3P and Fe gradually appear when the electrode is discharged to 0.1 V. The peaks located at 22.5° and 37.2° correspond to the (101) and (103) plans of Na3P (JCPDS 74-1164), while the peak at 49.2° corresponds to the (101) plane of Fe (JCPDS 34-0529). The peaks located at 32.8°, 37.2°, and 46.3° correspond to (011), (111), and (112) planes of FeP (JCPDS 65-2595). The FeP peaks disappear during the discharge and reappear during the charge process which corresponds to the conversion reaction of the FeP material.\nTo demonstrate the practical application, a full cell was assembled by using the pre-sodiated expanded FeP NSs@rGO electrode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the anode and cathode, respectively. As shown in Fig. S14,† the galvanostatic profiles of the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in a half cell shows a specific capacity of 89.7 mA h g−1 in the potential window of 2.0 to 4.2 V and at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The full cell was cycled in the potential window of 1.0 to 3.5 V. The rate performance shown in Fig. 7e exhibits an initial charge and discharge capacity of 95.3 mA h g−1 and 92.0 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 (based on the mass of the cathode material), respectively. The electrode capacity ratio between the anode and cathode is 1.12. The current density increases gradually to 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1, and the specific capacities are 89.3, 82.1, 72.3, and 59.6 mA h g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the cycle performance of the full cell was estimated at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. The full-cell can retain a specific capacity of 67.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 7e).\nInterestingly, we also investigated the air stability of expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs using XPS measurement (Fig. S15†). In situ sputtering was conducted to etch ∼6 nm of the surface layer. For expanded FeP NSs@rGO and FeP NSs, they were exposed to ambient atmosphere (temperature 23–25 °C, humidity 75–85%) for 90 days. After exposure to ambient atmosphere, 40.2% of FeP in the FeP NS sample was oxidized to Fe-POx (Fig. S15b and c†). In contrast, 16.1% of FeP in the fresh expanded FeP NSs@rGO sample was oxidized as shown in Fig. S15a.† According to these results, iron-phosphide in the expanded FeP NSs@rGO nanocomposite is more resistant to oxidation than FeP NSs owing to the successful inhibition of the penetration of water or oxygen into deeper layers of the nanocomposite. Also, it can be seen that the air stability of iron phosphide can be an important factor for compounds such as black phosphorus and red phosphorus.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Preparation of polystyrene beads (PSBs)\nThe PSBs with a particle size of 60 nm (diameter) were synthesized by controlled emulsion polymerization. Initially, 50 mg of potassium persulfate (PPS) as an initiator and 5 mg of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) as a surfactant were dissolved and mixed with 30 mL of deionized water in a 50 mL round bottomed flask and degassed with nitrogen for 30 min. After the temperature of the reactor was elevated to 70 °C in an oil bath, 3 mL of styrene (Aldrich), which had been purified through a column filled with activated alumina, was injected quickly by using a syringe and reacted at 70 °C for 4 h with vigorous stirring. The crude colloidal dispersion was filtered through a glass filter and charged into a semi-permeable cellulose membrane tube (MWCO 12000–14000, MFPI) which was fully soaked in a 5 L bath containing DI water to remove the unreacted low molecular weight impurities in the tube. DI water was replenished until the resistivity reaches about 12 MΩ. Finally, the 2 wt% of PS colloid was kept in a vial containing a small amount of ion exchange resin (AG501-X8, Bio-Rad) added for the preservation of colloidal dispersions.\n\n2.2 Preparation of Fe-tris-based brucite-type metal hydroxide nanosheets (Fe-tris NSs)\nInitially, 0.396 g of FeCl2·4H2O were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Also, 2.422 g of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Then, the two solutions were mixed and stirred for 15 hours. The reacted brownish solution was collected and washed with water three times by centrifugation. The material was then freeze-dried for 4 days.\n\n2.3 Preparation of the Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite\nGraphene oxide was synthesized by a modified Hummers’ method. The Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite was prepared by a facile charge-driven self-assembly method. In detail, 0.1 g of Fe-tris NSs was dispersed in 20 mL of DI water and sonicated for at least 1 h. Then, 1 g of PSB solution and 10 mL of GO solution (0.0005 g mL−1) were added dropwise under magnetic stirring overnight. After that, the Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite was collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The Fe-tris NSs@GO nanocomposite was prepared under the same conditions without PSBs.\n\n2.4 Preparation of the expanded Fe phosphide nanosheets@rGO nanocomposite (expanded FeP NSs@rGO)\nThe expanded FeP NSs@rGO nanocomposite was prepared by phosphorizing the Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite. In detail, 2 g of NaH2PO2 and 0.1 g of the as-prepared Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite were put in the separate alumina boat and placed upstream and downstream of the quartz tube, respectively. After sealing, the tube was purged using Ar and underwent heat treatment at 430 °C for 3 hours with a rate of 2 °C min−1. After that, heat treatment was conducted once more at 600 °C for 3 hours with a rate of 5 °C min−1 for removing PSBs. The FeP NSs@rGO nanocomposite was prepared by phosphorizing Fe-tris NSs@GO under the same conditions.\n\n2.5 Preparation of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)\nFirst, 16 mmol oxalic acid, 4 mmol vanadium oxide, and 12 mmol sodium dihydrogen phosphate were dissolved in distilled water at 80 °C for 30 min with continuous stirring. Subsequently, the mixed solution was dried at 60 °C for 12 h and the gel was formed. Finally, the prepared gel was heated at 350 °C for 5 h and 800 °C for 10 h under an argon atmosphere in a tube furnace.\n\n2.6 Characterization\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4800, 15 kV) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm result was obtained using a BELSORP-mini II (MicrotracBEL Corp). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using NX-10. Zeta potential measurements were conducted using a ZEN1020 (Malvern Instruments). The specific surface area was calculated through the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The microstructures of the samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; JEOL JEM-2100F, 200 keV). Raman analysis was performed with a Raman spectrometer (DXR2xi). The crystallographic structures were obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker New D8 Advance, scan range in 2θ of 10–80°). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an Axis-HIS with Al irradiation at 12 kV and 18 mA at a constant pass energy of 20 eV.\n\n2.7 Electrochemical measurement\nThe electrode was prepared by mixing the as-prepared active materials, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; Sigma Aldrich), and carbon black (Super P; Timcal) in a mass ratio of 80:10:10. Then, the mixed slurry was cast on a copper foil current collector and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 5 h. The areal loading mass of the active material was about 1.20 mg cm−2–1.25 mg cm−2. Then, the cell was assembled using a coin type cell (CR-2016) in an argon-filled glove box (O2 and H2O < 0.1 ppm) with sodium metal foil as the counter electrode and a glass fiber filter as the separator. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Electrochemical tests were conducted using a WBCS3000s cycler (WonA-Tech, Korea) within a potential window of 0.001–3.0 V vs. Na+/Na. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was conducted using a ZIVE SP1 (ZIVE LAB).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Also, 2.422 g of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Then, the two solutions were mixed and stirred for 15 hours. The reacted brownish solution was collected and washed with water three times by centrifugation. The material was then freeze-dried for 4 days.\n\n2.3 Preparation of the Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite\nGraphene oxide was synthesized by a modified Hummers’ method. The Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite was prepared by a facile charge-driven self-assembly method. In detail, 0.1 g of Fe-tris NSs was dispersed in 20 mL of DI water and sonicated for at least 1 h. Then, 1 g of PSB solution and 10 mL of GO solution (0.0005 g mL−1) were added dropwise under magnetic stirring overnight. After that, the Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite was collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The Fe-tris NSs@GO nanocomposite was prepared under the same conditions without PSBs.\n\n2.4 Preparation of the expanded Fe phosphide nanosheets@rGO nanocomposite (expanded FeP NSs@rGO)\nThe expanded FeP NSs@rGO nanocomposite was prepared by phosphorizing the Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite. In detail, 2 g of NaH2PO2 and 0.1 g of the as-prepared Fe-tris NSs@PSBs@GO nanocomposite were put in the separate alumina boat and placed upstream and downstream of the quartz tube, respectively. After sealing, the tube was purged using Ar and underwent heat treatment at 430 °C for 3 hours with a rate of 2 °C min−1. After that, heat treatment was conducted once more at 600 °C for 3 hours with a rate of 5 °C min−1 for removing PSBs. The FeP NSs@rGO nanocomposite was prepared by phosphorizing Fe-tris NSs@GO under the same conditions.\n\n2.5 Preparation of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)\nFirst, 16 mmol oxalic acid, 4 mmol vanadium oxide, and 12 mmol sodium dihydrogen phosphate were dissolved in distilled water at 80 °C for 30 min with continuous stirring. Subsequently, the mixed solution was dried at 60 °C for 12 h and the gel was formed. Finally, the prepared gel was heated at 350 °C for 5 h and 800 °C for 10 h under an argon atmosphere in a tube furnace.\n\n2.6 Characterization\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4800, 15 kV) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm result was obtained using a BELSORP-mini II (MicrotracBEL Corp). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using NX-10. Zeta potential measurements were conducted using a ZEN1020 (Malvern Instruments). The specific surface area was calculated through the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The microstructures of the samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; JEOL JEM-2100F, 200 keV). Raman analysis was performed with a Raman spectrometer (DXR2xi). The crystallographic structures were obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker New D8 Advance, scan range in 2θ of 10–80°). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an Axis-HIS with Al irradiation at 12 kV and 18 mA at a constant pass energy of 20 eV.\n\n2.7 Electrochemical measurement\nThe electrode was prepared by mixing the as-prepared active materials, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; Sigma Aldrich), and carbon black (Super P; Timcal) in a mass ratio of 80:10:10. Then, the mixed slurry was cast on a copper foil current collector and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 5 h. The areal loading mass of the active material was about 1.20 mg cm−2–1.25 mg cm−2. Then, the cell was assembled using a coin type cell (CR-2016) in an argon-filled glove box (O2 and H2O < 0.1 ppm) with sodium metal foil as the counter electrode and a glass fiber filter as the separator. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Electrochemical tests were conducted using a WBCS3000s cycler (WonA-Tech, Korea) within a potential window of 0.001–3.0 V vs. Na+/Na. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was conducted using a ZIVE SP1 (ZIVE LAB).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Preparation of polystyrene beads (PSBs)\nThe PSBs with a particle size of 60 nm (diameter) were synthesized by controlled emulsion polymerization. Initially, 50 mg of potassium persulfate (PPS) as an initiator and 5 mg of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) as a surfactant were dissolved and mixed with 30 mL of deionized water in a 50 mL round bottomed flask and degassed with nitrogen for 30 min. After the temperature of the reactor was elevated to 70 °C in an oil bath, 3 mL of styrene (Aldrich), which had been purified through a column filled with activated alumina, was injected quickly by using a syringe and reacted at 70 °C for 4 h with vigorous stirring. The crude colloidal dispersion was filtered through a glass filter and charged into a semi-permeable cellulose membrane tube (MWCO 12000–14000, MFPI) which was fully soaked in a 5 L bath containing DI water to remove the unreacted low molecular weight impurities in the tube. DI water was replenished until the resistivity reaches about 12 MΩ.

Results and discussion\nThe synthetic route for MoS2/NSGs-G composite is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, the nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene was produced by the electrochemical exfoliation method. After cleaning and impurity removal, cetrimonium bromide, Na2MoO4·2H2O, and L-cysteine were added to nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene mixture solution. Importantly, cetrimonium bromide could improve the charge state on the graphene surface, which promotes the adsorption of graphene to MoO42−, thus contributing to MoO42− to generate MoS2 in situ on graphene, eventually obtaining self-supporting network structured MoS2/heteroatom-doped graphene composite (MoS2/NSGs-G).\nThe XRD patterns of the as-prepared MoS2/NSGs-G, MoS2/Gs-G, bulk MoS2, and bulk N, S-co-doped graphene are displayed in Fig. 1A. It shows that all diffraction peaks of MoS2/NSGs-G and MoS2/Gs-G at about 2θ = 18.1°, 32.6°, 39.6°, 58.2°, and 68.8° are well-matched with the (002), (100), (103), (105), and (110) planes of the hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS 37-1492). As for bulk MoS2, all the diffraction peaks were also indexed to the crystal structure of MoS2 (JCPDS no. 37-1492), and the obvious (002) peak at about 2θ = 14.1° indicated that there was a good layered stacking structure. Compared to bulk MoS2, although the (002) plane of MoS2/NSGs-G and MoS2/Gs-G was located at about 2θ = 18.1°, it showed a small right shift to a high scattering angle, demonstrating that MoS2/NSGs-G and MoS2/Gs-G still maintained a well-stacked layered structure. The MoS2/NSGs-G and MoS2/Gs-G showed a small right shift for the (002) reflection, which is triggered by the intercalation of carbon sheets (amorphous carbon), and graphene between the MoS2 sheets. The bulk N, S-co-doped graphene displays a (002) plane at around 24.2°, which is related to a typical graphite diffraction peak. This peak is slightly left shifted to a low scattering angle, suggesting the presence of a certain oxidation reaction during the electrochemical exfoliation process. A broad peak appearing at around 15.6° corresponded to the characteristic peak of graphene oxide, further confirming that certain oxidation of graphene occurs during electrochemical exfoliation. Apart from this, the typical diffraction peak of graphene at 26.6° in MoS2/NSGs-G and MoS2/Gs-G was not detected, indicating that graphene is separated and has not been re-stacked.\nThe morphology of the MoS2/NSGs-G sample was characterized by FESEM and TEM techniques. Fig. 1B shows a representative image of the MoS2/NSGs-G sample, which is composed of intertwined nanosheets with wavy folds on the surface. When the sample is viewed closely in Fig. 1C, it shows that the thickness of the nanosheets is approximately 100 nm. In addition, compared to bulk MoS2 and bulk N, S-co-doped graphene (shown in Fig. S2B and C†), no large graphene nanosheets and obvious accumulation of MoS2 were observed in the MoS2/NSGs-G and MoS2/Gs-G (seeing in Fig. S2A†) samples, suggesting that N, S co-doped graphene acted as a good buffer matrix for MoS2. Two-dimensional N, S-co-doped graphene, and self-supporting MoS2 formed a three-dimensional interweaved network structure, which could prevent the re-stacking of N, S-co-doped graphene, and MoS2 as well as stabilize the structure during cycles. To further investigate the refined microstructure of MoS2/NSGs-G, TEM, and HRTEM characterizations were performed. In Fig. 1D and E, it can be seen that there are interweaved ultrathin nanosheets in MoS2/NSGs-G, and nanosheets are very tightly connected to each other, which is in agreement with the results of SEM. The HRTEM image in Fig. 1F distinctly displays that the MoS2/NSGs-G sample is consisting of a few layered MoS2 and graphene and they are interconnected together. The interlayer distances of MoS2 and graphene are about 0.87 nm and 0.36 nm, respectively. In addition, the detailed element distribution is examined by EDS (demonstrated in Fig. S3†), confirming a uniform distribution of C, O, N, S, and Mo in MoS2/NSGs-G. It is generally believed that the expanded layer spacing helps accelerate the conduction of electrolytes and ions, increasing the surface area of the material as well as offering abundant reaction sites. Therefore, MoS2/NSGs-G with a self-supporting network structure and expanded layer spacing as the anode has the potential to enhance the sodium ions storage.\nThe chemical bonding state of the MoS2/NSGs-G sample was investigated with the XPS technique. Fig. 2A gives strong evidence that there are S, Mo, C, N, and C elements in MoS2/NSGs-G and their atomic percentage are 22.03%, 8.98%, 54.08%, 3.72%, and 11.18%, respectively. The ratio of S to Mo calculated is about 7.34 to 1, which is higher than the theoretical value of 2 to 1, indicating that sulfur elements have been successfully doped into graphene, which is consistent with the results in Fig. S1.† It can be clearly observed in the XPS results that part of the Mo element is oxidized. Some of the S element is oxidized and some of it is bonded to C. Therefore, according to the results of XPS, we have calculated that the percentage content of MoS2 in the composite is about 15%. As shown in Fig. 2B, four peaks appeared at about 533.4 eV, 532.4 eV, 531.6 eV, and 530.6 eV in O 1s, which are identified as combining energy peaks of O–CO, O–C, OC, and O–H, respectively. In the case of C 1s, four peaks at the binding energies of about 289.1 eV, 286.1 eV, 285.0 eV, and 284.4 eV in Fig. 2C, corresponding to the bonding of O–CO, C–S/C–O, C–N, and sp2 C, respectively. The presence of C–N and C–S further confirmed that nitrogen and sulfur have been doped into the graphene layer. The spectrum of N 1s in Fig. 2D can be divided into four main peaks of about 401.8 eV, 399.7 eV, 398.2 eV, and 395.6 eV, which are related to graphitic N, pyrrole N, pyridine N, and Mo 3p, respectively. The result of the N 1s peak provides strong evidence that nitrogen has been successfully doped into graphene and it could improve the electronic conductivity of the composite effectively. Furthermore, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N could offer extra active sites and defects, which contributes to enhancing Na+ storage capacity. As for the S 2P spectrum in Fig. 2E, it shows that the peaks at 163.7 eV and 162.5 eV correspond to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively, and the sulfur oxide peak is observed at 169.1 eV, indicating that sulfur partially exists in the form of S2+ in MoS2/NSGs-G. The spectrum of Mo 3d in Fig. 2F shows that the peaks at 232.9 eV, 229.7 eV, and 227.0 eV correspond to Mo 3d3/2, Mo 3d5/2, and S 2s, respectively, which are related to S2− and Mo4+ ions in MoS2. In addition, the peak at about 236.3 eV belongs to Mo6+, which is due to the partial oxidation of the surface of MoS2/NSGs-G in air. Besides, the total atomic percentages of N and S were detected as 1.38% and 14.95% in MoS2/NSGs-G, respectively. It is believed that N or S doping could regulate the charge state of the material and increase the active sites, which are conducive to enhancing the Na+ diffusion rate and charge transport in the materials.\nTo investigate the electrochemical behavior of MoS2/NSGs-G electrode, the typical charge–discharge tests at 0.5 A g−1 were performed by the LAND test system (it needs to be pointed out that the cells are activated using 0.025 A g−1, 0.05 A g−1, and 0.1 A g−1 in the first, second, and third charge–discharge process, respectively. The discharge process represents the sodiation process). For the first sodiation process, there are three inclined voltage platforms in the range of 1.28–1.19 V, 0.92–0.37 V, and 0.29–0.03 V, as shown in Fig. 3A, which are attributed to the formation of the SEI layer, the reaction of sodium ions into the MoS2 layers and the sodium ions embedded graphene layers, respectively. The voltage platform appears near 1.65–2.21 V in the initial anodic process, which is mainly the process of sodium ion extraction from NaxMoS2. In the subsequent charge–discharge processes, the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode presents two stable voltage platforms at around 1.60–0.85 V and 1.78–2.23 V, which belong to the sodiation reactions of Na insertion into S and the reactions of Na2S conversion into S, respectively. In addition, the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode displays discharge and charge capacities of 1040.4 and 595.7 mA h g−1 during the initial cycle, respectively, and the initial coulombic efficiency was 52.4%. The lost capacity may be due to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) or the decomposition of electrolyte. As the cycles continue, the coulombic efficiency of MoS2/GNs-AG in the second and third cycles rapidly reached 94.0% and 96.7%, which indicates that the electrode has high cycle reversibility. In particular, the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode maintains relatively high sodium storage with a charge capacity of about 502.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Compared with the specific capacity of the first charge, the capacity retention rate after 100 cycles was still maintained at 84.4%, implying that the insertion/extraction process of sodium in the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode is highly reversible.\nFig. 3B presents the continuous galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling performance of the MoS2/NSGs-G, MoS2/Gs-G, bulk N, S-co-doped graphene, and bulk MoS2 electrodes. As can be noticed, the bulk MoS2 electrode shows poor cycle performance and the cycle begins to decay rapidly after about 100 cycles. Even the specific capacity of sodium storage decreased rapidly from 256.7 mA h g−1 to 85.9 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles. This result may be caused by large volume expansion of MoS2, leading to the pulverization and exfoliation of MoS2, ultimately resulting in reducing the specific capacity of the electrode and cycle performance degradation. Distinctly, the other three electrodes display extremely stable electrochemical performances for sodium storage, which indicates that graphene has an important role in the cycle stability of the electrode. The charge-specific capacity of MoS2/Gs-G and bulk N, S-co-doped graphene electrodes after 250 cycles are 365.7 mA h g−1 and 120.0 mA h g−1, respectively, which are higher than the charge capacity of the bulk MoS2 electrode. Among them, the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode delivers the highest sodium storage capacity with a specific capacity of 443.9 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. The capacity of MoS2/NSGs-G fluctuates slightly, which may be due to the existence of unevenly growing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the cycles, leading to a partial irreversible reaction. In addition, because of the volume effect of MoS2, a small part of the active material loosens or falls off during the sodiation/desodiation process, which may also cause fluctuations in the capacity of the composite material. Even though the capacity of the MoS2/NSGs-G fluctuates slightly, the coulombic efficiency of MoS2/NSGs-G except in the first three cycles is about 99%, indicating that MoS2/NSGs-G has excellent reversibility. The MoS2/NSGs-G electrode has a satisfactory reversible sodium storage capacity and extremely stable cycling performance, which are attributed to the nitrogen and sulfur co-doping increasing the sodium storage sites and a three-dimensional interconnected network that can stabilize the structure of the electrode material. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of N, S-co-doped graphene and high theoretical specific capacity MoS2 makes the MoS2/NSGs-G composite material possess an extremely high specific capacity and superior cycling performance.\nFig. 3C displays the impressive rate performances of MoS2/NSGs-G, MoS2/Gs-G, bulk N, S-co-doped graphene, and bulk MoS2 electrodes at different current densities from 0.1 to 10 A g−1, and finally changed back to 0.1 A g−1. It is distinctly seen that all electrodes reveal relatively stable capacity at each current density. However, the rate performance of bulk MoS2 electrodes is worse than that of other electrodes, and its specific capacity is lower than that of other electrodes at each rate. This may be put down to the lack of N, S co-doped graphene as a buffer to support molybdenum disulfide, which is difficult to withstand the “shock” caused by current changes, ultimately leading to the decrease of specific capacity. In Fig. 3C, as the current density returns to its initial value, the corresponding capacity increases may be attributed to the high reversibility and the activation process of bulk MoS2 and graphene. Clearly, the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode demonstrated the best rate performance, with a reversible charge capacity of 491.5, 490.5, 453.9, 418.1, 383.8, 333.1, and 294.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively (provided in the Table S1†). When the current density recovered to 0.1 A g−1 again, the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode still maintained the specific capacity of 507.3 mA h g−1, which fully demonstrates that the MoS2/NSGs-G sample has good structural stability and excellent rate performance. These results indicate that the MoS2/NSGs-G sample has potential research significance and application prospects in high-performance SIBs.\nIn order to understand the electrochemical behavior of sodium-ion storage for MoS2/NSGs-G electrode, the CV test was implemented and the results are presented in Fig. 4A. It reveals that three reduction peaks appearing at about 0.01 V, 0.46 V (disappearing in the subsequent cycles), and 1.07 V are assigned to Na+ insertion into the graphene layers, the formation of SEI layers (decomposition of electrolyte) and the insertion of sodium ions into MoS2 in the initial cathodic scan, respectively. In the first anodic process, there are two oxidation peaks at approximately 1.76 V and 2.23 V, which are related to the reconstitution of S and Mo to form MoS2 and the Na+ de-insertion from Na2S, respectively. In the two subsequent cycles, the CV curve demonstrates that the oxidation peak and the reduction peak are highly coincident without significant changes, suggesting that MoS2/NSGs-G electrode possesses very stable and high reversibility of electrochemical behavior.\nTo further inquire the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode, CV curves at various scanning rates from 0.1 mV to 1.0 mV s−1 were obtained, as shown in Fig. 4B. Although there is a certain polarization of the redox peak of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode with the increase of scanning rate, significant reduction peak, and oxidation peak at around 0.65 V and 1.81 V, relating to the reversible process of sodiation and desodiation, respectively, are still observed, which is highly consistent with the analysis results shown in Fig. 4A. According to previous research results, it is believed that there is a power-law relationship between current and sweep speed, which obeys the following equation:\nwhere a and b stand for adjustable parameters, v is on behalf of the scan speed, i represents the current density. Particularly, when the value of b is close to 0.5 or 1, signifying the diffusion-controlled process or the capacitive behavior is dominant in the electrode. Fig. 4C presents the values of b at peak 1 and peak 2 as 0.87 and 0.90, respectively, indicating a capacitive storage mechanism is more dominant in the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode, making for a fast Na+ sodiation/desodiation and prominent rate performance. These results are highly consistent with the analysis in Fig. 3C, providing strong evidence that the MoS2/NSGs-G material has outstanding rate performance. The EIS results in Fig. 4D exhibit that the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode displays a semicircle in the high-frequency area and a sloping straight line in the low-frequency area before and after 3 cycles, which are related to charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg resistance (Zw). It can be obviously seen that the charge transfer resistance of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode after 3 cycles (9 Ω) is smaller than that of the electrode before cycles (15 Ω). This may be because the composite material forms a stable SEI during the cycles, layered nanostructure heteroatom doped graphene could effectively alleviate the volume effect of MoS2 and stabilize the structure of composite materials, which are conducive to reducing the resistance of the composite material. According to equation i0 = RT/nFRct, the exchange current density is used to assess the electrochemical performance of the electrode. Where T refers to the absolute temperature, n stands for the number of transferred electrons, R (8.314 J mol−1 K−1) represents the gas constant, and F (96485 C mol−1) and Rct are referred to as the Faraday constant and charge transfer resistance, respectively. The values of i0 for the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode before and after 3 cycles are 1.71 × 10−5 A cm−2 and 2.85 × 10−3 A cm−2, respectively. Therefore, the above results show that the MoS2/NSGs-G has good reaction reversibility and low resistance.\nIn order to investigate the capacitive effects (k1v) and the diffusion-controlled insertion process (k2v1/2) of MoS2/NSGs-G, a function of potential is used following:\nwhere v stands for the scan rate. It is usually used to distinguish the ratio of the current related to surface capacitance and sodium ion semi infinite linear diffusion by determining the value of k1 and k2. Fig. 5A exhibits that 81% (orange) of the total capacity represents the capacitive contribution for the MoS2/NSGs-G sample at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, which is well coincident with the value of b. As a comparison, the results of the capacitive contribution of MoS2/NSGs-G electrode at different scan rates of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mV s−1 are provided in Fig. S4,† further indicating that the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode has an outstanding characteristic of capacitive charge storage contribution. With the increase in the sweep rate, Fig. 5B displays that the diffusion behavior of MoS2/NSGs-G electrode has decreased, while the capacitive charge storage contribution increased, which are 87%, 91%, 94%, 95%, and 98% of the total capacity contribution. Up to 98% of the pseudocapacitance is mainly attributed to the ultrathin layer nanostructures of MoS2/NSGs-G effectively restraining the aggregation of MoS2 and graphene so that Na+ can be rapidly inserted and extracted from the material surface during the cycles. In addition, the high specific surface area, abundant defects, and heteroatoms of nitrogen and sulfur in the composite material are helpful to improve the electrochemical performance and facilitate the pseudocapacitance behavior. Moreover, the synergistic effects of MoS2 and graphene contribute to enhancing the interface storage and the sodiation/desodiation reaction, which makes the composite material show an obvious pseudocapacitance behavior. These results strongly demonstrate that MoS2/NSGs-G possesses the sodium storage mechanism of dominant pseudocapacitive contribution, which plays a critical role in improving the electrochemical properties of electrode materials.\nIn order to investigate the crystal structure and morphological changes of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode after cycles, XRD, SEM, and HRTEM studies on the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode after the cycles were performed. Fig. 6A shows the XRD pattern of MoS2/NSGs-G after 250 cycles. It can be clearly observed that the diffraction peaks of the MoS2/NSGs-G at about 2θ = 43.2°, 50.3°, and 70.0° are well referred to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the copper substrate. Two obvious diffraction peaks appeared at around 21.1° and 28.4°, which point to the products of NaMoS2 and Na2S, respectively. In addition, three diffraction peaks in the (002), (100), and (103) planes were observed, which well matched those of the standard MoS2 (PDF # 37-1492), indicating that MoS2 can still maintain good crystal structure even after the cycles. Fig. 6B and C show the morphologies of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode before and after cycles, respectively. The original MoS2/NSGs-G electrode before cycles has a rough surface and there are many gaps between particles. After cycles, the surface of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode becomes smooth and the particles are tightly connected with each other. No cracks appeared on the surface of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode, indicating that the composite still maintained good structural stability after long cycles. Moreover, the solid electrolyte film generated on the electrode surface is also helpful to protect the structure of the material. In Fig. 6D, the HRTEM image of the MoS2/NSGs-G electrode shows that the lattice fringe of MoS2 can be obviously observed, which still remained at 0.87 nm after cycles, indicating that the MoS2/NSGs-G possesses good structural stability. Therefore, because of the good structural stability of the MoS2/NSGs-G, it could contribute to improving the cyclic stability and the electrochemical performance of the material.\nThe MoS2/NSGs-G material has remarkable electrochemical properties of high sodium storage capacity, excellent rate performance and long cycle life are on account of several obvious structural characteristics (i) two-dimensional structure of graphene and MoS2 spontaneously assemble into a self-supporting three-dimensional network structured composite material, this three-dimensional network could alleviate the volume change of the material, stabilize the structure during cycles and shorten the transport path of the ions and electrolyte, (ii) heteroatomic N and S are uniformly doped on graphene nanosheets by a facile electrochemical exfoliation, increasing the reaction sites, electronic conductivity and sodium storage capacity, (iii) extended layer spacing of graphene and MoS2, which facilitates increased sodium storage capacity, ions and electrolyte transport, (iv) the high sodium storage capacity of MoS2 and good support matrix of graphene are closely intertwined and create a synergistic effect, making the composite have outstanding electrochemical properties. As a result, this work may offer an operable strategy to explore high-performance MoS2-based composites for SIBs and other potential applications in the catalytic field.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Material reagent\nSodium sulfate (Na2SO4, Aladdin), glycine (C2H5NO2, Aladdin), dimethyl formamide (DMF, Aladdin), cetrimonium bromide (CTAB, Aladdin), sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O, Aladdin), and L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S, Aladdin) were used.\n\n2.2 Preparation of heteroatom-doped graphene\nIn this preparation process, the nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene was obtained by a facile electrochemical exfoliation approach. The electrolyte was composed of sodium sulfate (14.20 g) and glycine (7.51 g) dissolved in 1000 mL of deionized water. Then, the graphite foil (as a working electrode, about 4 cm × 12 cm) and Pt foil (as a counter electrode) were connected to a two-electrode system for electrochemical exfoliation. The height of the graphite foil above the solution level was about 2 cm, and the distance between the two electrodes was maintained around 3 cm throughout the exfoliation process. To improve the hydrophilicity of the graphite foil, the pre-electrochemical exfoliation voltage was set to 2 V and kept for 5 min. Then, a voltage of 10 V was applied between the two electrodes to start the electrochemical exfoliation until the graphite foil was completely exfoliated. Afterward, the black suspension was filtered and repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. To obtain fewer-layered graphene, the exfoliated graphene was dispersed into dimethyl formamide and sonicated for 2 h. Then, the dispersion was filtered and washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove dimethyl formamide. After that, the exfoliated graphene was dispersed in deionized water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min. Finally, the top part of the suspension was collected and the obtained nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene nanosheets were defined as NSGs-G. The nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene nanosheets were confirmed by XPS testing, which displayed that there were bonding states of C–N and C–S in the graphene nanosheets (as shown in Fig. S1†).\n\n2.3 Preparation of MoS2/heteroatom-co-doped graphene composite\nThe as-prepared black suspension containing 30 mg NSGs-G was diluted to form an 80 mL aqueous solution and ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. In order to increase the adsorption capacity of graphene onto MoO42−, the cetrimonium bromide was added to the above solution and the solution was stirred continuously for 12 h. Then, L-cysteine (1.2 g) and Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.6 g) were added to the mixed solution and the solution was stirred for another 2 h. Afterwards, the above solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave to carry out a hydrothermal reaction at the temperature of 200 °C for 24 h. When the autoclave was naturally cooled, the mixture was filtered and washed repeatedly with deionized water and ethanol for several times, then the mixture was dried at 80 °C. To improve the conductivity of the material, the resultant black mixture was heated in the argon atmosphere from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and kept at 800 °C for 2 h. The final product was defined as MoS2/NSGs-G. In the same way, the MoS2/Gs composite and bulk MoS2 were obtained without adding glycine and graphene, respectively.\n\n2.4 Material characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of the materials was implemented by Rigaku's D/max 2500v/pc instrument using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Philips' FEI Quanta 200 FEG) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL 2100F) were used to investigate the morphologies of the materials. An energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS, INCA) was connected to the FESEM to analyze the element distribution of the materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out by AXIS ULTRA DLD instrument and the obtained XPS test data were calibrated using the C 1s peak.\n\n2.5 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical measurements were performed using the two-electrode cells (CR2032 coin-type half-cells using Na metal as the counter electrode), which were assembled in an argon-filled glove box. The working electrode contained 80 wt% active materials, 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride as a binder, and 10 wt% Super P as a conductive additive, which were compressed onto the current collector (copper foil). The electrolyte mainly consisted of 1 M NaClO4 dispersing in dimethyl carbonate/ethylene carbonate (1:1 in volume) and 5 vol% of fluoroethylene carbonate was added into the electrolyte solution. The active material loading in the electrode was 0.6–0.8 mg cm−2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge cycle test of the button battery at 3–0.01 V (vs. Na+/Na) was carried out using a LAND test system. For studying the electrochemical behavior of the batteries, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using an electrochemical instrument (Zahner IM6, Germany), and the test parameters were set as follows; a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 at 1.0 mV to 3.0 V and ranging from 10 MHz to 100 kHz at the polarization of 5.0 mV, respectively.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Material reagent\nSodium sulfate (Na2SO4, Aladdin), glycine (C2H5NO2, Aladdin), dimethyl formamide (DMF, Aladdin), cetrimonium bromide (CTAB, Aladdin), sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O, Aladdin), and L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S, Aladdin) were used.\n\n2.2 Preparation of heteroatom-doped graphene\nIn this preparation process, the nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene was obtained by a facile electrochemical exfoliation approach. The electrolyte was composed of sodium sulfate (14.20 g) and glycine (7.51 g) dissolved in 1000 mL of deionized water. Then, the graphite foil (as a working electrode, about 4 cm × 12 cm) and Pt foil (as a counter electrode) were connected to a two-electrode system for electrochemical exfoliation. The height of the graphite foil above the solution level was about 2 cm, and the distance between the two electrodes was maintained around 3 cm throughout the exfoliation process. To improve the hydrophilicity of the graphite foil, the pre-electrochemical exfoliation voltage was set to 2 V and kept for 5 min. Then, a voltage of 10 V was applied between the two electrodes to start the electrochemical exfoliation until the graphite foil was completely exfoliated. Afterward, the black suspension was filtered and repeatedly washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. To obtain fewer-layered graphene, the exfoliated graphene was dispersed into dimethyl formamide and sonicated for 2 h. Then, the dispersion was filtered and washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove dimethyl formamide. After that, the exfoliated graphene was dispersed in deionized water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min. Finally, the top part of the suspension was collected and the obtained nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene nanosheets were defined as NSGs-G. The nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene nanosheets were confirmed by XPS testing, which displayed that there were bonding states of C–N and C–S in the graphene nanosheets (as shown in Fig. S1†).\n\n2.3 Preparation of MoS2/heteroatom-co-doped graphene composite\nThe as-prepared black suspension containing 30 mg NSGs-G was diluted to form an 80 mL aqueous solution and ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. In order to increase the adsorption capacity of graphene onto MoO42−, the cetrimonium bromide was added to the above solution and the solution was stirred continuously for 12 h. Then, L-cysteine (1.2 g) and Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.6 g) were added to the mixed solution and the solution was stirred for another 2 h. Afterwards, the above solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave to carry out a hydrothermal reaction at the temperature of 200 °C for 24 h. When the autoclave was naturally cooled, the mixture was filtered and washed repeatedly with deionized water and ethanol for several times, then the mixture was dried at 80 °C. To improve the conductivity of the material, the resultant black mixture was heated in the argon atmosphere from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and kept at 800 °C for 2 h. The final product was defined as MoS2/NSGs-G. In the same way, the MoS2/Gs composite and bulk MoS2 were obtained without adding glycine and graphene, respectively.\n\n2.4 Material characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of the materials was implemented by Rigaku's D/max 2500v/pc instrument using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Philips' FEI Quanta 200 FEG) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL 2100F) were used to investigate the morphologies of the materials.

The galvanostatic charge–discharge cycle test of the button battery at 3–0.01 V (vs. Na+/Na) was carried out using a LAND test system. For studying the electrochemical behavior of the batteries, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using an electrochemical instrument (Zahner IM6, Germany), and the test parameters were set as follows; a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 at 1.0 mV to 3.0 V and ranging from 10 MHz to 100 kHz at the polarization of 5.0 mV, respectively.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

However, due to the limited and uneven distribution of lithium resources in the Earth's crust, it is urgent to find new energy storage materials as both a supplement and substitute for LIBs. Compared with lithium, sodium exhibits similar electrochemical properties and is an abundant natural resource in the Earth's crust. These advantages make sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) one of the potential energy storage systems. Commercial graphite materials in LIBs show a very poor electrochemical performance in SIBs. Therefore, finding suitable anode materials for SIBs is the key to their early commercial application. Among many anode materials, VI A main group metal compounds based on a multi-electron conversion reaction mechanism possess the advantages of low cost, easy control over the morphology, and a high theoretical specific capacity. Therefore, they have been widely investigated as SIBs anode materials. However, such materials are accompanied by a huge volume expansion during the electrochemical cycling process, resulting in the crushing and collapse of the electrode materials. Therefore, the application of such materials in SIBs still faces great challenges.\nDue to their typical narrow band gap and size-dependent properties, V–VI main group metal-chalcogenides show important application potential. Among them, antimony(III) selenide (Sb2Se3) is a representative semiconductor material with a direct band gap (Eg ≈ 1.11 eV), which has been widely studied in the fields of photoelectric devices, thermoelectric materials, photovoltaic materials and electrochemical energy storage. A variety of new Sb2Se3 nanostructures exhibit different physical and chemical properties compared with their bulk materials, particularly one-dimensional (1D) nanowires with a high length/diameter ratio, which have received close attention from researchers due to their unique properties of anisotropy. Sb2Se3, as an anode material in SIBs, is conducive to the transfer of Na+, and 1 mol Sb2Se3 can react with 12 mol Na+, resulting in a high theoretical capacity of 670 mA h g−1, which has attracted extensive attention from many researchers. Through in situ X-ray diffraction, Yang's group found that the de-intercalation reaction, the conversion reaction and the alloy reaction occurred during the charging and discharging process of Sb2Se3, leading to a relatively high theoretical mass specific capacity. However, during this process, volume expansion and contraction will occur, and even the active material will fall off the substrate, leading to a low electron conductivity and poor cycling stability. The most effective mitigation method is to insert Sb2Se3 into the carbon substrate material as a volume buffer to inhibit volume expansion and improve the electrical conductivity. 2D MXene materials exhibit abundant surface redox reaction sites, a high metal conductivity (6.76 × 105 S m−1), a controllable layer spacing due to weak van der Waals forces, and a more stable layer structure and lower Na+ diffusion barrier than graphene; thus, MXene matrix composites can be constructed through alternate filtration, surface modification, intercalation and in situ deposition, and have become an ideal choice for energy storage applications. In addition, MXene is beneficial to improve the volumetric energy density of electrode material. Therefore, it is expected that high-performance electrode materials for SIBs can be constructed via the hybridization of Sb2Se3 and MXenes.\nIn this work, the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene composite was fabricated by fixing monodisperse Sb2Se3@NC nanotubes on the surface of the Ti3C2Tx MXene through interfacial covalent bonding. Thanks to the supporting skeleton of the MXene and the strong interface contact with Sb2Se3, the volume expansion of Sb2Se3 during charging and discharging process of SIBs is effectively buffered. In addition, the formation of a three-dimensional continuous electron transport network shortens the ion transport path, which is of great significance for speeding up the electron/ion transport for Na+ storage. Specifically, the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene exhibits an enhanced SIB performance with a stable specific capacity of 333.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 300 cycles. The strong pseudo-capacitance and sodium-ion diffusion properties of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene are responsible for the improved SIB performance. In Na+ full-battery applications, Sb2Se3@NC/MXene//Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) also shows a stable capacity of 115.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles.\nThe preparation process of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene is shown in Fig. 1a. For the dispersed MXene layer, it can be obtained using a conventional etching and exfoliation approach. Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern of the Ti-MXene nanosheets. This indicates that the Al atomic layer in Ti3AlC2 has been successfully removed, and the peak at 6.5° corresponds to the MXene (002) crystal plane, indicating that the layer spacing of the nanosheet has increased, which is basically consistent with the complete large nanosheet shown in the SEM image in Fig. S1b (ESI†). For the fabrication of Sb2Se3@NC, Sb2S3 nanowires were first produced via a hydrothermal method. Characterization using XRD and SEM/TEM confirmed the successful synthesis of the Sb2S3 nanowires (Fig. S2, ESI†). The Sb2S3 nanowires were treated with polydopamine (PDA) coating and calcination. As a result, Sb nanoparticles encapsulated into N-doped carbon nanotubes (Sb@NC) can be created (Fig. S3, ESI†). Then using the pyrolytic selenization technique, Sb2Se3@NC were formed. As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), the crystal structure of the product matches well with orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (JCPDS: 75-1462). The Sb2Se3@NC show an ultralong nanotube structure with a diameter of around 100 nm. Finally, the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene was obtained via the facile mixing Sb2Se3@NC and MXene in aqueous solution (Fig. 1a). First, XRD measurements were conducted on the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene hybrid, as shown in Fig. 1b. Except the peak at 6.5° for the (002) plane of MXene, all other peaks can be well matched with the orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (JCPDS: 75-1462), indicating the pure crystal structure of the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene hybrid. The chemical states of the elements in Sb2Se3@NC/MXene were analyzed via XPS, and consist of Sb 3d, O 1s, Se 3d, N 1s, Ti 2p and C 1s (Fig. S5a, ESI†). A significant amount of polar groups (O, OH, and F) was added to the Ti-MXene surface during etching and exfoliation, which endowed it with good hydrophilicity and exceptional water dispersion, according to the high-resolution XPS of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene in the Ti 2p region (Fig. S5b, ESI†). For C 1s in Fig. S5c (ESI†), the four peaks at 282, 284.7, 285.4 and 288.8 eV can be indexed to C–Ti, C–C, C–O/C–N and CO, respectively. The XPS spectra of Sb 3d and O 1s are shown in Fig. 1c. Sb3+ is present in Sb2Se3@NC/MXene, as evidenced by the peaks at 529.1 eV and 538.4 eV, which correspond to Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2, respectively. The other peaks are related to the oxidation of a small part of the surface of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene. Fig. 1d shows the XPS spectrum of elemental Se. The peaks at 53.8 eV and 55.4 eV are attributed to the characteristic peaks of Se–Sb and Se–Se bonds, respectively, indicating that Se in the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene exists in the bivalent form.Fig. 1e shows the N 1s fractional peak of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene. It can be divided into three peaks at 398.4, 400.2 and 401.2 eV, which correspond to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N, respectively.\nThe morphologies of the obtained Sb2Se3@NC/MXene hybrid and the intermediates were characterized using SEM, TEM and HR-TEM (Fig. 2). The SEM and TEM images of Sb2S3 show its solid nanofibrous morphology with a diameter of about 100 nm and a length of several microns (Fig. 2a and b). Fig. 2c and d show the Sb nanoparticles confined in the N-doped carbon nanotubes. This shape was maintained after selenization (Fig. 2e and f). By mixing Sb2Se3@NC and MXene, the 2D MXene can be well cross-linked with the Sb2Se3@NC nanotubes (Fig. 2g and h). The electron diffraction X-ray spectrum (EDS) of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene shows the distribution of the five elements C, Ti, Se, Sb and N in the cross-linked structure. The Sb2Se3@NC/MXene hybrid composed of 2D layered MXene and 1D nanotubes has the advantages of continuous ion/electron channels and short diffusion distances, and also acts as a buffer layer to alleviate the huge volume change in SIBs. The TGA curve of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene suggests that the carbon content in the composite is 33.3% (Fig. S6, ESI†). The surface area measurement indicates that the BET surface area can be improved from 14.9 to 20.0 m2 g−1via the introduction of MXene into Sb2Se3@NC (Fig. S7, ESI†).\nThe electrochemical SIB performance and the mechanism of the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene were thoroughly examined. Fig. 3a displays the CV curves for the first five cycles of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene at 0.1 mV s−1. Three reduction peaks at 1.25, 1.04 and 0.48 V were observed. The reduction peaks at 1.25 V and 1.04 V were associated with the formation of NaxSb2Se3 and Sb nanoparticles embedded in Na2Se, respectively, as well as the establishment of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI), while the reduction peaks at 0.48 V were related to the alloying reaction between Sb and Na+. During the initial round of positive scanning, three oxidation peaks of 0.74, 1.51 and 1.83 V were noticed. These peaks can be attributed to the de-alloying of Na3Sb, the conversion of Na2Se and Sb into NaxSb2Se3, and the de-sodiation reaction of NaxSb2Se3. The CV curves almost completely overlap between the second and fifth cycles, demonstrating the reversibility of the Na storage processes. The 1st, 2nd and 5th charge/discharge (GCD) curves of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene at 0.2 A g−1 exhibit an initial high capacity of 672.2 mA h g−1 and an initial coulombic efficiency of 67.9%, as well as an approximate 100% coulombic efficiency in the 2nd cycle, which are much better than the Sb2Se3@NC (Fig. 3b and Fig. S8a, ESI†). The rate performance comparison between Sb2Se3@NC/MXene and Sb2Se3@NC is shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. S8b (ESI†). At 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, Sb2Se3@NC/MXene delivers enhanced specific capacities of 448.9, 380.8, 346.6, 323.3, 286 and 241.6 mA h g−1, respectively. For the cycling stability of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene, a specific capacity of 367.8 mA h g−1 can be achieved after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. S9, ESI†). When the current density is increased to 1 A g−1, it also exhibits the superior stable capacity of 333.5 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles (Fig. 3d and Fig. S10, ESI†). By comparing the rate capabilities, it can be proved that Sb2Se3@NC/MXene can maintain the best performance among the previously reported Sb2Se3-based SIBs (Fig. S11, ESI†). Based on the superior Na+ half-cell performance of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene, Na+ full batteries were constructed using the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode, and the appropriate potential window of 1.25–3.75 V was selected. The rate capability of the full batteries is shown in Fig. 3e. The specific capacities of 346.9, 260.5, 221.1, 200.2, 180.5 and 168.9 mA h g−1 are obtained at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 A g−1, respectively. An excellent cycle life can also be demonstrated in terms of the high capacity of 115.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles (Fig. 3f and Fig. S12, ESI†). In addition, the specific capacity of the full cell after 200 cycles is 13.7 mA h g−1, which is based on the mass loading of the NVPOF cathode (Fig. S13, ESI†). The inset of Fig. 3f shows an LED light lit using the as-prepared Sb2Se3@NC/MXene//NVPOF full battery.\nIn order to further understand the diffusion and charge transfer characteristics of the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene electrode, pseudocapacitive calculations and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests were performed. Fig. 4a shows the various CV curves from 0.1 to 3.0 mV s−1. The kinetic process of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene was verified using the previously reported method and formulas, including pseudo-capacitance and diffusion behavior. From the CV curves, six redox peaks can be fitted, as shown in Fig. 4b. The straight slope from the lines, which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, and the b values represent the degree of diffusion or surface capacitance. The b values of the six lines are calculated to be 0.79, 0.86, 0.99, 0.69, 0.99 and 0.81, respectively. The b values of the six peaks are all close to 1, indicating that the capacity contribution of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene is mainly controlled by the pseudo-capacitance behavior. At 1.0 mV s−1, the capacitance contribution of the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene electrode is measured to be 81.6% (Fig. 4c). A histogram of the capacitance contributions made by the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene electrodes at scan speeds ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 mV s−1 is shown in Fig. 3d. With an increase in the scan rate, the capacity contribution percentage of the pseudo-capacitance process improves. At the high scanning rate of 3 mV s−1, the capacity contribution of the pseudo-capacitor process is as high as 91.2%. A high contribution ratio of pseudo-capacitance indicates that the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene has a strong ability to absorb Na+, which is conducive to improving the reversible capacity and the cycling stability, so as to show an excellent electrochemical performance. The sodium diffusion rates of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene and Sb2Se3@NC can be calculated through the GITT test (Fig. 4e and Fig. S14, ESI†). The diffusion rate of Na ions for Sb2Se3@NC/MXene is higher than that of Sb2Se3@NC during the charging and discharging process (Fig. 4f). The 2D MXene-stabilized Sb2Se3@NC effectively shorten the diffusion path of Na ions and reduce the energy barrier for Na+ to participate in the reaction, which explains the high diffusion rate of the SIBs with Sb2Se3@NC/MXene. According to EIS measurements (Fig. S15, ESI†), improved ionic/electronic conductivities in Sb2Se3@NC/MXene are reflected by the smaller semicircle and the steeper line. By checking the cycled electrode (Fig. S16, ESI†), it can be seen that the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene electrode shows an excellent retention of morphology.\nIn conclusion, the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene hybrid was prepared. The effective interfacial chemical bond can bridge the physical gap between Sb2Se3 and the MXene, thus improving the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer. In addition, interfacial covalent bonds can effectively confine Sb2Se3 and the corresponding reduction products to the surface of the MXene. Benefitting from the unique hybrid structure and synergistic effect between monodisperse Sb2Se3@NC and fully stripped MXene, the Sb2Se3@NC/MXene hybrid material shows a highly reversible sodium storage capacity of 333.5 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 1 A g−1, and even maintains 115.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles for Na+ full batteries. In view of the established enhanced sodium storage properties, the rational covalent bonding strategy of Sb2Se3@NC/MXene composites can also be extended to other related fields.\nThis work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (22KJA430009), the Science and Technology Development Plan of Suzhou (ZXL2022176), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M711686), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20201049).\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Flexible storage systems, as the kernel component of flexible electronics, have attracted extensive attention. Although flexible lithium-ion batteries (F-LIBs) have been commercialized, their sustainable development is being hampered by the limited storage and soaring prices of lithium reserves. Therefore, flexible sodium-ion batteries (F-SIBs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives, owning to their abundant resources of sodium and the similar working principles to LIBs. However, F-SIBs are still in their infancy, and their energy density is far below the demands in various application scenarios. Relative to flexible anodes, flexible cathodes for F-SIBs with both excellent electrochemical and mechanical properties are facing particularly huge challenges.\nFlexible free-standing cathodes are usually composed of active substances and flexible substrates, in which the active substances serve as the sodium storage system. Among the polyanions, layered oxides, and Prussian blue analogues active substances for SIBs, only the polyanionic cathode materials have received more extensive attention, such as NaFePO4, Na3V2(PO4)3, and Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F for F-SIBs to date. Generally, flexible polyanionic cathodes are constructed by an electrospinning technique. The electrospinning membrane can be used directly as a cathode without the addition of binders, conductive carbon or collector fluids. And the electrospinning technique offers continuous expressways for electrons to improve the electronic conductivity. While the improvement of the energy density of flexible polyanionic cathodes is primarily restricted by the limited theoretical specific capacity and large relative molecular mass of polyanionic active substances.\nInstead, layered transition metal oxide active substances possess the advantages of high theoretical capacity, fast ion diffusion, high energy density, etc. Flexible free-standing cathodes with transition metal oxides as the active substances are usually fabricated via solvothermal synthesis, hydrothermal reaction, and a vacuum filtration technique. Note that the success of solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesises depends strongly on the selected flexible substrates, which also lowers the energy density of flexible cathodes. And the vacuum filtration technique easily causes cathode fracture and stripped active substances during cycling due to the weak adhering interaction between the active substances and flexible substrates. In contrast, cathodes fabricated via electrospinning are intrinsically flexible without additional flexible substrates and possess strong cohesion between the active substances and flexible substrates. However, oxide active substances are typically synthesized in oxidizing atmospheres, which are incompatible with that of electrospinning technology. According to our previous studies, layered oxide NaCrO2(NCO) is synthesized in an inert/reducing atmosphere compatible well with that of electrospinning technology, and exhibits superior rate and cycling performance as well as larger theoretical specific capacity (250 mA h g−1) suitable as the electrochemical active substances for F-SIBs.\nHerein, we innovatively proposed to construct a NaCrO2@C(NCO@C) flexible free-standing cathode via an electrospinning technique. The as-constructed NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode exhibits superior rate performance (106.3 mA h g−1 at 10C), good cyclability (capacity retention of 87.5% over 300 cycles at 0.2C), and outstanding mechanical flexibility. The current work opens a new avenue towards the future development of flexible free-standing cathodes for SIBs.\nAccording to the PDF Card No. 88-0720, the main diffraction peaks in Fig. 1 can be accurately indexed to the hexagonal layered structure of NCO with a space group Rm (166). Note that two impurity phases, Cr2O3 and Na2CO3, are also included with 29 wt% and 14 wt%, respectively. It is reported that the Cr2O3 layer coated on NCO can avoid direct contact between NCO and the electrolyte, effectively limiting the incidence of side reactions. The Na2CO3 impurity may result from the residual base on the membrane surface reacting with the CO2 in the air. No diffraction peaks of carbon fibre in Fig. 1 reveal that the carbon substrate is amorphous.\nSEM images of the NCO@C free-standing cathode in Fig. 2a show the consecutive and interlaced fibres with diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm. The NCO particles of about 50 nm are uniformly adhered to or embedded in the interlinked carbon fibres, which are not easily detached during cycling, beneficial for cycling stability. The elemental mappings captured by EDS (Fig. 2b) demonstrate that the Na, Cr, O, C, and N elements are homogeneously distributed in the NCO@C fibres. Meanwhile, Fig. 3a further verifies the presence of Na, Cr, O, C and N elements. In Fig. 3b, four characteristic peaks of C 1s at 284.5 eV, 285.6 eV, 287.9 eV, and 289.5 eV are attributed to CC, CN, C–N, and OC–O, respectively. There are three fitted N 1s peaks at 398.3 eV, 400.1 eV, and 403.0 eV assigned to the pyridine nitrogen, pyrrole nitrogen and graphite nitrogen, respectively. Notably, the various nitrogens derived from the PAN precursor can provide more electrons to the π-conjugated system of carbon, thus significantly improving the electronic conductivity of the NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode.\nAs Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows, the two broad peaks located around 1350 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 represent the D-band (related to sp3 coordination behavior) and the G-band (related to graphite carbon and sp2 coordination behavior), respectively. The value of R is close to 1.14, indicating good conductivity of the carbon framework of the NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode, which is beneficial for improving the electrochemical performance.\nBased on the thermo-gravimetric analysis in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the content of NCO substance including Na2CO3 and Cr2O3 impurities in the NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode is 63 wt%. Combined with the refined XRD result (Fig. 1), the calculated content of NCO electrochemical active substance in a flexible cathode is 35.8 wt%. In Fig. 4a, the features of the CV curves are well consistent with those of the NCO cathode. At 0.1 mV s−1, two pairs of main redox peaks at 3.09/2.83 V and 3.33/3.27 V, correspond to the redox reaction of Cr3+/Cr4+. And yet the other small peaks in the range of 2.9–3.1 V are attributed to the order/disorder phase transformation. The discharge curves in Fig. 4b demonstrate long plateaus at ∼3.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) and small plateaus at ∼3.3 V, in accordance with two main redox peaks in the CV curves. No obvious working potential drop occurs during the initial 20 cycles, indicating the good electrochemical reversibility. The initial discharge capacity of 110.0 mA h g−1 is achieved at 0.5C (1C = 250 mA g−1), which is slightly lower than that of the NCO cathode in ref. . As shown in Fig. 4c, the NCO@C free-standing cathode delivers an outstanding rate performance with average reversible capacities of 112.3 112.2, 110.6, and 106.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5C, 2C, 5C, and 10C, respectively. When the current density is switched back to 0.5C, the capacity is recovered to 111.2 mA h g−1, very close to the initial value. The initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) in Fig. 4d is 86.2% and the discharge capacity remains at 82.9 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.2C, which illustrates outstanding cycling stability. The excellent rate and cycling performance of the NCO@C free-standing cathode can be probably ascribed to the following two reasons. On the one hand, the NCO particles are refined by the freeze-assisted sol–gel method, exposing more active sites for sodiation/desodiation and shortening the Na+ diffusion distance. Meanwhile, the electrospinning technique offers a continuous one-dimensional channel for electron transfer to lower the Na+ diffusion resistance, enabling rapid Na+ diffusion. On the other hand, the unique cathode structure of NCO active particles embedded in carbon fibres can suppress the volume expansion of NCO during the repetitive Na+ intercalation/deintercalation to stabilize the crystal structure.\nThe NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode possesses excellent electrolyte wettability compared to the conventional NCO cathode with aluminium foil as a collector, as shown in Fig. 5. The contact angle between the liquid (electrolyte) and the solid substrate (electrode) can be defined by the Laplace–Young's equation:\nγγγ\nFig. S4 (ESI†) demonstrates that the NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode possesses good bending flexibility. After repeated bending, no fractures or wrinkles occur in the NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode when being recovered to its initial state.\nThe NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode with excellent electrochemical properties and mechanical flexibility was firstly constructed by an electrospinning technique using layered oxide NCO as the electrochemical active substance. The NCO particles are uniformly glued to or embedded in the interconnected carbon fibres, which creates a strong bond between the electrochemical active substance and the flexible substrate. The constructed NCO@C flexible free-standing cathode delivers an impressive rate and cycling stability performance, with an average discharge capacity of 106 mA h g−1 at 10C and retention rate of 87.5% after 300 cycles at 0.2C. The carbonaceous structures constructed by electrospinning not only contribute to the electron conductivity, but also suppress the volume expansion of NCO during sodiation and desodiation. The combination of oxide-based electrochemical active substances and electrospinning technology sheds a brand-new light on the further development of high-performance F-SIBs.\nWe would like to express our sincere appreciation for the generous financial support provided by the National Science Foundation, China (21673051), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Grant No. 2021A1515010388).\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

However, choosing suitable anode materials presents a significant challenge. Traditional materials like graphite are not ideal due to the larger size of sodium ions compared to lithium, causing size mismatch and voltage issues. In this context, hard carbon has been explored as an alternative, but its limited capacity and lower rate performance present challenges for electronic devices, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage. This underscores the pressing need for innovative anode materials to overcome these limitations.\nTransition metal oxides (TMOs) have emerged as promising candidates for sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes, thanks to their high theoretical capacity. TMOs offer the potential for storing significant energy per unit mass or volume, making them appealing for applications requiring long-lasting power sources. Moreover, many transition metals are abundant in nature, rendering their oxide forms both readily available and cost-effective compared to other battery materials. This affordability could pave the way for broader SIB adoption. However, the specific capacity of TMOs often falls short of their theoretical capacity, restricting the overall energy storage capacity. Slower sodium ion diffusion kinetics within specific TMO structures, compared to lithium ions, contribute to reduced rate capabilities for charging and discharging processes. Therefore, optimizing anode material structures holds the key to maximizing the TMO performance in SIBs.\nCarefully tailoring material structures can enhance conductivity, increase surface area, and improve ion diffusion, resulting in higher energy storage capacity and superior cycling stability. Carbonaceous materials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and nanofibers, provide a versatile platform for functionalizing and modifying SIB electrodes, courtesy of their excellent conductivity, chemical stability, and physical robustness. These characteristics endow carbon-based electrodes with superior rate capability and cycling durability. Among carbonaceous materials, carbon hollow spheres (CHSs) stand out due to their unique combination of hollow and porous structures, such as high electrical conductivity, inherent stability, and abundant ion channels. Their porous nature facilitates the integration of other active components onto the surface, allowing for tailored designs with specific functionalities. The hollow structure of CHSs provides a large surface area-to-volume ratio, increasing electrochemical performance by providing more active sites. Notably, the growth of nanosheets, NiO, Co3O4, MnO2, and TiO2/MoO2 on the outer surface of CHSs has led to enhanced electrochemical performance. Nevertheless, incorporating active components on both the inner and outer surfaces of CHSs presents a substantial challenge.\nHerein, a hybrid material (NiMn2O4/CHS) with a trilaminar and hollow structure was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method, with carbon hollow spheres (CHSs) serving as non-sacrificial templates. The abundant mesopores within the carbon shells facilitated the successful anchoring of NiMn2O4 nanosheets on both the inner and outer surfaces of the carbon shells. CHSs acted as robust and conductive skeletons, improving structural stability and accelerating electron transfer. Furthermore, the nanosized NiMn2O4 promoted the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions. When employed as electrode materials for sodium-ion storage, NiMn2O4/CHS exhibits a high specific capacity of 363 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 243 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 2.0 A g−1 as well as outstanding cycling durability. The use of carbon hollow spheres as a substrate offers several advantages including high surface area, excellent conductivity, and stability/durability. This makes them an attractive choice for researchers exploring innovative solutions within the realm of energy storage.\nThe synthesis of NiMn2O4/CHS is depicted in Fig. 1a, involving the fabrication of mesoporous CHSs, the growth of NiMn-LDH nanosheets, and the conversion of NiMn-LDH into NiMn2O4. To begin, mesoporous CHSs are derived from the etching of core–shell structured SiO2@C nanospheres, resulting from the carbonization of SiO2@resorcinol-formaldehyde (SiO2@RF). The abundant SiO2 nanoparticles in the SiO2@C shell lead to the formation of mesoporous nanochannels in the carbon shells upon SiO2 removal. Next, NiMn-LDH nanosheets are uniformly deposited on both sides of the carbon shells, forming hollow spheres with a trilaminar shell architecture. The mesoporous nanochannels in CHSs play a crucial role in the generation of this trilaminar shell. During the hydrothermal process, Ni2+ and MnO4− ions diffuse into the CHS cavities through these nanochannels, enabling the simultaneous anchoring and growth of NiMn-LDH nanocrystals into nanosheets, ultimately creating the NiMn-LDH/CHS composite. A final calcination treatment under an N2 atmosphere transforms NiMn-LDH/CHS into sandwich-structured NiMn2O4/CHS, featuring two NiMn2O4 skins bonded to a core of carbon shell.\nThe evolution of the NiMn2O4/CHS micromorphology is revealed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CHSs exhibit a uniform spherical structure with a consistent size of approximately 190 nm (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1a, ESI†). The hollow structure of CHSs is further confirmed by TEM, which reveals numerous cross-connected mesopores in the carbon shell, generating nanochannels leading to the CHS cavity. Fig. 1c clearly illustrates that NiMn-LDH nanosheets uniformly cover the surface of the CHSs. Following calcination, NiMn2O4/CHS retains the morphology of NiMn-LDH/CHS with virtually no change in appearance (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1b, ESI†). TEM images of NiMn2O4/CHS (Fig. 2b and c) show two layers of NiMn2O4 nanoflakes on the external and internal surfaces of the carbon shell, confirming the trilaminar shell structure. The thickness of the external NiMn2O4 layer is approximately 50 nm, while that of the internal layer is challenging to accurately determine. However, the internal NiMn2O4 layer is notably thinner than the external layer due to the gradual closure of nanochannels in the carbon shells as NiMn-LDH nanosheets load onto the carbon shells in the hydrothermal process. This prevents precursor ions, such as Ni2+ and MnO4−, from entering the CHS cavities and inhibits the growth of internal NiMn-LDH nanosheets. High-resolution TEM images (Fig. 2d) reveal lattice stripes with a plane spacing of 0.253 nm, corresponding to the (311) plane of NiMn2O4. Moreover, high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of NiMn2O4/CHS (Fig. 2e and f) indicate the homogeneous distribution of Mn, Ni, and O on both surfaces of the carbon shells, demonstrating the successful deposition of NiMn2O4 nanosheets on both surfaces. In comparison, pristine NiMn2O4 exhibits a large nanoflake structure in the absence of CHSs (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†).\nThe crystal phase transition of NiMn2O4/CHS is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 2a). The broad bump of CHSs at 25.0° corresponds to amorphous carbon, while the three peaks of NiMn-LDH/CHS at 18.7°, 36.5°, and 65.4° are characteristic of layered double hydroxide. The evident diffraction peaks of NiMn2O4/CHS at 35.4°, 43.2°, and 62.7° are assigned to the (311), (400), and (440) planes of cubic NiMn2O4 (JCPDS No. 01-1110), respectively. This data indicates the complete transformation of NiMn-LDH/CHS into NiMn2O4/CHS. The Raman spectrum of NiMn2O4/CHS (Fig. 2b) reveals two peaks at 1338 and 1601 cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands of carbon, respectively. The ratios of the D and G bands in CHS and NiMn2O4/CHS are 0.82 and 0.65, respectively. The peak around 586 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of NiMn2O4. Compared to pure NiMn2O4, this suggests the successful introduction of CHSs into the NiMn2O4/CHS hybrid nanomaterial. Both NiMn2O4/CHS and NiMn2O4 exhibit N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of Type IV with Type H3 hysteresis loops, indicating slit-like mesopores formed by the nanoflake assembly (Fig. S2a, ESI†). However, the pore size distribution of NiMn2O4/CHS features more mesopores than that of NiMn2O4, primarily due to the presence of CHS cores and smaller nanosheets. The surface area of NiMn2O4/CHS is 149 m2 g−1, higher than that of NiMn2O4 (114 m2 g−1). The hollow structure of CHSs provides a large surface area-to-volume ratio, which enhances electrochemical performance by facilitating more active sites for chemical reactions. The increased surface area also promotes better ion diffusion within the electrode material, leading to improved efficiency and capacity. In Fig. S3 (ESI†), the contents of NiMn2O4 and CHS in the NiMn2O4/CHS composite are 91.2% and 4.1%, respectively.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to identify the chemical states of elements in NiMn2O4/CHS. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S2b, ESI†) shows the peaks of Ni, Mn, C, and O in correspondence with NiMn2O4/CHS. As shown in the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p (Fig. 3c), the peaks at 855.3 and 872.8 eV belong with the Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of Ni2+, respectively; while the peaks at 856.8 and 874.4 eV are attributed to the Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of Ni3+, respectively. For the Mn element (Fig. 3d), the Mn 2p orbit was fitted into four spin–orbit peaks, where two peaks (641.5 and 653.2 eV) and another two peaks (643.5 and 655.2 eV) are related to Mn2+ and Mn3+, respectively. Moreover, there are three peaks at 533.4, 531.7, and 530.0 eV in the O 1s spectrum (Fig. S2c, ESI†), associated with O–C, O–H, and O–Mn/O–Ni, respectively. The three peaks of C 1s at 288.4, 286.6, and 284.6 eV were assigned to –COOH, –CO/–C–OH, and –CC–/–C–C–, respectively (Fig. S2d, ESI†).\nThe electrochemical performance of the NiMn2O4/CHS electrodes is evaluated in a half-cell device. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of NiMn2O4/CHS (Fig. 4a) exhibit a broad bump around 0.9–1.6 V during the first anode scan, corresponding to the insertion of Na+ into NiMn2O4 and the conversion of NiMn2O4 into Ni and Mn metals. A peak at 0.65 V is associated with the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer resulting from electrolyte decomposition. In the first cathode scan, a peak at 1.06 V corresponds to the conversion of Ni and Mn into NiO and Mn2O3, respectively. The redox peaks remain consistent with cycling, indicating the exceptional reversibility of the NiMn2O4/CHS electrode. Therefore, the electrochemical mechanism of NiMn2O4/CHS can be presumed as the equations (NiMn2O4 + 8e− + 8Na+ → Ni + 4NaO + 2Mn; Ni + 4NaO + 2Mn ↔ Mn2O3 + NiO + 8e− + 8Na+). The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves (Fig. 4b) exhibited obvious sloping characterization of the GCD curves, ensuring the restriction of polarization and the achievement of good rate capability. From Fig. 4c, it was observed that the NiMn2O4/CHS electrode delivered a high reversible capacity of 287 mA h g−1, almost triple that of the pure NiMn2O4 electrode (88 mA h g−1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. The outstanding reversibility of the NiMn2O4/CHS electrode was attributed to the introduction of CHS.\nThe NiMn2O4/CHS anode delivered an initial discharging/charging capacity of 552/363 mA h g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 65.8% at current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 4d), which was superior to the pure NiMn2O4 anode (521/204 mA h g−1 and 39.2%). Moreover, NiMn2O4/CHS presented excellent rate performances with capacities of 363, 323, 298, 268, and 243 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 A g−1 (Fig. S4, ESI†), respectively. When the current density came back to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity recovered to 352 mA h g−1. According to the specific capacity (Fig. S5, ESI†) and content of CHS, the capacity contributions of CHS in the composite are 12.6, 9.5, 8.0, 6.6 and 5.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 A g−1, respectively. The rate performance of NiMn2O4/CHS overwhelmed that of the bare NiMn2O4 anode. This indicated that the introduction of carbon played a positive role in the rate capacity. Additionally, the smaller particle size reduces the diffusion distances and increases the contact points between the material and sodium ions, enhancing the Na+ storage performance. The long-term cycling performances of the NiMn2O4/CHS and bare NiMn2O4 anodes were estimated at 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. 4e). After 500 cycles, NiMn2O4/CHS showed a capacity retention of 78.3% (a reversible capacity of 197 mA h g−1), which was superior to the bare NiMn2O4 (27.2% and 25 mA h g−1). The morphology of NiMn2O4/CHS after the cycling test has been well preserved (Fig. S6, ESI†), revealing that CHSs possess remarkable mechanical stability and durability. Their robust structure enables them to withstand repeated cycles of charging and discharging without significant degradation or loss in performance. From Fig. 4f, NiMn2O4/CHS exhibited smaller charge transfer resistance and better ion diffusion behavior than pure NiMn2O4. The CHS substrate served as a conductive skeleton that can efficiently transport electrons during electrochemical processes, resulting in low resistance and improved efficiency. This property makes them highly suitable for applications that require fast charge/discharge rates or high-power output.\nThe outstanding Na-ion storage performance of NiMn2O4/CHS is attributed to its specific architecture: (i) the mesoporous CHSs act as a robust substrate that alleviates volumetric changes and significantly enhances sodium ion diffusion; (ii) CHSs, serving as a conductive skeleton, expedite electron transfer; (iii) nanostructured NiMn2O4 nanoparticles substantially reduce the distance over which sodium ions must diffuse, enhancing the ion diffusion kinetics. These results demonstrate that incorporating mesoporous CHSs is a promising strategy for achieving high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.\nNiMn2O4/CHS with a unique trilaminar shell structure has been successfully fabricated by the hydrothermal method. The carbon shells of CHSs, with their abundant mesopores, facilitate the diffusion of precursor ions during the synthesis, resulting in the uniform growth of NiMn2O4 nanoflakes on both sides of the carbon shells. Benefiting from the unique architecture, NiMn2O4/CHS delivered a high capacity of 363 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, an excellent rate capability (243 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1) and long-term cycling durability.\nThe work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22075217 and 52322214), the Key Research and Development Program of Hubei Province (2023BAB113) and the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China (2022CFA001 and 2023CFA088).\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no competing financial interests.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results\n\n3.1 Phase and structure characterization\nPowder X-ray diffraction was employed to investigate the crystal structure of the as-synthesized NVP/C composite cathode materials. As shown in Fig. 1, all the samples had the same structural characteristics and good crystallinity. After careful comparison with the standard JCPDS card, almost all the diffraction peaks could be well matched to rhombohedra Na3V2(PO4)3 (PDF#53-0018) with the space group R3c. When VEtOH:H2O = 8:2 in solution, two impurity peaks appeared at ∼8.9° and 16.7° for the NVP/C-5 sample. These results indicated that variance of the ratio of EtOH to H2O would not affect the crystallization of NVP during calcination; however, a too high EtOH content would lead to the appearance of impurities in the product.\nThe content of EtOH in the solvent was thus a key parameter affecting the morphology of the obtained samples. In order to explore this effect, the morphologies of NVP/C composites prepared under different solvent ratios were tested by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a exhibits the SEM image of NVP/C. It can be clearly seen that irregular particles with sizes of about 0.5–3 μm appeared in the NVP/C-0 sample. However, with the increase in the volume ratio VEtOH:H2O of EtOH and water (H2O) in the solvent, a connected pore structure began to appear in the NVP/C composites (Fig. 2b); and the pore-size gradually increased. When VEtOH:H2O = 4:6, the NVP/C-2 sample exhibited an obvious 3D interconnected hierarchical porous structure with the largest pore size and the optimized connectivity (Fig. 2c, Fig. 3a and b). Fig. 3c clearly exhibits the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.37, corresponding to the inter-planar distance of the (021) plane in the NVP crystal. Moreover, a carbon layer with a thickness of nearly 5 nm was coated on the surface of the NVP/C-2 crystal. As the volume ratio continued to increase, the pores in the as-synthesized sample gradually collapsed, resulting in a gradual deterioration of its connectivity (Fig. 2d–f). The elemental composition and distribution of NVP/C-2 were identified by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping. The uniform distribution of Na, V, P, and O indicated that the 3D interconnected hierarchical porous framework was assembled from NVP (Fig. 3d and e). In addition, it can be clearly observed from Fig. 3e that the density of light spots representing N on the NVP/C-2 cathode was significantly lower than that of other elements, indicating that the NVP/C-2 cathode contained a small amount of N element. Quantitative identification of the elemental composition was carried out through EDX analysis. As shown in Fig. S1,† the atomic ratio of the elements was close to the stoichiometric ratio of Na3V2(PO4)3. The carbon content of the NVP/C-2 sample was finally confirmed to be 7.0 wt% by TGA (Fig. S2†).\nThe crystal structure of NVP and the graphitization degree of the carbon-coating layer were further determined by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4a, three peaks could be observed at ∼1000, 1350, and 1590 cm−1 for all the samples, which should be assigned to PO43−, disordered carbon (D-band), and graphitic carbon (G-band), respectively. The relative peak intensity ratios of the D-band and G-band (ID:IG) for all the NVP/C samples were close to 1, implying that the degree of graphitization of the carbon-coating layers was low in all the samples. To quantitatively investigate the effect of the solvent ratio on the pore structure of as-synthesized NVP/C samples, we performed nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. As shown in Fig. S3† and Fig. 4b, when varying the volume ratio of EtOH to H2O (VEtOH:H2O) from 0:10 to 8:2, the specific surface area of the resultant NVP/C samples showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The NVP/C-2; and NVP/C-3 samples delivered I-type N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms that were obviously different from the other samples (Fig. 4b and S3†), indicating that these two samples possessed abundant micropores than the other samples. Its large number of micropores enabled the NVP/C-2 sample to display the biggest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (190.8 m2 g−1) and the smallest average pore size (nearly 3.0 nm) (Table S1†). Such a large surface area can guarantee the efficient diffusion of ions after contacting with the electrolyte. Furthermore, the broad pore-size distribution meant that there were meso-porous and macro-porous structures in the NVP/C-2 sample in addition to micropores (Fig. 4c). This hierarchical micro/meso/macro-porous structure can significantly enhance the structural stability of NVP/C-2. Although a sharp peak was observed at about 3.8 nm in the pore-size distribution diagrams of the other samples, except for NVP/C-2 and NVP/C-3, this peak was considered a ghost peak caused by the connectivity and diversity of the pores according to the characteristics of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and previous reports.\n\n3.2 Identification of chemical states\nXPS was performed to identify the elemental chemical states of the various NVP/C composites. The wide survey spectra (Fig. S5a†) of the as-synthesized NVP/C composites showed five main peaks located at 1069.7, 530.8, 518.5, 282.2, and 132.1 eV, which were assigned to Na 1s, O 1s, V 2p, C 1s, and P 2p, respectively. These results were consistent with the elemental composition of NVP/C, once again confirming the successful synthesis of the target product. Furthermore, the wide survey spectrum of each sample showed one weak peak at ∼401 eV (Fig. S4a†), which should be attributed to N 1s. Moreover, the high-resolution N 1s spectra (Fig. 5d) exhibited a relatively large signal-to-noise ratio, meaning that each sample contained a small amount of nitrogen, which was consistent with the EDX elemental mapping (Fig. 3d). The high-resolution V 2p spectrum (Fig. 5a) of the NVP/C-2 sample could be perfectly fitted with two peaks located at 516.7 and 523.8 eV, which were assigned to V3+ 2p3/2 and V3+ 2p1/2, respectively. This valence state corresponded to the standard valence state of V in NVP. The O 1s spectra could be divided into two peaks, which were assigned to P–O (531 eV) and C–O (532.8 eV) bonds (Fig. 5b). The appearance of C–O bonds was confirmed again by the C 1s spectra (Fig. 5c), and was most likely caused by the carbonization of oxalate. After careful comparison of the shapes, positions, and peak splitting status of the peaks in the high-resolution XPS spectra (Fig. S4 andS5b, c†), it could be found that the six elements (V, P, O, N, C and Na) all had highly similar chemical states in all the synthesized NVP/C samples, which were also consistent with those in NVP.\n\n3.3 Electrochemical performances\nThe electrochemical behaviors of the as-synthesized NVP/C composite cathodes were evaluated by galvanostatic charging–discharging measurement, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. Fig. 6a shows the rate performances of the NVP/C composite cathodes from 0.1 C (1 C = 117 mA g−1) to 10 C. Among all these cathodes, the NVP/C-2 cathode exhibited the best rate performance, with reversible capacities of 119.5, 113.3, 90.3, 84.1, 80.6, 72.9, and 61.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. When the charging–discharging rate returned to 0.1 C, the NVP/C-2 cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 115.7 mA h g−1, indicating that this cathode possessed excellent structural stability. The galvanostatic charging–discharging curve can intuitively reflect the electrochemical reaction during the charging–discharging process. As shown in Fig. 6b, a pair of potential plateaus at 3.4 V could be clearly observed in all the charging–discharging profiles, which could be attributed to the V3+/V4+ redox reaction. In addition, two extra peaks at 3.87 and 3.94 V could also be observed, which should be assigned to the V4+/V5+ redox reaction. Comparing the long cycling performance (Fig. 6c), it was found that the NVP/C-2 cathode exhibited the highest discharge capacity (61.3 mA h g−1) at 10 C, and its capacity retention was 90.2% of the initial capacity after 500 charging–discharging cycles, indicating that the NVP/C-2 cathode possessed excellent structural stability and ionic conductivity. Due to the severe limitation of the electron/ion conductivity by the dense bulk structure in these three samples, only the surface layer of the NVP material in contact with the electrolyte could participate in the electrochemical reaction and contribute only a small amount of capacity to the cell during the high-rate charging–discharging process.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) tests of the as-synthesized six cathode-based batteries were performed to investigate their electrochemical behaviors. All the CV curves showed one pair of redox peaks located at ∼3.4 V (Fig. 6d), which was consistent with the galvanostatic charging–discharging curves (Fig. 6b). Besides, the CV curve of the NVP/C-2 sample showed the sharpest redox peaks and the smallest polarization between these two peaks, indicating that the battery assembled with NVP/C-2 had the optimized electrochemical kinetics.\nEIS is the most effective measurement to deeply understand the differences in sodium-ion-transport kinetics within batteries assembled with different cathode materials. Consequently, EIS was performed here for all the samples. As shown in Fig. 6e, all the EIS curves consisted of two parts: (i) a semicircle in the high-frequency region, which was related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct and RSEI) and double-layer capacitance (Cdl and CSEI) among the electrode, solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) and electrolyte; and (ii) a straight line in the low-frequency region corresponding to Warburg impedance (ZW). An equivalent circuit (see inset of Fig. 6e) was proposed to fit the internal impedance distribution of the battery. Here, Rs represents the electrolyte impedance, which can be measured from the intercept on the X axis. Since all the batteries used the same electrolyte, the Rs of each battery was almost the same. Also, Rct must be considered, which represents the charge-transfer resistance and which can be approximated from the diameter of the semicircles in the plots. It is evident that NVP/C-2 cathode has the lowest Rct among all samples as listed in Table 1, confirming the inferences obtained from the CV test.\nIn order to further investigate the Na+-diffusion behavior, the straight lines located in the low-frequency region of the EIS plots were fitted by Z′ and ω−1/2 (Fig. 6f). The diffusion coefficient of Na+ can be calculated according to the following equations:\nwhere R, T, and F are the gas constant (R = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1), room temperature (T = 298.15 K), and the Faraday constant (96485.4 C mol−1), respectively; A is the area of the cathode (A = 1.13 cm2); n is the number of electrons participating in the charging–discharging reaction (n = 2); C is the concentration of Na+ in the unit cell volume (C = 6.92 × 10−3 mol cm−3); and σ is the Warburg factor. As shown in Table 1, Na+ transfer (DNa+) in NVP/C-2 was significantly higher than that in the other samples, which means that the NVP/C-2 sample had the highest Na+-ion-transport rate.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of 3D interconnected hierarchical porous NVP/C composite cathode\nNVP/C composite cathode materials were synthesized via a facile sol–gel method. V2O5 (99%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation), (NH4)2HPO4 (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), H2C2O4·2H2O (AR, Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd), CH3COONa·2H2O (AR, Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory), and ethanol (AR, Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd) were selected as raw materials without any further purification. We first prepared mixed solutions of ethanol and water in volume ratios of 0:10, 2:8, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4, and 8:2 and named the solutions A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively. Then, V2O5 (1 mmol) and H2C2O4·2H2O (3 mmol) were first dissolved into 100 ml mixed solution C with continuous stirring at 80 °C for 40 min to obtain a transparent blue solution. Afterwards, 3 mmol (NH4)2HPO4, 3 mmol CH3COONa·2H2O, and 0.1 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were added into the above solution, with stirring continuously until a gel was formed. Immediately, this gel was transferred into a blast drying oven and kept at 80 °C until dry; heating at 5 °C min−1 to 350 °C and kept for 5 h under a N2 atmosphere; then heating at 5 °C min−1 to 800 °C and kept for 8 h to obtain the final product, which was marked as NVP/C-2. The products prepared with 100 ml mixed solutions of A, B, D, E, and F were denominated as NVP/C- 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe phase compositions of the obtained samples were identified by X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) (SmartLab 9 kW) with a scan rate of 20° min−1 in the 2θ range from 5° to 80° with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) source. The morphologies of the synthesized samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific FIB-SEM GX4) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Thermo Fisher Talos F200S G2). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to distinguish the elemental composition and distribution of the as-synthesized NVP/C composites. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Escalab Xi+) was used to characterize the elemental chemical states. The contents of carbon in the NVP/C composites were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (TG 550) from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in an air atmosphere. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on a Renishaw in Via Raman microscopy instrument equipped with an Ar+ laser (λ = 532 nm). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore-size distributions of the as-synthesized samples were tested using an automatic surface area analyzer (Micromeritics 3FLEX).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe synthesized NVP/C samples, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and acetylene black in a mass ratio of 8:1:1 were dispersed in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to form a uniform slurry and then coated on aluminum foils. After drying in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 10 h, the coated foil was cut into 12 mm wafers for use as the cathodes. The mass loading was nearly 2.0 mg cm−2. Next, CR2025-type coin batteries were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (Mikrouna). Sodium metal wafer and Whatman glass fiber were used as the counter electrodes and separators, respectively. In addition, 1.0 mol L−1 NaClO4 dissolved in EC:DEC = 1:1 (v/v) with 5% FEC was employed as the electrolyte for these coin batteries. The amount of electrolyte in each cell was nearly 50 μL. Galvanostatic charging/discharging tests were performed on Land BT 2000 battery test systems between 2.3 and 4.3 V at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, frequency range from 10 mHz to 0.1 MHz) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The structure of the prepared samples was studied by XRD. The XRD patterns and the lattice cell parameters obtained using the fitting method of Rietveld are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, respectively. The sample with the initial or nominal composition of Na0.5MnO2 (Fig. 2a) is in a single phase with a tunnel-type structure (space group Pbam). For example, the reflection (1 1 0) at ca. 10.1° is typical of the structure. When a larger amount of sodium is employed in the synthesis, for the compound with nominal composition Na0.6MnO2, the reflections of the impurity phase with the layered-type structure with space group P63/mmc (not shown) were obtained as expected. Nevertheless, according to the results of the Rietveld fitting, the layered impurity contribution is only 5.7%, although this result should be considered carefully because the intensity or the reflections can be affected by preferred orientation of the particles. However, after F-doping the compound with the same starting sodium content, the XRD pattern for Na0.6MnO1.95F0.05 can be fitted by using a single phase with a tunnel-type structure (Fig. 2b). A slight contraction of the unit cell volume is observed in the tunnel-type phase after F-doping, and this can be ascribed to the smaller size of F− than O2−. When a higher amount of fluorine is used in the synthesis, for the nominal composition Na0.6MnO1.9F0.1, in addition to the reflections of the tunnel-type structure, a few reflections with very low intensity emerge, and these new reflections can be indexed in the space group P63/mmc of a layered (P2) phase.\nThus, the reflection (0 0 2) at ca. 16°-2θ is marked with L in Fig. 2c, which is typical of the layered-type phase. The reflections of the layered-type phase are of very low intensity, and this minor phase cannot be refined by the Rietveld method, but can just be fitted by the Le Bail method. Thus, the results for the layered phase of Na0.6MnO1.9F0.1 shown in Table 1 are very tentative, including the quantification of its contribution (ca. 1.5%).\nAccording to the XRF analysis, the Na/Mn ratio is always slightly lower than the ratio used in the reactants (Table 1), due to sodium evaporation. In addition, the presence of NaF in the synthesis reduces the resulting Na/Mn ratio a little more in the final product. One reason for this could be that the melting point of sodium fluoride (993 °C) is lower than the melting point of sodium oxide (1132 °C). We can infer from the XRF and XRD results that NaF has two effects: increasing sodium loss during synthesis and F-doping of the tunnel-type phase. On one side, the reduction of sodium content increases the probability of the formation of pure tunnel-type phases. On the other side, effective F-doping increases the probability of finding impurities. This is the reason that the sample with nominal composition Na0.6Mn1.9O0.9F0.1 possesses a small amount of the layered phase (Fig. 2c) and a smaller Na/Mn ratio compared to the single-phase sample with nominal composition Na0.6Mn1.95O0.95F0.05. In conclusion, the synthesis conditions must be carefully chosen to prepare the best electrode material, because NaF is more easily evaporated reducing both sodium and fluorine content, and F-doping increases the content of the layered-type phase.\nThe particle morphology was examined by SEM. The particles of Na0.5MnO2 have rod-shaped morphologies with a typical width of around 0.4–0.9 μm and a length of several micrometres (Fig. 3a), but also particles with more irregular morphology are observed. For Na0.6MnO1.95F0.05 (Fig. 3b) and Na0.6MnO1.9F0.1 (Fig. 3c), the morphology of the particles is more regular.\n\nFTIR and Raman spectroscopy\nThe main Raman bands observed at around 700–540 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of Mn–O (Fig. 4a). The broadening of the band towards the region between 620 and 540 cm−1 is observed for the F-doped samples, suggesting an increased heterogeneity in the Mn-anion (O/F) bonds. The low-intensity bands at 385–270 cm−1 may be assigned to the bending vibrations of O–Mn–O and Na–O. Since these bands at 385–270 cm−1 are not visible for the F-doped sample, it is concluded that the multianionic sample has a more disordered local structure. The band at around 1076–1078 cm−1 is only observed for the F-doped samples.\nThe FTIR spectra exhibit peaks (Fig. 4b) located between 755 and 555 cm−1, which can be attributed to the stretching mode of Mn–(O/F). The peaks between 540 and 400 cm−1 can be due to the bending mode of (O/F)–Mn–(O/F). A certain tendency to shift to lower wavenumbers after F-doping is observed in the positions of peaks of the bending mode, which is in good agreement with the modification of the bonds between manganese and the anions (oxide and fluoride).\n\nXPS\nXPS is very useful for studying the surface of the electrode materials of post-lithium-ion batteries. The XPS results allow us to study the Na, Mn, O and F atoms on the surface of the samples (Fig. 5), and the results are in good agreement with the F-doping of the tunnel-type phase. The small-intensity peak at ca. 684 eV is ascribed to F 1s, which confirms the presence of fluorine in the doped samples, at least on the particle surface, and in spite of the volatility of sodium fluoride employed in the synthesis. In the O1s core level, the main peak, which is placed at ca. 529.5 eV, is ascribed to oxygen in the framework of the compound, and the other peaks at higher energies are related to F-doping. It is observed that F-doping involves an increase in the contribution of the oxygen component at 533 eV, probably due to the high electronegativity of F bonded to Mn and the inductive effect, and perhaps due also to crystallographic defects. In the region of Mn 2p, for Na0.5MnO4, the coexistence of Mn3+ (major contribution at ca. 642.1 eV for Mn 2p3/2) and Mn4+ (minor contribution at ca. 644 eV for Mn 2p3/2) is observed. For the F-doped samples, besides the contributions due to Mn3+ and Mn4+ bonded to oxygen atoms, another very small component placed at higher binding energies (ca. 647 eV for Mn 2p3/2) was employed for the fitting and can be ascribed to manganese atoms bonded to fluorine (and oxygens) atoms. The higher ionicity of the Mn–F bond shifts the XPS peak of manganese to higher binding energies. These results agree well with the changes observed in the vibrational spectra and a subtle change of the bond energies in the solid and are in good agreement with F-doping in the structure of the tunnel-type phase. Tentatively, F-doping could create a sort of entatic state for easier charge/discharge processes and better sodium (de)intercalation, although this hypothesis should be corroborated with future theoretical studies, for example, by DFT calculations.\n\nElectrochemistry\nWe can study the very interesting effect of F-doping on the electrochemical behaviour. Electrochemistry in the sodium cells of the F-free sample is shown in Fig. 6. The capacity of Na0.5MnO2 at 10 mA g−1 is ca. 70 mA h g−1 in the first few cycles. At higher current density and after further cycling, the capacity is very low. After F-doping, a substantial increase in capacity is observed even at high current intensity (Fig. 7 and 8). The charge compensation mechanism, which is induced by replacing some O2− ions with F−, and a higher Na/Mn ratio, increases the experimental charge capacity for F-doped samples.\nTheoretically, the partial substitution of O by F can reduce slightly the average oxidation state of Mn from +3.56 in Na0.44MnO2 to +3.46 in Na0.44MnO1.9F0.1. After removing all the sodium atoms, the average oxidation state of Mn in MnO1.9F0.1 is +3.9, instead of +4.0 in MnO2. The initial OCV is 2.87 V. The voltage curve is indicative of multitransition processes. The capacity of the first charge is 77 mA h g−1 (Fig. 7), which corresponds to the removal of 0.38 Na. For Na0.6MnO1.9F0.1 (Fig. 8), the capacity of the first discharge down to 2.46 V is ca. 123 mA h g−1, which corresponds to the intercalation of 0.6 Na. The cell polarization is very low, compared to the F-free Na0.5MnO2 single phase. Regarding the reversibility and reversible capacity, we can conclude that even the three types of sodium (Na1, Na2 and Na3) are reversibly extracted and inserted at low current intensity. The experimental capacity of the first charge exceeds the capacity for removing 0.22 Na from Na0.44MnO2, and this result is also related to the fact that the sodium content in NaxMnO2−xFx is higher than x = 0.44, which is in good agreement with the XRF analysis. In conclusion, F-doping allows the removal of a higher amount of sodium in the first charge and provides higher reversible capacity in the successive cycles.\nThe typical voltage plateaus or pseudoplateaus are observed in the voltage–capacity plots of all the three materials (Fig. 6a, 7a and 8a), indicating the biphasic transitions during sodium (de)insertion. These pseudoplateaus can be more clearly discerned as peaks in the corresponding derivative plots (Fig. 9), which are placed at 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 V in the charge process. This multitransition is a complex process. The optimized (F-doped) samples exhibit longer pseudoplateaus in the voltage curves, and more intense peaks and less hysteresis in the derivative plots, suggesting an easier reduction of manganese and/or a better sodium diffusion.\nIn addition, the prolonged cycling was tested at a very high rate (500 mA g−1 current intensity). In Fig. 10, it is observed that the F-doped samples deliver higher capacities (40–45 mA h g−1) than F-free oxide samples (10–17 mA h g−1). This result suggests a more rapid diffusion of sodium in the fluorinated samples. Since Na0.6MnO1.95F0.05 is a single phase and the layered phase is a very minor impurity in Na0.6MnO1.9F0.1, the improvement of the electrochemistry cannot be due to any impurity or heterogeneity, and it must be ascribed to the optimization of the tunnel-phase compound, particularly after F-doping.\nIn order to shed more light on the improved electrochemistry, the diffusion coefficient of sodium (DNa+) in the framework of NaxMnO2−yFy was calculated from the relaxation curves obtained from the results of the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) by using the following equation:\nFor Na0.5MnO2, the values are between 10−10 and 3.7 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 in the first charge, depending on the cell voltage, and between 3.3 × 10−10 and 10−11 cm2 s−1 during the first discharge (Fig. 11). For Na0.6MnO1.95F0.05, the diffusion coefficient values are higher. These results clearly indicate that the optimization of the composition accelerates sodium diffusion, and future studies could shed light on revealing more details about this effect.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results\nThe main challenge presented in this work was to obtain the unprecedented tri-component materials directly processed as transparent films, and to demonstrate their efficiency as electrodes in aqueous SIBs. Beyond describing a nanoarchitected material that had never been reported before, this work also demonstrates the potential and broadness of the LLIR to achieve these sophisticated materials in different nanoarchitectures, which will result in different properties, as will be demonstrated in the following.\nNine different films have been prepared, consisting of three control samples (MoS2, rGO, and rGO/CuxO), along with six nanocomposites generated through three different approaches. The first strategy involved producing the films separately and subsequently depositing the most conductive film (rGO or rGO/CuxO) onto the substrate, followed by the deposition of the MoS2 film above the previous one, in a layer-by-layer (LbL) method (samples rGO/MoS2-LbL and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL). The second method involved the preparation of each individual film at a liquid–liquid interface, followed by the combination (mixing) of those films at the liquid–liquid interface before deposition over the substrates, resulting in the samples rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing. Finally, the third method involved the chemical synthesis of the rGO/CuxO in-situ at the liquid–liquid interface in the presence of a MoS2 dispersion in a one-step approach, resulting in the rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ films.\nDigital photographs of the films deposited over planar quartz substrates are shown in Fig. 2a. The high homogeneity, transparency, and optical quality of the films are evident. The MoS2 film has a characteristic orange-yellowish hue, while the rGO and rGO/CuxO films appear gray. Due to the multilayer deposition method, darker films were obtained for the layer-by-layer films, compared to the those synthesized using the mixing and in situ strategies.\nFig. 2b and Fig. S1a (ESI†) present the UV-Vis spectra of the samples deposited over planar quartz substrates. The main absorption bands are detailed in Table S1 (ESI†). The MoS2 spectrum (Fig. S1a, ESI†) presents the characteristic A and B bands at 673 nm and 621 nm, respectively, due to excitonic transitions in the valence band related to excitons at point K of the Brillouin zone, and the bands C and D at 453 nm and 392 nm due to the excitonic transitions from the valence to the conduction band of the semiconductor. The spectrum of rGO/CuxO (Fig. S1a, ESI†) shows a single band at 270 nm attributed to the π–π* transition in graphene, confirming the reduction of GO to rGO in this sample. This band is also observed in the rGO sample at 259 nm. It is well known that the energy of the π–π* transition in rGO samples is dependent on the effectiveness of the GO to rGO reduction (which is directly related to the sp2 backbone restoration), and occurs at lower energy for the most-reduced samples. The occurrence of this band at 259 nm for rGO and 270 nm for rGO/CuxO indicates that the GO to rGO reduction was more effective in the rGO/CuxO sample compared to in the neat rGO. Furthermore, another band at 305 nm can be seen in the neat rGO spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†) due to the n–π* transitions involving residual oxygenated functional groups that were not fully removed during the reaction, which provides further evidence that the GO to rGO reduction was not as effective in the neat rGO reaction as in the rGO/CuxO one. Taking into account the fact that the amounts of GO and NaBH4 are exactly the same in both reactions, as well as the fact that the reducing agent was shared with the Cu2+ cations during the synthesis of rGO/CuxO (meaning less reducing agent available to GO), we would expect the opposite. This apparent paradox can be explained by considering that the nascent CuxO nanoparticles catalyze the GO to rGO reduction, promoting more-reduced rGO after 30 min of reaction. The difference in the energy of the UV-Vis band was not observed for the same reactions conducted for 24 h (data not shown), corroborating this hypothesis. No bands due to the CuxO nanoparticles were detected in the rGO/CuxO spectrum.\nThe spectra of the nanocomposites (Fig. 2b) show all the MoS2 and graphene bands described earlier, corroborating the presence of both components in the samples. Some shifts in the MoS2 bands were observed in the spectra of the in situ synthesized samples (Table S1, ESI†), mainly in the band-gap-related C and D bands, which may be indicative of changes in the electronic structure of MoS2 due to the interactions among the components.\nThe Raman spectra of the films are presented in Fig. 2c and Fig. S1b, S2 (ESI†), and a summary of the main features is presented in Table S2 (ESI†). The MoS2 film (Fig. S1b, ESI†) presents two characteristic bands at 384 and 412 cm−1 due to the E12g and A1g modes, respectively. The graphene bands are readily observable in the rGO and rGO/CuxO samples: the G band at 1588 cm−1 (due to the E2g mode); the D band at 1352 cm−1 (resulting from a symmetry break due to structural defects or partially disordered graphitic domains); the D′ band at 1620 cm−1 (also due to disorder or defects in the structure, usually observed in well-reduced rGO samples in which the sp2 structure was efficiently rebuilt after the reduction process); the 2D band at 2683 cm−1 (attributed to the structural organization of graphene in the two-dimensional plane); and the D + G band at 2940 cm−1 (a combinatory mode). Comparing the rGO and rGO/CuxO spectra, there is a slight shift in the band positions (Table S2, ESI†), the bands are narrower in the rGO/CuxO spectrum, and the D′ band does not appear in the rGO spectrum. All these features are spectral evidence that the rGO is more reduced in the rGO/CuxO than in the rGO films, corroborating the data obtained from UV-Vis spectroscopy.\nAll the MoS2 and graphene bands discussed earlier can be found in the spectra of the nanocomposites presented in Fig. 2c and Fig. S2 (ESI†), including the evidence for more-reduced rGO in the samples containing the CuxO nanoparticles. The ratio between the intensities of the D and G band (the ID/IG ratio) was calculated (Table S2, ESI†), and a significant increase in ID/IG was observed for all the CuxO-containing materials, as expected for more effectively reduced rGO. The chemical interactions among the components can also be responsible for the increase in the ID/IG ratio observed for the nanocomposite samples.\nFig. S3a (ESI†) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the thin films. MoS2 and all the MoS2-containing films present an intense peak due to the (002) planes of 2H-MoS2 at 6.15 Å (JCPDS 37–1492), which is enlarged in comparison to that of bulk MoS2, evidencing the presence of few-layer MoS2. The other two less-intense peaks of MoS2 expected to be seen in this range (specifically, the (100) and (103) peaks) are not observable in the patterns presented in Fig. S3a (ESI†) due to the specificity of the MoS2 sample used in this work (characterized as few-layer, polycrystalline and exhibiting a small grain size of 64 nm × 42 nm) and due to the data being collected directly from the thin films using a grazing angle accessory. A large and low-intensity signal at 3.85 Å can be seen in the profile of the rGO and rGO/CuxO films due to the irregular stacking of the rGO sheets as a result of their re-organization in the solid state after the reduction process. The copper oxide nanoparticle signal appears between 25 and 45° (in 2θ). An expanded view of this region can be seen in Fig. S3b (ESI†), demonstrating that the samples are constituted of a mixture of CuO and Cu2O.\nIn order to identify the nature of the copper oxide produced in the rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ tri-component sample, several syntheses were carried out, and the film was collected from the liquid–liquid interface with the aim of accumulating material to acquire a conventional X-ray diffractogram profile. The result is shown in Fig. S3c (ESI†); the material is characterized by the presence of the (002) peak of MoS2 at d = 6.15 Å (JCPDS 37–1492); the broader and poorly defined (002) peak of the rGO at 3.97 Å; three peaks attributed to Cu2O at 3.01 Å (110), 2.46 Å (111) and 2.13 Å (200) (JCPDS 74-1230); and four peaks due to CuO at 2.75 Å (110), 2.52 Å (111), 2.32 Å (200) and 1.87 Å (202) (JCPDS 72-0629). It is interesting to note that although the rGO/CuxO and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ samples were prepared in exactly the same way (except, of course, that the latter was prepared in the presence of dispersed MoS2), the former has predominantly CuO and the latter a mixture of Cu2O (predominant) and CuO. These findings suggest that MoS2 is not just a spectator during the synthetic procedure, and someway affects the reaction pathway.\nFig. 3a–i (and Fig. S4–S8, ESI†) show the scanning electron microscopy images of the films. The MoS2 thin film (Fig. 3a and Fig. S4a–c, ESI†) is composed of a continuous network of small platelets (average size of 64 nm × 42 nm), while rGO (Fig. 3b and Fig. S4d–f, ESI†) consists of large interconnected graphene sheets (∼1 μm × 500 nm) with clear edges and folds. Notably, this rGO morphology can also be seen in the sample rGO/CuxO (Fig. 3c and Fig. S4g–i, ESI†), together with cubic-shaped CuxO nanoparticles (average lateral size of 120 nm) distributed over, between and wrapped by the graphene sheets. These three morphological profiles appear on different nanoarchitectures in the bi- and tri-component nanocomposite films: (i) in both rGO/MoS2-LbL (Fig. 3d and Fig. S5a–c, ESI†) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL (Fig. 3g and Fig. S5d–f, ESI†), the morphology observed is consistent with films that have been sequentially deposited, one on top of another, in which the morphology of individual films can be detected; (ii) in contrast to the –LbL samples, both the rGO/MoS2-mixing (Fig. 3e and Fig. S6a–c, ESI†) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing (Fig. 3h and S6d–e) films exhibit closer interaction among the components. The MoS2 plates are sandwiched between graphene sheets, creating a more intimate contact between the materials; (iii) a similar nanoarchitecture was observed in both the rGO/MoS2-in situ (Fig. 3f and Fig. S7a–c, ESI†) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (Fig. 3i and Fig. S7d–f, ESI†) films, which were characterized by very close and intimate contact among the three components, but the CuxO NPs were larger in size (approximately ∼200 nm), demonstrating that the presence of MoS2 during the synthesis also affects the final particle size. Images using a backscattered electron (BSE) detector were collected for the rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ sample (Fig. S8, ESI†). In the BSE images, the regions containing heavy elements (high Z values) appear brighter, facilitating the identification of the large amount and good distribution of copper oxide nanoparticles and MoS2 nanoplatelets.\nEnergy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. 3j–p and Fig. S9, ESI†) provided information on the elemental composition of the materials. The survey spectra of all the nanocomposite films (Fig. S9, ESI†) show the presence of C, Mo, and S (the Si signal is from the substrate). In addition, Cu and O were also detected in the samples containing CuxO nanoparticles, as expected. Fig. 3j–l present the spatially resolved spectra, and Fig. 3m–p show the elemental mapping obtained for the rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ sample. Analysis of these data revealed that the cubic particles of this sample are composed of Cu2O/CuO, as shown by the intense Cu and O signals in the point analysis spectra of these cubes (Fig. 3l) and by the Cu mapping (Fig. 3n). The MoS2 plates were found to be homogeneously distributed throughout the sample (Fig. 3o).\nFig. 4 and Fig. S10–S16 (ESI†) show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images collected for the samples rGO, MoS2, rGO/CuxO, rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ. Graphene (Fig. S10, ESI†) has large, flat sheets with small layers, as well as some characteristic folds. On the other hand, MoS2 (Fig. S11, ESI†) presents a very small two-dimensional plate (64 nm × 42 nm, as previously shown by SEM), structure with the stacking of a few layers (3 to 10 layers, Fig. S12, ESI†). The rGO/MoS2-in situ sample (Fig. 4a–b and Fig. S13, ESI†) has MoS2 plates homogeneously distributed across large graphene sheets. The rGO/CuxO (Fig. 4c–f and Fig. S14, ESI†) sample, in addition to the cubic morphology seen via SEM in regions with large amounts of particles, also shows very small (∼10 nm) and mostly spherical particles distributed throughout the graphene sheets. The presence of CuO (with a crystallographic plane d200 = 0.32 nm) and Cu2O (with a crystallographic plane d111 = 0.24 nm) in rGO/CuxO was confirmed through high-resolution images and FFT (fast Fourier transform) analysis, as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). EDS analysis obtained using STEM (Fig. 4g–j) of the rGO/CuxO sample show Cu and O on the darker and geometric-shape particles in Fig. 4g, again corroborating the CuxO composition of those nanoparticles, and a homogeneous distribution of C matching the graphene-like morphology.\nThe TEM and HRTEM images of the sample rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (Fig. 5 and Fig. S16, ESI†) reveal details regarding the nanoarchitected way in which the three components are organized. As can be seen, the film is supported by interconnected graphene sheets on which the MoS2 and the CuxO NPs are homogeneously distributed (Fig. 5a, b and Fig. S16, ESI†). Looking closer, as in the two different regions illustrated in Fig. 5c and d, it can be noted that the three components are in very intimate contact with no segregation or predominance of individual components. This finding highlights the hypothesis that graphene and MoS2 can act as nucleation and growth sites for the CuxO nanoparticles. Looking even closer (Fig. 5e and f), it can be seen that in addition to the cubic-shaped ones, the sample is full of very small CuxO nanoparticles (1 to 10 nm) spread over the entire film. Fig. 5f elucidates the intimate contact between these small CuxO nanoparticles, the MoS2 (the fringes of the few-layer MoS2 can be detected mixed with the CuxO NPs) and the graphene.\nThe EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 5h–j) of the region shown in Fig. 5g clearly shows the distribution of the elements and corroborates the identification of each component in the film.\nThe electrochemical performance of the nanocomposites deposited over ITO/glass was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge curves (GCD), an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), carried out in NaCl aqueous solution as electrolyte. Fig. 6 shows the CVs of the nanocomposites and the control samples at 5 mV s−1 within the potential range of −0.2 V to 0.4 V in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl. Fig. S17 (ESI†) shows the CV data at different scan speeds (5 to 50 mV s−1). Pseudo-capacitive behavior was observed in the MoS2 thin-film (Fig. 6a), with a redox pair at an E1/2 of 0.14 V. Two mechanisms are predicted in the literature to explain this profile: the first one describes the pseudo-capacitive behavior from the faradaic process in which Na+ ions are intercalated into the lamellar structure of MoS2 (eqn (1)), and the second one is related to the non-faradaic process due to the formation of an electrical double layer due to the adsorption of cations onto the MoS2 surface.\nThe CV profile of rGO is typical of a capacitive material related to the occurrence of an electric double-layer, as can be seen in Fig. 6b. The nanocomposites between rGO and MoS2 exhibit similar behavior, showing a faradaic process at E1/2 = 0.1 V (attributed to MoS2) and a rectangular profile coherent with the rGO. The faradaic process is more defined in the CV curve of rGO/MoS2-mixing and occurs at lower potential than in the other samples (E1/2 = 0.06 V) due to the improved contact between the two components, as described earlier.\nThe cyclic voltammogram of rGO/CuxO exhibits two well-defined redox pairs, a predominant one at E1/2 = 0.19 V (0.26 V/0.12 V), corresponding to the Cu+/Cu2+ process, and a less-intense one at 0.16 V/−0.05 V, attributed to the Cu+/Cu2+ oxidation pair of small copper oxide nanoparticles with different species/sizes/shapes in the film. As previously described, this sample contains two species of copper oxide, with CuO being present in greater quantity and Cu2O in smaller quantity. These species have different sizes and shapes that are consistent with the processes observed in the film. Furthermore, CV experiments were conducted on rGO/CuxO in different electrolytes (aqueous solutions of NaCl, NaNO3, and Na2SO4), and the CV profile obtained in NaNO3 (Fig. S18, ESI†) indicates several well-defined oxidation processes that are consistent with the presence of Cu2O/CuO nanoparticles. Literature reports of these materials mainly focus on organic electrolytes that are not within our working range. Other systems have been studied in alkaline aqueous electrolytes, and, although the processes may be slightly different, they occur in the same potential range as our work, and these studies have previously demonstrated the Cu+/Cu2+ process in this range.\nThe tri-component materials present significant differences in their CV profiles due to the different ways in which they are nanoarchitected. The rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL sample shows an oxidation process at 0.07 V attributed to MoS2 and another redox pair at 0.2 V/0.09 V attributed to Cu+/Cu2+ processes; the rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing film exhibits a single redox process at E1/2 = 0.11 V (0.17 V/0.05 V), which has a profile similar to that of the rGO/MoS2-mixing control sample. This process is attributed to the combined processes of both materials (MoS2/CuxO) due to their close contact, as discussed earlier. The rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ sample exhibits two processes: a redox pair at 0.17 V/−0.06 V and another at 0.23 V/0.08 V. These processes are comparable to those observed in the rGO/CuxO control sample and can be attributed to the Cu+/Cu2+ redox process, although the profiles are shifted in comparison to the rGO/CuxO control sample due to the larger amount of Cu2O relative to CuO in this sample. Also, the redox process attributed to MoS2 (eqn (1)) at the same potential should contribute to the observed intensity of the redox pair. The oxidation process becomes noticeably broader as the scanning speed of the cyclic voltammograms increases (Fig. S17I, ESI†), indicating the occurrence of two processes in the same region, possibly originating from CuxO nanoparticles and MoS2.\nFig. S19 (ESI†) displays the Nyquist plots derived from the EIS data of all the nanocomposite films. The rGO film closely resembles an ideal capacitor according to its curve profile and CV measurements; when the system kinetics are straightforward, current limitation occurs due to mass transfer phenomena, resulting in a more-linear and less-distinct semicircular region that corresponds to the sodium diffusion process within the electrode. In contrast, the neat MoS2 is characterized by an evident semi-circle at high frequency, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance, indicating that the electrochemical process is governed by charge transfer phenomena between the active material and the electrolyte. The diameter of the semi-circle is directly proportional to the charge transfer resistance and inversely proportional to the rate of heterogeneous charge transfer. The incorporation of CuxO NPs or MoS2 into graphene to give the bi-component material leads to the appearance of the semi-circle in the high-frequency region, and the tri-component materials exhibit smaller semi-circle diameter. Notably, the rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ film possesses the lowest charge transfer resistance, which implies enhanced conductivity. This is consistent with the superior specific capacity results of these samples, as will be discussed further.\nThe electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) is a convenient tool for monitoring mass changes during the electrochemical evaluation of electrode materials. It provides direct information that allows the understanding of various surface processes related to sensors, capacitors, batteries, and other electrochemical devices.Fig. 7 and Fig. S20 (ESI†) show the CV profiles recorded in NaCl 0.1 mol L−1 and the respective EQCM frequency responses recorded simultaneously for the samples MoS2, rGO/CuxO and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ deposited on a gold/quartz electrode. The slight variations observed in the voltametric behavior of these films compared to those presented earlier are due to the working electrode utilized (films deposited over gold/quartz) as well as to the wider potential range selected, which was determined by EQCM stabilization (a feat that was unattainable within a smaller range). In Fig. 7a, the CV obtained for MoS2 reveals two redox pairs with E1/2 values of −0.24 V and 0.25 V, respectively, which are ascribed to the pseudocapacitive processes discussed earlier. Thomas et al. presented the electrodeposition technique for obtaining MoS2 using EQCM under different working conditions than those used in this study, but observed a similar electrochemical profile. As shown in the EQCM results for MoS2 (Fig. 7a), a slight increase in mass occurs near a potential of 0.2 V (1) during the reduction process, followed by a significant increase starting at −0.3 V (2). During oxidation, the mass begins to decrease at around −0.3 V (3), and another drop is observed at 0.2 V (4). The suggested mechanism, which is schematically represented in eqn (1), is based on Na+ cation intercalation during the reduction of the electrode material, which involves the filling of the electrode with cations, leading to a mass increase. Conversely, cation deintercalation occurs during the oxidation process when Na+ cations are removed from the electrode material, resulting in a decrease in mass. This is exactly what can be seen in Fig. 7a for the MoS2 film: the mass variations happen in the same region as the charge changes (redox processes), suggesting an intercalation/deintercalation process within the material. Notably, the deintercalation at 0.2 V (4) is in close proximity to the discharge potential, as discussed in the subsequent GCD analyses.\nIn both the rGO/CuxO (Fig. 7b) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (Fig. 7c) samples, there is a similar mass change profile with a steady mass increase starting at 0.0 V (1) and continuing up to −0.4 V for rGO/CuxO and up to −1.0 V for rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (2). In fact, the mass change profile of the tri-component material appears to be a mixture between the profiles of MoS2 (Fig. 7a) and rGO/CuxO (Fig. 7b), indicating the contribution of all the materials through the entire process. During oxidation, the mass starts to decrease near −0.3 V (3) and remains constant up to −0.2 V for rGO/CuxO and 0.6 V for rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (4). Furthermore, the differences in mass obtained during the CV cycles reveal increases in mass of 8.1, 11.3 and 13.5% for the rGO/CuxO, MoS2 and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ films, respectively, indicating that the ternary film has the greatest intercalation capacity for Na+ ions, corroborating the EIS data discussed earlier and supporting the performance of this material as electrodes, as will be discussed next.\nThe performance of the nanoarchitected thin films as anodes for aqueous sodium-ion batteries was analyzed based on the CV profiles of each sample. GCD curves were obtained in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaCl in the potential window between −0.2 and 0.4 V (Fig. 8). Currents of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 A g−1 (Fig. S21, ESI†) were applied, and the specific capacities (SC) were calculated (Table 1). Fig. 8a and b displays the GCD profile of the materials operating at a current of 0.1 A g−1. The GCD curves exhibit a plateau between 0.1 to 0.2 V, indicating the intercalation of Na+ in the thin films, as previously shown in the CV curves (Fig. 6) and EQCM measurements (Fig. 7). Fig. 8c and d show the variation of the specific capacity according the number of CD cycles, demonstrating the decrease in the storage capacity of the materials as the current density increases, which is the expected profile for batteries due to the internal resistance of the materials, which limits the speed at which cations can migrate in and out of the structure.\nThe MoS2 film exhibited an impressive SC value (551 mA h g−1) that was significantly higher than the values obtained for this same film in KCl aqueous solution (276 mA h g−1), suggesting that hydrated Na+ is more easily intercalated than hydrated K+. This high capacity was not retained in the rGO-based MoS2 binary composites, in which the SC values were 280 mA h g−1 (rGO/MoS2-LbL), 238 mA h g−1 (rGO/MoS2-mixing) and 206 mA h g−1 (rGO/MoS2-in situ). The SC for the pristine rGO film was not determined, as it does not exhibit a redox process. The copper-oxide-nanoparticle–based materials, however, present impressive electrochemical performance, with rGO/CuxO having an SC value of 620 mA h g−1. In addition to the redox process attributed to copper oxide NPs, this result is also explained by the presence of the more-conductive rGO in this sample (due to the more effective reduction of GO to rGO, as discussed earlier), which is expected to improve the electrical double layer. Regarding the nanoarchitected tri-component structures, the findings are particularly noteworthy: (i) rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL presents an SC of 1321 mA h g−1, which represents a 240%, 213% and 472% increase compared to those of MoS2, rGO/CuxO and rGO/MoS2-LbL, respectively; (ii) rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing presents an SC of 1056 mA h g−1, which is 192%, 170% and 444% higher than those of MoS2, rGO/CuxO and rGO/MoS2-mixing, respectively; (iii) rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ presents an impressive SC of 1377 mA h g−1, which represents a 250%, 222% and 668% increase compared to those of MoS2 rGO/CuxO and rGO/MoS2-in situ respectively. These data are summarized in Table 1.\nFig. 8e presents the specific capacity measured during 200 charge/discharge cycles at 2 A g−1. The MoS2 film exhibits instability during the first 50 cycles, which can be attributed to the volume change and structural breakage that occurs in this material during the GCD processes. When MoS2 is combined with rGO or rGO/CuxO, greater stability is observed during cycling. In the films generated using rGO/CuxO, a negligible loss of stability is observed in the initial 10 cycles, which can be ascribed to the adjustment of the CuO/MoS2 in the structure during the process of Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation. The only film that exhibits a high loss of stability during cycling is the rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL film, in which the contact among the components is not as close as in the other films. The coulombic efficiency of the materials, as determined from 200 charge/discharge cycles (as presented in Fig. 8f and Table 1), ranges between 70% and 90%. The rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL film is an exception, showing low stability as previously discussed. The performance of the rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ thin film was followed over 1000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles at elevated current (Fig.S22, ESI†), and it demonstrated a stability of 50%.\nThe SC values of the tri-component films obtained in this study are comparable to the remarkable values reported in the literature. These results are attributed to several factors: (i) the high charge storage capacity of the three materials used in this study; (ii) the improved conductivity achieved through the use of reduced and better-structured graphene; (iii) the formation of nanocomposites that prevent the restacking of 2D materials and accommodate the volume changes of the MoS2 and CuxO nanoparticles; (iv) the employment of nanoarchitected structures that possess high surface area and homogeneity; (v) the intrinsic characteristics of each of the tri-component structures obtained in the samples, e.g., the small flakes of the few-layer MoS2, the coexistence of Cu2O/CuO, and the very small CuxO nanoparticles dispersed through the entire sample; and (vi) the synergistic effect among the three components due to the intimate contact among them, which is directly dependent on the preparation method. In the best sample, rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ, each of the three components is in intimate contact as a result of the nanoarchitected way in which they are structured. The graphene sheets contribute to the overall performance, allowing cation adsorption and playing a crucial role in enhancing the conductivity (as observed by EIS) and the resistance to mechanical stress of both MoS2 and CuxO NPs during cycling. The insertion of Na+ into the electrode occurs through the interaction with the three components, while the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene facilitates efficient charge transfer during the intercalation process, contributing to the overall performance and stability of the electrode.\nTable 2 presents a summarized comparison between the results reported in this work with those using different MoS2/graphene composites and some ternary combinations (MoS2/graphene/other) applied to energy storage. The full table is available in the ESI† (Table S3). It can be noted that the majority of the data presented in the literature is based on LIBs and organic electrolytes, which makes our results for SIBs in aqueous electrolyte even more impressive. Finally, it is important to point out that this is the first report of a ternary material comprising rGO, MoS2 and CuxO nanoparticles prepared as a thin and transparent film. Similar ternary combinations have been reported only in two very recent papers by Selvamani et al. (2020) and (2021), which were prepared as powders for alkaline supercapacitor applications.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Chemicals\nAmmonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Vetec), ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S, solution 20%, Vetec), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%, Anidrol), acetonitrile (gradient grade for liquid chromatography, 99.9% LiChrosolv, Merck), graphite (90%, Graflake, Nacional de Grafite), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, synth, 99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37% Panreac), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Vetec), hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (H2O2, 30%, Vetec), toluene (99.9% Sigma Aldrich or 99% Neon), copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2, Vetec), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%, Acros Organic), and sodium chloride (NaCl, Neon) were used as received. The solutions and dispersions were prepared with deionized water using a Milli-Q ultra-pure water purification system with R = 18.2 MΩ cm.\n\n2.2. Synthesis, exfoliation and film preparation of MoS2\nMoS2 was synthesized and exfoliated according our previous report. The thin films of neat MoS2 were prepared through the LLIR according the procedure summarized in Fig. 1a: 5 mL of an acetonitrile dispersion of MoS2 (0.14 mg mL−1) was added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and maintained under magnetic stirring at 2500 rpm. Then, 20 mL of ultrapure water and 20 mL of toluene were added to the system, and the resulting biphasic system was magnetically stirred for 12 h. After interruption of the stirring, a homogeneous, continuous and self-assembled film of MoS2 was obtained at the liquid–liquid interface. The film was transferred to a glass Becker containing the substrate (glass, quartz, Si, FTO/glass electrodes) at the bottom and deposited by pulling the substrates across the liquid/liquid interface. The film was dried at 200 °C for 4 h before characterization.\n\n2.3. Preparation of the graphene/CuxO nanoparticles thin films\nThe graphene/copper oxide nanoparticles thin films were prepared according a methodology previously reported by us, as summarized in Fig. 1b. The method involves the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu2+ in a water/toluene biphasic system in air. GO was prepared using a modified Hummers’ method. Then, 8 mL of a 0.3 mg mL−1 Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution, 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1) and 18 mL of water were mixed in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in a total volume of 30 mL for the aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to the flask to obtain the liquid–liquid interface. The entire system was stirred for two hours at 1500 rpm. After this time, 3 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution (40 mg mL−1) were added under stirring, and the reaction was performed for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the stirring was turned off, and a dark gray thin film was observed at the liquid–liquid interface, which was characterized by reduced graphene oxide/CuxO nanoparticles (hereafter referred as rGO/CuxO thin film). The aqueous phase was exchanged for fresh ultra-pure water (by removing the aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette and adding a novel portion of 30 mL of water), and the system was stirred for a few minutes. This procedure was done to remove any soluble impurities remaining in the system, and it was repeated 10 times. Subsequently, the same procedure was carried out with toluene. As a control, the same procedure was also performed without copper nitrate, aiming for the preparation of a neat rGO film. Both films were deposited over suitable substrates as described earlier in Section 2.2.\n\n2.4. Thin films of nanocomposites comprising rGO, CuxO nanoparticles and MoS2\nStarting from the LLIR, three different approaches were adopted to prepare the tri-component films, as described in the following sections and schematically represented in Fig. 1c, d and e. The strategies will be referred to here as the layer-by-layer (Fig. 1c), mixing (Fig. 1d) and in situ synthesized (Fig. 1e) strategies.\n2.4.1. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by the layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy. This is the simplest approach, in which the previously prepared rGO/CuxO and MoS2 films at the water–toluene interface were sequentially deposited over the substrates in a layer-by-layer-like process (Fig. 1c). A film of rGO/CuxO prepared exactly as described earlier (Section 2.3) was deposited over suitable substrates and dried at 200 °C for 4 hours. Subsequently, a film of MoS2 prepared as described in the Section 2.1 was deposited over this rGO/CuxO film, followed by another drying process at 200 °C for 4 hours. For comparison, the same procedure was carried out to produce a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film (by depositing a MoS2 film over a previously deposited rGO one). The films obtained in this way will be referred to here with the suffix – LbL (from layer-by-layer): rGO/MoS2-LbL and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL.\n2.4.2. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by film mixing. The second approach was based on a mixture of two films that were already stabilized at liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 1d). Each film was individually prepared (MoS2 and rGO/CuxO, prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and kept at the water–toluene interface. Afterwards, 10 mL of the toluene and 15 mL of the water of each water/film/toluene system were removed using a pipette. The toluene/MoS2-film/water system was magnetically stirred at 2500 rpm, and the toluene/rGO-CuxO-film/water system was added over it. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 12 hours, and after this, the film at the liquid–liquid interface was transferred to substrates and dried according to the procedure described earlier. A control sample starting from a neat rGO film (instead of a GO/CuxO film) was also prepared. The films will be referred to here with the suffix –mixing: rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing.\n2.4.3. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite chemically synthesized in situ. The last nanocomposite was chemically synthesized in situ, directly at the liquid–liquid interface, by performing the same reaction described in Section 2.3 to produce the rGO/CuxO films, but with MoS2 dispersed in one of the liquid phases (Fig. 1e). First, 8 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (0.3 mg mL−1) was mixed with 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1), 7 mL of a 0.14 mg mL−1 acetonitrile solution of MoS2 and 11 mL of water in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in 30 mL of aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to create the liquid–liquid interface, and this system was kept under magnetic stirring for two hours at 1500 rpm. After that time, 3 mL of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (40 mg mL−1) was added with a syringe. After 30 minutes, the stirring was interrupted, and a grey film was observed at the interface between the two liquids. The cleaning process and deposition over substrates were carried out as described earlier. A film synthesized in the same way but without Cu(NO)3 was prepared, aiming to obtain a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film. The films will be referred to here with the suffix – in situ: rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ.\n\n2.5. Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a thin-film accessory. Raman spectra were acquired using a confocal Raman spectrometer (WITec Alpha 300R) with a 532 nm laser line at 0.9 mW of power, with 30 accumulations of 10 s of acquisition time. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer directly on the films deposited on quartz substrates, using air as a reference. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Mira FEG-SEM (Tescan) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV coupled to an EDS detector (Oxford Instruments) for elemental analysis. For the transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images, the films were deposited over copper grids covered with a hollow carbon thin film, and the images were collected using a JEOL 120 kV instrument at 100 kV. High-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JEM F200 device with a resolution of 0.1 nm, and the EDS-type elemental chemical analysis was obtained using an SDD detector with an area of 100 mm2 in a scanning mode (STEM). Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab potentiostat operated via GPES and NOVA 1.11 software, using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode and the thin films deposited over ITO as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from −0.2 V to 0.4 V at different scan rates (5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1) in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl. The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were performed using NaCl aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte in the range of −0.2 V to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at five current densities (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 A g−1), and evaluation of the materials for 200 or 1000 consecutive cycles was performed at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cyclic voltammograms were integrated to obtain the approximate electroactive mass of the components in each film: MoS2 (9.35 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO (3.41 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-LbL (5.19 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL (2.89 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-mixing (5.07 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing (1.58 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-in situ (5.39 × 10−8 g cm−2) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (2.06 × 10−7 g cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous NaCl solution at −0.1 V with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency of 10 MHz to 10 kHz. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed using an Autolab 128n in EQCM mode and the software nova 2.15, with a gold circular electrode (3 mm radius) coupled to a quartz crystal, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode, in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaCl in the range of −1.0 to 0.6 V at 10 mV s−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Chemicals\nAmmonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Vetec), ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S, solution 20%, Vetec), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%, Anidrol), acetonitrile (gradient grade for liquid chromatography, 99.9% LiChrosolv, Merck), graphite (90%, Graflake, Nacional de Grafite), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, synth, 99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37% Panreac), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Vetec), hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (H2O2, 30%, Vetec), toluene (99.9% Sigma Aldrich or 99% Neon), copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2, Vetec), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%, Acros Organic), and sodium chloride (NaCl, Neon) were used as received. The solutions and dispersions were prepared with deionized water using a Milli-Q ultra-pure water purification system with R = 18.2 MΩ cm.\n\n2.2. Synthesis, exfoliation and film preparation of MoS2\nMoS2 was synthesized and exfoliated according our previous report. The thin films of neat MoS2 were prepared through the LLIR according the procedure summarized in Fig. 1a: 5 mL of an acetonitrile dispersion of MoS2 (0.14 mg mL−1) was added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and maintained under magnetic stirring at 2500 rpm. Then, 20 mL of ultrapure water and 20 mL of toluene were added to the system, and the resulting biphasic system was magnetically stirred for 12 h. After interruption of the stirring, a homogeneous, continuous and self-assembled film of MoS2 was obtained at the liquid–liquid interface. The film was transferred to a glass Becker containing the substrate (glass, quartz, Si, FTO/glass electrodes) at the bottom and deposited by pulling the substrates across the liquid/liquid interface. The film was dried at 200 °C for 4 h before characterization.\n\n2.3. Preparation of the graphene/CuxO nanoparticles thin films\nThe graphene/copper oxide nanoparticles thin films were prepared according a methodology previously reported by us, as summarized in Fig. 1b. The method involves the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu2+ in a water/toluene biphasic system in air. GO was prepared using a modified Hummers’ method. Then, 8 mL of a 0.3 mg mL−1 Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution, 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1) and 18 mL of water were mixed in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in a total volume of 30 mL for the aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to the flask to obtain the liquid–liquid interface. The entire system was stirred for two hours at 1500 rpm. After this time, 3 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution (40 mg mL−1) were added under stirring, and the reaction was performed for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the stirring was turned off, and a dark gray thin film was observed at the liquid–liquid interface, which was characterized by reduced graphene oxide/CuxO nanoparticles (hereafter referred as rGO/CuxO thin film). The aqueous phase was exchanged for fresh ultra-pure water (by removing the aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette and adding a novel portion of 30 mL of water), and the system was stirred for a few minutes. This procedure was done to remove any soluble impurities remaining in the system, and it was repeated 10 times. Subsequently, the same procedure was carried out with toluene. As a control, the same procedure was also performed without copper nitrate, aiming for the preparation of a neat rGO film. Both films were deposited over suitable substrates as described earlier in Section 2.2.\n\n2.4. Thin films of nanocomposites comprising rGO, CuxO nanoparticles and MoS2\nStarting from the LLIR, three different approaches were adopted to prepare the tri-component films, as described in the following sections and schematically represented in Fig. 1c, d and e. The strategies will be referred to here as the layer-by-layer (Fig. 1c), mixing (Fig. 1d) and in situ synthesized (Fig. 1e) strategies.\n2.4.1. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by the layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy. This is the simplest approach, in which the previously prepared rGO/CuxO and MoS2 films at the water–toluene interface were sequentially deposited over the substrates in a layer-by-layer-like process (Fig. 1c). A film of rGO/CuxO prepared exactly as described earlier (Section 2.3) was deposited over suitable substrates and dried at 200 °C for 4 hours. Subsequently, a film of MoS2 prepared as described in the Section 2.1 was deposited over this rGO/CuxO film, followed by another drying process at 200 °C for 4 hours. For comparison, the same procedure was carried out to produce a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film (by depositing a MoS2 film over a previously deposited rGO one). The films obtained in this way will be referred to here with the suffix – LbL (from layer-by-layer): rGO/MoS2-LbL and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL.\n2.4.2. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by film mixing. The second approach was based on a mixture of two films that were already stabilized at liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 1d). Each film was individually prepared (MoS2 and rGO/CuxO, prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and kept at the water–toluene interface. Afterwards, 10 mL of the toluene and 15 mL of the water of each water/film/toluene system were removed using a pipette. The toluene/MoS2-film/water system was magnetically stirred at 2500 rpm, and the toluene/rGO-CuxO-film/water system was added over it. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 12 hours, and after this, the film at the liquid–liquid interface was transferred to substrates and dried according to the procedure described earlier. A control sample starting from a neat rGO film (instead of a GO/CuxO film) was also prepared. The films will be referred to here with the suffix –mixing: rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing.\n2.4.3. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite chemically synthesized in situ. The last nanocomposite was chemically synthesized in situ, directly at the liquid–liquid interface, by performing the same reaction described in Section 2.3 to produce the rGO/CuxO films, but with MoS2 dispersed in one of the liquid phases (Fig. 1e). First, 8 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (0.3 mg mL−1) was mixed with 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1), 7 mL of a 0.14 mg mL−1 acetonitrile solution of MoS2 and 11 mL of water in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in 30 mL of aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to create the liquid–liquid interface, and this system was kept under magnetic stirring for two hours at 1500 rpm. After that time, 3 mL of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (40 mg mL−1) was added with a syringe. After 30 minutes, the stirring was interrupted, and a grey film was observed at the interface between the two liquids. The cleaning process and deposition over substrates were carried out as described earlier. A film synthesized in the same way but without Cu(NO)3 was prepared, aiming to obtain a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film. The films will be referred to here with the suffix – in situ: rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ.\n\n2.5. Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a thin-film accessory. Raman spectra were acquired using a confocal Raman spectrometer (WITec Alpha 300R) with a 532 nm laser line at 0.9 mW of power, with 30 accumulations of 10 s of acquisition time. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer directly on the films deposited on quartz substrates, using air as a reference. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Mira FEG-SEM (Tescan) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV coupled to an EDS detector (Oxford Instruments) for elemental analysis. For the transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images, the films were deposited over copper grids covered with a hollow carbon thin film, and the images were collected using a JEOL 120 kV instrument at 100 kV. High-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JEM F200 device with a resolution of 0.1 nm, and the EDS-type elemental chemical analysis was obtained using an SDD detector with an area of 100 mm2 in a scanning mode (STEM). Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab potentiostat operated via GPES and NOVA 1.11 software, using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode and the thin films deposited over ITO as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from −0.2 V to 0.4 V at different scan rates (5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1) in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl. The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were performed using NaCl aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte in the range of −0.2 V to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at five current densities (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 A g−1), and evaluation of the materials for 200 or 1000 consecutive cycles was performed at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cyclic voltammograms were integrated to obtain the approximate electroactive mass of the components in each film: MoS2 (9.35 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO (3.41 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-LbL (5.19 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL (2.89 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-mixing (5.07 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing (1.58 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-in situ (5.39 × 10−8 g cm−2) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (2.06 × 10−7 g cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous NaCl solution at −0.1 V with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency of 10 MHz to 10 kHz. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed using an Autolab 128n in EQCM mode and the software nova 2.15, with a gold circular electrode (3 mm radius) coupled to a quartz crystal, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode, in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaCl in the range of −1.0 to 0.6 V at 10 mV s−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The second approach was based on a mixture of two films that were already stabilized at liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 1d). Each film was individually prepared (MoS2 and rGO/CuxO, prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and kept at the water–toluene interface. Afterwards, 10 mL of the toluene and 15 mL of the water of each water/film/toluene system were removed using a pipette. The toluene/MoS2-film/water system was magnetically stirred at 2500 rpm, and the toluene/rGO-CuxO-film/water system was added over it. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 12 hours, and after this, the film at the liquid–liquid interface was transferred to substrates and dried according to the procedure described earlier. A control sample starting from a neat rGO film (instead of a GO/CuxO film) was also prepared. The films will be referred to here with the suffix –mixing: rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing.\n2.4.3. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite chemically synthesized in situ. The last nanocomposite was chemically synthesized in situ, directly at the liquid–liquid interface, by performing the same reaction described in Section 2.3 to produce the rGO/CuxO films, but with MoS2 dispersed in one of the liquid phases (Fig. 1e). First, 8 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (0.3 mg mL−1) was mixed with 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1), 7 mL of a 0.14 mg mL−1 acetonitrile solution of MoS2 and 11 mL of water in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in 30 mL of aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to create the liquid–liquid interface, and this system was kept under magnetic stirring for two hours at 1500 rpm. After that time, 3 mL of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (40 mg mL−1) was added with a syringe. After 30 minutes, the stirring was interrupted, and a grey film was observed at the interface between the two liquids. The cleaning process and deposition over substrates were carried out as described earlier. A film synthesized in the same way but without Cu(NO)3 was prepared, aiming to obtain a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film. The films will be referred to here with the suffix – in situ: rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ.\n\n2.5. Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a thin-film accessory. Raman spectra were acquired using a confocal Raman spectrometer (WITec Alpha 300R) with a 532 nm laser line at 0.9 mW of power, with 30 accumulations of 10 s of acquisition time. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer directly on the films deposited on quartz substrates, using air as a reference. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Mira FEG-SEM (Tescan) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV coupled to an EDS detector (Oxford Instruments) for elemental analysis. For the transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images, the films were deposited over copper grids covered with a hollow carbon thin film, and the images were collected using a JEOL 120 kV instrument at 100 kV. High-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JEM F200 device with a resolution of 0.1 nm, and the EDS-type elemental chemical analysis was obtained using an SDD detector with an area of 100 mm2 in a scanning mode (STEM). Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab potentiostat operated via GPES and NOVA 1.11 software, using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode and the thin films deposited over ITO as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from −0.2 V to 0.4 V at different scan rates (5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1) in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl. The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were performed using NaCl aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte in the range of −0.2 V to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at five current densities (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 A g−1), and evaluation of the materials for 200 or 1000 consecutive cycles was performed at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cyclic voltammograms were integrated to obtain the approximate electroactive mass of the components in each film: MoS2 (9.35 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO (3.41 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-LbL (5.19 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL (2.89 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-mixing (5.07 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing (1.58 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-in situ (5.39 × 10−8 g cm−2) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (2.06 × 10−7 g cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous NaCl solution at −0.1 V with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency of 10 MHz to 10 kHz. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed using an Autolab 128n in EQCM mode and the software nova 2.15, with a gold circular electrode (3 mm radius) coupled to a quartz crystal, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode, in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaCl in the range of −1.0 to 0.6 V at 10 mV s−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Chemicals\nAmmonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Vetec), ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S, solution 20%, Vetec), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%, Anidrol), acetonitrile (gradient grade for liquid chromatography, 99.9% LiChrosolv, Merck), graphite (90%, Graflake, Nacional de Grafite), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, synth, 99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37% Panreac), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Vetec), hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (H2O2, 30%, Vetec), toluene (99.9% Sigma Aldrich or 99% Neon), copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2, Vetec), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%, Acros Organic), and sodium chloride (NaCl, Neon) were used as received. The solutions and dispersions were prepared with deionized water using a Milli-Q ultra-pure water purification system with R = 18.2 MΩ cm.\n\n2.2. Synthesis, exfoliation and film preparation of MoS2\nMoS2 was synthesized and exfoliated according our previous report. The thin films of neat MoS2 were prepared through the LLIR according the procedure summarized in Fig. 1a: 5 mL of an acetonitrile dispersion of MoS2 (0.14 mg mL−1) was added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and maintained under magnetic stirring at 2500 rpm. Then, 20 mL of ultrapure water and 20 mL of toluene were added to the system, and the resulting biphasic system was magnetically stirred for 12 h. After interruption of the stirring, a homogeneous, continuous and self-assembled film of MoS2 was obtained at the liquid–liquid interface. The film was transferred to a glass Becker containing the substrate (glass, quartz, Si, FTO/glass electrodes) at the bottom and deposited by pulling the substrates across the liquid/liquid interface. The film was dried at 200 °C for 4 h before characterization.\n\n2.3. Preparation of the graphene/CuxO nanoparticles thin films\nThe graphene/copper oxide nanoparticles thin films were prepared according a methodology previously reported by us, as summarized in Fig. 1b. The method involves the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu2+ in a water/toluene biphasic system in air. GO was prepared using a modified Hummers’ method. Then, 8 mL of a 0.3 mg mL−1 Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution, 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1) and 18 mL of water were mixed in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in a total volume of 30 mL for the aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to the flask to obtain the liquid–liquid interface. The entire system was stirred for two hours at 1500 rpm. After this time, 3 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution (40 mg mL−1) were added under stirring, and the reaction was performed for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the stirring was turned off, and a dark gray thin film was observed at the liquid–liquid interface, which was characterized by reduced graphene oxide/CuxO nanoparticles (hereafter referred as rGO/CuxO thin film). The aqueous phase was exchanged for fresh ultra-pure water (by removing the aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette and adding a novel portion of 30 mL of water), and the system was stirred for a few minutes. This procedure was done to remove any soluble impurities remaining in the system, and it was repeated 10 times. Subsequently, the same procedure was carried out with toluene. As a control, the same procedure was also performed without copper nitrate, aiming for the preparation of a neat rGO film. Both films were deposited over suitable substrates as described earlier in Section 2.2.\n\n2.4. Thin films of nanocomposites comprising rGO, CuxO nanoparticles and MoS2\nStarting from the LLIR, three different approaches were adopted to prepare the tri-component films, as described in the following sections and schematically represented in Fig. 1c, d and e. The strategies will be referred to here as the layer-by-layer (Fig. 1c), mixing (Fig. 1d) and in situ synthesized (Fig. 1e) strategies.\n2.4.1. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by the layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy. This is the simplest approach, in which the previously prepared rGO/CuxO and MoS2 films at the water–toluene interface were sequentially deposited over the substrates in a layer-by-layer-like process (Fig. 1c). A film of rGO/CuxO prepared exactly as described earlier (Section 2.3) was deposited over suitable substrates and dried at 200 °C for 4 hours. Subsequently, a film of MoS2 prepared as described in the Section 2.1 was deposited over this rGO/CuxO film, followed by another drying process at 200 °C for 4 hours. For comparison, the same procedure was carried out to produce a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film (by depositing a MoS2 film over a previously deposited rGO one). The films obtained in this way will be referred to here with the suffix – LbL (from layer-by-layer): rGO/MoS2-LbL and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL.\n2.4.2. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by film mixing. The second approach was based on a mixture of two films that were already stabilized at liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 1d). Each film was individually prepared (MoS2 and rGO/CuxO, prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and kept at the water–toluene interface. Afterwards, 10 mL of the toluene and 15 mL of the water of each water/film/toluene system were removed using a pipette. The toluene/MoS2-film/water system was magnetically stirred at 2500 rpm, and the toluene/rGO-CuxO-film/water system was added over it. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 12 hours, and after this, the film at the liquid–liquid interface was transferred to substrates and dried according to the procedure described earlier. A control sample starting from a neat rGO film (instead of a GO/CuxO film) was also prepared. The films will be referred to here with the suffix –mixing: rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing.\n2.4.3. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite chemically synthesized in situ. The last nanocomposite was chemically synthesized in situ, directly at the liquid–liquid interface, by performing the same reaction described in Section 2.3 to produce the rGO/CuxO films, but with MoS2 dispersed in one of the liquid phases (Fig. 1e).

Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to create the liquid–liquid interface, and this system was kept under magnetic stirring for two hours at 1500 rpm. After that time, 3 mL of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (40 mg mL−1) was added with a syringe. After 30 minutes, the stirring was interrupted, and a grey film was observed at the interface between the two liquids. The cleaning process and deposition over substrates were carried out as described earlier. A film synthesized in the same way but without Cu(NO)3 was prepared, aiming to obtain a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film. The films will be referred to here with the suffix – in situ: rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ.\n\n2.5.

Chemicals\nAmmonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Vetec), ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S, solution 20%, Vetec), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%, Anidrol), acetonitrile (gradient grade for liquid chromatography, 99.9% LiChrosolv, Merck), graphite (90%, Graflake, Nacional de Grafite), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, synth, 99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37% Panreac), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Vetec), hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (H2O2, 30%, Vetec), toluene (99.9% Sigma Aldrich or 99% Neon), copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2, Vetec), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%, Acros Organic), and sodium chloride (NaCl, Neon) were used as received. The solutions and dispersions were prepared with deionized water using a Milli-Q ultra-pure water purification system with R = 18.2 MΩ cm.\n\n2.2. Synthesis, exfoliation and film preparation of MoS2\nMoS2 was synthesized and exfoliated according our previous report. The thin films of neat MoS2 were prepared through the LLIR according the procedure summarized in Fig. 1a: 5 mL of an acetonitrile dispersion of MoS2 (0.14 mg mL−1) was added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and maintained under magnetic stirring at 2500 rpm. Then, 20 mL of ultrapure water and 20 mL of toluene were added to the system, and the resulting biphasic system was magnetically stirred for 12 h. After interruption of the stirring, a homogeneous, continuous and self-assembled film of MoS2 was obtained at the liquid–liquid interface. The film was transferred to a glass Becker containing the substrate (glass, quartz, Si, FTO/glass electrodes) at the bottom and deposited by pulling the substrates across the liquid/liquid interface. The film was dried at 200 °C for 4 h before characterization.\n\n2.3. Preparation of the graphene/CuxO nanoparticles thin films\nThe graphene/copper oxide nanoparticles thin films were prepared according a methodology previously reported by us, as summarized in Fig. 1b. The method involves the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu2+ in a water/toluene biphasic system in air. GO was prepared using a modified Hummers’ method. Then, 8 mL of a 0.3 mg mL−1 Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution, 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1) and 18 mL of water were mixed in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in a total volume of 30 mL for the aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to the flask to obtain the liquid–liquid interface. The entire system was stirred for two hours at 1500 rpm. After this time, 3 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution (40 mg mL−1) were added under stirring, and the reaction was performed for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the stirring was turned off, and a dark gray thin film was observed at the liquid–liquid interface, which was characterized by reduced graphene oxide/CuxO nanoparticles (hereafter referred as rGO/CuxO thin film). The aqueous phase was exchanged for fresh ultra-pure water (by removing the aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette and adding a novel portion of 30 mL of water), and the system was stirred for a few minutes. This procedure was done to remove any soluble impurities remaining in the system, and it was repeated 10 times. Subsequently, the same procedure was carried out with toluene. As a control, the same procedure was also performed without copper nitrate, aiming for the preparation of a neat rGO film. Both films were deposited over suitable substrates as described earlier in Section 2.2.\n\n2.4. Thin films of nanocomposites comprising rGO, CuxO nanoparticles and MoS2\nStarting from the LLIR, three different approaches were adopted to prepare the tri-component films, as described in the following sections and schematically represented in Fig. 1c, d and e. The strategies will be referred to here as the layer-by-layer (Fig. 1c), mixing (Fig. 1d) and in situ synthesized (Fig. 1e) strategies.\n2.4.1. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by the layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy. This is the simplest approach, in which the previously prepared rGO/CuxO and MoS2 films at the water–toluene interface were sequentially deposited over the substrates in a layer-by-layer-like process (Fig. 1c). A film of rGO/CuxO prepared exactly as described earlier (Section 2.3) was deposited over suitable substrates and dried at 200 °C for 4 hours. Subsequently, a film of MoS2 prepared as described in the Section 2.1 was deposited over this rGO/CuxO film, followed by another drying process at 200 °C for 4 hours. For comparison, the same procedure was carried out to produce a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film (by depositing a MoS2 film over a previously deposited rGO one). The films obtained in this way will be referred to here with the suffix – LbL (from layer-by-layer): rGO/MoS2-LbL and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL.\n2.4.2. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by film mixing. The second approach was based on a mixture of two films that were already stabilized at liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 1d). Each film was individually prepared (MoS2 and rGO/CuxO, prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and kept at the water–toluene interface. Afterwards, 10 mL of the toluene and 15 mL of the water of each water/film/toluene system were removed using a pipette. The toluene/MoS2-film/water system was magnetically stirred at 2500 rpm, and the toluene/rGO-CuxO-film/water system was added over it. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 12 hours, and after this, the film at the liquid–liquid interface was transferred to substrates and dried according to the procedure described earlier. A control sample starting from a neat rGO film (instead of a GO/CuxO film) was also prepared. The films will be referred to here with the suffix –mixing: rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing.\n2.4.3. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite chemically synthesized in situ. The last nanocomposite was chemically synthesized in situ, directly at the liquid–liquid interface, by performing the same reaction described in Section 2.3 to produce the rGO/CuxO films, but with MoS2 dispersed in one of the liquid phases (Fig. 1e). First, 8 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (0.3 mg mL−1) was mixed with 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1), 7 mL of a 0.14 mg mL−1 acetonitrile solution of MoS2 and 11 mL of water in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in 30 mL of aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to create the liquid–liquid interface, and this system was kept under magnetic stirring for two hours at 1500 rpm. After that time, 3 mL of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (40 mg mL−1) was added with a syringe. After 30 minutes, the stirring was interrupted, and a grey film was observed at the interface between the two liquids. The cleaning process and deposition over substrates were carried out as described earlier. A film synthesized in the same way but without Cu(NO)3 was prepared, aiming to obtain a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film. The films will be referred to here with the suffix – in situ: rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ.\n\n2.5. Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a thin-film accessory. Raman spectra were acquired using a confocal Raman spectrometer (WITec Alpha 300R) with a 532 nm laser line at 0.9 mW of power, with 30 accumulations of 10 s of acquisition time. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer directly on the films deposited on quartz substrates, using air as a reference. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Mira FEG-SEM (Tescan) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV coupled to an EDS detector (Oxford Instruments) for elemental analysis. For the transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images, the films were deposited over copper grids covered with a hollow carbon thin film, and the images were collected using a JEOL 120 kV instrument at 100 kV. High-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JEM F200 device with a resolution of 0.1 nm, and the EDS-type elemental chemical analysis was obtained using an SDD detector with an area of 100 mm2 in a scanning mode (STEM). Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab potentiostat operated via GPES and NOVA 1.11 software, using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode and the thin films deposited over ITO as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from −0.2 V to 0.4 V at different scan rates (5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1) in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl. The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were performed using NaCl aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte in the range of −0.2 V to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at five current densities (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 A g−1), and evaluation of the materials for 200 or 1000 consecutive cycles was performed at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cyclic voltammograms were integrated to obtain the approximate electroactive mass of the components in each film: MoS2 (9.35 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO (3.41 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-LbL (5.19 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL (2.89 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-mixing (5.07 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing (1.58 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-in situ (5.39 × 10−8 g cm−2) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (2.06 × 10−7 g cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous NaCl solution at −0.1 V with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency of 10 MHz to 10 kHz. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed using an Autolab 128n in EQCM mode and the software nova 2.15, with a gold circular electrode (3 mm radius) coupled to a quartz crystal, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode, in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaCl in the range of −1.0 to 0.6 V at 10 mV s−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Preparation of the graphene/CuxO nanoparticles thin films\nThe graphene/copper oxide nanoparticles thin films were prepared according a methodology previously reported by us, as summarized in Fig. 1b. The method involves the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu2+ in a water/toluene biphasic system in air. GO was prepared using a modified Hummers’ method. Then, 8 mL of a 0.3 mg mL−1 Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution, 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1) and 18 mL of water were mixed in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in a total volume of 30 mL for the aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to the flask to obtain the liquid–liquid interface. The entire system was stirred for two hours at 1500 rpm. After this time, 3 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution (40 mg mL−1) were added under stirring, and the reaction was performed for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the stirring was turned off, and a dark gray thin film was observed at the liquid–liquid interface, which was characterized by reduced graphene oxide/CuxO nanoparticles (hereafter referred as rGO/CuxO thin film). The aqueous phase was exchanged for fresh ultra-pure water (by removing the aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette and adding a novel portion of 30 mL of water), and the system was stirred for a few minutes. This procedure was done to remove any soluble impurities remaining in the system, and it was repeated 10 times. Subsequently, the same procedure was carried out with toluene. As a control, the same procedure was also performed without copper nitrate, aiming for the preparation of a neat rGO film. Both films were deposited over suitable substrates as described earlier in Section 2.2.\n\n2.4. Thin films of nanocomposites comprising rGO, CuxO nanoparticles and MoS2\nStarting from the LLIR, three different approaches were adopted to prepare the tri-component films, as described in the following sections and schematically represented in Fig. 1c, d and e. The strategies will be referred to here as the layer-by-layer (Fig. 1c), mixing (Fig. 1d) and in situ synthesized (Fig. 1e) strategies.\n2.4.1. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by the layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy. This is the simplest approach, in which the previously prepared rGO/CuxO and MoS2 films at the water–toluene interface were sequentially deposited over the substrates in a layer-by-layer-like process (Fig. 1c). A film of rGO/CuxO prepared exactly as described earlier (Section 2.3) was deposited over suitable substrates and dried at 200 °C for 4 hours. Subsequently, a film of MoS2 prepared as described in the Section 2.1 was deposited over this rGO/CuxO film, followed by another drying process at 200 °C for 4 hours. For comparison, the same procedure was carried out to produce a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film (by depositing a MoS2 film over a previously deposited rGO one). The films obtained in this way will be referred to here with the suffix – LbL (from layer-by-layer): rGO/MoS2-LbL and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL.\n2.4.2. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by film mixing. The second approach was based on a mixture of two films that were already stabilized at liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 1d). Each film was individually prepared (MoS2 and rGO/CuxO, prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and kept at the water–toluene interface. Afterwards, 10 mL of the toluene and 15 mL of the water of each water/film/toluene system were removed using a pipette. The toluene/MoS2-film/water system was magnetically stirred at 2500 rpm, and the toluene/rGO-CuxO-film/water system was added over it. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 12 hours, and after this, the film at the liquid–liquid interface was transferred to substrates and dried according to the procedure described earlier. A control sample starting from a neat rGO film (instead of a GO/CuxO film) was also prepared. The films will be referred to here with the suffix –mixing: rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing.\n2.4.3. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite chemically synthesized in situ. The last nanocomposite was chemically synthesized in situ, directly at the liquid–liquid interface, by performing the same reaction described in Section 2.3 to produce the rGO/CuxO films, but with MoS2 dispersed in one of the liquid phases (Fig. 1e). First, 8 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (0.3 mg mL−1) was mixed with 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1), 7 mL of a 0.14 mg mL−1 acetonitrile solution of MoS2 and 11 mL of water in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in 30 mL of aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to create the liquid–liquid interface, and this system was kept under magnetic stirring for two hours at 1500 rpm. After that time, 3 mL of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (40 mg mL−1) was added with a syringe. After 30 minutes, the stirring was interrupted, and a grey film was observed at the interface between the two liquids. The cleaning process and deposition over substrates were carried out as described earlier. A film synthesized in the same way but without Cu(NO)3 was prepared, aiming to obtain a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film. The films will be referred to here with the suffix – in situ: rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ.\n\n2.5. Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a thin-film accessory. Raman spectra were acquired using a confocal Raman spectrometer (WITec Alpha 300R) with a 532 nm laser line at 0.9 mW of power, with 30 accumulations of 10 s of acquisition time. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer directly on the films deposited on quartz substrates, using air as a reference. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Mira FEG-SEM (Tescan) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV coupled to an EDS detector (Oxford Instruments) for elemental analysis. For the transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images, the films were deposited over copper grids covered with a hollow carbon thin film, and the images were collected using a JEOL 120 kV instrument at 100 kV. High-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JEM F200 device with a resolution of 0.1 nm, and the EDS-type elemental chemical analysis was obtained using an SDD detector with an area of 100 mm2 in a scanning mode (STEM). Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab potentiostat operated via GPES and NOVA 1.11 software, using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode and the thin films deposited over ITO as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from −0.2 V to 0.4 V at different scan rates (5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1) in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl. The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were performed using NaCl aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte in the range of −0.2 V to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at five current densities (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 A g−1), and evaluation of the materials for 200 or 1000 consecutive cycles was performed at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cyclic voltammograms were integrated to obtain the approximate electroactive mass of the components in each film: MoS2 (9.35 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO (3.41 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-LbL (5.19 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL (2.89 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-mixing (5.07 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing (1.58 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-in situ (5.39 × 10−8 g cm−2) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (2.06 × 10−7 g cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous NaCl solution at −0.1 V with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency of 10 MHz to 10 kHz. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed using an Autolab 128n in EQCM mode and the software nova 2.15, with a gold circular electrode (3 mm radius) coupled to a quartz crystal, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode, in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaCl in the range of −1.0 to 0.6 V at 10 mV s−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Chemicals\nAmmonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Vetec), ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S, solution 20%, Vetec), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%, Anidrol), acetonitrile (gradient grade for liquid chromatography, 99.9% LiChrosolv, Merck), graphite (90%, Graflake, Nacional de Grafite), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, synth, 99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37% Panreac), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Vetec), hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (H2O2, 30%, Vetec), toluene (99.9% Sigma Aldrich or 99% Neon), copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2, Vetec), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%, Acros Organic), and sodium chloride (NaCl, Neon) were used as received. The solutions and dispersions were prepared with deionized water using a Milli-Q ultra-pure water purification system with R = 18.2 MΩ cm.\n\n2.2. Synthesis, exfoliation and film preparation of MoS2\nMoS2 was synthesized and exfoliated according our previous report. The thin films of neat MoS2 were prepared through the LLIR according the procedure summarized in Fig. 1a: 5 mL of an acetonitrile dispersion of MoS2 (0.14 mg mL−1) was added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and maintained under magnetic stirring at 2500 rpm. Then, 20 mL of ultrapure water and 20 mL of toluene were added to the system, and the resulting biphasic system was magnetically stirred for 12 h. After interruption of the stirring, a homogeneous, continuous and self-assembled film of MoS2 was obtained at the liquid–liquid interface. The film was transferred to a glass Becker containing the substrate (glass, quartz, Si, FTO/glass electrodes) at the bottom and deposited by pulling the substrates across the liquid/liquid interface. The film was dried at 200 °C for 4 h before characterization.\n\n2.3. Preparation of the graphene/CuxO nanoparticles thin films\nThe graphene/copper oxide nanoparticles thin films were prepared according a methodology previously reported by us, as summarized in Fig. 1b. The method involves the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Cu2+ in a water/toluene biphasic system in air. GO was prepared using a modified Hummers’ method. Then, 8 mL of a 0.3 mg mL−1 Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution, 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1) and 18 mL of water were mixed in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in a total volume of 30 mL for the aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to the flask to obtain the liquid–liquid interface. The entire system was stirred for two hours at 1500 rpm. After this time, 3 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution (40 mg mL−1) were added under stirring, and the reaction was performed for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the stirring was turned off, and a dark gray thin film was observed at the liquid–liquid interface, which was characterized by reduced graphene oxide/CuxO nanoparticles (hereafter referred as rGO/CuxO thin film). The aqueous phase was exchanged for fresh ultra-pure water (by removing the aqueous phase using a Pasteur pipette and adding a novel portion of 30 mL of water), and the system was stirred for a few minutes. This procedure was done to remove any soluble impurities remaining in the system, and it was repeated 10 times. Subsequently, the same procedure was carried out with toluene. As a control, the same procedure was also performed without copper nitrate, aiming for the preparation of a neat rGO film. Both films were deposited over suitable substrates as described earlier in Section 2.2.\n\n2.4. Thin films of nanocomposites comprising rGO, CuxO nanoparticles and MoS2\nStarting from the LLIR, three different approaches were adopted to prepare the tri-component films, as described in the following sections and schematically represented in Fig. 1c, d and e. The strategies will be referred to here as the layer-by-layer (Fig. 1c), mixing (Fig. 1d) and in situ synthesized (Fig. 1e) strategies.\n2.4.1. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by the layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy. This is the simplest approach, in which the previously prepared rGO/CuxO and MoS2 films at the water–toluene interface were sequentially deposited over the substrates in a layer-by-layer-like process (Fig. 1c). A film of rGO/CuxO prepared exactly as described earlier (Section 2.3) was deposited over suitable substrates and dried at 200 °C for 4 hours. Subsequently, a film of MoS2 prepared as described in the Section 2.1 was deposited over this rGO/CuxO film, followed by another drying process at 200 °C for 4 hours. For comparison, the same procedure was carried out to produce a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film (by depositing a MoS2 film over a previously deposited rGO one). The films obtained in this way will be referred to here with the suffix – LbL (from layer-by-layer): rGO/MoS2-LbL and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL.\n2.4.2. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite prepared by film mixing. The second approach was based on a mixture of two films that were already stabilized at liquid–liquid interfaces (Fig. 1d). Each film was individually prepared (MoS2 and rGO/CuxO, prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) and kept at the water–toluene interface. Afterwards, 10 mL of the toluene and 15 mL of the water of each water/film/toluene system were removed using a pipette. The toluene/MoS2-film/water system was magnetically stirred at 2500 rpm, and the toluene/rGO-CuxO-film/water system was added over it. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 12 hours, and after this, the film at the liquid–liquid interface was transferred to substrates and dried according to the procedure described earlier. A control sample starting from a neat rGO film (instead of a GO/CuxO film) was also prepared. The films will be referred to here with the suffix –mixing: rGO/MoS2-mixing and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing.\n2.4.3. rGO/CuxO/MoS2 nanocomposite chemically synthesized in situ. The last nanocomposite was chemically synthesized in situ, directly at the liquid–liquid interface, by performing the same reaction described in Section 2.3 to produce the rGO/CuxO films, but with MoS2 dispersed in one of the liquid phases (Fig. 1e). First, 8 mL of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (0.3 mg mL−1) was mixed with 4 mL of an aqueous dispersion of GO (0.15 mg mL−1), 7 mL of a 0.14 mg mL−1 acetonitrile solution of MoS2 and 11 mL of water in a 50 mL round bottom flask, resulting in 30 mL of aqueous phase. Afterwards, 20 mL of toluene was added to create the liquid–liquid interface, and this system was kept under magnetic stirring for two hours at 1500 rpm. After that time, 3 mL of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (40 mg mL−1) was added with a syringe. After 30 minutes, the stirring was interrupted, and a grey film was observed at the interface between the two liquids. The cleaning process and deposition over substrates were carried out as described earlier. A film synthesized in the same way but without Cu(NO)3 was prepared, aiming to obtain a rGO/MoS2 bi-component film. The films will be referred to here with the suffix – in situ: rGO/MoS2-in situ and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ.\n\n2.5. Characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a thin-film accessory. Raman spectra were acquired using a confocal Raman spectrometer (WITec Alpha 300R) with a 532 nm laser line at 0.9 mW of power, with 30 accumulations of 10 s of acquisition time. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer directly on the films deposited on quartz substrates, using air as a reference. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Mira FEG-SEM (Tescan) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV coupled to an EDS detector (Oxford Instruments) for elemental analysis. For the transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) images, the films were deposited over copper grids covered with a hollow carbon thin film, and the images were collected using a JEOL 120 kV instrument at 100 kV. High-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a JEOL JEM F200 device with a resolution of 0.1 nm, and the EDS-type elemental chemical analysis was obtained using an SDD detector with an area of 100 mm2 in a scanning mode (STEM). Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab potentiostat operated via GPES and NOVA 1.11 software, using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode and the thin films deposited over ITO as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from −0.2 V to 0.4 V at different scan rates (5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1) in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 NaCl. The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were performed using NaCl aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte in the range of −0.2 V to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at five current densities (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 A g−1), and evaluation of the materials for 200 or 1000 consecutive cycles was performed at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cyclic voltammograms were integrated to obtain the approximate electroactive mass of the components in each film: MoS2 (9.35 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO (3.41 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-LbL (5.19 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-LbL (2.89 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-mixing (5.07 × 10−8 g cm−2), rGO/CuxO/MoS2-mixing (1.58 × 10−7 g cm−2), rGO/MoS2-in situ (5.39 × 10−8 g cm−2) and rGO/CuxO/MoS2-in situ (2.06 × 10−7 g cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous NaCl solution at −0.1 V with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequency of 10 MHz to 10 kHz. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements were performed using an Autolab 128n in EQCM mode and the software nova 2.15, with a gold circular electrode (3 mm radius) coupled to a quartz crystal, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode, in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaCl in the range of −1.0 to 0.6 V at 10 mV s−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nThe nickel disulphide (NiS2) was synthesised by mixing spherical nickel nanoparticles with sulphur, followed by a simple heat treatment at 500 °C for 3 h in an argon atmosphere. This method provides a facile and scalable process for synthesising NiS2. Fig. 1a displays the XRD pattern of the synthesised particles, which consist of a single phase of NiS2 with a cubic pyrite structure (JCPDS # 89-7142). Additionally, the Raman spectrum in Fig. 1b confirms the pure NiS2 phase, exhibiting a doublet at around 280 cm−1 and a sharp peak at 480 cm−1. The peak at 272 cm−1 is attributed to Tg phonon vibration, and the peak at 280 cm−1 is assigned to Eg phonon vibration. The sharp peak at 480 cm−1 corresponds to Ag phonon vibration in NiS2.Fig. 1c shows the FESEM image of NiS2, which features spherical particles clustered together. This morphology is further investigated using TEM, as shown in Fig. 1d. The spherical shape of the NiS2 nanoparticles resembles that of the Ni precursor, as seen in Fig. S1a.† Given that the annealing temperature was 500 °C, sulphur vapour (with a boiling point of 444 °C) could react with the spherical nickel particles to form spherical NiS2 particles. The HRTEM image in Fig. 1e reveals lattice spacings of 0.23 nm and 0.28 nm, which correspond to the (211) and (200) planes of cubic NiS2, respectively. This HRTEM result further corroborates the formation of NiS2, aligning with the XRD pattern. From the STEM image and EDS mapping in Fig. S2,† nickel and sulphur are uniformly distributed throughout the NiS2 particles.\nNiS2 electrodes were prepared on a copper current collector and cycled using two types of electrolytes. The cycling performance of the NiS2 electrode in ether-based (DME) and carbonate-based (EC/DEC) electrolytes is shown in Fig. 2. The cycling properties are largely dependent on the type of electrolyte, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. In the case of DME electrolyte, the initial discharge capacity is 856 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency of 94%, and it remains at 804 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Conversely, in the case of the EC/DEC electrolyte, the capacity of the NiS2 electrode drastically decreases within 20 cycles and stays below 30 mA h g−1. The variations in voltage profile are represented in Fig. 2b and c. In the DME electrolyte, two plateaus appear at 1.3 V and 1.0 V during the first discharge (sodiation), and two more plateaus appear at 1.6 V and 1.9 V during the first charge curve. Although the capacity remains relatively stable during cycling, the plateau potentials in the discharge curve significantly change with repeated cycling; a short plateau appears around 2.0 V at the 10th cycle, followed by a long plateau at 1.5 V after the 50th cycle. These variations in plateau potential likely indicate changes in the sodiation reaction. In the EC/DEC electrolyte, as seen in Fig. 2c, the initial discharge curve is similar to that of the DME electrolyte. However, the capacity drastically decreases, and the discharge curve exhibits a sloping behaviour without a flat plateau after the 10th cycle. To investigate the differences between the two electrolytes, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the NiS2 electrode in both DME and EC/DEC has been analysed and is displayed in Fig. 2d. In the DME electrolyte, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the pristine NiS2 electrode is approximately 40 Ω and decreases to ∼10 Ω after the first cycle. For the EC/DEC electrolyte, the initial Rct value is ∼400 Ω, which is substantially higher than that of the DME electrolyte. Moreover, the Rct value for the carbonate-based electrolyte increases after the first cycle.\nIt has been reported that the high Rct in carbonate electrolytes is associated with a thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. This thick SEI layer could lead to electrical isolation between NiS2 particles, resulting in parasitic reactions that consume alkali ions in subsequent cycles. Such phenomena could be linked to poor cycling behaviour. On the other hand, ether-based electrolytes are reported to form a thin SEI layer on the active material. Although the NiS2 electrode was prepared without any specialised carbon nanostructure, its cycling performance was excellent when using a Cu current collector and DME electrolyte. The electrochemical properties under these conditions have been investigated in detail.\nFrom Fig. 3, the NiS2 electrode exhibited excellent rate performance when using a DME electrolyte and a copper current collector, delivering a reversible capacity of ∼800 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 132 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 100 A g−1. The voltage profile at various current densities in the DME electrolyte is illustrated in Fig. 3b. In Fig. 3c, stable cycling performance is observed at a high current density of 15 A g−1 over 1000 cycles. The capacity decreases during the initial stage but stabilises after 200 cycles. The variation in the voltage profile during cycling is displayed in Fig. 3d. A single plateau at 1.5 V during discharge appears after the 100th cycle, exhibiting the same behaviour as in Fig. 2b.\nIn Fig. 4, the NiS2 electrode using DME electrolyte and a Cu current collector was investigated after 1000 cycles in the charged state. Fig. 4a and b displays TEM images and EDS mapping results from TEM, indicating the presence of both copper and nickel. Fig. 4c presents the atomic concentrations in the 1000th cycled electrode based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. After 1000 cycles, elements of copper, nickel, and sulphur were detected. The copper elements likely originate from the Cu current collector, which is the only source of copper in the cell. In Fig. 4d, XPS results of the 1000-cycle sample show two peaks at 931 eV and 951 eV, corresponding to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 of copper sulphide (Cu2S), respectively. The HRTEM image in Fig. 4e reveals lattice spacings of 0.28 nm and 0.32 nm, corresponding to the (200) and (111) planes of NiS2, respectively. However, the lattice spacing of 0.19 nm could not be explained by NiS2 but is well-matched with the (110) planes of Cu2S. Thus, a Cu2S phase appeared in the NiS2 electrode after 1000 cycles.\nFrom the above results, it can be concluded that Cu2S was formed during the cycling of the NiS2 electrode for sodium-ion batteries. These findings are consistent with previous studies that used ether and a Cu current collector. Additionally, the single plateau at 1.5 V after cycling in Fig. 2d aligns with the plateau of Cu2S. Initially, the capacity should arise from the sodiation of sulphur, which is a reversible reaction involving Na2S and transition metals (Ni or Cu). After cycling, some of the sulphur in NiS2 likely transformed into Cu2S via a reaction with copper. However, since the total amount of sulphur in both Cu2S and NiS2 should remain equal to that of pristine NiS2, the capacity did not decrease; instead, a flat plateau at 1.5 V appeared after cycling. This plateau is characteristic of Cu2S. Thus, the plateau at 1.5 V likely originates from Cu2S. The capacity after cycling was derived from both NiS2 and Cu2S, and the total amount of sulphur should be the same as that in pristine NiS2. This phenomenon may be associated with the good cycling properties observed.\nEven though copper foil is considered as a candidate for an anode current collector, it reacts with NiS2 to form Cu2S. To identify the appropriate current collector for a NiS2 electrode, various popular current collectors were investigated, including aluminium foil, carbon nanotube-coated aluminium foil (CNT/Al), carbon-coated aluminium foil (C/Al), stainless steel foil, titanium foil, and nickel foil. The ohmic drop (at ∼1.7 V) in the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) is shown in Fig. S3† and summarised in Fig. 5a. Data from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, including charge transfer resistance derived from the Nyquist plot, are also integrated into Fig. 5a. The NiS2 electrode using a C/Al (carbon-coated aluminium foil) current collector exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance, potentially promoting faster kinetics. Fig. 5b displays the rate performance of the NiS2 electrode using a C/Al current collector and DME electrolyte. The NiS2 electrode delivered high capacities of 738, 642, 605, 583, 546, and 293 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, at an extremely high current density of 100 A g−1, the electrode delivered a capacity of 129 mA h g−1. This performance is similar to that observed with a Cu current collector in Fig. 3a and exceeds the rate performance reported in previous studies on NiS2. The high-rate performance of the NiS2 electrode is likely an intrinsic property. Fig. 5c presents the voltage profile at various rates. For kinetic analysis, cyclic voltammetry was performed at different current densities ranging from 0.1 to 20 mV s−1 (shown in Fig. 5d). During both anodic and cathodic scans, two peaks were observed in both the reduction and oxidation processes. Fig. 5e and f show the linear relationship between anodic/cathodic peak current and scan rate, consistent with eqn (2).\nwhere i is the peak current, a and b are constants, and V is the sweep rate. The b values corresponding to the cathodic peaks were 0.88 and 0.79, respectively, while those for the anodic peaks were 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. When the b-value is close to 0.5, the rate is controlled by the diffusion process; conversely, when the b-value is close to 1, the rate is governed by surface reactions. In both anodic and cathodic reactions, the rate may be influenced by both diffusion and surface reactions. A thin SEI layer formed by DME electrolyte, along with the high ionic conductivity of DME, could be associated with fast kinetics.\nFig. 6 illustrates the cycling properties of the NiS2 electrode using a C/Al current collector. The short-term cycling performance was conducted at a current rate of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 6a), and the corresponding voltage profile is displayed in Fig. 6b. The first discharge curve exhibits two plateaus, similar to that observed when using a Cu current collector in Fig. 2b. However, a flat plateau does not appear during cycling, differing from the behaviour observed with a Cu current collector in Fig. 2b. In other words, there may be no side reactions. According to Fig. S4† (EDS mapping results of the cycled electrode), the aluminium element was not detected in the NiS2 electrode after cycling. The C/Al foil should be inert during cycling and thus stands as a good candidate for the NiS2 electrode in sodium-ion batteries. The Nyquist plot of the pristine NiS2 electrode and the electrode after cycling is presented in Fig. 6c. The Rct was approximately 14 Ω initially and increased slightly to 16 Ω after cycling. The low charge transfer resistance could suggest fast kinetics. The long-term cycling performance was conducted at a current density of 50 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 6d, with the corresponding voltage profile presented in Fig. S5.† The NiS2 electrode exhibited an initial capacity of 413 mA h g−1 and a capacity decay rate of 8.47 × 10−3% per cycle over 5000 cycles. The discharge curve shows a sloping behaviour but lacks any plateau at 1.5 V. EDS mapping results obtained through TEM are displayed in Fig. 6e. After 5000 cycles, nickel and sulphur were observed, but aluminium was not detected in the NiS2 electrode. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images after 5000 cycles are shown in Fig. 6f. The d-spacing corresponds to 0.28 nm and 0.23 nm, which relate to the (200) and (211) planes of NiS2, respectively.\nTable S1† presents previous reports on NiS2 electrodes. Fig. 7a displays the cycling performance of these previous studies, along with cell conditions such as electrode structure, electrolyte, and current collector. Specifically, the current collectors, electrolytes, and electrodes are systematically represented. Copper, stainless steel, titanium, and carbon-coated aluminium have been used as current collectors. Carbonate-based electrolytes such as EC, DMC, DEC, PC, FEC, as well as ether-based electrolytes like DME and DEGDME, have been employed for various types of NiS2 electrodes. When using carbonate electrolytes, some previous reports showed poor cycling properties for NiS2 electrodes prepared without carbon coatings. Despite this, most NiS2 electrodes featuring carbon nanostructures exhibited good cycling properties when paired with carbonate electrolytes. Additionally, NiS2 electrodes using ether electrolytes and copper current collectors displayed a 1.5 V plateau after cycling. When NiS2 electrodes were cycled with ether electrolytes and alternative current collectors like stainless steel and Ti, the clear 1.5 V plateau during discharge was not observed. Based on our results and previous findings, the expected reaction mechanism responsible for metal sulphide behaviour is summarised in Fig. 7b. This reaction can be applied to all metal disulphide anodes, irrespective of the electrolyte used. In the case of ether electrolytes, bare NiS2 could react with copper foil to form copper sulphide during cycling, thereby promoting stable cycling. The formation of copper sulphide could be identified by the appearance of a plateau at 1.5 V during discharge. Moreover, bare NiS2 electrodes displayed poor cycling properties, potentially related to the formation of a thick SEI layer. Copper foil may not be an ideal current collector for bare nickel disulphides. However, there are two approaches to overcome the side reactions of copper current collectors. The first involves modifying the NiS2 electrode with a thick, uniform carbon coating, which can also be compatible with carbonate electrolytes. A thick carbon coating on nickel sulphide acts as a barrier, preventing the direct contact of copper and thereby mitigating side reactions. The main drawback of this strategy is reduced volumetric capacity. The alternative solution is to change the current collector; for example, carbon-coated aluminium foil can be used with a bare NiS2 electrode in an ether-type electrolyte. This strategy can also be applied to other metal sulphide anode materials to explore their real capacities without side reactions. This superior electrochemical performance highlights the promising practical applications of NiS2 anodes for sodium-ion batteries. Additionally, this strategy can be adapted to other metal sulphides to mitigate the side reactions involving copper current collectors.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Synthesis of NiS2\nNickel sulphide was synthesised by mixing nickel and sulphur powders, followed by heating at 500 °C for 3 h in an argon atmosphere. Nickel nanopowder (99%, Nanotechnology, Korea) and sulphur micron powder (Aldrich) were used as precursors. The nickel and sulphur powders were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:8 for 10 h using a planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 6, Fritsch GmbH, Germany) and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 8 h. The dried powder was then annealed in a tube furnace at 500 °C for 3 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1, in an argon atmosphere.\n\n2.2. Structural characterisation\nThe crystal structure was analysed using an X-ray Diffractometer (Bruker D2 Phaser, USA). To determine sulphide formation, Raman spectra were obtained using a LabRAM HR800 UV. Morphological evolution was assessed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM Quanta3D, FEI, Netherlands). Further details of the crystal structure were elucidated using TEM (FEI, TF30ST). Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Ulvac-PHI, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) was conducted with the aid of glovebox to minimise exposure.\n\n2.3. Electrochemical characterisation\nThe NiS2 electrode was prepared with 80% NiS2, 10% Ketjen Black (AkzoNobel, EC-600JD), and 10% PVDF (Sigma Aldrich). These components were thoroughly mixed using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Sigma Aldrich) and coated onto various current collectors, including copper foil (Wellcos), aluminium foil (Wellcos), carbon-coated aluminium foil (MTI Korea), carbon nanotube-coated aluminium foil (Prime 1E, Gratube Co.), nickel foil (Alfa Aesar Co.), stainless steel foil (Alfa Aesar Co.), and titanium foil (Alfa Aesar Co.). The coated slurry was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass of the active material was ∼1 mg cm−2. Swagelok-type cells were assembled for electrochemical testing. Sodium metal was employed as both a counter electrode and a reference electrode, while glass fibre (Whatman, GF/D) and Celgard served as separators. The cells were tested at room temperature within a voltage window of 0.01 to 3 V (WBCS 3000L, WonA Tech Co., South Korea) using either ether-based or carbonate-based electrolytes. A 1 M solution of sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6, Alfa Aesar, 99+% purity) dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the ether electrolyte. For comparison, a 1 M NaPF6 solution in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethylene carbonate (DEC) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was utilised as the carbonate electrolyte. Impedance spectra were measured in the frequency range from 1 to 0.01 MHz using a VMP3 multi-channel potentiostat (Biologic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). Cyclic voltammetry was performed at a voltage scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 within the 0.01 to 3 V voltage window. A four-probe analysis was conducted using a portable 4-probe resistivity tester (MTI, EQ-JX2008-LD). The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was carried out at a current density of 500 mA g−1, with a 10 minute rest time between charge and discharge cycles.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nIn Fig. 1(a), the XRD patterns for NVPF, NVPF/G, and NVPF/G@P are shown. It is clear that all the characteristic diffraction peaks coincide with the monoclinic NVPF, this suggests that the carbon coating, which has an adhesive effect, does not alter the crystal structure of NVPF. In Fig. 1(b), it is shown that the carbon content of each group was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). At temperatures below 300 °C, only slight mass loss in the NVPF, NVPF/G and NVPF/G@P groups can be observed, and the large weight loss in the range of 300–600 °C is due to pyrolysis of residual carbon; it is also this factor that causes the observed weight loss in NVPF. The highest residual carbon pyrolysis content in the PEG6K group was 8.5 wt%, which was higher than that in the graphite only group (6.7 wt%), indicating that the carbon content brought by PEG6K was about 1.8 wt%. That is to say, the additional carbon source brought by PEG6K can supplement the loss caused by the graphite carbon layer in the subsequent battery charging and discharging, thereby improving the stable cycling performance of the battery. In Fig. 1(c), in addition to the NVPF group, the Raman spectra of the other two groups of samples show two distinct characteristic peaks, the disordered carbon (D band) at 1340 cm−1 and the graphite crystalline carbon (G band) at 1600 cm−1, respectively. With the introduction of PEG6K in the NVPF/G@P group, a higher relative strength ratio (ID/IG) was obtained (0.97 for NVPF/G and 0.95 NVPF/G@P), indicating that PEG6K could increase the degree of graphitization, which implied that the NVPF/G@P group had better graphitization crystallinity.\nIn Fig. 2(a), the X-ray photoelectron spectrum of NVPF/G@P is shown, with Na 1s, F 1s, O 1s, V 2p, P 2p, and C 1s peaks. In Fig. 2(b), © high-resolution C 1s peaks were decomposed at 284.7, 285.8, 287.5, and 288.9 eV, corresponding to C–O/C–OH, C–C, C–N, and O–CO, respectively. The occurrence of C–O/C–OH peaks is mainly attributed to the terminal functional groups of PEG6K. The C–O/C–OH peaks were mainly attributed to the terminal functional groups of PEG6K, and with the addition of PEG6K, the C–O/C–OH peak area was significantly higher than that of other peaks, which greatly improved the wettability of NVPF to sodium metal. In Fig. 2(c), the high-energy spectrum of V 2p is shown, and there are two very distinct peaks. The two characteristic peaks at 515.8 and 523.5 eV correspond to V3+ of NVPF. In Fig. 2(d), a distinct P 2p characteristic peak is shown at 132.9 eV and 134.2 eV related to the P–C and P–O bonds.\nIn Fig. 3(a)–(c), SEM micrographs of NVPF, NVPF/G and NVPF/G@P are shown, and due to the addition of the covered graphitic carbon coating with PEG6K, the NVPF/G@P samples in Fig. 3(c) show more graphite sheet layer structure than NVPF and NVPF/G in Fig. 3(a) and (b). This demonstrates that PEG6K exhibits strong bonding capabilities, effectively mitigating volume fluctuations and thereby ensuring a stable electrochemical performance. In the HRTEM image in Fig. 3(d), the samples show a relatively homogeneous amorphous carbon layer of 3.5 nm on the surface of the NVPF, and the spacing of the lattice fringes is 0.25 nm, which verifies the (013) plane of NVPF. The EDS scanning spectra element diagram in Fig. 3(e)–(j) depicts the uniform distribution of C, P, O, F, Na, V, and F over NVPF/G@P. Fig. 3(k) shows a separately tested graphite SEM micrograph, showing the apparent lamellar structure of graphite.\nIn Fig. 4(a), the first discharge capacity of the positive electrode with NVPF, NVPF/G, and NVPF/G@P at 0.2C magnification is 80.2, 106.2, and 128.5 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 4(a)–(c)). After 50 charge–discharge cycles, the NVPF/G@P-based electrode has a capacity of 124.6 mA h g−1, which much exceeds that of the NVPF and NVPF/G electrodes (78.8 and 99.4 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, respectively). In addition, the NVPF/G@P group has a highly stable charge–discharge platform, thanks to the introduction of PEG6K. Therefore, the presence of a uniform graphite–carbon coating and the introduction of PEG6K are conducive to obtaining good electrochemical performance. The rate performance test from 0.2 to 10C and back to 0.2C can clearly show that NVPF/G@P-based batteries have excellent reversible capacity in terms of rate performance testing, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5C at 127.5, 121.5, 118.8, 115.8, and 111.3 mA h g−1 in Fig. 4(d) and (e). At 10C, the high rate, the NVPF/G@P electrode still has a discharge capacity of 105.0 mA h g−1, which is much better than the values obtained based on the NVPF and NVPF/G electrodes (27.4 and 50.4 mA h g−1, respectively). When the magnification is switched back to 0.2C, the NVPF/G@P electrode still has a capacity of 115.6 mA h g−1. Fig. 4(f) illustrates the long-term cycling of each group of samples. Since the capacity of the NVPF/G@P battery remains at a high level after 200 cycles, in addition, in this long cycle plot, the sodium-ion battery of NVPF/G@P shows the best capacity of all the test groups in this work. In Fig. 4(g), the structural framework and ion transport mechanism of NVPF/G@P are briefly described, and in the NVPF/G@P group with the introduction of PEG6K and graphite, the rapid diffusion of sodium ions between the electrode and the electrolyte is seen to explain the excellent stability of NVPF/G@P charge and discharge. This is confirmed by the resistance comparison analysis in the following article. In Fig. 4(h), we list the data of NVPF reported in recent years and compared with our work, it can be clearly seen that whether it is the first charge and discharge efficiency or the retention of battery capacity after high magnification, it is in the lead; for , although the performance is higher than in our work, in terms of cost, our work has a significant advantage, so overall our work has greater potential.\nIn Fig. 5, the battery is assembled and tested to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the material. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the NVPF/G group and the NVPF/G@P group with a scanning rate of 0.1–0.5 mV s−1, respectively, and it is evident that the redox characteristic peaks are present on both electrodes, which are due to phase transitions with sodium intercalation and NVPF extraction; in addition, the NVPF/G@P group has a higher intensity peak, indicating that after the addition of PEG6K, full combination with graphite can increase the diffusion rate of sodium ions, achieving low electrochemical polarization and extremely stable high electrochemical reversibility. Fig. 5(c) shows the number of triple cycles in the NVPF/G@P group with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1, and the almost identical curves indicate that the NVPF/G@P group is extremely stable. Fig. 5(d) shows the EIS analysis spectra for NVPF, NVPF/G, and NVPF/G@P, fitted with an equivalent circuit model (see Illustration 5d inside), and the Ip plotted against the square root of the scan rate (v1/2) and the impedance spectra of three samples at 1C after 30 cycles. It is clear that the EIS spectrum is mainly composed of high-frequency intercepts (corresponding to Rs). A concave semicircle is formed between the electrolyte and the electrode at the intermediate frequency (i.e., the transfer resistance Rct), while at the low frequency it appears as a straight line. We use constant phase elements (CPEs) to simulate the capacitance and Warburg impedance Zw is contributed by the surface of the active material. The three samples in the Nyquist plot have a half-ring at the middle and high frequencies, and a straight line at the low frequencies. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of NVPF/G@P is lower than that of the other two groups, which is conducive to fast electrochemical kinetics and excellent electrochemical performance; this phenomenon is due to the diffusion of sodium ions between the electrode and the electrolyte, and the higher the slope coefficient, the faster the diffusion of sodium ions. The fitting results are shown in Table 1. By comparison, the internal resistance (Rs = 4.71 Ω) and charge transfer resistance (Rct = 147.82 Ω) of the NVPF/G@P samples were the smallest, indicating that the addition of PEK6K combined with the graphitic carbon layer could significantly reduce the internal resistance of NVPF/G@P as well as greatly enhance charge transfer. Notably, NVPF/G@P exhibits the smallest semicircle, which shows that it has the most outstanding electrochemical properties among the materials synthesized in this paper. In this study, the diffusion coefficient corresponding to sodium ions was further investigated using the equation below, and the data calculated from this formula are shown in Table 1:\nIn the formula, the peak current (mA) is denoted by Ip, the effective contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte is denoted by A, the number of electrons per molecule during embedding is denoted by n, and the sodium ion concentration is denoted by C. The fitting results are shown in Table 1. By comparison, the internal resistance (Rs = 4.71 Ω) and charge transfer resistance (Rct = 147.82 Ω) of the NVPF/G@P samples were the smallest, indicating that the addition of PEK6K combined with the graphitic carbon layer could significantly reduce the internal resistance of NVPF/G@P as well as greatly enhance charge transfer.\nThe electrochemical schematic of the whole cell consists of an NVPF/G@P positive electrode and HC negative electrode charge and discharge (see Fig. 6(a)). The corresponding HC commercial anode hard carbon comes from KJ GROUP (Shenzhen Kejing Star Technology Company). The full cell charge and discharge diagram of NVPF/G@P//HC can be observed in Fig. 6(b); in this work, the specific N/P ratio in the full cells is 1.3 and the hard carbon loading in the full cell is about 1.5 mg cm−2, and it can be clearly seen that the relatively stable charge and discharge platform and stable capacity greatly inherit the voltage platform of NVPF/G@P, and the discharge capacity of the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 10th times is 112.5, 112.4, 112.1 and 112.7 mA h g−1, respectively. Fig. 6(c) and (d) show the rate capacity and corresponding charge–discharge curves of the NVPF/G@P//HC full-cells, respectively, and the capacities of the full-cells are 112.3, 100.6, 91.3, 89.3, 87.4, 79.3 and 76.0 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1, 2, 5, 10C and 20C, respectively. A relatively stable capacity after switching from 10C to 20C indicates that the full-cells exhibit excellent cycling stability, and after 100 cycles at 0.2C they still have a capacity of 91.0 mA h g−1 in Fig. 6(e). In addition, the NVPF/G@P//HC full-cell can still have 85.0% coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles at 0.2C, indicating that it has good practical prospects.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the Co/Zn-ZIF crystals were prepared by coordination of the 2-MeIm organic functional group with Co2+ and Zn2+, and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Co/Zn-ZIF crystals (Fig. S1a†) matches well with the standard card (CCDC 602542). The morphology and element content of Co/Zn-ZIF crystals were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the corresponding elemental mapping (Fig. S1b and c†). Then, the Co/Zn-ZIF precursor was uniformly coated with polydopamine in a Tris-buffer solution, to form a surface-coated N-doped carbon shell after high-temperature pyrolysis. Finally, the hollow-structured Co-ZnS@NC was synthesized through sulfidation and carbonization processes. ZnS and Co-ZnS were synthesized through similar processes except for introducing Co2+ or N-doped carbon. Compared with the SEM images (Fig. S2a and S3a†) of ZnS and Co-ZnS samples, the dodecahedral shape of Co-ZnS@NC (Fig. 1b) is well maintained after the annealing processes. According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1c), the diameter of the hollow Co-ZnS@NC composite is about 1.6 μm, and the particles have a clear rough carbon layer on the surrounding surface. The ultrathin carbon shell (∼35 nm) is expected to effectively increase the electrical conductivity and inhibit the aggregation effect during the pyrolysis process (Fig. 1d). The lattice spacing of Co-ZnS@NC is 0.31, 0.19, and 0.33 nm, which can be indexed to the (006), (108), and (101) crystal planes of ZnS, indicating an intact crystal structure of ZnS even with cobalt doping (Fig. 1e). Moreover, the results of elemental mapping and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) of the Co-ZnS@NC revealed that the molar ratio of Co/Zn is about 1:68 (Table S1†). Besides, the distribution of C and N elements further proves the hollow structure of composite materials (Fig. 1f).\nXRD patterns of the three samples in Fig. 2a exhibit similar pattern diffraction peaks corresponding to hexagonal ZnS (JCPDS no. 01-089-2739), which means that cobalt doping does not affect the lattice structure of ZnS. Since larger Zn2+ (74 pm) was replaced by smaller Co2+ (65 pm), the lattice structure of Co-ZnS@NC has no change compared to that of hexagonal ZnS. The Rietveld refined XRD patterns of the three samples (Fig. 2b and Fig. S4†) also confirm the substitution of cobalt atoms at the Zn sites, and the lattice parameters are summarized in Table S2.† Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted to calculate the component contents of the three samples (Fig. 2c). A small weight loss below 200 °C could be attributed to the evaporation of the absorbed water, while the subsequent weight loss between 200 °C and 500 °C results from the combustion of carbon, and at temperatures over 500 °C, ZnS is converted to ZnO. The carbon and ZnS contents are about 27% and 68.14%, respectively, (details in the ESI†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to identify the surface chemical properties of composite materials. As shown in Fig. S5a,† the XPS survey spectra of the three samples indicate the existence of Zn, S, C, O, and N elements. Specifically, no Co element diffraction peaks were detected, suggesting that trace amounts of Co were doped. The fitted spectrum Zn 2p XPS can be deconvoluted into two prominent peaks at 1020.8 eV and 1043.9 eV, corresponding to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 spin–orbit peaks of the Zn element (Fig. 2d). Note that the binding energies of Zn 2p in Co-ZnS and Co-ZnS@NC are higher than those of ZnS, which means the electron changes around Zn2+. The results of Zn 2p XPS confirm the spatial charge redistribution after cobalt doping, thus leading to the more exposed electrochemically active sites for the transfer and storage of Na+. The S 2p spectrum further confirmed the successful synthesis of ZnS, and the peaks at 162.5 eV and 161.3 eV are assigned to the S2− anions in ZnS (Fig. 2e). Notably, the area ratio between S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 is not 2:1 (Table S3†), which might be ascribed to the existence of C–S–Zn. The C–S–Zn bonds not only enable improved structural stability of composite materials but also can increase electron transfer between C, S, and Zn atoms based on the bridging effect. The C 1s spectrum of Co-ZnS@NC shown in Fig. 2f exhibits four peaks, and the peaks at 285.1 eV and 286.2 eV can correspond to the C–S and C–N, further confirming the strong connection between the conductive carbon framework and ZnS.\nThe sodium storage performance of the Co-ZnS@NC was investigated in a half cell using sodium metal as a counter electrode, while the performances of ZnS and Co-ZnS were also studied under the same conditions for comparison. As shown in Fig. 3a, Co-ZnS@NC presents the highest reversible capacity of 416.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 after 100 cycles, which assured that the Co doping and carbon coating could increase the active sites and structural stability of the composite materials. SEM images of the three samples after cycling also confirm the above point (Fig. S6†). The similar galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) profiles of the three samples are presented in Fig. 3b and Fig. S7,† assuring the same sodium storage mechanism. Notably, the GCD profiles of Co-ZnS@NC at different cycles are almost overlapped, confirming its cycling stability. In the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Co-ZnS@NC (Fig. S8†), in the initial cathodic scan, the broad peak between 0.01 and 0.6 V can be ascribed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and the sodiation process. Following the anodic scan, the oxidation peaks at 0.65 V and 0.9 V indicate a stepwise desodiation process. Furthermore, the anodic/cathodic peaks overlap well in the subsequent cycles, indicating excellent electrochemical reversibility of Co-ZnS@NC. The details of the corresponding reaction mechanisms are discussed in the following section. From the comparison in Fig. 3c, the Co-ZnS@NC electrode exhibits the best rate capability among the three samples, exhibiting the highest reversible capacities of 481.5, 471.7, 456.1, 425.1, and 397.2 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 A g−1, respectively. In particular, even at a current density of 20.0 A g−1, Co-ZnS@NC can still maintain a high reversible capacity of 368.8 mA h g−1, while the Co-ZnS@NC electrode can recover 466.0 mA h g−1 when the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1. Compared with other reported ZnS-based anodes for SIBs, Co-ZnS@NC provides excellent rate performance, confirming its superiority (Fig. 3d and Table S4†). Apart from the excellent rate capability, the Co-ZnS@NC electrode can also deliver excellent stability. As displayed in Fig. 3e, under a current density of 1.0 A g−1, the reversible capacity Co-ZnS@NC stabilizes at 456.8 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles and the capacity retention is about 82.5%. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 10.0 A g−1, Co-ZnS@NC can still maintain a high reversible capacity of 285.5 mA h g−1 over 2000 cycles (Fig. S9†), further highlighting its excellent stability. For comparison, the electrochemical properties of the NC anode are shown in Fig. S10.†\nTo further evaluate the practicality of the Co-ZnS@NC anode for SIBs, a full cell was assembled by selecting Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode (Fig. S11†). Fig. 3f shows the charge/discharge curves of the NVP cathode, the Co-ZnS@NC anode, and the full cell (the capacity of the curves had been normalized to 1). The full cell can light up a string of bulbs after being fully charged, confirming the feasibility of the Co-ZnS@NC anode (Fig. S12†). At a current density of 0.1 A g−1, the full cell delivers a high discharge capacity of 79.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles with a capacity retention of 95.9% (Fig. 3g), based on the total mass of the active materials. Similar to the Co-ZnS@NC anode, the full cell also exhibits superior rate performance (Fig. 3h), with the average discharge capacities of 84.3, 83.7, 79.9, 74.7, 70.0, and 66.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 A g−1, respectively. After returning to 0.1 A g−1, the discharge capacity recovers to 83.0 mA h g−1, demonstrating favorable cycling stability. Moreover, the full cell shows a high energy density of 214.4 W h kg−1 (details in the Experimental section).\nTo explore the reason for the fascinating rate performance of the three samples, CV curves at different scan rates were examined as shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S13.† With the scan rate gradually increasing, the current response of the Co-ZnS@NC anode also increases obviously, but all the CV curves maintained a similar pattern. The relationship between peak currents (i) and various scan rates (v) can be expressed via the equation i = avb, where a high b value positively affects rate capability. As shown in Fig. 4b, all the b values of the oxidation and reduction peaks of the Co-ZnS@NC anode are close to 1, suggesting that the surface-controlled capacitive process has dominant contribution during the desodiation/sodiation processes. Furthermore, the contribution of the surface-controlled capacitive process (k1v) to total capacity contributions (k1v + k2v1/2) of the Co-ZnS@NC can be evaluated based on the equation i(V) = k1v + k2v1/2. Fig. 4c shows the calculated capacitive contribution of the Co-ZnS@NC anode to be high as 92.8% at 0.6 mV s−1, which is higher than those of Co-ZnS (76.0%) and ZnS (73.2%). In addition, the capacitive contribution for the Co-ZnS@NC anode gradually increases as the scan rate increases, which is higher than that of the other samples at the same scan rate (Fig. 4d). A large proportion of surface-controlled capacitive processes is favourable for fast and stable Na+ diffusion, benefiting the superior rate performance and long-term cycling. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results also verify that the resistance of the Co-ZnS@NC anode is smaller than that of the other two samples (Fig. 4e). As calculated (details in the ESI†), the chemical diffusion coefficient of Na+ (DNa+) in the Co-ZnS@NC based on the Warburg region in the Nyquist plots still is the highest among all samples (Fig. S14†). The DNa+ in the three samples was further calculated based on GITT tests. As shown in Fig. 4f, the DNa+ values of the Co-ZnS@NC anode are about 10−13–10−11 cm2 s−1 during the desodiation/sodiation processes, which are higher than those of Co-ZnS and ZnS (details in Fig. S15†).\nTo further investigate the reaction mechanism and structural evolution, in situ XRD and ex situ XPS were then conducted. Fig. 4g shows the in situ XRD measurement during the initial two cycles at 100 mA g−1. At the open circuit voltage (OCV) state, the pristine Co-ZnS@NC shows four shows peaks at ∼26.67°, 28.4°, 30.2°, and 47.3° corresponding to the (101), (006), (103), and (108) planes of hexagonal ZnS, respectively. Discharging from the OCV to 0.3 V (Stage I), the peaks of the ZnS gradually shift to low angles due to the Na+ intercalation in Co-ZnS@NC. With the following sodiation process (Stage II), the four peaks gradually disappear; instead, two new peaks at ∼36.66° and 39.45° ascribed to the formation of Zn (JCPDS no. 00-001-1238) and Na2S (JCPDS no. 00-003-0933), respectively, appear revealing the conversion reaction of ZnS. When fully discharged to 0.01 V, a new emerging peak around 40.75° is attributed to the alloying reactions indicated by the formation of NaZn13 (Stage III, JCPDS no. 00-003-1008). The peak at 43.4° also belongs to both Zn and NaZn13. The peaks of Zn, NaZn13, and Na2S are gradually weakened during the succeeding desodiation process, while the patterns of ZnS reappear at 2.8 V, implying the reversible conversion reaction between ZnS and Na+. Notably, the ZnS components showed a weak XRD pattern by recharging back to 2.8 V, proving that ZnS has undergone an amorphization process during the insertion/extraction of Na+. Moreover, a similar storage process is revealed in the following cycle, thus demonstrating stable and reversible reaction processes. Ex situ XPS profiles of the Co-ZnS@NC anode were applied for further verification of the reaction mechanism (Fig. 4h and Fig. S16†). Compared to the pristine XPS spectra of S 2p, a new peak at 161.2 eV appears, which is assigned to Na2S at the fully discharged state. Notably, the peaks of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 are slightly blue-shifted to 162.8 eV and 164.0 eV due to the formation of Na2S, respectively. Specifically, the peak of Na2S disappeared after the fully charged state, indicating stable and reversible reaction processes, which is consistent with the in situ XRD analysis result.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and thiourea were purchased from Kermel. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Cu foil, Al foil, Super P, and ketjen black (KB) were supplied by Shanghai Songjing Energy Technology Limited. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) was purchased from Szkejing. DoDochem.com offered NaPF6 in DME. All chemicals were directly used without any treatment.\n\nMaterials preparation\nSynthesizing Co/Zn-ZIF precursors. First, 8 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 8 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 100 ml of methanol (solution A). Second, 32 mmol of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 100 ml of methanol (solution B). Then, solution B was added to solution A with a dropping speed of 100 ml h−1 and stirred vigorously for 10 min. Subsequently, the mixed solution was maintained at room temperature for 24 h. The obtained purple precipitates were collected through centrifuging and washed with methanol three times. Finally, the precursor was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained sample is labeled Co/Zn-ZIF. Similarly, for the synthesis of Zn-ZIF, the procedures were carried out in the absence of Co(NO3)2·6H2O.\nSynthesizing the Co/Zn-ZIF@PDA composite. 200 mg of the Co/Zn-ZIF precursor was dispersed in 200 ml of Tris-buffer solution through 30 min of sonication. Then, 100 mg of dopamine hydrochloride was poured into the mixed solution and stirred for 24 h. The composite materials were centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and labeled Co/Zn-ZIF@PDA.\nSynthesizing Co-ZnS@NC. 200 mg of the as-prepared Co/Zn-ZIF@PDA and 280 mg of thiourea were dispersed in 60 ml of ethanol and stirred vigorously for 10 min. Then, the above suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and deionized water several times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. Afterward, the as-prepared product was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 under an argon atmosphere. For comparison, ZnS and Co-ZnS without a carbon coating were synthesized in a similar route by replacing the Co/Zn-ZIF@PDA with Zn-ZIF and Co/Zn-ZIF, respectively.\nSynthesizing NC. 100 mg of dopamine hydrochloride and 242 mg of Tris were dissolved in a mixed solution (100 mL of deionized water and 100 mL of ethanol), stirred for 24 h and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. Then, the sample was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 under an argon atmosphere, obtaining the pure N-doped carbon (NC).\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nFor anode materials, the working electrodes were made by coating a slurry containing 70 wt% active material (Co-ZnS@NC Co-ZnS and ZnS), 20 wt% KB, and 10 wt% PVDF on Cu foil, followed by a drying process under vacuum at about 100 °C overnight and transferred to a glove box under an argon atmosphere before the cell assembly. The areal mass loading of active materials in the electrode was around 0.5 mg cm−2. 1.0 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) dissolved in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) was used as the electrolyte. For the fabrication of the cathode of the full cell, the slurry of NVP was prepared by loading 70 wt% active material, 20 wt% conductive KB, and 10 wt% PVDF binder onto Al foil. The mass loading of the cathode is around 1.0 mg cm−2. Before the preparation of the full cell, the as-prepared anode was pre-sodiated by bringing it into contact with Na metal for 1 h. The fabrication process for assembling a full cell is the same as that for preparing a half cell. The calculation of the energy density for a full cell is based on the following equations:\nwhere E and P represent the energy density and power density, respectively; V represents the average discharging voltage, i/m represents the current density (m is the total mass of the anode material and cathode material of the electrodes), and t represents the total discharging time.\n\nMaterials characterization\nThe microstructures were detected by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7610F Plus) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN) with elemental distribution analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Bruker D8 ADVANCE), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Mettler TG-DSC 3+), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Shimadzu/Krayos AXIS Ultra DLD), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Agilent ICPOES730; Agilent, USA), and Raman spectroscopy with a 532 nm laser (Renishaw inVia). The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CHENHUA, Shanghai), and all the electrochemical performances were tested on a Neware battery testing system (BTSCT-3008-TC).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

For convenience, Ba-doped NVP with different doping amounts can be abbreviated as NVBP-X, where X = 1, 2, 4 and 8 represents Ba-doping amounts of x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08, respectively. From the results, indexed peaks can be well matched with the rhombohedral NVP phase with R3c space group (PDF # 70-3613), indicating that the partial substitution of Ba (≤0.1) does not change the crystal structure of NVP. The detailed alteration of the (113) diffraction peak from the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1(b). With the increase of the Ba-doping amount to 0.01, there is a slight negative shift of (113) (hkl) towards a smaller diffraction angle. When the doping amount is further increased to 0.02, a significant negative shift of the (113) peak is observed. This change of the diffraction peak is attributed to the larger size of the Ba ion radius (+2, 1.35 Å) than the V ion radius (+3, 0.64 Å, in 6-fold coordination), suggesting the expansion of the unit cell volume upon Ba2+ doping. However, when the doping amount increases to 0.04 and 0.08, the negative shift phenomenon of the selected peak disappears, which may be attributed to un-doping resulting from excessive doping amount. It is believed that the enlarged unit cell space can provide broader channels for Na ion diffusion, decreasing the Na ion migration energy and facilitating the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, according to the Bragg formula, the interlayer space of the (113) peak in NVP can expand by substitution of V3+ by Ba2+ due to the bigger radius of Ba2+ than V3+, which broadens the Na ion migration diffusion channel and benefits in achieving a superior high rate capability.\nFig. 2(a–e) shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the prepared materials. As displayed in the images, all five materials are composed of particles with various shapes and sizes, even though there are some observably agglomerated particles with the size of 2–3 μm for NVP. It is observed that the agglomeration degree is much weaker in NVBP-X than in NVP. Additionally, the particle size decreases with increasing Ba-doping content. When the Ba-doping amount varies from 0.01 to 0.08, the size of NVP particles decreases from several micrometers to hundreds of nanometers, which facilitates electrolyte penetration and shortens the diffusion route of Na ions. Simultaneously, the relatively smaller particle size after Ba-doping could weaken the ionic scattering during electrochemical sodiation/de-sodiation, resulting in improved kinetic characteristics. Fig. 2(f) presents NVBP-2 and corresponding energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental mapping images. From the results, C, Na, V, P and O elements are detected, and Ba is dispersed uniformly in the composite, implying the homogenous elemental distribution of the material.\nTo further elucidate the architectural morphological features and the structure of the carbon coating layer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. For NVP (Fig. 3(a–c)), the image clearly reveals severely aggregated particles with the size ranging from 2 to 3 μm, matching well with the SEM observation. Moreover, the graphene wrinkles as well as amorphous carbon architecture with a thickness of about 2–3 nm are detected in accompaniment with crystalline NVP (Fig. 3(b and c)). The residual carbon colony would serve as a high speed electron transfer network. Clear lattice fringes are detected with the lattice spacing of 0.374 nm, matching well with the (113) plane of the rhombohedral structure of NVP. After Ba-doping, as shown in Fig. 3(d–f), graphene sheets with an amorphous carbon architecture are still visible. The addition of Ba-based reagent slightly alters the crystal space of NVP since a larger lattice spacing (0.424 nm) is detected for NVBP-2. Simultaneously, the graphene layer with a lattice spacing of 0.34 nm is observable.\nTo further identify the carbon architecture of the five samples, the Raman spectrum and TG plot were characterized. As shown in Fig. 4, it is verified that all five samples demonstrate two main characteristic bands of sp2-type carbon, including one band at 1590 cm−1 and another band at 1350 cm−1. The former carbon band is attributed to the breakage of symmetry at the edges of the graphite sheet (the E2g vibration mode), known as the D band, while the later carbon band is ascribed to the A1g vibration mode, arising from the graphite band and known as the G band. From the analysis of the ID/IG value, NVP has a stronger peak intensity ratio of the D band than that of the G band in comparison with NVBP-X materials, suggesting that the graphitization degree of carbon in NVP may have been slightly changed by Ba-doping. This indicates that the Ba ion may have a faintly catalytic influence for graphitization of carbon, such as Ni, Co, and Fe, which is still under investigation. It is noted that there is a small peak in NVBP-X and NVP materials at 437 cm−1, which is ascribed to the existence of VO6 or PO4. Besides, according to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot in Fig. S1,† the relative weight ratio of carbon is 5.7% for NVBP-2.\nX-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) measurement was carried out to analyze the valence information of C, V and Ba in NVP and NVBP-2, and the results are presented in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a), the C 1s spectrum in NVP is composed of four carbon-based bonding peaks: O–CO, CO, C–O and C–C peaks located at 288.5, 286.5, 285.1 and 284.1 eV binding energies, respectively. After Ba-doping, CO and C–O peaks shift slightly towards lower binding energy, whereas the C–C peak remains unchanged, suggesting that the carbon chemical environment is basically unaltered. For V 2p spectra, the high resolution spectra of NVP and NVBP-2 are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). Two de-convoluted peaks at 524.0 eV and 517.0 eV are attributed to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 of V4+, respectively, while two others at 523.2 eV and 516.2 eV match well with V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 of V3+, respectively. The high ratio of V 2p3/2 at around 517.0 eV can be ascribed to the higher chemical state of vanadium from +3 to +4, originating from the balance of the valence and the conservation of the charge from aliovalent acceptor doping of Ba2+ for V3+. Moreover, from the analysis in Fig. 5(e) and (f), it is demonstrated that there is an emerging small characteristic peak existing at around 779.8 eV and 795.1 eV, which can be attributed to Ba2+ 3d5/2 and Ba2+ 3d3/2. The detailed alteration of Ba2+ before/after Na storage has been shown in Fig. S2.† In the image, compared with the discharge state at 2.5 V, there is a slight negative shift of Ba2+ peaks at the charging state of NVP at 4.3 V, illustrating that the Ba valence could be affected in accompaniment with Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. These results strongly corroborate that the as-expected Ba ion has been doped into the NVP structure, affecting the chemical environment of NVP.\nFig. 6(a) and (b) present GCD profiles of NVP and NVBP-2 electrodes at various C rates in a potential range of 2.5–4.3 V versus Na+/Na, respectively. Here, 1C equals the theoretical capacity (117 mA h g−1) of NVP. Both electrodes exhibit the typical potential plateau of the NVP cathode at around 3.4 V, corresponding to the redox reaction couple between V4+ and V3+. The NVBP-2 electrode possesses a relatively superior specific discharge capacity at low C rate (<2C) or high C rate (>2C) when compared with the NVP electrode. The NVBP-2 electrode delivers a specific capacity of 104.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2C rate and maintains 65.1 mA h g−1 at 50C. In contrast, the NVP electrode possesses 113.3 mA h g−1 of specific capacity at 0.2C and there is only 37 mA h g−1 at 50C. It is noted that the bended profile of the charging/discharge curve at 50C is mainly attributed to the low data collection amount. From potential plateau analysis, it is noted that when the C rate exceeds 2C, there is a huge polarization phenomenon for the NVP electrode but no obvious polarization for the NVBP-2 electrode, indicating the shortened diffusion length of the Na ion and improved redox kinetics after Ba-doping. From the rate capability performance (Fig. 6(c)), the NVBP-2 electrode exhibits superior rate capability compared to NVP and other NVBP electrodes at high current densities (>5C), although the specific capacity of NVP is higher than that of NVBP-2 at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C and 2C rates. For cycling performance at 0.2C (Fig. 6(d)), the NVBP-2 electrode also presents a high capacity retention (95.8%) compared to other Ba-doped electrodes after 100 cycles. With further increasing the C rate to 5C and prolonging the cycling span to 500 cycles, as shown in Fig. 6(e), the NVBP-2 electrode presents an excellent capacity retention of 91.5% when compared to 83.2% of NVP, 95.6% of NVBP-1, 93.2% of NVBP-4, and 93.4% of NVBP-8. The high-rate capacity retention has been improved by the suitable Ba-doping content while the low-rate capacity would be damaged. The reasons are unclear and still under investigation.\nSince the high rate capability is an important factor in determining the practical value of cathode materials for SIBs, we also detected the high rate capability of the NVBP-2 electrode at 10C and 50C rates. As displayed in Fig. 7(a), the electrode possesses 101.5 mA h g−1 of discharge capacity in the initial charge–discharge test at 10C rate, and the capacity maintains at 97.6 mA h g−1 at the 500th cycle, while it still maintains at 92.1 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. When tested at 50C rate, the NVBP-2 electrode gives 65.1 mA h g−1 of specific capacity in the first discharge cycle and maintains 63.2 mA h g−1 at the 900th discharge cycle, suggesting an excellent cycling stability. The observable voltage steps may be caused by the low data collection rate. Interestingly, the targeted NVBP-2 electrode can still remain with a discharge capacity of 52.8 mA h g−1 with 81.2% retention after 2000 cycles at 50C in Fig. 7(b). However, the NVP electrode only possesses a discharge capacity of 10 mA h g−1 at 50C rate. This result proves that the structural stability of NVP has been clearly improved by Ba-doping. Simultaneously, after Ba-doping into NVP, the lower migration barrier of Na ions benefits the diffusion of Na ions, especially under high rate conditions. As summarized, this Ba-doping NVP material demonstrates relatively higher rate capability than those of other structural NVP materials (Table S1, ESI†). Two possible reasons are responsible for enhanced electrochemical properties: (1) the inactive Ba-doping in the V-site in NVP stabilizes the NASICON structure during Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation due to the stronger Ba–O bond compared to the V–O bond; (2) the appropriate Ba-doping induces the formation of V valence from +3 to +4, which could enable more multi-electron redox reactions. However, excess Ba-doping might lead to lattice distortion and block the diffusion route of Na ions, resulting in poor electrochemical performance.\nTo further deeply understand the electrode reaction kinetic mechanism of the NVP material before and after Ba-doping, CV curves were recorded, and the results are shown in Fig. 8(a and b). The well-defined sharp redox peaks at 3.52/3.49 V should be ascribed to the Na ion intercalation and de-intercalation in the NVP architecture. With the increasing scan rate, NVP and NVBP-2 electrodes present increased the current density and potential polarization. However, the cathodic and anodic peaks of NVP shift significantly towards lower and higher potentials, respectively, due to the enhanced polarization. In contrast, the NVBP-2 electrode still maintains complete redox peaks at a higher scanning rate of 0.5 mV s−1, suggesting faster kinetics and lower polarization. The corresponding linear relationship between peak current and square root of scan rate of the anodic/cathodic process is shown in Fig. 8(c). Calculated on the basis of the Randles–Sevcik equation, the Na ion diffusion coefficient in the solid state NVBP-2 electrode reaches 2.89 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, which is higher than that of the NVP electrode (1.18 × 10−11 cm2 s−1). Simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 8(d), in combination with the equation i = aυb (where i is the current response, a is a constant, υ is the sweep rate and b is the power-law exponent), the b value determines the controlled step in the electrochemical process, where a value close to 0.5 represents a diffusion-controlled step while a value close to 1 indicates the capacitive behavior of the surface faradaic redox reaction. The calculation results show that NVP has a b value of 0.39/0.01 for the anodic/cathodic peak current, while NVBP-2 shows a b value of 0.59/0.32, suggesting that the charge transfer mechanism is limited for NVP, and there is more contribution of the capacitive behavior for NVBP-2. Moreover, according to the calculations based on the equation i(V) = k1υ + k2υ1/2 (where i(V) is the response current, υ is the scan rate, k1υ is the surface capacitive contribution and k2υ1/2 is a diffusion-controlled process), the proportion of diffusion and surface contribution can be identified. With the increase of the scan rate, the NVBP-2 electrode demonstrates higher capacitive contribution than that of the NVP electrode, which may be attributed to the smaller particle size of NVBP-2 and Ba-doping influence.\nEIS tests for NVP and NVBP-2 electrodes were conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† It is noted that both electrodes show similar semicircles in the high-frequency section and a linear line in the low-frequency section. The semicircle in the high-frequency region represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), while the linear line in the low-frequency region indicates the Na ion diffusion procedure during the intercalation/de-intercalation process (W0). In comparison, the NVBP-2 electrode exhibits lower Rct (122.3 Ω) and a relatively more vertical linear line than that of NVP (Rct = 389.2 Ω), which confirms the higher electrochemical reaction activity and faster Na ion diffusion kinetic behavior than that of the NVP electrode.\nTo further reveal the regulation of the Na ion diffusion route and electrochemical conversion barrier for the Ba-doped NVP material, the optimized crystal structure of NVP is shown in Fig. 9(a). In the asymmetric unit, there is one V and one P atom, while other atoms (Na and O) are represented in two distinct positions each. The main building block involves two VO6 octahedra interlinked by three phosphate groups lying along the c axis, with sodium atoms located in the voids of the framework with six- (Na1 site) and eight-fold (Na2 site) coordinations. As it is widely known, the Na2 site has higher electrochemical activity than the Na1 site due to the difference in the oxygen environment. Depending on the projection site of the V atom onto the a–b plane, there are three types of V atoms, and Fig. 9(b–d) shows Ba-doping into the three different V sites. Additionally, we performed NEB calculations to study the diffusivity of Na ions in Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3.Fig. 10(a) illustrates the Na ion migration path from a Na1 site to another Na1 site via a Na2 site, while Fig. 10(b) shows Na ion migration barriers in Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 of 764 and 311 meV, respectively. This former value is much higher than the latter one, and therefore the Na ion at the Na1 site of NaV2(PO4)3 is hard to migrate to another Na1 site. In NaV2(PO4)3, the energy at the Na2 site is 665 meV, which is higher than that in Na3V2(PO4)3 (33 meV). This energy difference is attributed to destabilization of the Na2 site. One Na ion at the Na1/2 site is repelled by two/four neighboring V ions, and the oxidation states of V in NaV2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 are +4 and +3, respectively. Therefore, the Na2 site in NaV2(PO4)3 is less stable due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion from V ions (+4). With the same calculation strategy for Ba-doping NVP, Na ion migration barriers in Na3V11/12Ba1/12(PO4)3 and NaV11/12Ba1/12(PO4)3 were found to be 694 and 243 meV, respectively. The lower migration barriers of Na ions after Ba-doping, particularly the one for NaV11/12Ba1/12(PO4)3, shows that the third Na ion along with other two Na ions is more active during the charge/discharge process. To further investigate the origin of lower migration barriers, Fig. 11 shows the local density distribution near one Ba-doping V site (the charge density distribution is shown in Fig. S4†). The electronic distribution of V is “[Ar] 3d3 4s2”, while that of Ba is “[Xe] 6s2”. Without the 3d orbital, Ba is less chemically electrophilic, and thus more isosurfaces of electron accumulation appear around the Ba site, as shown in Fig. 11. These newly formed electron accumulation surfaces offer more potential paths for Na ion diffusion, which is consistent with previous experimental results. While the accessible Na ion sites of the surface component can be extended to have continuous three-dimensional configurations by allowing the Na ion to diffuse through tetrahedral sites in the framework. This Na ion percolation network with its high connectivity of the diffusion pathway helps to explain the high rate capability of NVBP-2, which is also confirmed by topology analysis. After Ba-doping, the inversion symmetry has been broken due to the non-uniform distribution of V sites along the lattice vector through the disappearance of inversion centers. It is believed that destroying the inversion symmetry can enhance the stability of the crystal lattice without polarization, which benefits Na ion diffusion and improves the electrochemical rate capability of this Ba-doping material. The lack of such inversion centers leads to the asymmetric polarization of the electric system, where orbitals V3d + V4p and V3d + O2p hybridize, and this leads to a possible 1s-3d transition, which exquisitely reveals edge differences between NVP and NVBP phases and explains the improved high-rate performance of the NVBP electrode.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nFig. 1 depicts the experimental process for the synthesis of the multiple yolk–single shell structured Se-Fe7S8@NC@C microcubes, while the entire synthetic procedure is presented in the ESI.† First of all, Prussian blue is manufactured via the coprecipitation method at 80 °C. Then, the Prussian blue microcubes are coated with resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) by dispersing them in a mixed alkali solution for 8 h to achieve PB@RF microcubes. After this, the PB@RF microcubes and a mixture of sulfur and selenium powders (a molar ratio of 2.5:1) are placed in the downstream and upstream sections of a ceramic arc in a tube furnace, respectively, and heated for thermal decomposition and sulfurization reactions. Finally, the outer RF layer and cyanogen (CN−) are carbonized to form a carbon layer and an N-rich carbon matrix separately, and iron ions react with sulfur and selenium vapors to generate Se-doped Fe7S8 during the annealing process in an N2 atmosphere. Simultaneously, the Prussian blue structure collapses into multiple yolks, and the RF coating acts as a shell layer to sustain the basic cubic framework.\nSEM is performed to obtain the morphologies and microstructures of the material. In Fig. 2a, PB presents a microcube morphology with a size of about 500 nm. Fig. 2b reveals that PB@RF also possesses a microcube morphology, while the surface becomes marginally rough after the RF coating. In Fig. 2c and d, the synthesized Fe7S8@NC@C and Se-Fe7S8@NC@C both exhibit a uniform microcube morphology and the Se-doping scarcely changes the morphology. In contrast, the PB without the RF protective layer suffers from structural collapse and the microstructure is severely damaged after high-temperature annealing (Fig. 2e). Clearly, the RF-derived carbon layer can provide rigid protection for the initial cubic structure and considerably augment the microstructural stability of the material. TEM pictures of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C in Fig. 2f–i further confirm the successful construction of multiple yolk–single shell structured microcubes, where the sufficient volume between yolks efficiently mitigates volume changes. In addition, the carbon layer derived from RF is clearly observed in Fig. 2i, with a carbon layer thickness of about 60 nm.\nThe mapping images of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C in Fig. 3a–g demonstrate that the Fe, S and Se elements are primarily concentrated in the yolk, while the C and N elements are mainly distributed in the shell. Moreover, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C is shown in Fig. 3h, where two diffraction rings correspond to the (200) and (102) planes of Fe7S8. From Fig. S1,† it can be observed that Fe7S8@NC@C possesses obvious lattice stripes with spacings of 0.264 nm and 0.205 nm, corresponding to the (203) and (206) planes of Fe7S8 separately; in comparison, Se-Fe7S8@NC@C possesses wider lattice stripes of (203) 0.270 nm and (206) 0.213 nm (Fig. 3i and j). Additionally, as exhibited in Fig. S2 and Table S1,† the mass percentages of C, N, S, Fe, and Se are 11.93%, 2.27%, 25.79%, 56.66% and 3.35%, respectively. An inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) was used to analyze the composition of the samples, and the corresponding results are shown in Table S2 and Fig. S3.†\nFig. 4a and S4† display the XRD maps of the as-manufactured materials. In Fig. S4,† the diffraction peaks of PB match well with the standard cards of Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3 (01–0239) and align with the previous report. As shown in Fig. 4a, the diffraction peaks of Fe7S8@NC@C and Se-Fe7S8@NC@C align with the standard card of Fe7S8 (24–0220). Nonetheless, Se-Fe7S8@NC@C shifts towards lower angles in contrast with Fe7S8@NC@C, suggesting that the interplanar spacing of Fe7S8 is expanded after the successful doping of Se, which is in accordance with Bragg's equation (Fig. S5†). The chemical valence states of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C are determined by XPS in Fig. 4b–f. The survey spectra of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C (Fig. S6†) reveal the presence of Fe, S, Se C, N and O signal peaks. The existence of O is attributed to the oxidation of sulfides, C is derived from RF and CN− in the PB, and N may also be attributed to cyanogen. The Fe 2p spectra of Fe7S8@NC@C and Se-Fe7S8@NC@C are displayed in Fig. 4b. The satellite peak of Fe is present at 717.5 eV, and the two spin-orbital peaks at 727.0/724.0 eV and 713.0/710.6 eV belong to the redox pair of Fe3+/Fe2+, attributed to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively. In the S 2p spectra of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C, three types peaks of S 2p can be detected, corresponding to (S2)2−, (Sn)2− and S–O, respectively (Fig. 4c). The peak positions of S2− 2p3/2, S2− 2p1/2, (Sn)2− and S–O are at 161.9, 163.8, 165.0 and 168.2 eV for Se-Fe7S8@NC@C, respectively. Notably, the peaks of Fe7S8@NC@C obviously shift towards a lower binding energy compared with those of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C, indicating that the doping of Se into Fe7S8 induces a change in the electronic structure of Fe7S8. This phenomenon could be attributed to the difference in electronegativity between Se and S. From Fig. 4d, it can be observed that the Se 3d spectra could be fitted into three peaks. The peak positions of 55.5, 56.6 and 58.7 eV correspond to Se2− 3d5/2, Se2− 3d3/2 and SeOx, respectively. In Fig. 4e, three peaks located at 397.8, 399.7, and 401.9 eV can be detected in the N 1s spectra of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C, which are attributed to graphitic N, pyrrolic N, and pyridinic N, respectively. The C 1s spectra of Fe7S8@NC@C and Se-Fe7S8@NC@C in Fig. 4f can be fitted into three peaks, which are attributed to C–C (284.8 eV), C–N (286.6 eV), and CO (288.8 eV), respectively. The chemical state of carbon in Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C is revealed by the Raman spectra (Fig. 4g). The signal peaks at ∼1354 and ∼1539 cm−1 are detected and attributed to the D band and G band, respectively, demonstrating that RF and PB transform into a carbon coating at high temperature. The Se-Fe7S8@NC@C composite exhibits a higher ID/IG (1.084) value, illustrating more defects on the surface of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C, which are predicted to notably boost the Na+-ion storage capacitance. Fig. 4h exhibits the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C. Se-Fe7S8@NC@C (6.11 m2 g−1) has a larger specific surface area compared to Fe7S8@NC@C (3.22 m2 g−1), which facilitates the provision of more active sites to accelerate the reaction kinetics. In Fig. 4i, both Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C exhibit a mesoporous structure (2–50 nm), which is favorable for Na+ ion transfer and electrolyte pervasion.\nAs displayed in Fig. 5, various electrochemical property tests of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C were performed to certify the superiority on multiple aspects of the structure of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C as the electrode material. Fig. 5a indicates the CV test of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 for the initial three cycles within 0.01–3 V. In the 1st loop, visible reduction peaks emerge at 0.93 and 0.31 V, attributed to the sodiation process and the decomposition of the electrolyte to form the solid electrolyte interphase films. Additionally, marked oxidation peaks arise at 1.37 V and 1.80 V, attributed to the desodiation process of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C. It is noteworthy that minor cathodic and anodic peaks are discovered at 0.03 and 0.06 V separately, attributed to sodiation/desodiation of carbon (xC + Na+ + e− ↔ NaCx). Furthermore, the subsequent cycles (2nd and 3rd) almost overlap, proving the exceptional stability and reversibility of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C. Nevertheless, slight alterations in peak positions between the 2nd and 3rd cycles are induced by the inevitable polarization. As shown in Fig. 5b, the voltage plateau in the GCD profiles of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C is basically parallel to the redox peak position on the CV curves. During the initial sodiation/desodiation cycle, the charge/discharge capacity of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C is 703.2/828.5 mA h g−1 and displays a satisfactory initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 84.9%. In comparison, Fe7S8@NC@C possesses a much lower ICE of 71.0%, which demonstrates that Se-Fe7S8@NC@C possesses better reversibility than Fe7S8@NC@C. Fig. 5c shows the cycling performances of Fe7S8@NC@C and Se-Fe7S8@NC@C. A remarkable capacity of 765.1 mA h g−1 is maintained after 90 cycles for Se-Fe7S8@NC@C, while the capacity of Fe7S8@NC@C declines rapidly to 480.2 mA h g−1 after 54 cycles. Moreover, the rate capabilities of Fe7S8@NC@C and Se-Fe7S8@NC@C are evaluated between 0.1 and 5 A g−1 (Fig. 5d and e). Specifically, at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, the discharge capacities of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C are 674.8, 641.0, 612.8, 585.5, 547.4 and 448.2 mA h g−1, respectively. Meanwhile, a capacity of 712.4 mA h g−1 can be retained when the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, suggesting conspicuous rate performance and superior reversibility compared to Fe7S8@NC@C at different current densities. In addition, satisfactory rate capability of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C can also be verified in the GCD curves (Fig. 5d). Moreover, the comparison among advanced anode materials indicates that Se-Fe7S8@NC@C has a much better rate capability than the majority of advanced anode materials (Fig. 5f and Table S3†). Meanwhile, the long cycling stabilities of Fe7S8@NC@C and Se-Fe7S8@NC@C at 5 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 5g. The capacity of 390.9 mA h g−1 for Se-Fe7S8@NC@C can be retained after 800 cycles, and its CE remains almost 100% throughout the cycling process. In comparison, Fe7S8@NC@C retains 252.1 mA h g−1 after 164 cycles. Obviously, the Se-Fe7S8@NC@C electrode has far superior sodium storage capability, which is attributed to the introduction of a small amount of Se. What's more, the Se-Fe7S8@NC@C electrode has a more stable coulombic efficiency compared to the Fe7S8@NC@C electrode (Fig. 5c, e and g). The SEM images and EDS spectra of the electrodes after cycling were used to verify the stability of the samples. In order to verify the great cycling stability of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C, we test the morphology and composition of the Se-Fe7S8@NC@C electrode before and after cycling. As shown in Fig. S7a–c,† the Se-Fe7S8@NC@C electrode material remains firmly attached to the collector after cycling, while the Fe7S8@NC@C electrode material partially detaches from the collector, demonstrating the excellent cycling stability of the Se-Fe7S8@NC@C electrode. Before cycling, the Se-Fe7S8@NC@C electrode material possesses a cubic microstructure and its composition is mainly Fe7S8 (Fig. S7d and S7g†). After 100 cycles at 5 A g−1, the morphology of the Se-Fe7S8@NC@C electrode material still maintains the cubic framework, and its composition contains not only Fe7S8 but also Na and F, which can be attributed to the formation of NaF in the SEI film induced by the electrolyte (NaPF6) and the sodium ions (Fig. S7e and S7h†). This stabilized SEI film facilitates the enhancement of the long cycling life of SIBs. On the contrary, the morphology of the Fe7S8@NC@C electrode is completely fragmented after 100 cycles, and although additional Na and F are also detected, the F content is low and insufficient for the formation of a stable SEI film to enhance cycling stability (Fig. S7f and S7i†).\nIn order to further explore the reaction kinetics of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C, CV curves were recorded at various scanning rates. In Fig. 6a, the cathodic and anodic peaks display similar positions and shapes, indicating that Se-Fe7S8@NC@C has no significant polarization. Additionally, the peak current (i) rises as the scanning speed (v) increases, which indicates that Se-Fe7S8@NC@C possesses obvious pseudocapacitive behavior in the sodiation/desodiation process. The i and v are in accordance with the below formulas:\nIn general, the storage mechanisms of the pseudocapacitive control process and the diffusion control process are represented by b values of 1 and 0.5, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b, the b values for peaks 1–4 are 0.76, 0.86, 1.03 and 0.91, respectively, suggesting that both behaviors occur synchronously in the sodiation/desodiation process. Formula (3) is used to calculate the contribution ratio of the two control processes:\nk 1 v and k2v1/2 represent the pseudocapacitive control contribution and diffusion control contribution, respectively. The pseudocapacitive contribution reaches 97.08% at a scanning speed of 1.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 6c). As exhibited in Fig. 6d, when the scanning speeds are 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mV s−1, the pseudocapacitive contributions are 93.63%, 94.35%, 95.36%, 96.15% and 97.08%, respectively, which means that the pseudocapacitive contribution dominates at various scanning rates, resulting in high-rate capability for Se-Fe7S8@NC@C.\nIn Fig. 6e, the electronic impedance spectra of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C are displayed. The Rct of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C (129.95 Ω) is lower than that of Fe7S8@NC@C (148.56 Ω). Furthermore, the Na+-ion diffusion dynamics (DNa+) is usually calculated using the following formulas:\nAccording to Formula (4), the Warburg factors of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C are fitted in Fig. 6f. Based on Formula (5), the DNa+ values of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C and Fe7S8@NC@C are calculated to be 2.01 × 10−12 and 7.42 × 10−13, respectively. Obviously, Se-Fe7S8@NC@C shows a larger DNa+ value, implying that Se-doping can greatly enhance the ion/electron transfer kinetics and the conductivity.\nThe sodium storage properties of Se-Fe7S8@NC@C were researched thoroughly via ex situ XRD. The GCD profiles are marked with six charge/discharge states in Fig. 7a [a: open-circuit voltage (OCV); b and c: discharged to 0.5 V and 0.3 V, respectively; d–f: charged to 1.0 V, 1.6 V and 2.5 V, respectively]. The XRD maps for various states are displayed in Fig. 7b. There are three strong signal peaks located at 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1°, attributed to Cu collection (04-0836). It is noteworthy that the weak signal peaks located at 30.0°, 34.0°, 44.1° and 53.3° are detected initially (a), which correspond to the (211) plane of Fe7S8 (24-0220). In the sodiated states of discharge to 0.5 V, a weak diffraction peak at about 28.5° is detected, which belongs to the (111) plane of FeS2 (42–1340), while in the sodiated states of discharge to 0.3 V, the (220) plane of Na2S (47–1698) and the (110) plane of Fe (ref. ) (06-0696) are detected. In the desodiated states, the diffraction peak of iron gradually decreases. The detailed reaction process is illustrated in Fig. 7c. Based on the above analysis, the sodium storage mechanism of the as-prepared Se-Fe7S8@NC@C can be explained as follows:\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The refined detailed lattice parameters and elemental occupancies are listed in Table S2–5.† Ni, Mn, Cu and Sn elements occupy the octahedral 3b Wyckoff sites, indicating the incorporation of Cu2+ and Sn4+ into the TM layers. Fig. 1c demonstrates the refined O3-NaNMCS crystal structure along the b axis. The refined lattice parameters shown in Table S6† indicate that the distance between the O–O in the adjacent TMO2 layers increases from 2.25 Å to 2.36 Å after doping, with a slight contraction of Na layers from 3.10 Å to 2.98 Å. This is mainly due to the enhanced electrostatic interaction between Na and O, thus leading to contracted TM layers and a robust structure for Na+ storage.\nTo realize the local structures of O3-NaNMCS and O3-NaNM, the Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Ni and Mn K-edges were fitted by the least-squares method, as presented in Fig. 1d and e and Fig. S3.† The diagram shows two dynamic peaks which can be attributed to the first coordination of TM–O and the second coordination of TM–TM, respectively. The corresponding fitting parameters listed in Table S7–10† illustrate that both the Mn–O and Ni–O bond lengths corresponding to the first coordination shell for O3-NaNMCS are increased compared with O3-NaNM, which is consistent with the XRD refined results shown in Table S6.† This implies a weakened covalency of the TM–O bond and more electrons around oxygen, contributing to an enhanced electrostatic force between Na and O.\nThe projected density of states (DOS) was analyzed to further explore the electronic states of O3-NaNM and O3-NaNMCS as shown in Fig. 1f and Fig. S4.† Sn4+ filled with d10 electrons is not involved in the hybridization with the O 2p orbital, forming Sn–O ionic bonds, which facilitates electron delocalization in TMO2 slabs. This results in a higher electron density around O to enhance the interaction between sodium and oxygen, which corresponds to the slight shrinkage of the Na layers of O3-NaNMCS shown in Table S6.† The Cu 3d orbital overlaps with the O 2p state near the Fermi level (EF), indicating a distinct orbital hybridization of the O 2p orbital with the Cu 3d orbital, which makes available redox pairs for the Cu 3d orbital. The total DOS for both materials indicates that the band gap disappears after Cu2+ and Sn4+ co-doping, which can be attributed to the involvement of Cu 3d in the orbital hybridization near the EF of O3-NaNMCS. The smaller band gap is associated with the enhanced conductivity of O3-NaNMCS.\nAs illustrated in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 2a and d, the particle sizes of O3-NaNM and O3-NaNMCS are about 1–2 μm. This is similar to the particle sizes of O3-NaNMC and O3-NaNMS shown in Fig. S5.† The lattice spacing of the crystal face (003) is determined to be 5.35 Å in O3-NaNM and 5.34 Å in O3-NaNMCS by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images in Fig. 2b and e. The corresponding Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) images are shown in Fig. 2c and f with the indicated crystal facets (003) and (006). As shown in Fig. 2g and Fig. S6,† the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images confirm the uniform distribution of the elements in O3-NaNMCS and O3-NaNM.\n\nStructure evolution and reaction mechanism\nIn situ XRD of O3-NaNM and O3-NaNMCS was performed in a voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V in the first cycle, as shown in contour plots and XRD plots (Fig. 3 and Fig. S7,† respectively). During the initial charge to 4.0 V, O3-NaNM gradually transforms into a hexagonal P3 phase, as the (003) and (006) diffraction peaks shift continuously to lower angles along with the disappearance of the (104) peak and the appearance of the (105) peak. The P3 phase remains until about 3.7 V, while the (003) peak shifts slightly to a higher angle at the end of charging, corresponding to the contraction of the c-lattice parameter. Furthermore, the appearance of a new diffraction peak at ∼42.5° is ascribed to the formation of a monoclinic O3′ phase. Upon discharging from 4.0 V to 2.0 V, the phase gradually transfers from O3′ to P3 and finally returns to the O3 phase. This is in contrast to the phase transition behavior of O3-NaNMCS shown in Fig. 3b, which shows reversible O3–P3–O3 phase evolution upon cycling. The absence of the O3′ phase implies the enhanced structure stability of O3-NaNMCS, which is rewarded from the enhanced electrostatic adsorption between Na and O in the DOS results shown in Fig. 1f. It can inhibit the sliding of TMO2 slabs and stabilize the host structure for Na+ extraction at the end of charging. This is further confirmed by the in situ XRD patterns of O3-NaNMC and O3-NaNMS shown in Fig. S8 and S9,† revealing that Cu and Sn co-doping can mitigate the P3 → O3′ phase transition.\nThe charge compensation mechanism of O3-NaNMCS in different states was elucidated using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra. Upon charging to 4.0 V, the Ni K-edge exhibits a clear shift towards the high energy region and its absorption spectrum overlaps with the LiNiO2 reference shown in Fig. 4a, indicating oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4b, the Mn K-edge shows no significant changes, indicating that Mn remains in the tetravalent state as presented in MnO2. It is noted that the XANES spectra of the Cu K-edge move to a higher energy region after being fully charged, which manifests the oxidation of Cu2+ to Cu3+. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were also carried out and the variation tendency of Ni 2p, Mn 2p and Cu 2p XPS spectra shown in Fig. S10† is consistent with the XAS results. Thus, the redox of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Cu2+/Cu3+ is responsible for the charge compensation of O3-NaNMCS during charging and discharging, in which Sn4+ is electrochemically inactive, as confirmed by the Sn 3d spectra in ex situ XPS as shown in Fig. S10d.†\n\nElectrochemical performance and Na+ kinetics\nThe electrochemical performances of O3-NaNM and O3-NaNMCS were evaluated in the Na cells. The initial three galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of O3-NaNM and O3-NaNMCS are shown in Fig. 5a and b at 50 mA g−1 within 2.0–4.0 V. O3-NaNM delivers an initial discharge capacity of 130.0 mA h g−1, but exhibits multiple voltage platforms, which can be attributed to its multiple phase transitions and Na+/vacancy ordering. Comparatively, O3-NaNMCS shows smoother charge/discharge curves with a reversible capacity of 115.3 mA h g−1, indicating its depressed P3 → O3′ phase transition as shown in Fig. 3. The relatively reduced capacity is ascribed to the presence of inactive Sn4+. In general, Na+/vacancy ordered structures are often manifested due to the strong Na+–Na+ interaction. Thus, the strong forces between Na and O in O3-NaNMCS confirmed by refined XRD results shown in Table S6† may interfere with electrostatic interactions between Na+, and favor the blocked Na+/vacancy arrangement. In addition, the initial discharge capacity of O3-NaNMC and O3-NaNMS is ∼120 mA h g−1 as shown in Fig. S11.† Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves shown in Fig. 5c and S12† further confirm that Na+/vacancy ordering can be restrained by Cu and Sn co-substitution.\nThe Na+ diffusion coefficients (DNa) of O3-NaNM and O3-NaNMCS were evaluated by GITT tests. As presented in Fig. 5d, the measured diffusion coefficients of Na+ in O3-NaNM range from 10−14.9 to 10−13.1 cm2 s−1, and the values of Na+ diffusion coefficients vary from 10−13.6 to 10−13.0 cm2 s−1 for O3-NaNMCS. The higher minimum of diffusion coefficients is typically associated with interference in phase transitions and Na+/vacancy ordering during extraction and insertion of Na+. The values of DNa for O3-NaNMC and O3-NaNMS, plotted in Fig. S13a and b,† respectively, are also higher than that of O3-NaNM. The corresponding GITT curves are exhibited in Fig. S13c–f,† similar to the charge/discharge curves. Fig. 5e reveals the outstanding rate capability of O3-NaNMCS versus O3-NaNM, which is enhanced by the increased Na+ diffusion kinetics and better electron transfer induced by Cu2+ as shown in Fig. 1f. O3-NaNMCS delivers high reversible capacities of 129.2, 126.3, 123.8, 119.4, 115.5 and 108.5 mA h g−1 at various current densities ranging from 20 to 1000 mA g−1.\nThe long-term cycling stability of O3-NaNM and O3-NaNMCS was examined at 200 mA g−1 over a voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. As displayed in Fig. 5f, O3-NaNMCS presents a promising capacity retention of 80.7% after 500 cycles, with a capacity loss of approximately 0.039% per cycle, in sharp contrast to the capacity retention of 55.7% for O3-NaNM. The capacity retention of O3-NaNMC and O3-NaNMS at 200 mA g−1 was also significantly higher than that of O3-NaNM (Fig. S14a and b†). Additionally, O3-NaNMCS shows a capacity retention of 92.7% after 150 cycles at a low current density (50 mA g−1), considerably higher than the capacity retention of only 72.0% for O3-NaNM (Fig. S14c†). The remarkable rate and cycling performance of O3-NaNMCS can be ascribed to its excellent structure stability during sodiation/desodiation.\nFurthermore, to evaluate the practical application of O3-NaNMCS, a sodium ion full cell with hard carbon (HC) as the anode was fabricated (Fig. 5g). Fig. S15a† shows the charge/discharge curves of the half-cell for O3-NaNMCS and HC which was presodiated by discharging to 0.01 V. As shown in Fig. S15b,† the HC//O3-NaNMCS full cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 117 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 over the initial cycles. Even at 200 mA g−1, the full cell demonstrates outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90.5% over 200 cycles as shown in Fig. 5h.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The optimized lattice constants are a = 9.089 Å, b = 3.800 Å, c = 8.532 Å and β = 101.82°, which are in good agreement with the experimental values of a = 9.118 Å, b = 3.795 Å, c = 8.563 Å and β = 101.55°. The relative errors are less than ±0.6%, indicating that our selections for computation, including the pseudopotentials, XC functional and Ueff values, can provide reliable results for electrochemical and electronic properties.\nWith the same computational settings, the structural optimization of the doubled supercells with 4 formula units (48 atoms) for NTO, NTNO and NTVO were then performed. Table 1 lists the optimized lattice constants and cell volumes in comparison with the available experimental data. As mentioned above, the configuration with the lowest total energy was selected among the three different configurations for the doped NTO supercells. In Table 1, we list the experimental lattice constants for Na2Ti,2.97Nb,0.03O7, which has a significantly lower concentration of doping Nb ions compared with our case of Na2Ti,2.75Nb,0.25O7. It was found that the cell volume was slightly expanded by Nb doping with a relative volume expansion rate of 0.91%, estimated by rvol = (VNTNO − VNTO)/VNTO × 100%, in accordance with the experiment. This value of rvol is larger than the value of 0.19% estimated from experiments, due to the higher concentration of doping Nb ions in this work. The volume expansion by Nb doping is attributed to larger ionic radius of Nb4+ (0.68 Å) or Nb5+ (0.64 Å) and Ti3+ (0.67 Å) than that of Ti4+ (0.605 Å). In contrast, V doping was found to shrink the cell volume with a rvol value of 0.42% because of smaller ionic radii of the V4+ (0.58 Å) and V5+ (0.54 Å) ions.\nIn the next step, we identified the intermediate phases formed by inserting additional Na ions into the host compounds NTO, NTNO and NTVO, for suitability in the charge/discharge process in SIBs. As expected from ΔBVS analysis, the content of additional Na ions could be allowed to vary between 0 and 2, forming intermediate phases of Na2+xTO, with insignificant structural variation. Fig. 2 shows the variation tendencies of lattice constants and volumes of the doubled supercells for Na2+xTO, Na2+xTNO and Na2+xTVO, with increasing Na content x from 0 to 2 with an interval of 0.25. It should be noted that there exists numerous configurations for Na insertion at each value of Na content x, and the lowest energy configuration was picked out with performing structural optimization (see Fig. S1–S3 for final configurations).†\nFor all three compounds, the lattice constants a and b were found to increase gradually with increasing Na content x, whereas the lattice constant c, i.e., the interlayer distance, was found to decrease gradually until x = 1.5 and then it decreased rapidly, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Of course, some wavy features were observed. This indicates that the interaction between the step layers can be enhanced via the attractive Na–O ionic bonding by insertion of additional Na ions into the interlayer space, while the repulsion between Na ions and TM ions is dominant in the lateral directions. As can be seen in Fig. 2(b), the supercell volumes were found to overall increase with increasing Na content x from 0 to 1.5, then the volumes decrease abruptly at x = 1.75 and again increase at x = 2 for NTO, NTNO and NTVO. The abrupt decrease of volume at x = 1.75 is associated with the rapid decrease of the interlayer distance due to the enhancement of layer–layer interactions. Across the whole range of Na content, the volumes of Nb-doped NTO supercells are larger while the volumes of V-doped NTO supercells are smaller, than those of NTO supercells, an effect ascribed to the ionic radii of TM ions as discussed previously. To check the cycling stability during charge/discharge processes, we evaluated the relative volume expansion rate rvol with respect to the volumes of the host compounds at x = 0 as shown in Fig. 2(c). The variation tendencies are similar to those of the cell volumes. Most importantly, the maximal values of rvol found at x = 1.5 are below 3%, being much smaller than other intercalation-type electrode materials (usually 5 ∼ 6%) as well as alloy-type electrode materials. This indicates that the NTO-related compounds under study can exhibit superior cycling stabilities.\n\n3.2 Energetics and electrode potential\nThe formability of the intermediate phases can be assessed by calculating their formation energies from the hosts and Na bulk in the body-centered cubic (bcc) phase as follows, where ENa(bulk) is the total energy of the relevant compound and M stands for Ti, Ti,2.75/3Nb,0.25/3 and Ti,2.75/3V,0.25/3. The negative value of Ef indicates spontaneous formation of the intermediate phase from the host and Na bulk, while the positive value is indicative of their endothermic formation, i.e., non-spontaneous formation. Fig. 3(a) displays the calculated formation energy curves as a function of Na content x, ranging from 0.25 to 2. It was found that the formation energies varied between −0.9 eV and −0.3 eV, indicating certain formations of the intermediate phases. With increasing Na content x, the Ef values were shown to decrease gradually until x = 1.5 and then increase slightly in magnitude, implying the weakening of formability, which is in accordance with the variation of the cell volumes. In the meantime, the formability could be weakened going from NTO to V-doped and to Nb-doped NTO compounds since the Ef values were decreased in magnitude across the whole Na content range.\nTo check the binding strength between the host and inserted Na ions, the binding energy Eb per Na atom was calculated using the following equation,\nwhere ENa(atom) is the total energy of the isolated Na atom calculated using the cubic supercell with a lattice constant of 15 Å and only the Γ point in the first BZ. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the binding energies could vary between −2.6 eV and −2.0 eV with the same variation tendencies as the formation energies: the binding strength was found to gradually decrease with increasing Na content, with the highest to lowest going from NTO to NTVO and to NTNO.\nWe also estimated the relative stability of the intermediate phases with respect to the starting (x = 0) and ending (x = 2) compounds for additional Na insertion. To this end, the formation enthalpies were calculated using the following equation,\nwhere Na2M3O7 and Na4M3O7 are the initial and final compounds for Na insertion. Fig. 4(a) shows the calculated convex hull curves for the formation enthalpies of NTO, NTNO and NTVO as functions of Na content x ranging between 0 and 2. For the three kinds of compounds, the intermediate phases with x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 were found to be stable because their formation enthalpy values were laid on the convex hull. However, other phases with x = 1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 were found to be unstable with respect to the two end compounds, i.e., these phases could not be formed in reality during the charge/discharge process. The intermediate phase with the lowest formation enthalpy was observed at x = 0.75 for NTO but at x = 1 for the NTNO and NTVO compounds. Moreover, the formation enthalpies of NTNO and NTVO were overall lower compared with NTO due to the weakening of the interactions between cations and anions by Nb or V doping. Also, the Nb-doped NTNO phases exhibited slightly lower formation energies than the V-doped NTVO phases, indicating that the former phases can be formed more easily than the latter ones. This can be associated with the fact that the interaction strength between the Nb5+,4+ cations and O2− anions is higher than that between the V5+,4+ cations and O2−, leading to the enhanced relative stability of the NTNO intermediate phases compared with the NTVO ones.\nWith these stable intermediate phases identified by the convex hull, we calculated the step-like electrode potential with respect to the Na/Na+ counter electrode. The electrode potential between the adjacent phases at xi and xj could be calculated using the total energies of the relevant phases as follows,\nwhere e is the elementary charge. Fig. 4(b) shows the determined step-like electrode potentials for NTO, NTNO and NTVO as functions of specific capacity, which varies between 0 to 177.6, 171.2 and 177.2 mA h g−1, respectively. Such reduction of specific capacity with Nb or V doping is due to their heavier atomic weights compared to Ti. It was found that the electrode potential in the plateau region became 0.05 V higher by Nb doping and 0.11 V higher by V doping compared with NTO. The calculated electrode potential steps for NTO and NTNO were in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed electrode potential profiles. It is worth noting that the discharge curves look like having long plateau portions, indicating that the materials under study could be used as electrode active materials in SIBs rather than as capacitor electrode materials in SICs. It turned out from our calculations, that the energy density of SIBs employing NTO as the anode material could be slightly lowered by Nb or V doping due to the reduction of specific capacity and the rise in electrode potential.\n\n3.3 Electronic properties\nFrom previous theoretical and experimental works, it was found that NTO itself has a wide band gap of 3.5–3.7 eV and therefore it is an electrically insulating compound. This is unfavorable for electron transfer during the charge/discharge process, and thus a conductive agent such as carbon black should be added to the electrode. When doping with Nb or V, the band gap can be expected to decrease due to the increased valence electron density, thereby improving the electron conductivity. To check the electronic conduction improvement, we calculated the electronic density of states (DOS) in the compounds. The initial and final compounds Na2Ti3O7 and Na4Ti3O7, denoted as NTO-2 and NTO-4, and their Nb- or V-doped counterparts were selected for electronic structure calculations. Fig. 5 shows the atom-resolved partial DOS of these compounds, calculated using the PBEsol XC functional and DFT + U method.\nIn our calculations, the band gap of NTO-2 was determined to be 3.37 eV, which is very close to the experimental value. The final compound NTO-4 formed by inserting additional Na ions, showed a lower band gap of 2.78 eV, possibly due to the increased density of conduction band states originating from additional Na ions. When doping with Nb, the band gaps were found to be slightly reduced to lower than 0.1–0.2 eV for both NTNO-2 (3.20 eV) and NTNO-4 (2.68 eV) with almost no preservation of the DOS shape compared with the undoped counterparts. From the orbital-resolved partial DOS analysis, it was found that the conduction band states were dominated by Ti 3d and Nb 4d equally (see Fig. S4 and S5†). Meanwhile, the V-doped compounds, NTVO-2 and NTVO-4, exhibited much lower band gaps of 2.40 and 1.66 eV, respectively, with the characteristic peaks originating from V 3d near the conduction band minimum (CBM) (see also Fig. S6 and S7†). As shown in Fig. 6, for the integrated local density of states, the valence band states close to the valence band maximum (VBM) were composed of O s states with minor contribution from the TM d states, while the conduction band states close to CBM were attributed to the TM d states with minor contribution of the O p states (see Fig. S8†). Based on the calculation results, it can be concluded that the electron conductivity can surely be improved by Nb or V doping.\nTo get an understanding of electron transfer upon Na ion insertion during the charge/discharge process, we evaluated the Löwdin charges of each atom, as listed in Table S1.† In NTO-2, the average charges were found to be 0.73, 1.5 and −0.8 for Na, Ti and O, respectively. Upon insertion of 8 Na ions, the average charge of Na ion was slightly reduced to 0.7, while oxygen showed a value increased by −0.9. Interestingly, 4 Ti ions kept the charge as ∼1.5 but 8 Ti ions exhibited the reduced value of ∼1.2, confirming the partial reduction of Ti ions upon Na insertion for the discharge process, 3Ti4+ → Ti4+2Ti3+. In the case of NTNO-2, one Ti ion close to Nb had a smaller charge of 1.3 compared to the average value 1.5 in the other Ti ions, implying the reduction of the Ti ion upon Ti/Nb exchange for the sake of charge compensation, i.e., 2Ti4+ → Nb5+Ti3+. When inserting Na ions into NTNO-2, 4 Ti ions also maintained the charge state as 1.5, while 7 Ti ions and Nb ion exhibited a reduction, indicating the partial reduction during the discharge process, 2.5Ti4+0.25Ti3+0.25Nb5+ → Ti4+1.75Ti3+0.25Nb4+. On the contrary, none of the 11 Ti ions had a change in charge state from 1.5 upon Ti/V exchange, thereby indicating that the V ion was in the V4+ state. In NTVO-4, 4 Ti ions had an atomic charge of ∼1.5 while the remaining Ti ions and the V ion showed a reduction, thereby indicating the reduction of TM ions like 2.75Ti4+0.25V4+ → Ti4+1.75Ti3+0.25V3+.\n\n3.4 Ion conductivity\nThe Na ion conductivity determines the rate capability and cycling life of SIBs, together with the relative volume expansion rate. Therefore, we investigated the Na ion diffusion, which was expected to occur naturally within the interlayer space and according to the vacancy-mediated mechanism like in most insertion-type layered electrode materials. The 2 × 2 × 1 supercells were used to get more reasonable insight into the Na ion conduction. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), we suggested 4 different pathways to consider all the possible ways for the Na ion migration within the interlayer space; (1) pathway of ascending the step in the (100) direction (Path 1), pathway of horizontal moving on the step in the (010) direction (Path 2), pathway of diagonal moving on the step in the (110) direction (Path 3 and Path 4). We estimated the activation energies for Na ion diffusion along these pathways by applying the NEB method. It should be noted that the Na ion diffusion across the layer was not allowed, undoubtedly due to obstacles formed by the MO6 octahedra and thus much higher activation energy.\nFig. 7(c) displays the calculated energy profiles for Na ion migration along these suggested pathways. Along Path 1, the activation energies were determined to be 0.75, 0.77 and 0.79 eV for NTO, NTNO and NTVO, respectively. These are relatively high compared with those along other pathways, indicating that the Na migration ascending the step could not occur in reality. The horizontal Na ion migration along the (010) direction (Path 2) produced the energy difference curves with a two-peaks feature, for which the activation energies were calculated to be 0.30, 0.25 and 0.22 eV for NTO, NTVO and NTNO, respectively. For the case of NTO, although slightly underestimated, the calculated value was in good agreement with the experimental value of 0.39 eV. The reduction of activation energy by Nb or V doping, indicating the improvement of Na ion conductivity, could be attributed to the enhancement of cation–cation repulsion. Meanwhile, along Path 3 in the diagonal direction, the activation energy was found to be 0.47 eV for NTO and slightly reduced by Nb or V doping. Also, the activation energy along Path 4 was reduced from 0.22 eV for NTO to 0.21 eV by V doping and to 0.19 eV by Nb doping. To sum up, the Na ion conductivity on the step layer can be enhanced by V doping and furthermore by Nb doping. Such enhancement of Na ion conductivity by Nb or V doping can be ascribed to the enhancement of repulsion between the Na cation and TM cations, occurring the charge state change of 2Ti4+ → Nb5+Ti3+ or V4+Ti4+.\nFinally we estimated the diffusion coefficients using the calculated activation energies Ea and the Arrhenius equation, D = a2νexp(−Ea/kBT) with a ≈ 4 Å, ν ≈ 1011 Hz and kBT = 0.026 eV at room temperature. The activation energies for Na ion migration only, along Path 2 were considered here. Table 2 presents the calculated diffusion coefficients of NTO, NTNO and NTVO, together with other electrochemical properties determined in this work. They exhibited relatively high diffusion coefficients of 1.54 × 10−9, 3.09 × 10−8 and 9.91 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 along the horizontal path, confirming the enhancement of Na ion diffusibility by Nb or V doping. As presented in Table 2, the relative volume expansion rate, specific capacity and electrode potential, could be weakened but the electronic and ionic conductivities could be enhanced by Nb or V doping.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nTable 1 and Fig. 1 display all the XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement profiles of all the samples. All diffraction peaks can be readily indexed as cubic spinel of CoFe2O4, which agrees well with the conventional CoFe2O4 spinel with the Fd3m space group (JCPDS no. 22-1086). No additional peaks are observed, demonstrating the purity of the CoFe2O4 produced. Overall, the intensity peaks become sharper as the calcination temperature increases, indicating that the crystallite size increases with temperature. The crystallite sizes (L) for all samples were calculated using Scherrer's equation: where, k is a constant (0.9394), λ is the Cu-Kα radiation wavelength (1.5148 Å), β is the full width at half-maximum on the XRD peak in radians and θ is the angle of diffraction. M700, M800 and M900 crystallite sizes were calculated to be 26.26, 29.84 and 31.36 nm, respectively. Moreover, the lattice parameters, a for the calcination treatment for M700, M800 and M900 slightly decrease by 8.37, 8.36 and 8.33 Å, respectively. This phenomenon is typically occurs due to the defects removal such as oxygen vacancies and the lattice contracts during calcination. These findings are similar to the results from a previous study.\nRaman spectroscopy (Fig. 2) was also carried out to confirm the nature of CoFe2O4. Inverse spinel CoFe2O4 shows an A1g symmetry at 684 cm−1 associated with the tetrahedral sub-lattice and octahedral sub-lattice at the peak at 615 cm−1. The band at 473 cm−1 is attributed to asymmetric bending of Fe (Co)–O. Conversely, the Raman band at 291 cm−1 is attributed to the Eg symmetric bending of Fe (Co)–O.\nThe formation of CoFe2O4 spinel was also supported by the FTIR spectra (Fig. 3). The appearance of two peaks at 570 and 415 cm−1 is closely linked to the stretching vibrations of metal oxide in the octahedral site Co2+–O2− and tetrahedral site Fe3+–O2−, respectively. These two typical bands can be detected in almost all CoFe2O4 structures. However, at relatively higher temperatures, the peaks become sharper and narrower due to lattice distortion minimization and improve the crystallinity. This fact is in agreement with XRD.\nXPS spectroscopy was explained the elemental composition of CoFe2O4 and displays the existence of the Co, Fe and O element as showed in Fig. 4. The deconvoluted spectra of the Co 2p (Fig. 4a) spectra show peaks due to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 at binding energy of 779.71 and 794.99 eV respectively. In addition, the satellites peaks at 785.38 eV and 802.83 eV indicated the presence of unpaired 3d electron of the high spin Co2+. In Fig. 4b exposed Fe 2p spectrum and displayed the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks at 710.54 and 723.58 eV, respectively. These results support the presence of Fe3+ in the inverse spinel CoFe2O4. The two peaks at 529.42 and 532.31 eV in a single O 1s fine spectra (Fig. 4c) can be considered as the metal–O bond and consistent with oxygen in the defect, respectively.\nSEM images (Fig. 5) showed a remarkable morphological change as the calcination temperatures increased with average particle size ranging from 1.1 to 3.6 μm. Sample M700 (Fig. 5a) shows an octahedron shape with a particle size of ∼1.1 μm, and sample M800 (Fig. 5b) shows a well-defined octahedral shape, with a faceted surface and size of about ∼2.27 μm. As the temperature increased to 900 °C (M900 (Fig. 5c)), the particle sizes increased to ∼3.64 μm and the morphology became flattened, giving rise to new facets. This condition appears inevitable, primarily because of the interaction between magnetic particles at higher calcination temperatures.\nThe Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the samples was determined using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms measured at 77.3 K (Fig. 6). From the obtained isotherms, all the samples show type IV adsorption isotherms which indicate mesoporous structures. Furthermore, all samples show H3 hysteresis loop which show the characteristic of slit shape features. The open loop at the isotherm may be caused by slow adsorption at narrow pores which exhibited from slit shape features. The specific surface areas of M700, M800, and M900 were found to be 2.6017, 3.6244, and 7.7535 m2 g−1, respectively. In addition, the measured pore volumes of the samples were 0.0020 cm3 g−1 for M700, 0.0032 cm3 g−1 for M800 and 0.0082 cm3 g−1. It is clear that higher calcination temperatures resulted in an increase in the BET surface area due to structural and morphological changes, indicating the emergence of a new facet as shown in the SEM image.\nFurther analysis was conducted using TEM images (Fig. 7). The crystalline CoFe2O4 structure demonstrates that the sample M900 possessed dense agglomerates, as illustrated in Fig. 7a. Lattice fringes of CoFe2O4 (Fig. 7b) indicate an interplanar spacing of 0.25 nm belonging to the (311) plane with a cubic phase, which agreed well with the XRD data.\nCV was conducted for all electrodes between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 8). Throughout the first scan, all electrodes showed a broad-ranging cathodic peak at 0.6 V, consistent with the irreversible emergence of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI); electrolyte deterioration causes a significant irreversible loss of capacity during the first discharge process. The shift between 0.3 and 0.8 V during the subsequent cycle is attributed to the reduction of Fe3+ and Co2+ to Fe0 and Co0, respectively, and the reversible reaction to form Na2O (eqn (2)):\nIn the anodic process, the oxidation peaks at 0.8 and 1.2 V are attributed to the reformation of CoFe2O4 via the oxidation of Fe0 and Co0 to Fe3+ and Co2+, respectively. All the CV curves almost overlapped during the subsequent cycle, indicating high reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. The selected cycles of the charge and discharge profiles for all electrodes at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 is shown in Fig. 9. The charge and discharge plateau for all electrodes is aligned with the CV peaks. The initial capacity of discharge and charge capacities of the electrode are 617 mA h g−1 (M700), 839 mA h g−1 (M800), and 350 mA h g−1 (M900), respectively. Based on these result, M800 electrode deliver higher discharge capacity due to the uniform morphology, suggesting that large contact interface between electrolyte and electrodes, which lead to high irreversible Na+ consumption. Contrarily, the large particle size required a longer time for ion transfer into the particles and faces diffusion limitation of Na+ within a single large particle. All electrodes display irreversible capacity loss owing to the formation of the SEI layer and electrolyte degradation during the first cycle. However, there is difference for the second discharge curves of the sample M900 and sample M800 and M700 due to considerable loss in specific capacity of the M900 sample. This result agreed well with the capacity value of M900 sample which is lower that M800 and M700.\nFig. 10a demonstrates the cycling behaviour of all electrodes at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. At the initial cycle, the M800 electrode exhibits the highest discharge capacity (839 mA h g−1), followed by the M700 (617 mA h g−1) and M900 (350 mA h g−1) electrodes. For the M800 electrode, a preserved discharge capacity of 98 mA h g−1 was calculated after 100 cycles, whereas the discharge capacity for the M700 (76 mA h g−1) and M900 (69 mA h g−1) electrodes. The reversible discharge capacity of the M800 electrode was 224 mA h g−1 after the second cycle and continued to decline throughout the 100 cycles, which was possibly due the activation and stabilisation processes within the electrode. In this regard, the observed capacity values of the M800 electrode remain high compared to the other electrodes. Similar trends were also observed for the M700 and M900 electrodes. After 100 cycles, the discharge capacities of the M700 and M900 electrodes were 76 mA h g−1 and 69 mA h g−1, respectively. According to previous reported, fast capacity fading of materials due to structure collapse and dissolution of materials may occur in electrolyte decomposition. As a result, the improvement in cycling stability of materials is attributed to a delay in structure decay. The specific capacity retained by the M800 electrode after 100 cycles was 88%, compared to 87% and 80% retained by the M700 and M900 electrodes, respectively. Clearly, the initial coulombic efficiencies were 48%, 33% and 24% for the M700, M800 and M900 electrodes, respectively, owing to uncontrolled SEI layer formations. After several cycles, all the electrodes demonstrated high coulombic efficiencies of more than 99% as the SEI layer formation stabilised during cycling. The rate capability of all the electrodes was also determined at different current rates, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. 10b). The M800 electrode delivered the discharge capacities of 171, 125, 103, 87, 73 and 108 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 0.2 A g−1, respectively. Even though the rate returned to 0.2 A g−1, the discharge capacity of M800 electrode could still display the maximum reversible capacity, suggesting stable cycling performance. However, the consecutive cycling performances of the M700 and M900 electrodes were unsatisfactory. After 66 cycles at various charge and discharge rates, the discharge capacity of the M800 electrode at 0.2 A g−1 remained 108 mA h g−1, representing approximately 87% capacity recovery. Hence, the improved cycle and rate performance of the M800 electrode is superior to that of the M700 and M900 electrodes, may be due to the well-defined octahedral shape of M800 delivers sufficient active sites for Na-ion, thus reducing the electron and ion transport pathways.\nThe improved electrochemical performance of CoFe2O4 (M800) could be assigned to the high crystallinity and homogeneous distribution of particles, leading to a high surface area, facilitating electrode–electrolyte interaction and affording increased active sites for electrochemical reactions. The well-dispersed particles are beneficial for excellent performance because they provide a short transport length and a substantial contact area between the active material and electrolyte. In this regard, the sample must afford a high surface area for promoting the adsorption and storage of Na-ions. M900 presented a large particle size as seen from the SEM image, which in turn severely affect the performance because it is difficult for ions to diffuse into bulk materials. It suggests that increasing the length of diffusion pathways of Na-ions and resulting in unsatisfactory CoFe2O4 behaviour. This method is well recognised for its cost-effective preparation because the products can be produced in large quantities in a short session. Scientifically, the salt melts during the preparation method owing to the high rate of ion absorption and high ability to dissolve, which can speed up the rate of the reactions. To the best of our knowledge, systematic investigations on the parameters influencing the formation and characteristics of CoFe2O4 during the molten salt method are still lacking. Overall, the discharge capacity of CoFe2O4 discovered in this study is preferable to those previously reported (Table 2). The synthesis of molten salts at low temperatures represents a template and surfactant free, cost-effective, simple and an efficient method for large-scale production. As a result of this study, new insights can be gained for future studies on CoFe2O4 as an anode material for Na-ion batteries.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthesis of spinel CoFe2O4\nA spinel CoFe2O4 was synthesised by adapting a previously described molten salt method. Highly pure cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, ≥99.0%), ferric chloride (FeCl3, ≥98%), potassium chloride (KCl, 99.5%) and sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.5%) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were ground with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) purchased from Merck Millipore using an agate mortar, and heated overnight at 120 °C under vacuum. The CoFe2O4 powders were obtained by calcinating them at 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C for 6 h at a heating rate 5 °C min−1 in air and then labelled as M700, M800 and M900, respectively. Finally, the powders were washed, filtered and dried at 100 °C for 12 h (under vacuum).\n\n2.2 Material characterisation\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample was obtained using Rigaku Miniflex II under monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5148 Å) from 5° to 80°. The morphology and structure of the CoFe2O4 were viewed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-6360LA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM; TECNAI G2 F20). The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using Shimadzu IR Tracer-100. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the chemical states of the elements present in the CoFe2O4 using an Axis Ultra DLD XPS, Kratos and obtained spectra were fitted using CASA software. Then, Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw) was performed using 532 nm excitation extended with 0.1% power-laser measurements.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The CoFe2O4 electrode is prepared by mixing 75 wt% active material, 15 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was applied onto a copper foil with an electrode mass loading of ∼2 mg cm−2 and dried at 100 °C overnight. The coin-type cell (CR2032) was assembled in an argon-filled glove box (MBRAUN Unilab) with sodium metal as the counter electrode and glass fibre as the separator. The electrolyte solution was prepared using 1 M NaClO4 (98%) in a mixture of propylene carbonate (anhydrous, 99.7%) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonates (99%). Cyclic voltammetry (CV; CHI 700E) and galvanostatic charge and discharge (NEWARE battery analyser) were controlled in a range of 0.01–3.00 V voltage versus Na/Na+.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthesis of spinel CoFe2O4\nA spinel CoFe2O4 was synthesised by adapting a previously described molten salt method. Highly pure cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, ≥99.0%), ferric chloride (FeCl3, ≥98%), potassium chloride (KCl, 99.5%) and sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.5%) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were ground with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) purchased from Merck Millipore using an agate mortar, and heated overnight at 120 °C under vacuum. The CoFe2O4 powders were obtained by calcinating them at 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C for 6 h at a heating rate 5 °C min−1 in air and then labelled as M700, M800 and M900, respectively. Finally, the powders were washed, filtered and dried at 100 °C for 12 h (under vacuum).\n\n2.2 Material characterisation\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample was obtained using Rigaku Miniflex II under monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5148 Å) from 5° to 80°. The morphology and structure of the CoFe2O4 were viewed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-6360LA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM; TECNAI G2 F20). The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using Shimadzu IR Tracer-100. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the chemical states of the elements present in the CoFe2O4 using an Axis Ultra DLD XPS, Kratos and obtained spectra were fitted using CASA software. Then, Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw) was performed using 532 nm excitation extended with 0.1% power-laser measurements.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The CoFe2O4 electrode is prepared by mixing 75 wt% active material, 15 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was applied onto a copper foil with an electrode mass loading of ∼2 mg cm−2 and dried at 100 °C overnight. The coin-type cell (CR2032) was assembled in an argon-filled glove box (MBRAUN Unilab) with sodium metal as the counter electrode and glass fibre as the separator. The electrolyte solution was prepared using 1 M NaClO4 (98%) in a mixture of propylene carbonate (anhydrous, 99.7%) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonates (99%). Cyclic voltammetry (CV; CHI 700E) and galvanostatic charge and discharge (NEWARE battery analyser) were controlled in a range of 0.01–3.00 V voltage versus Na/Na+.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 Crystal structure of NFVP/C\nA straightforward sol–gel method was utilized in the fabrication of NFVP/C samples. After preheating the dried gel at 300 °C, oxalic acid remains. Oxalic acid played a crucial part in the synthesis, acting as a reductive agent, chelator, and source of carbon. The partial breakdown leads to the formation of residual carbon, which remains intact after the subsequent calcination at 700 °C in N2 and adheres to the surface of NFVP particles, resulting in the creation of NFVP/C. The XRD analysis indicates the NFVP/C is an isostructural with the NASICON-structured compounds. The crystal structure was further confirmed using the GSAS-II software with XRD Rietveld refinement. The crystallographic data supports this conclusion. The data obtained from Na2FeTi(PO4)3 (ref. ) indicates that the refinement process has led to reliability factors of Rwp = 5.83% and Rp = 4.57%. The improved findings suggest that NFVP/C can be precisely classified into the Rc space group, with unit cell dimensions of a = 8.717 (Å), c = 21.84 (Å), and V = 1437.27 (Å). Tables 1–3 contain the presented information on refinement details, atomic coordinates, and selected bond distances. The asymmetric unit of Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3/C consists of six atoms that are crystallographically independent. Within this unit, both V and Fe atoms are found at the same 12c sites. There are Na (1) atoms located in 6b sites. Na (2) is fully occupied in 18e sites with partial occupation, and there are also 18e sites where P atoms are located. Furthermore, the general 36f sites contain two O atoms. The bond distances of V/Fe–O, P–O, and Na–O are within an acceptable range and comparable to those found in other compounds with NASICON structure, suggesting the accuracy of the refinement in determining the structure. The crystalline arrangement of a single unit cell of NFVP is depicted in Fig. 1(b). The presence of Na+ in the cavities demonstrates the formation of a robust and three-dimensional framework through the corner sharing of V/FeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The distinguishing feature of NASICONs, Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3, is the presence of “lantern” units.\nThe morphology and structure information of NFVP/C samples were examined using SEM. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image reveals that the samples synthesized in their original form consist of non-uniform particles measuring in size 0.5–2 μm (Fig. 2(a–c)). The distribution of elements can be analyzed using EDS with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As demonstrated in Fig. 2(d). The NFVP/C contains a uniform distribution of the elements Na, Fe, V, P, and O. Additionally, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the NFVP/C is shown in Fig. 3. In the analysis, the V peak positions in the fitted XPS are observed at 516.9 eV and 523.7 eV, which correspond to the V 2p3/2 and V2p1/2 peaks of V3+.The fitted XPS peak of Fe is also shown. The peaks at 712.7 eV and 726.4 eV represent the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks of Fe3+, respectively. This suggests that both Fe and V exist in the trivalent state within the NFVP/C. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests were conducted on the NFVP/C. As illustrated in the Fig. 4. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm reveal a swift rise in nitrogen adsorption and desorption between 0.5–0.8 relative air pressure, succeeded by a gradual ascent, indicating a typical type IV curve. The BET method calculates the specific surface area as 58.72 square meters per gram. The figure provided illustrates that the pore size, as determined by the BJH technique, is predominantly approximately 7 nanometers.\n\n3.2 Electrochemical performance of Na‖NFVP/C cell\nThe NFVP/C was studied as the cathode material in an Na‖NFVP/C cell to evaluate its electrochemical performance. Fig. 5(a) depicts the Na‖NFVP/C cell's charge–discharge profiles. At a current rate of 0.5C, the voltage range is between 1.5 and 4.5 V. During this range, a charging capacity of 114.8 mA h g−1 and a discharging capacity of 115.2 mA h g−1 are attained, with 1C equivalent to 117 mA h g−1. Even after three cycles, the discharging capacity of 111.4 mA h g−1 remains unchanged. Fig. 5(b) outlines the CV curves illustrating two different reaction platforms at 3.4 V and 4.0 V. After three cycles, the discharge capacity of the sample remains at 111.4 mA h g−1. Fig. 5(b) displays the charge/discharge curves, revealing two separate reaction platforms at 3.4 V and 4.0 V, while the CV curves are shown. Two sets of redox peaks are displayed within the 1.5–4.5 V range. Redox pairs V4+/V5+, V3+/V4+, and V3+/V4+ have voltages of 4.03 V/3.95 V and 3.54/3.30 V, respectively. Furthermore, the CV curves for each cycle have a substantial overlap, which confirms a highly reversible electrochemical process. Despite the fact that the introduction of Fe3+ decreases the reaction potential, the higher specific capacity and reaction potential of V4+/V5+ are advantageous in obtaining a high energy density. Fig. 6(a) shows the evaluation of the rate performance of the Na‖NFVP/C cell across a temperature range of 0.5C to 40C. At 0.5C, 1.0C, 2.0C, 5.0C, 10.0C, 20.0C, and 40.0C, the Na‖NFVP/C cell demonstrates rate performances of 115.1 mA h g−1, 111.2 mA h g−1, 107.9 mA h g−1, 103 mA h g−1, 98.7 mA h g−1, 90.4 mA h g−1, and 74.2 mA h g−1 respectively. Even when reaching 40C, the material maintains a consistent specific capacity. Specific capacities of can still be attained. Even when brought back to 0.5C, it is still possible to attain an impressive specific capacity of 113.0 mA h g−1, demonstrating exceptional structural stability during high rate performance. In comparison with other doped NVP, the rate performance of the current material is exceptional. Fig. 6(b) illustrates the implementation of a comprehensive analysis of a prolonged cycle at a temperature of 5C. Surprisingly, the Na‖NFVP/C cell is able to retain 97.8% of its original capacity even after undergoing 500 cycles at 5C. After EIS testing (Fig. 7), the NFVP/C material has a low charge transfer resistance (Rct) and interfacial contact resistance, which indicates that Fe+ can significantly improve the electrical conductivity of the composite.\nThe CV of the Na‖NFVP/C cell is shown in Fig. 8(a) for different scan rates between 1.5 and 4.5 V, revealing the presence of two sets of redox peaks that represent the insertion and extraction of Na+. The oxidation–reduction peaks are slightly shifted as the scanning rate increases due to cathode polarization. The linear relationship between the redox peak currents and the square root of the scan rate is depicted in Fig. 8(b). To determine the diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions (DNa+), one can utilize the Randles–Sevcik equation:\nwhere the peak current is denoted by ip, and A represents the actual contact area between the electrode sheet and the electrolyte. The electrode reaction involves n electron transfer, while Co signifies the concentration of sodium ions in the bulk phase. Finally, ν refers to the sweep speed. For the peak 1 and peak 4, DNa+ is calculated as 5.368 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 and 1.649 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, respectively. This is one order of magnitude higher than that of Na3V2(PO4)3 (7.19 × 10−13 cm2 s−1).\nFig. 9 summarizes the discharge voltage as a function of specific capacity for the present NFVP material. Not only higher specific capacity but also higher discharge voltage is demanded toward excellent performance of energy density\nIn order to determine the source of the excellent Na-storage performance of NFVP/C, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to clarify the pathways and obstacles for Na+ migration. Two potential migration routes, Na → Na (P1), which the migration pathways of Na+ in the channel between the [PO4] tetrahedral. Na → Na (P2),That migration pathways of Na+ in the space between [Fe/VO6] octahedron. In Fig. 10(a) the energy barriers for the P1 and P2 paths were calculated to be 0.14 eV and 0.30 eV, respectively, using the climbing-image nudged elastic band method. Hence, it is evident that the P1 channels (the upper channel in Fig. 10(b)) running alongside the [Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3] structure offer the most favorable routes for Na+ diffusion in terms of energy. The migration barrier of 0.14 eV for this is similar to Na3V2(PO4)3, but significantly lower than the migration barriers of the majority of reported cathode materials for SIB. The remarkable response kinetics and favorable rate performance of NFVP can be attributed to the minimal energy barrier for ionic migration.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthesis of Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3/C\nTo synthesize Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3/C, 0.8 mmol of ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) and 1.20 mmol of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) were added to an aqueous solution of citric acid. The resulting mixture was stirred thoroughly for 30 min at 70 °C in a water bath. Next, 3.1 mmol of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) and 0.15 g of glucose (C6H806) were added in sequence to the above solution. 3 mmol of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) was gradually added to the solution and stirred for 30 min until a uniform mixture was achieved. Subsequently, 3 mmol of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) were added to the solution while stirring for another 30 min until a homogenous solution was formed. Finally, the solution was heated in a water bath at 80 °C until a gel was formed. The gel retrieved was dried in an oven and ground into powder by using a mortar and pestle. The powder obtained through the sol–gel method underwent a two-step heating process in a tube furnace. In the first step, the powder was heated at 300 °C for 3 hours to eliminate ammonia, water, and carbon dioxide, using carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water in the experiment. After grinding the sample for 2 hours, the second step involved heating the sample at 750 °C for 8 hours under argon protection. The initial heating process had a rate set at 2 °C min−1, followed by 3 °C min−1 for the rest of the duration. The sample was then retrieved, resulting in the target product.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nAt room temperature, Cu Kα radiation was used to collect X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns on a Bruker D8 diffractometer. The structures of the substance were analyzed using a Hitachi SU-8010 microscope through field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the chemical compositions were examined through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis. The XPS analysis was conducted using an ULVAC-PHI PHI-5000 VPIII device equipped with Al Kα radiation, and the XPS-spectra were processed using the Thermo Avantage software.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nElectrochemical tests were performed using CR2032 coin cells. To form the operational electrode, a mixture of Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3/C samples, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride was combined in a mass ratio of 8:1:1. Propylene carbonate (1.0 M) containing NaClO4 was utilized. The electrolyte composition consists of 1 M NaClO4, with PC as the solvent. Additionally, we have incorporated 5% FEC as an additive to enhance performance. The separator employed was a glass fiber diaphragm. Half cells employed self-produced sodium metal foil as the counter electrode. Regarding sodium-ion batteries with symmetrical properties.\n\n2.4 Calculations using density functional theory\nThe Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was used to perform all calculations, which were based on density functional theory and first-principles calculations. Projected added waves (PAW) describe the interactions between the core separation and valence electrons, while the local density is characterized by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) which is based on the PBE exchange correlation energy. The Monkhorst–Pack method was utilized to sample the divisions of the Brillouin zone. The calculation used a cutoff energy value of 400 eV, denoted as ENCUT. Optimizing the convergence sampling in the calculation of the diffusion barrier and mechanical strength generated the K points of dimensions 1*1*1–3*3*1. Using the elastic energy band method (NEB), the migration routes and energy obstacles of individual lithium ions were computed. The electron and ion relaxation convergence precision values are 1.0 × 10−4 eV and 1.0 × 10−3 eV, respectively, while the force convergence criterion is 0.02 eV Å−1.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

As depicted in Fig. 1a, its crystal structure contains three isolated sodium storage sites with different oxygen surroundings, namely occupied Na1 and Na2 sites and a vacant Na3 site. More specifically, two Na+ ions at the Na2 site (0.67 occupation) exhibit electrochemical activity, while one Na+ ion at the Na1 site (1.0 occupation) is electrochemically inert. The remaining empty sites enable the lattice to accommodate over-stoichiometric Na+ and further generate Na-enriched phases.\nAs the cathode, Na3VP undergoes a typical biphase transition to form Na1V2(PO4)3 (Na1VP) and completely removes two Na+ from the Na2 site accompanied by two V3+ oxidizing to V4+, resulting in a theoretical capacity of 117.6 mA h g−1 and a voltage plateau at 3.36 V vs. Na+/Na (Fig. 1b). Recent investigations revealed that the V2+/V3+ redox couple in Na3VP can also be activated by controlling the sodiation depth, viz., the potential window of charge/discharge measurement. In the over-discharging process (Fig. 1b), two V3+ in Na3VP can be reduced to V2+ respectively and over-stoichiometric Na+ is embedded in the lattice to balance the charge. The first Na+ is inserted into the empty Na2 site to generate the Na4V2(PO4)3 phase (Na4VP, 1.67 V vs. Na+/Na), followed by the second Na+ in the vacant Na3 site to generate the Na5V2(PO4)3 phase (Na5VP, 0.28 V vs. Na+/Na). Of particular note, deep-sodiated Na5VP is energetically unfavorable due to the intense coulombic repulsion, thus leading to an extraordinarily low voltage plateau.\nThe structure evolution of Na3VP during the desodiation/sodiation process is intensively investigated by in situ XRD (Fig. 1c and S1†). Initially, all diffraction peaks can be assigned to Na3VP, showing a rhombohedral structure with a space group of R-3c. When charging (desodiation) to 3.7 V, the diffraction peaks of Na3VP diminish gradually while the peaks of Na1VP increase, presenting continuous phase transformation. The peak shift to higher angles demonstrates lattice shrinkage resulting from the removal of Na+. During the discharge (sodiation) process, an opposite trend is observed from Na1VP to Na3VP. Afterwards, over-discharging leads to the appearance of the Na4VP new phase, as indicated by a plateau at around 1.67 V (vs. Na+/Na) and emerging diffraction peaks at 23.5°, 28.5°, 30.8°, and 34.7° with gradually increasing intensity, which is in good agreement with previous reports. This demonstrates that the two phases coexist and correspond directly to the voltage plateau. Upon further sodiation, a new plateau appears at about 0.28 V (vs. Na+/Na) while diffraction peaks at 23.5° and 28.5° fade away gradually, accompanying the formation of Na5VP. Operando XRD confirms the feasibility of the presodiation strategy to produce sodium-enriched phases from Na3VP and reveal the corresponding structure information.\nThe cyclic voltammogram (CV) profile (Fig. 1d) obtained between 0.1 and 3.7 V (vs. Na+/Na) reconfirms the accessibility of Na4VP and Na5VP. Three pairs of cathodic/anodic peaks located at ∼0.20/0.36, ∼1.56/1.78 and ∼3.30/3.48 V are in good agreement with plateaus observed in the galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles (eqn (1)–(3)). Notably, a broad irreversible peak is observed between 0.3 and 0.9 V, implying aggressive electrolyte decomposition. During the cycles (Fig. S2†), all the peak currents prominently diminish and the polarization gradually increases, owing to the structure deterioration of active materials and the accumulation of the SEI on the electrode surface. In contrast, the CV curves between 1.0 and 4.0 V almost completely overlapped after the initial cycle (Fig. S3†), indicating the highly reversible phase transition among Na1VP, Na3VP, and Na4VP. The split of the cathodic peak in the first cycle may be ascribed to the minor structure rearrangement of the active material. The narrower CV peaks also imply a faster Na+ insertion process for Na4VP than Na5VP. It is important to note that Na5VP exhibits low inital coulombic efficiency (ICEcathode is defined as the ratio of sodiation capacity to desodiation capacity of a cathode), rendering it incompatible with HC anodes (Fig. S4†). As mentioned above, the typical ICEanode (defined as the ratio of desodiation capacity to sodiation capacity of an anode) of HC anodes is only 60–80%. When Na5VP with an ICE of merely 40% matches with HC anodes, surplus Na+ will be introduced into the full cells and form uncontrollable sodium dendrites on the anode side, resulting in safety concerns. Therefore, Na4VP has a suitable ICE (∼64%) and excellent structural stability, denoting its superiority for active sodium compensation in full cells.\nAs displayed in Fig. 1e, currently reported aromatic sodium reagents, such as Biph-Na and Naph-Na, demonstrate ultra-low redox potentials of 0.16 V and 0.09 V vs. Na+/Na for cathode materials (lower than the Na5VP formation potential of 0.28 V vs. Na+/Na). In order to prevent over-sodiation from yielding Na5VP or other parasite reactions, the treatment duration with sodium reagents must be strictly controlled, which is not conducive to industrial batch application. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop appropriate sodium reagents to achieve a refined precise and controllable preparation of Na4VP.\nNa+ insertion/extraction reaction of NaxVP:\nPreparation of the PNZ-Na reagent:\nPrecise chemical sodiation of Na3VP enabled by the PNZ-Na reagent:\nIn accordance with the potential-matched chemical sodiation strategy (Fig. 1f), phenazine sodium (PNZ-Na) has been elaborately chosen as a suitable sodiation reagent due to its appropriate potential. The PNZ-Na reagent displays a pair of reversible redox peaks at 1.51 and 1.62 V (vs. Na+/Na, Fig. 1e), corresponding to the PNZ/PNZ− redox couple (eqn (4)). PNZ-Na exhibits the highest potential as a sodiation reagent reported so far, benefiting from the strong electron-withdrawing effect of nitrogen atoms and the efficient charge dispersion provided by the additional six-membered ring. Hence, the end-point of the reaction is effectively clamped by the PNZ-Na reagent potential, thus preventing over-sodiation. During the chemical presodiation process, reductive PNZ-Na concurrently donates Na+ and e− for Na3VP while also leading to the recovery of intrinsic phenazine molecules (eqn (5)). The sodium ions diffuse into the Na3VP lattice and locate at the partially occupied Na2 site to form a pure Na4VP phase.\n\nControllable synthesis of Na-enriched Na4VP via the chemical sodiation strategy\nThe chemical presodiation of the Na3VP cathode is conducted simply by immersing the electrode into PNZ-Na solution for a particular time, followed by DME rinse to remove the residual PNZ-Na. Phenazine and sodium metal are mixed in dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent in equal amounts to obtain the PNZ-Na reagent, as described in eqn (4). The strong electron affinity of heterocyclic aromatics causes the outermost electrons of Na metal to transfer spontaneously to the conjugated phenazine rings, producing grape-purple colored PNZ− radicals (Fig. 2a left). Once the Na3VP electrode is immersed in the PNZ-Na solution, the sodiation reaction proceeds through electron transfer from the PNZ− radical to Na3VP along with Na+ accommodation to form Na4VP (eqn (5)). Following the reaction, the purple PNZ− radical dissolved in DME is converted to a pristine PNZ molecule, resulting in the PNZ-Na solution fading (Fig. 2a right).\nTo probe the reaction pathways, we prepared presodiated NaxVP (3 ≤ x ≤ 4) electrodes with various immersion times of 30–120 s. As the reaction time increases, the emergence of new diffraction peaks at 30.8° and 34.7°, along with growing intensity, is attributable to the Na4VP phase, while the peaks of Na3VP at 31.6° (116) and 35.6° (300) weaken (Fig. 2b). This outcome reveals that two phases, Na3VP and Na4VP, coexist during the presodiation process (30 s and 60 s), which is consistent with in situ XRD and prior reports. Notably, Na3VP is completely converted to Na4VP after presodiation for more than 90 s. (Fig. S5†) The XRD pattern of chemically presodiated Na4VP is identical to that of electrochemically sodiated Na4VP, implying a rapid Na+ migration in the cathode and a uniform sodiation process achieved by chemical presodiation. The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) tests accurately determine the Na content in different samples (Fig. 2c). The samples with treatment time of 30, 60, and over 90 s are accordingly denoted as Na3.37VP, Na3.68VP, and Na4VP.\nThe presodiation degree of NaxVP achieved via chemical treatment is also evaluated using electrochemical performance in sodium half-coin cells. The initial charge curves of NaxVP, including ICE and plateau capacity at about 1.67 V that correspond to Na4VP, are displayed in Fig. 2d and e. The open circuit voltage (OCV vs. Na+/Na) dramatically drops during the biphasic process from Na3VP to Na4VP, after which it remains stable at around 1.67 V. The presodiated NaxVP exhibits a continuous increase in initial charge capacity (i.e., Na extraction), whereas the ICE decreases with increasing sodiation time, indicating a sustained Na+ insertion reaction (Fig. S6†). Consequently, the chemical presodiation process continues until Na3VP diminishes, as reflected by a constant ICE of ∼64% and an increased specific capacity of ∼56 mA h g−1, respectively. Notably, no unnecessary parasitic reactions are introduced due to the identical charge–discharge curves and ICE between chemical and electrochemical sodiation (Fig. S7a†). The redox potentials between the reductive agent and Na3VP are well-matched, thereby avoiding the issues of over-sodiation, inhomogeneity, and inconsistency during scaling up for mass production. Even with excessive treatment time (30 min) and reagent dosage, there is no structural damage to the cathode materials, demonstrating the success of our chemical presodiation strategy based on the redox-potential matched principle (Fig. S7b†). The sodiation reaction self-terminates once all Na3VP transforms into sodium-rich Na4VP due to the elaborately screened sodiation reagents. We further conducted the in situ XRD test of the PNZ-Na presodiated Na4VP electrode (Fig. S8 and S9†). The variation of diffraction peaks is consistent with the electrochemical sodiation process, and there is no impurity phase introduced by presodiation treatment. It is a highly reversible transformation between Na4VP and Na3VP and reconfirms that presodiation has no adverse effect on the lattice structure. Therefore, the reliability of the chemical presodiation strategy is firmly authenticated.\nRaman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are further employed in order to explore the effect of presodiation treatment on the structure of the Na3VP cathode. The Raman spectra shown in Fig. 2f indicate that the symmetric bending vibration peak of the PO4 tetrahedron in Na3VP at 453 cm−1 is slightly blue-shifted after presodiation treatment. This result suggests the enhancement of P–O bond energy and boosting ionicity of the Na4VP lattice. The valence states of vanadium ions are verified by the XPS results. The survey XPS spectrum (Fig. S10†) confirms the presence of the same chemical composition elements in Na3VP and Na4VP. The binding energy of P 2p shifts toward the higher energy direction (from 133.4 eV to 133.7 eV), reconfirming the stronger P–O bonds (Fig. S11†). As seen in Fig. 2g and h, the V 2p peaks broaden after presodiation and reveal the coexistence of mixed V3+ and V2+ ions in the lattice. The two peaks of Na3VP at 516.8 eV and 523.9 eV coincide with V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 of V3+, which means only trivalent vanadium is observed in the pristine electrode. Except for the peaks above, new peaks at 514.9 eV and 522.5 eV can be ascribed to the contribution of V2+ in Na4VP. Further quantitative analysis of the V 2p spectrum indicates a V3+/V2+ ratio of 0.49/0.51 based on the integral area of deconvoluted peaks, which agrees well with the valence distribution for Na4VP. All the characterization studies above demonstrate that the PNZ-Na solution can readily and controllably presodiate the Na3VP cathode in a relatively short time.\nThe morphological evolution of the Na3VP and Na4VP samples is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results show that both Na3VP and Na4VP exhibit a regular spherical morphology, with a diameter ranging from 5–15 μm, consisting of primary particles that are densely packed to form secondary particles (Fig. 3a and d). Apparently, the morphology characteristic of sodiated Na4VP is not affected by the chemical treatment and helps to retain the electrochemical performance (Fig. S12†). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis reconfirms the Na/V ratios of Na3VP and Na4VP to be 1.49 and 1.99, respectively (Fig. S13†). Cross sections are obtained by FIB-SEM to monitor microstructural damage, while no microcracks are observed after presodiation treatment (Fig. 3b and e). It should be noted that the internal voids in the particles are formed by primary particle agglomeration rather than structure degradation. HRTEM images in Fig. 3c reveal well-defined lattice fringes of 0.373 nm ascribed to the (113) planes in the Na3VP lattice. Likewise, we observe characteristic lattice fringes of 0.378 nm (Fig. 3f), corresponding to the emerging 23.5° diffraction peak in the Na4VP lattice (Fig. 2b).\n23Na/31P solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) offers in-depth insights into local structural transformation while probing the oxidation states of the neighboring vanadium ions. For 31P spectra, the signals are caused by the unpaired electronic spin transfer from TM d orbitals to the 31P nuclei through chemical bonds. Fig. S14† presents the room temperature 31P spectra for Na3VP and Na4VP. In the Na3VP lattice, a broad asymmetric peak at 2000–3500 ppm reflects a twisted environment for the 31P nuclei. While in Na4VP, the corresponding peak with decreasing intensity reveals the reducing dipolar interaction between unpaired electron spins of V and P nuclei. In contrast, a new broad peak at 3500–5000 ppm is observed in Na4VP, which is attributed to the complicated interaction between V2+ and adjacent phosphate groups. This phenomenon is because the V2+ (t2g3eg0) owning three unpaired electrons is more paramagnetic than V3+ (t2g2eg0) and generally causes a larger Fermi contact shift. Similar results are also observed in 23Na spectra.\nTurning to the 23Na NMR spectra, the signals of Na4VP are recorded at 8, 10, and 12 kHz to distinguish the isotropic signals and spinning side bands denoted by asterisks (Fig. 4a). A typical 23Na spectrum of Na3VP is presented in Fig. 4b and c, which includes two significant signals at 83 and 18 ppm with very different magnitudes and a set of spinning side bands. As previously reported by Hu et al., the oxidation state of vanadium centers coordinated with Na at Na1 sites is higher than those coordinated with Na at Na2 sites, leading to a more significant 23Na shift at the Na2 site in contrast with that at the Na1 site. Similar paramagnetic effects have also been reported in LIBs on 7Li NMR shifts. Based on these results, the signals at 83 and 18 ppm are assigned to the partially occupied Na2 site and fully filled Na1 site, respectively. Only Na at the Na2 site has electrochemical activity on account of the relatively weak bonding. The signal peaks shrink and slightly shift to the higher direction with the increasing sodium content of these samples (Fig. 4b). This phenomenon suggests a more ordered environment of Na, whereas more V2+ leads to a higher shift. We speculate that the shrinkage of peaks from Na3VP to Na4VP is due to a decrease in Na+ motion. Because of the partially occupied Na2 site, Na3VP has more Na vacancies than the fully occupied Na4VP. We further investigate Na+ diffusion kinetics by the CV technique at varied scan rates (Fig. S15 and S16†). The Na+ diffusion coefficients of Na4VP decrease as we suspected, indicating the reduced mobility of sodium ions. The fitted spectra of samples with different sodiated degrees are presented in Fig. 4c and d and we conclude that the Na2/Na1 peak area ratio gradually increases from 1.371 to 2.225. In other words, excess sodium ions that Na3VP receives from the PNZ-Na solution are preferentially accommodated in the Na2 site, making it close to completely occupied in the Na4VP sample.\n\nThe electrochemical performance of the Na-enriched Na4VP cathode\nThe sodium storage capability of the sodiatied samples is investigated through galvanostatic charge–discharge tests in half-cells with a Na-metal anode. All of the NaxVP electrodes with different treatment times manifest the same cycling stability at 0.5C for 100 cycles as pristine Na3VP (Fig. S17†). Even extending the treatment time to 30 min, no discernible capacity decay is observed, suggesting that the electrochemical performance is completely retained after presodiation treatment. Our presodiation strategy is not strict with processing time and is expected to achieve large-scale production. In the following discussion, we primarily focus on the comparison between pristine Na3VP and the sodiated Na4VP. Fig. 5a displays the CV curves of Na4VP at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The OCV of the Na4VP sample is close to 1.6 V which is related to the average valence of V ions, in line with previous discussion. During the first cathodic scan, the first oxidation peak appears at around 1.7 V corresponding to the first distinct plateau in the charge profile of Na4VP (Fig. 5b). These features, which are absent in Na3VP electrodes, are because of the oxidation V2+/V3+ in the Na-enriched phase and the extraction of the pre-doped sodium ions. When all pre-doped sodium is removed, the Na-enriched Na4VP entirely transforms into Na3VP and then presents a typical voltage plateau of 3.4 V attributed to the reversible V3+/V4+ redox couple, validated by well-overlapped CV profiles. In brief, active sodium compensation during cycling is achieved by the irreversible oxidation of V2+, viz., by controlling the voltage window. These results reconfirm that the preparation of the Na4VP cathode to offer charge compensation and an additional Na reservoir has been successfully implemented. The rate capability and long-term cycling stability of the two samples are analysed as shown in Fig. 5c–e in a voltage window of 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na+/Na). The Na4VP electrode exhibits reversible desodiation capacities of 109.4, 107.5, 106.1, 101, 98.1, and 92.8 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5C, respectively, slightly higher than that of the Na3VP electrode. When the rate comes back to 0.2C, a reversible capacity of about 108 mA h g−1 is achieved, suggesting the excellent reversibility of the Na4VP electrode. The Na4VP electrode also retains an outperformed cycling stability with high capacity retentions of 95.3% at 0.5C after 200 cycles and 91.8% at 1C after 600 cycles.\nNa4VP‖HC full cells are assembled to demonstrate the application feasibility of Na4VP as both the cathode and extra Na reservoir in enhancing the energy density of SIBs, and a control cell Na3VP‖HC is also constructed for comparison. For the fabrication of full cells, the mass matching between the cathode and anode is based on their capacity balance, which is determined by the charge capacity of the cathode and the discharge capacity of the anode. As displayed in Fig. 6a and b, during the first charge, both the irreversible sodium storage sites of the anode and the formation of the SEI will consume considerable active sodium. More Na3VP cathode is commonly to be matched with HC and in a Na-poor state in the following cycles, namely Na3−xVP. As an alternative, the Na4VP electrode used for full cells enables a 35.2 wt% reduction in cathode mass compared to the Na3VP electrode and ensures that the cathode as Na3VP without Na loss participates in subsequent cycles.\nAs shown in Fig. 6c, the Na3VP‖HC and Na4VP‖HC full cells deliver a charge capacity of 111 and 168 mA h g−1, respectively, matching well with the values in half cell configuration. However, the reversible discharge capacity of the Na3VP‖HC full cell is merely 66.6 mA h g−1 with 39.3% capacity loss. This result can be attributed to the failed Na+ reinsertion on the cathode side in the absence of extra endogenous Na+. In comparison, the full cell with the Na4VP cathode shows an initial discharge capacity of 109.7 mA h g−1 and an ICE of 65%, which are equivalent to that of the Na3VP half-cell, demonstrating extremely high utilization of active materials. Similar to other published results (Table S1†), the low ICE is ascribed to irreversible Na compensation during the initial charge cycle, but subsequent average coulombic efficiency is higher than that of Na3VP‖HC without presodiation (Fig. S18†). The Na4VP‖HC full cell shows comparable cycling stability with the control Na3VP‖HC full cell, but shows markedly enhanced reversible capacity and excellent rate capability (Fig. 6d, e and S19). Fig. 6d demonstrates the rate capability of both Na4VP‖HC and Na3VP‖HC full cells from 0.2C to 5C. Na4VP‖HC displays a respectable rate performance benefiting from the presodated Na4VP cathode. Discharge capacities of 107.5, 106, 103.2, 94.8, 84.9, 76.3, and 66.3 mA h g−1 are delivered at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5C, respectively. Even at a current density of 5C, corresponding to a charging duration as short as 12 min, Na4VP‖HC still delivers 61.7% capacity retention of the discharge capacity at 0.2C. In contrast, Na3VP‖HC exhibits much lower reversible capacity due to active sodium loss. Overall, Na4VP‖HC exhibits an impressive discharge capacity of 111 mA h g−1 with an ICE of 66%, and an energy density of 251.1 W h kg−1 based on the total mass of cathode and anode active materials. This is far superior to those of the control cell using the pristine Na3VP cathode (ICE of 60% and an energy density of 159.4 W h kg−1). The Na4VP‖HC full cell shows a decent cycling stability of 78% capacity retention at 1C after 100 cycles and 57% capacity retention at 2C after 500 cycles (Fig. 6e and S19), which is comparable with that of the control Na3VP‖HC full cell, but shows markedly enhanced reversible capacity. Table S1 in the ESI† compares the recently published NVP-based full cells in terms of electrochemical performance and energy density. To the best of our knowledge, the energy density of PNZ-Na presodiated Na4VP‖HC is among the best of the reported values for NVP-based full cells. These discrepancies strongly suggest that our presodiation strategy can improve the overall energy density of SIBs while simultaneously maintaining decent cycling stability.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Commercial Na3VP and hard carbon (BHC400) powders were purchased from Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd Phenazine, biphenyl, naphthalene and electron-grade N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were obtained from Aladdin Chem. Co., Ltd Anhydrous DME was purchased from JK Chemical. The phenazine-sodium (PNZ-Na) reagent was prepared by adding equal stoichiometric sodium metal and phenazine in DME and stirring for four hours in a glove box. Sodium-enriched Na4VP was synthesized simply by immersing the Na3VP powders or cathode sheet in 0.05 M PNZ-Na solution for a certain time (0–120 s) and then rinsing it with DME to quench the reaction and remove the residue, followed by vacuum drying for 15 min.\n\nCharacterization\nXRD patterns were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Smartlab SE) with Cu-Ka radiation at 40 kV. In situ XRD was performed on a live charge/discharge process to monitor the structure evolution of Na3VP. Every single pattern was collected for 7 min in the scan range of 18–38°. The morphologies and fine phase structure of samples were obtained by SEM (SEM, Zeiss Merlin Compact) and HRTEM (JEM-2100). The valent information was obtained by XPS (ESCALAB250Xi) with Al Ka radiation. Raman spectra (Bruker MultiRam) were measured to investigate the variation of chemical bonds before and after persodiation. The chemical compositions of samples were determined by ICP-OES (Agilent 730) and EDS (X-Max 50). FIB was used to observe the cross section of active material particles on Tescan SOLARIS equipment. The ssNMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE NEO 400 MHz NMR spectrometer.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe Na3VP cathode sheet was fabricated by mixing Na3VP, Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride at a mass ratio of 80:10:10 in NMP and further spreading the mixture on the aluminum foil with a doctor blade. After vacuum drying, the electrode was cut into discs with a diameter of 12 mm for use. For half cells, CR-2032-type coin cells were assembled by using pieces of Na foil as the counter and reference electrodes, Na3VP or Na4VP as the working electrode, and glass fiber as a separator in an argon-filled glove box with H2O and O2 contents less than 0.1 ppm. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1:1 v/v) solution with a 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted between 2.0 and 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na on a NEWARE CT4008 cycler battery cycler at room temperature. In particular, the nominal capacity of 1C is 117.6 mA g−1. For full cells, all procedures were identical to those for half-cell assembly with the exception of using a hard carbon electrode as the anode. The cathode/anode capacity ratio was set as 1:1 and the voltage range was set as 1.5–4.0 V vs. Na+/Na. The CV measurement was executed on an Admiral electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The energy density (E) of the full cell was calculated using the following formula: where Q, V, mcathode, and manode indicate the discharge capacity and average discharge voltage and the mass of the cathode and anode, respectively.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Two important parameters measuring solvation ability are DN and dielectric constant. Larger values indicate stronger solvation. Melm has a higher DN and higher dielectric constant, which can meet the requirements (Fig. 1a). In addition, Melm exhibits lower viscosity and a more affordable price than other solvents (Fig. 1b). The ionic conductivity exceeds that of traditional ether solvents at the same salt concentration (Fig. 1c). After comprehensive consideration, Melm emerges as the most suitable choice. Salt concentration crucially influences electrolyte cost, making it pivotal to achieve Melm application at low concentrations. Hence, three common sodium salts (NaPF6, NaCF3SO3, and NaClO4) were utilized to prepare the electrolytes (Table S1†) to identify the optimal electrolyte. The Raman spectrum revealed an abundance of free anions in 0.1 M NaCF3SO3 in Melm (0.1-Melm) and 0.2 M NaCF3SO3 in Melm (0.2-Melm) electrolytes (Fig. S1†) compared to other concentrations, suggesting sodium ions were surrounded by solvent molecules. This environment facilitates sodium ion intercalation into the graphite layer in a solvated form (Fig. S2†). Although the solvation structure in 0.2-Melm resembles that in 0.1-Melm, the ionic conductivity of 0.2-Melm (Fig. 1d) reaches 4.45 mS cm−1, twice that of 0.1-Melm (2.48 mS cm−1). Furthermore, 0.2-Melm exhibits higher capacity and superior cycle stability compared to 0.2 M NaPF6 in Melm and 0.2 M NaClO4 in Melm (Fig. S3 and S4†). Therefore, 0.2-Melm was chosen for subsequent comparative experiments and characterization.\nGiven that ethers are recognized solvents for solvation intercalation, diglyme (DGM) was selected as the reference for electrochemical performance (Fig. S5†). A comparative analysis reveals that 0.2-Melm exhibits lower viscosity, higher ionic conductivity, and superior solvation capability compared to 0.2-DGM (Fig. S6–S8†). Next, mesophase carbon microbeads (MCMB) were employed as the anode to assess electrochemical performance using 0.2-Melm and 0.2-DGM electrolytes (Fig. S9†). The redox peaks in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves represent the formation of different graphite interlayer compounds. Notably, the polarization voltage in 0.2-Melm is smaller than that in 0.2-DGM, indicating faster reaction kinetics in 0.2-Melm (Fig. 1e). In contrast to the ether electrolyte, MCMB in 0.2-Melm has an additional pair of redox peaks at 0.05/0.1 V, gradually disappearing with increasing current (Fig. S10†). This suggests an additional Na+ intercalation reaction at low voltages. The initial coulombic efficiency of MCMB in 0.2-Melm is 87.6% (Fig. 1f), surpassing that reported in several other articles (Fig. 1g). Moreover, MCMB in 0.2-Melm presents superior rate performance (Fig. S11†), demonstrating a capacity of 128.8 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 123.6.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 117.1 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1. Impressively, the MCMB anode in 0.2-Melm sustains a long-term cycle performance over 1800 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, maintaining a capacity of 98.8 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 84.6%. However, the cycle life of MCMB in 0.2-DGM was limited to only 128 cycles and failed due to an internal short circuit (Fig. 1h). Thus, an in-depth exploration is needed to identify the reasons for the performance differences mentioned above.\n\nElectrochemical reaction mechanism and interface characterization\nTo gain insight into the sodium storage mechanism of MCMB in 0.2-Melm electrolyte, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted. Fig. 2a shows that the entire intercalation and extraction process is a staging behavior, similar to the intercalation of solvated sodium ions in ether. The peak at 26° in the initial state corresponds to the (002) plane of MCMB. During the discharge process, (002) slowly shifts to 25°, and two new peaks (at ∼20° and 30°) gradually appear, representing different stages of intercalation reactions. As the discharging occurs, the ongoing displacement suggests that the insertion of solvated Na+ at this stage alters the interlayer spacing. Upon discharge to 0.67 V, MCMB shows new peaks at 12.5° and 18.6°, indicative of a new stage of solvated Na+-intercalated graphite. However, unlike at high potential, there is almost no change in interlayer spacing, which is possibly attributable to different solvation forms at this potential. During the charging process, the peaks at ∼26° and ∼30° are not fully recovered, suggesting the presence of residual solvated Na+ between the layers. To determine whether it is co-embedded in a solvated form, ex situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained (Fig. 2b). To avoid the influence of Melm adsorption, electrodes after cycling were cleaned multiple times with ethanol. When discharged to 0.01 V, the appearance of the CN peak of Melm at 1500 cm−1 indicates the embedding of Na+ in a solvated form. Charging the electrode to 2 V reveals a weak peak of CN, confirming the presence of residual solvated sodium ions between the layers, aligning with the XRD pattern. The above mechanisms played a positive role, as evidenced by the superior rate performance compared to ether (Fig. S11†), with no cracks in the MCMB particles after 100 cycles (Fig. S12†). Therefore, the residual solvated Na+ proves beneficial to reaction kinetics and interlayer interactions.\nThe investigation of interface properties remains crucial in understanding and optimizing electrochemical performance. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images reveal a more uniform solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film in 0.2-Melm compared to 0.2-DGM (Fig. 2c). Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, it was found that the SEI layer is enriched with sodium nitride inorganic content (401.5 eV) (Fig. S13†), enhancing the mechanical strength and ionic conductivity of the interphase layer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the cells after 3 cycles was performed and simulated. Results indicate that solution resistance (Rs), interface film resistance (Rf), and charge transfer resistance (Rct) are all smaller when using Melm compared to the ether electrolyte (Fig. 2d and Table S2†). This behavior can be attributed to the solvent properties, the inorganic-rich characteristics of the SEI film, and the co-solvent intercalation mechanism of Melm. The demise of ether electrolyte batteries is elucidated in Fig. 1h. Examining the discharge/charge curves of the MCMB anode over 128 cycles, it is evident that in 0.2-Melm, the curves remain normal, while in 0.2-DGM, the battery fails to charge to the set voltage (Fig. 2e). This may be due to the uneven SEI layer in 0.2-DGM, causing oxidized carbon atoms in the charged state to dissolve into the electrolyte, migrate to the sodium metal anode, and undergo redox reactions. This is supported by NMR results (Fig. S14 and Table S3†), with the C content in 0.2-DGM significantly increasing after 128 cycles compared with 0.2-DGM before cycling, indicating that carbon atoms can be dissolved into 0.2-DGM. Then in simpler terms, an internal short circuit occurs due to internal redox reactions. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, along with side-view SEM images of MCMB under OCV and after 128 cycles in different electrolytes, were collected (Fig. 2f and g). Before cycling, the particles are tightly bound to the current collector, but the difference is obvious after 128 cycles. In 0.2-Melm, electrode materials remain closely bound to the current collector, presenting a smooth and flat surface. Conversely, in 0.2-DGM, cracks become apparent on the electrode surface, and the materials detach from the current collector. This may be caused by uneven stress between the active material and the current collector due to the uneven SEI.\n\nElectrochemical performances of MCMB//NTP/C full cells\nLimited by the decomposition voltage of the electrolyte (Fig. S15†), it is unsuitable for a high voltage cathode, so NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) was chosen as the cathode. The synthesized NTP/C exhibits a size of 5–20 μm and a capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S16†). Fig. 3a illustrates the testing of full cells within 1.2–2.3 V, with the N:P ratio (capacity ratio of anode to cathode) controlled at ∼1.2. Before assembling the full cells, both the anode and cathode undergo activation for 3 cycles. To gain a clearer understanding of the reaction, the capacity versus voltage (dQ/dV) was integrated. The redox peaks at 1.35/1.4 V and 2.0–2.1/2.15 V correspond to the co-intercalation/de-intercalation of solvated Na+ in graphite (Fig. 3b). In terms of rate performance (Fig. 3c), the MCMB//NTP/C cell displays a capacity of 90.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 61.5 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 39.4 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 15.4 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1. The capacity can be restored when the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, and all capacities are obtained based on the mass of MCMB materials. With increasing current, the polarization voltage gradually rises (Fig. 3d), and the MCMB//NTP/C cell shows a capacity retention of 46.7% after 2800 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 3e). The stable cycling performance is related to the formation of a robust SEI film and the co-solvent intercalation mechanism in 0.2 Melm.\n\nProperties of Melm derivatives as electrolytes\nMotivated by the favorable performance of the 0.2 Melm electrolyte, we explored the potential of imidazole derivatives, specifically Prlm and Bulm, as electrolyte solvents in SIBs due to their similar molecular structures. It is necessary to investigate whether there is a strong binding energy between Na+ and solvent molecules. The binding energies and the ESPmin of Prlm/Bulm and Na+ were calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The binding energies for Prlm and Na+ and Bulm and Na+ are −1.12 and −1.13 eV, respectively (Fig. 4a). The values for the ESPmin of Prlm and Bulm are −56.53 and −56.63 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 4b). The high binding energy and low ESPmin indicate that both Prlm and Bulm have strong binding energy with Na+. Then, the electrochemical performances of MCMB anodes in 0.2-Prlm and 0.2-Bulm were measured. At a current density of 0.1 A g−1, the capacity of MCMB anodes in 0.2-Prlm (116 mA h g−1) surpassed that in 0.2-Bulm (90 mA h g−1), which is potentially attributable to solvation forms and steric effects. The ICEs of MCMB anodes in 0.2-Prlm and 0.2-Bulm are 76.3% and 83.3% (Fig. 4c and e), which may be related to the different thickness of the SEI layer formed. The CV curves of 0.2-Prlm and 0.2-Bulm were similar to those of 0.2-Melm (Fig. 4d and f), signifying the occurrence of intercalation and deintercalation reactions of solvated sodium ions. The dissimilarity in the first cycle can be attributed to SEI formation, while subsequent cycles exhibit consistent reversibility. Different redox peaks in CV curves represent the reaction of solvated Na+ of different stages, that is, the formation of different GICs. Melm derivatives (0.2-Melm, 0.2-Prlm, and 0.2-Bulm) exhibited good rate performance with little capacity fading as the current increases (Fig. 4g). The long-term cycle performance of MCMB anodes in Melm derivatives as electrolytes remained stable without short circuits after 300 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 4h). Therefore, imidazole-based electrolytes have promising potential for applications in medium-voltage sodium-ion batteries.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nIn the search for new electrode materials for SIB application, our proposed platform consists of three parts, i.e., ML model-prediction, DFT calculations, and experimental validation (Fig. 1a). Here we first predicted the crystal stability of the proposed structure using the ML model. The available dataset of formation energy per atom for ML was retrieved from the Materials Project (MP). DFT calculations were then used to optimize the proposed structures and finally, we attempted to synthesize the selected material and thoroughly characterize it. From the MP database, we were able to obtain 35209 entries. After data cleansing by removing the duplicates, we finally had 24695 data. 176 descriptors from Matminer were used for data featurization. 4 algorithms were used for training the ML models, i.e. XG Boost (XGB) from University of Washington, Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Ridge (BR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressions from Scikit-Learn. These ML models were selected due to several considerations. With current dataset and numerous descriptors, XG Boost can effectively learn complex relationships and interactions among the features. Random Forest can exploit the diversity of decision trees to capture complex patterns and provide robust predictions. Bayesian Ridge and Support Vector Machine Regressions are effective in high-dimensional spaces and can capture complex patterns in the data. Furthermore, SVM model has the ability to find optimal hyperplanes to separate data points. Other algorithms such as Neural networks (NNs), Expectation Maximization (EM), Adaboost, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and decision trees are also powerful to capture complex relationships within materials elements. However, for example, NNs often require huge amounts of data for training, and also training deep neural networks can be computationally expensive. It is worth considering that if computational resources were limited, it might have been challenging to train and optimize neural networks effectively. kNN might face challenges when dealing with high-dimensional datasets (176 descriptors). kNN tends to perform better with larger datasets, and with 24695 data points, the performance might not be optimal compared to other algorithms that are specifically designed for high-dimensional data, such as XG Boost and Random Forest. Indeed, this requires further studies and exceeds the boundaries of our present study. The effectivity of ML models was then assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), and root mean square error (RMSE). Fig. S1 (ESI†) depicts the test results of each ML model. The SVM Regression shows better performance than XGB, RF, and BR with R2 and RMSE values of 0.927 and 0.25, respectively. The R2 value above 0.9 can be an indication of a good model, particularly for predicting formation energy. Further optimization of the SVM algorithm was performed using GridSearchCV (Fig. S2†).\nThe optimized C and gamma values were found to be 1000 and 0.1, respectively. After implementing the optimized C and gamma values in the SVM Regression model, the test result was improved with R2 and RMSE values of 0.944 and 0.22, respectively (Fig. 1b). Accordingly, we selected the SVM model for crystal stability prediction of new proposed SIB cathode materials. Since we focus on the NASICON-derived compounds; we thus proposed and predicted 3 new compounds, i.e., NMVTP, NMVFP, and NMVAP. The choice of different elements for replacing vanadium in Na3.5V2(PO4)3, such as manganese, titanium, iron, and aluminum, were basically also based on several scientific considerations such as chemical similarity, ionic radii, availability and cost, and desired properties. Manganese, titanium, iron, and aluminum are all transition metals like vanadium and share some similarities in terms of electronic structure and bonding. From structural perspective, it is important to consider elements with similar ionic radii to minimize structural distortion. The ionic radii of those ions, i.e. Mn2+, Ti4+, Fe2+, and Al3+ are reasonably close to that of V5+, which may allow high possibility for successful substitution. Indeed, for practical considerations such as the availability and cost of the replacement elements also play a role in material selection. Manganese, titanium, iron, and aluminum are relatively abundant and widely used in various industries, which makes them more accessible and cost-effective compared to some other elements including vanadium. Overall, each element substitution can potentially influence properties such as ionic conductivity, thermal stability, electrochemical performance, and structural stability. By using the ML model, the predicted formation energy per atom of NMVTP, NMVFP, and NMVAP were −1.99, −1.86, and −1.82 eV, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed compounds are predicted to possess good crystal stability with NMVTP being the most stable. We then turn to DFT calculations to validate the proposed structures. The relaxed structures of the proposed compounds are depicted in Fig. 1d and S3.† The lattice parameters of these structures are also presented in Table. S1.† It can be observed that all the structures were able to preserve the NASICON characteristics. However, NMVAP experienced more distortion and exhibited relatively narrower unit cells compared to these of NMVTP and NMVFP. Previous reports indicate that a slightly larger channel in the structure is preferable for SIB applications. Furthermore, to verify the proposed observation the corresponding structures (NMVAP, NMVFP, and NMVTP) were further subjected to synthesis and characterization. It is expected that the proposed structure is promising for the SIB system.\nFirstly, to verify the electrochemical sodium storage properties of the ML-DFT predicted (NMVAP, NMVFP, and NMVTP) materials were synthesized via a rapid pyro-synthesis process (the detailed information can be found in the ESI†). The crystal features of the prepared cathode materials were analyzed using the PXRD, and the results are provided in Fig. S4.† It can be witnessed that the carbon-coated NMVAP/C, NMVFP/C, and NMVTP/C samples crystallize in the NASICON structured phase of trigonal symmetry with a space group of Rc. Though, the NMVFP/C belongs to the NASICON family additional phase is evidenced, indicating the existence of pyrophosphates during the annealing. Since the NMVTP/C sample exhibited estimable electrochemical Na+ storage properties, we have adopted Rietveld refinement (using X'Pert Highscore Plus Program) to determine the crystal structure of the NMVTP/C cathode. The Bragg diffractions peak at (012), (104), (113), (006), (024), (211), (122), (030), (220), (131), (134), (042), (404), (232), (140), (143), (502), and (330), as shown in Fig. 1c, are indexed well to a trigonal symmetry with a space group of Rc, according to X'pert Highscore software. The results of the structural framework of the Rietveld refinement are presented in Table S2.† From the structural refinement, the lattice parameters of NMVTP were calculated to be a = b = 8.85431 Å, c = 21.68460 Å, and V = 1472.285 Å (Table S2†). Furthermore, the fitness of the plot (inset in Fig. 1c) verifies the validity of the refinement process.\nThe detailed microstructures of the pyro-synthesized NMVTP/C were observed through FE-SEM (Fig. S5†) and HR-TEM (Fig. 1e). NMVTP/C exhibits a flake-like morphology with sizes ranging from 100–500 nm (Fig. S5a and b†). Whereas the NMVAP/C and NMVFP/C cathodes exhibit microparticle-like morphology Fig. S5c and d.† The amorphous carbon layer with a thickness of ∼5 nm on the surface of the NMVTP/C microflakes is observed in Fig. 1f. The high-resolution TEM image of the single flakes in Fig. 1g exhibits highly crystalline lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.61 nm, which is attributed to the (012) plane of the trigonal crystal system, as previously indicated by the PXRD pattern. The TEM/energy dispersive X-ray mapping study reveals the consistent presence of Na, Mn, V, Ti, P, O, and C in the selected area in Fig. 1h, further confirming the purity of the sample. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on NMVTP/C to determine the precise C content; the corresponding TGA plot is shown in Fig. S6a.† The amount of C in the NMVTP/C material was found to be 4.73%. Raman spectroscopy was carried out to elucidate the nature of the C shielded on the NMVTP/C material, and the corresponding results are given in Fig. S6b.† The Raman spectrum comprises two characteristic peaks at 1349.71 cm−1 (D-band) and 1592.84 cm−1(G-band). The ratio of sp3 to sp2 (i.e., the ratio of ID/IG) is determined to be 0.85, indicating that the C in the sample is amorphous in nature. Likewise, the ratio of ID/IG is determined to be 0.84 and 0.85 for NMVFP/C and NMVAP/C cathodes, respectively; indicating that the carbon features are amorphous as that of the NMVTP/C cathode in Fig. S6b.† Additionally, XPS was employed to identify the chemical composition and oxidation state of the transition metals in the NMVTP/C samples. The V 2p profile in Fig. S7a† exhibits two major peaks with binding energies of 519.2 and 522.8 eV, corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbit energy phase, respectively, with a separation of 3.6 eV. This is ascribed to the trivalent nature of V in the NMVTP/C sample. The Mn 2p profile in Fig. S7b† displays peaks at 642.3 and 653.4 eV, corresponding to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, with spin–orbit splitting energy of 11.1 eV. This indicates that the binding energy of Mn is 2+. Moreover, the paramagnetic metal phase appears at 645.9 and 656.6 eV in the form of shake-up satellites. The Ti 2p XPS profile in Fig. S8a† exhibits peaks at 459.4 and 464.9 eV, with an energy separation of 5.5 eV; this points to the tetravalent nature of Ti4+. The C 1s XPS profile in Fig. S8b† reveals two main peaks at 284.6 and 285.2 eV, corresponding to sp2 graphitized and sp3 diamond-like carbon C–C units, respectively. The small peak at 289.1 eV signifies COO bonds condensed on the surface. The O 1s XPS profile in Fig. S8c† displays peaks at 530.9, 532.4, and 535.3 eV, attributed to M–O, C–O–C, and COO bonds, respectively. The Na 1s and P 2p XPS profiles in Fig. S8d and S8e† reveal a pronounced peak at 1071.5 eV and 133.1 eV, respectively, signifying the existence of Na and P in the sample. Summing up these observations, the survey spectrum in Fig. S8f† indicates the purity of the NMVTP/C sample.\nElectrochemical sodium storage properties of three cathodes are studied using the CV technique in a half cell at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage domain between 4.15−1.5 V. The resultant CV profiles of the NMVAP/C, NMVFP/C, and NMVTP/C cathodes are illustrated in Fig. 2a–c. From CV profiles of NMVAP/C, there are three curves (V3+/4+ (3.5 V), Mn2+/3+ (3.7 V), and V4+/5+ (4.05 V)) existed during the positive scan, validating the involvement of V and Mn in the extraction of Na+ from the NMVAP/C structure. A similar phenomenon has been observed in earlier studies, which reported that the incorporation of Al3+ induces the high-valence redox activity of V. Nevertheless, the disappearance of Mn2+/3+ in the subsequent cycle specifies the poor electrochemical reversibility associated with structural failure. It is worth noting that the NMVFP/C and NMVTP/C cathodes reveal V4+/5+ (4.05 V) redox couples along with the V2+/3+ (1.6 V) redox couples. Yet these sample doesn't exhibit specific peaks for Mn2+/3+ and V3+/4+, rather a single peak is observed at 3.58 V and 3.6 V for NMVFP/C and NMVTP/C, respectively. This could be associated with the composition of Mn2+/3+ and V3+/4+ due to their small voltage difference as evidenced in the earlier reports. In addition, the Fe2+/3+ (3.1 V) and Ti3+/4+ (2.2 V) redox couples are witnessed for NMVFP/C and NMVTP/C, respectively.\nThe rate performance output is provided in (Fig. 2d–f), with an increase of C-rates, the NMVTP/C cathode exhibits superior rate stability followed by the NMVFP/C cathode. Notably, the NMVAP/C experienced a rapid capacity decay with an increase in C-rates. The NMVAP/C, NMVFP/C, and NMVTP/C cathodes could register capacities of 82, 113.4, and 133.14 mA h g−1 at 0.17C, respectively. The reversible capacity achieved by NMVTP/C (59.2 mA h g−1) cathode at a 17.5C rate is far ahead of NMVAP/C (10 mA h g−1), and NMVFP/C (31 mA h g−1) cathodes. The electrochemical properties (charge/discharge profiles) of the three cathodes in the voltage region of 4.15–1.5 V at 0.17C rate for the first two cycles are presented in (Fig. 2g–i). The voltage plateau and redox couple position of the three samples is in line with the CV observation. Furthermore, to visualize the stability features of these electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed before and after the cycling process. The resultant Nyquist plots of all samples are shown in Fig. S9a–c.† The respective Nyquist plots were fitted utilizing the electrochemical equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. S9a–c†). The fitting constraints for the NMVAP/C, NMVFP/C, and NMVTP/C are provided in Table S3, S4, and S5,† respectively. Where, R1, R2, R3, R4, Q1, Q3, Q4, and W have represented the solution or electrolyte resistance (Rs), the resistance of the solid electrolyte interface (RSEI), solid electrolyte interface capacitance (QSEI or CSEI), charge transfer resistance (RCT), the capacitance of charge transfer (QCT or CCT), and Warburg elements diffusion resistance, respectively. The corresponding resistance outputs of the different cathodes before and after cycling process is compared in the Fig S10.† It is evident that the Rs and RSEI have a minimal contribution to the internal resistance of the respective cathodes investigated in this investigation. On the other hand, before cycling process, the calculated charge transfer resistance (RCT) values had a major contribution to the overall resistance of the different cathodes analysed here. In specific, RCT values of NMVAP/C, NMVFP/C, and NMVTP/C are 1592, 1145, and 913.6 Ω, respectively. After-cycling process overall RCT values of NMVAP/C, NMVFP/C, and NMVTP/C are decreased (1025, 485.8, and 280.7 Ω) indicating a low charge transfer capability compared to the before-cycle samples. Overall, the NMVTP/C sample exhibited less resistance than the NMVFP/C and NMVAP/C, which is in line with the galvanostatic and rate performance outputs. Thus, the combined electrochemical studies (galvanostatic study, rate output, and EIS) substantiate our ML-DFT-assisted predictions i.e., the NMVTP/C has superior crystal stability, which ensures good electrochemical stability.\nFrom the charge/discharge output of the NMVTP/C, we have calculated the number of moles of Na+ that participated during the electrochemical process (Fig. 2i). In specific, the charge profile exhibits an extraction capacity of 128.56 mA h g−1 with two strong plateaus at 3.4 and 3.8 V. This indicates the two-step extraction of 2.25 moles Na+ ions from the NMVTP cathode i.e., the formation of Na1.25MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 (N1.25MVTP) phase with respect to the oxidation of V3+→V4+, Mn2+ → Mn3+, and V4+ → V5+. Meanwhile, the discharge curve displays a discharge capacity of 133.14 mA h g−1 with two principal voltage plateaus at 3.98 and 3.48 V, suggesting the insertion of 2.33 moles of Na+ ions into the NMVTP/C structure regulated by the reduction of V5+ → V4+, Mn3+ → Mn2+, and V4+ → V3+. More importantly, the inclusion of Ti provided additional insertion pathways at 2.25 V (driven by the reduction of Ti4+ → Ti3+) and 1.6 V (driven by the reduction of V2+ → V3+) for the Na+ ions to achieve Na3.58MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 (N3.58MVTP) phase (the average Na+ (de)insertion voltage is retained at 3.42 V). The continuous Na+ (de)insertion properties of the NMVTP/C cathode were monitored for 300 cycles at a rate of 0.77C in the potential range of 4.15–1.5 V; the resultant cycling stability curve is provided in Fig. 3a. After supplying 112 mA h g−1 at the first cycle the NMVTP/C cathode can retain a reversible capacity of 94 mA h g−1 following 300 cycles, with a capacity retention of 83%, and maintains a coulombic efficiency of almost 100%. This demonstrates the excellent sodium storage property of the NASICON-type NMVTP/C cathode even after repeated charge/discharge cycles, owing to its inherent structural stability. Selected charge/discharge patterns (after 100, 200, and 300 cycles) for the NMVTP/C cathode at a current density of 0.77C are provided in Fig. S11a.†The voltage plateaus are maintained in successive cycles, indicating that the Na+ (de)insertion into the NMVTP/C structure follows the same pathway.\nMoreover, the stable voltage profile in the charge/discharge curves suggests that the redox features of V2+/3+, Ti3+/4+, V3+/4+, Mn2+/3+, and V4+/5+ in the NMVTP/C are preserved throughout the cycles. Likewise, the voltage shapes are retained at the different current densities in the voltage range of 4.15–1.5 V (Fig. S11b†), further confirming the structural integrity and electrochemical Na reversibility of the NMVTP/C cathode both of which are vital benchmarks for any cathode material. The superior rate performance at all current densities in the wide voltage range demonstrates the electrochemical stability of the NMVTP/C cathode, which most SIB electrode materials do not exhibit. The rapid Na+ (de)insertion capability of the NMVTP/C cathode was also evaluated at a current rate of 10.5C and 14C in the voltage range of 4.15–1.5 V for prolonged cycles; the resultant cycling performances are presented in Fig. 3b and c.\nAfter delivering a maximum discharge capacity of 92 and 84 mA h g−1 at a rate of 10.5C and 14C, reversible capacities of 70 and 63 mA h g−1 are maintained after 1500 and 8000 cycles, respectively. This implies that at rates of 10.5C and 14C, the prevalent capacity retentions are 76% and 75%, respectively are retained. More importantly, the corresponding selected charge/discharge patterns at the respective rates, as shown in Fig. S11c and S11d,† preserve their shape and redox peak position throughout prolonged cycling, indicating the rapid and stable egress/ingress of Na+ ions from/into the NMVTP/C skeleton without sacrificing the redox properties. To recognize the importance of structural stability of the NMVTP/C during frequent Na+ insertion/extraction processes, the ex situ XRD analysis was performed after the cycling process. The cells at 17C after long-term cycles were disassembled and subjected to XRD analysis. From the Fig. S12,† it is obvious that the XRD patterns of the NMVTP/C cathode are largely preserved, which is crucial in assisting the Na+ insertion/extraction process for the most part of the cycling process. Yet, an in-depth understanding of the structural and valence state changes associated with the transition metal ions during the charge/discharge process of the NMVTP/C cathode using advanced characterization practices could be essential, which will be focused in future studies. It must be noted that an exceedingly small number of cathode materials for SIBs have been demonstrated to display stable voltage curves at rapid testing rates. As summarized in the Ragone plot (Fig. 3d), the NMVTP/C cathode exhibits the best performance among the polyanion-based sodium cathodes compared in this study. In particular, NMVTP/C exhibits the highest specific energy of 455 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 85.5 W kg−1 (based on the mass of the cathode material). Moreover, the electrochemical performance of the NMVAP/C, NMVFP/C, and NMVTP/C cathode is compared with previously reported NASICON-type cathodes in Table S6.† In specific, NMVTP/C cathode holds superior electrochemical properties than the compared cathodes highlighting the advantages of combination of Mn, V, and Ti elements in the NASICON structure.\nThe electrochemical kinetics of the NMVTP/C cathode was further investigated by performing CV at distinct voltage sweep domains from 0.1 to 0.5 mV s−1, and the outcomes are presented in Fig. 4a. As the sweep rate increases from 0.1 to 0.5 mV s−1, the peaks in the CV patterns are progressively amplified. At a particular potential, the contribution of diffusion-limited reaction kinetics and capacitance kinetics can be determined quantitatively from the following equation:\nwhere k1v refers to the surface capacitance process, and k2v1/2 refers to the diffusion-driven redox reaction at a definite scan rate. The surface capacitance-consumption data at all examined voltages were calculated and plotted in Fig. 4b. At a rate of 0.1 mV s−1, the calculated surface capacitance (shaded region) corresponds to 29.25% of the total capacity. Fig. 4c presents the histogram of the capacitive and diffusion-driven consumption at progressive scan rates. The surface-induced reaction dominates at higher scan rates. Interestingly, even at a high scan rate (0.5 mV s−1), more than 35.3% of the redox reaction takes place through the diffusion-induced intercalation process. This demonstrates that the capacity of the cathode mainly originates from the diffusion-driven Na+ (de)intercalation process. The Na migration kinetics and phase transition of the NASICON-type NMVTP/C cathode were observed by performing GITT at 0.15C with 10 min intervals between each pulse. The cathode was rested for 2 h to obtain a quasi-equilibrium potential, and it was examined under the potential range of 4.15–1.5 V. The resultant titration curve for the first cycle is presented in Fig. 4d.\nThe sodium diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the transient voltage established in the GITT curves and using Fick's second law:\nwhere DNa is the sodium chemical diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1) and mB,VM, MW, and A are the mass loading (g), molar volume (cm3 mol−1), molecular weight (g mol−1), and sum of the surface area (cm2) of the NMVTP/C cathode, respectively. τ (s) is the time of the applied current pulse, and ΔEs and ΔEτ are the variations in the steady-state voltage and total difference in the cell voltage arising from the persistent pulse of a single-stage GITT investigation, respectively. The continuous variation in the equilibrium voltage indicates the single-phase reaction mechanism for the Na+ (de)intercalation between 4.15 and 1.5 V (Fig. 4d). The corresponding diffusion coefficient for the charge and discharge processes are plotted in Fig. 4e and f. The calculated diffusion coefficients are in the ranges of 2.25 × 10−8 to 9.51 × 10−9 and 5.26 × 10−8 to 9.71 × 10−9 for the extraction and de-intercalation processes, respectively. This signifies the rapid Na+ flow in the NMVTP/C cathode. In particular, the rise and drop of the diffusion coefficient during the charge and discharge processes, respectively, around the voltage regions of 2.27/2.13, 3.62/3.36, and 3.9/3.8 V suggest that the Ti3+/Ti4+, V3+/V4+, Mn2+/Mn3+, and V4+/V5+ redox activities induce the reversible Na+ extraction and insertion in the NMVTP/C cathode. The enhanced Na+ diffusivity contributes to the rapid sodium storage property of the NMVTP/C cathode, thus resulting in its excellent rate properties and rapid current exploration abilities.\nIn situ XRD observations were carried out to determine the structural evolution of the NMVTP/C cathode during the Na+ (de)insertion process. The designed cell was initially charged to 4.15 V and discharged to 1.5 V at a current density of 0.17C. The in situ 2D contour map profiles along with the equivalent charge/discharge schemes are presented in Fig. 5a. The seven projected peaks for the uncharged electrode can be allocated as the (104), (113), (024), (211), (122), and (030) Bragg planes of the parent NMVTP/C cathode. The (006) plane alone exhibited practically no alterations during the charge and discharge conditions. Excitingly, as the Na+ extraction commenced, the peaks corresponding to the (104), (113), (024), (211), (122), and (030) planes of NMVTP/C slightly moved toward a higher angle. This indicates that the initial sodium charging was induced by the V3+ → V4+ and Mn2+ → Mn3+ redox-dominated single-phase sodium extraction. However, it is interesting to witness that the (113), (024), (122), and (030) planes at 23.32°, 28.24°, 31.72°, and 34.77°, respectively disappeared, and new peaks evolved at 23.93°, 28.92°, 32.72°, and 36.11°, respectively, representing the two-phase reaction originating from the V4+ → V5+ transition. More interestingly, the new peaks at 23.93°, 28.92°, 32.72°, and 36.11° uninterruptedly shifted to a higher 2θ angle, with no peak evolving further, indicating that solid-solution reaction has prevailed in the NMVTP/C cathode. Whereas (104) diffraction shape alone splits into two peaks that evolved sharply during the charge course. Thus, the appearance of new peaks and disappearance of the prevailing peaks during the charging process suggest that further Na+ extraction was constrained by the bi-phasic transition stemming from the V4+ → V5+ redox species. As the discharge process was initiated, all peaks began to return to their original states. Notably, after discharging, the (104) peak, which underwent splitting began to integrate into the original peak, as indicated by the open-circuit voltage (OCV). Furthermore, the new peaks at 23.93°, 28.92°, 32.72°, and 36.11° shifted back to a lower 2θ angle and disappeared. And the peaks corresponding to the (113), (024), (122), and (030) planes reappear in their original position, signifying that the original framework is restored at the end of the first cycle. This strongly suggests that the reversible phase transition occurs between 4.15 and 1.5 V.\nAdditionally, in situ XRD profile provides us with a firm sodium storage assessment (Fig. S13†), which offers a solid visualization of the structural changes in NMVTP/C cathode materials. In sum, all peaks underwent a considerable shift, following which they progressively returned to the original state, signifying that the charge/discharge process is highly reversible. The change in the peak positions indicates a single-phase solid-solution reaction, while the appearance of new peaks or the disappearance of existing ones indicates a biphasic reaction. Thus, the NMVTP/C cathode subsequently undergoes a reversible solid-solution and bi-phasic transition during the electrochemical Na+ (de)insertion process, resulting in its well-established voltage configuration. To corroborate the findings from the in situ study regarding the sodium storage mechanism of the NMVTP/C cathode, ex situ XRD measurements were carried out. The ex situ XRD patterns at various charge/discharge depths exhibit equivalent patterns to that of the of in situ XRD observation (i.e. shift of the (113), (024), and (122) peaks, splitting/merging of the (104) peak, and appearance/disappearance of the (030) peak) (Fig. S14†). Thus, the correspondence between the results of the in situ and ex situ observations confirms the solid-solution and bi-phasic processes. In command to acquire a deep understanding of the volume variation upon Na+ (de)intercalation courses, the Le Bail fitting is performed using the X'pert Highscore program. As interpreted in Fig. 5b, the unit cell volume slowly shrinks during the de-insertion period and enlarges during the re-insertion process. The overall volume alteration (after charge/discharge period) is estimated to be around 4.7% (ΔV/VParent) and is near to that of Na3V2(PO4)3, but is less than that of Na4MnV(PO4)3. The considerably a smaller amount of volume variation is accountable for the superior rate performance of the present investigating NMVTP/C cathode.\nBased on these observations, the electrochemical mechanism arising in the NMVTP/C cathode during Na (de)insertion can be enlightened schematically in Fig. 6a. The possible 2.25 moles of Na+ extraction from the NMVTP cathode results in the formation of N1.25MVTP as an intermediate phase after the 1st charge (based capacity output at 0.17C). After the end of the 1st discharge process, N3.58MVTP is regained. To realize practical requests, we further demonstrate the Na ion full cells based on NMVTP/C cathode and hard carbon (HC) anode in the coin cell. The half-cell charge/discharge profile of NMVTP/C and HC anode is compared in Fig. S15a† for reference. HC anode is chemically pre-sodiated before cell assembly. The rate capability yield of the NMVTP/C//HC full-cell are 136, 126, 114, 102, and 100 mA h g−1 cycled at different rates of 0.07C, 0.14C, 0.28C, 0.56C, and 0.77C are superior (Fig. S15b†). Furthermore, the cycling stability of NMVTP/C//HC full-cell is tested for 100 cycles at 0.77C rate (initially the cathodes are run at 0.07C for better stability), which can retain a stable discharge capacity (74.5 mA h g−1) with 78% capacity retention (Fig. 6b), indicating the NMVTP/C//HC full-cell is comprehensive for real-world applications. The selected charge/discharge pattern validates the stable voltage platform and redox outputs of the NMVTP/C//HC full-cell for the most part of the cycling test (Fig. 6c). The voltage vs. power density of plot NMVTP/C//HC is comparatively illustrated in Fig. 6d with other sodium-full cell systems constructed using the pre-sodiation strategy available in the literature. Especially the energy density (347 W h kg−1 at 340 W kg−1 power density) of our NMVTP/C//HC full-cell significantly exceeds the performances of sodium-full devices namely, PC-Fe3O4//Na2FeP2O7, Sn–C//Na3V2(PO4)3, Sb–O-G//Na3V2(PO4)3, Graphite//Na1.5VOPO4.8F0.7, Na2Ti3O7//VOPO4, NiO/Fe2O3//Na3V2(PO4)3. CV profile of the NMVTP//HC full-cell at 0.1 mV s−1 reveals a well-established oxidation sites appear at 4.05, 3.5, and 1.63 V, and the reduction locations arise at 3.98, 3.33, and 1.93 V (Fig. S15c†). More importantly, the CV-tested full-cell is further subjected to power the digital appliances (charged again). Notably, the NMVTP/C//HC full-cell can retain a potential of 4.08 V (Fig. S15d†), which is very crucial in powering the LED light (Fig. S15e†) and electronic digital watch (Fig. S15f†). The NMVTP/C cathode material established in this work is recognized to be one of the finest electrochemical presentations and encouraging SIB systems, which could certainly be streamlined to large-scale constructions in near future. To further ensure the intrinsic role of the NMVTP cathode, Na migration paths, as well as its energy barrier were evaluated through bond valence site (BVS) energy calculation and the Na insertion voltage was predicted using DFT method.\nWe found that, as shown in Fig. 7a, there are five possible pathways for Na+ to migrate within the NMVTP, NMVAP, and NMVFP structures, represented in five different colors: P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. It can be observed that Na ion in the NMVTP and NMVFP would likely diffuse through P1 pathway with corresponding energy barrier of 596 meV and 516 meV, respectively (Fig. 7b–f). In the other hand, the P5 pathway is likely more favorable for Na in NMVAP with the energy barrier of 516 meV. Generally, NMVTP has the lowest Na migration energy barrier inferring Na-storage superiority behavior than the other samples. For evaluating the phase stability upon Na insertion into NMVTP, the formation energy in various Na concentrations was calculated, and the corresponding convex hull was constructed. We screened 10 structures with the lowest electrostatic energy for each composition in NaxMnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 for x = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4. As shown in Fig. 7g, throughout all concentrations, it is found that there are 4 stable structures between Na1MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 and Na4MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3, i.e. Na1.5MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3, Na2.5MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3, and Na3.5MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3. It can also be observed that some metastable phases can be reached electrochemically since they lie below the convex hull value of 0. The calculation also suggests the combination of two-phase and solid-solution reactions, as observed from experimental characterization. Based on the obtained convex hull, the theoretical insertion voltage was also developed (Fig. 7h). The predicted Na insertion voltage is resemblance to that of electrochemical characterization. However, the subtle difference due to the low conductivity of the NASICON can be further improved using other carbon-based coating materials such as CNT or graphene. Overall, these theoretical studies are in good agreement with the experimental characterization and can be used for further materials large-scale development.\nIt must be emphasized here, as predicted from the ML-DFT model the NMVTP/C with the most stable formation energy demonstrated superior structural and electrochemical stabilities. Knowing that Fe and Al distribution in the earth's crust is ample, the realization of stable sodium storage properties from NMVAP/C and NMVFP/C cathodes could be highly beneficial. However, NMVAP/C and NMVFP/C cathodes with poor formation energy and large diffusion barrier exhibit insignificant sodium storage performance than the NMVTP/C with stable formation energy and low diffusion barrier. The interplay between the compositional and structural features might be effective to overcome these challenges, which needs further investigation.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The fraction analyses of P1, P2, and P3 were carried out through solvent extraction. Toluene is usually used to dissolve the relatively small aromatic molecules in pitches, while quinoline with higher solubility can dissolve larger aromatic molecules. Both the toluene-insoluble (TI) and quinoline-insoluble (QI) components show a positive correlation with the softening point and Tg. These two fractions are the heavy components with a large molecular weight, which could restrict the mobility of pitches and lead to a higher softening point and viscosity. Fig. S1† shows the DSC curves of the three CTPs, from which the Tg values of P1, P2, and P3 were determined to be 68 °C, 93 °C, and 108 °C, respectively. The glass transition usually occurs in a temperature range, and the ranges of P1, P2, and P3 were 44–94 °C, 66–140 °C, and 77–177 °C, respectively. It is notable that P3 had a broad glass transition range, which may be caused by the widest distribution of molecular size due to its rich QI and TI.\nFTIR spectra were employed to analyze the chemical structures of the CTPs. As shown in Fig. 1a, the spectra of P1, P2, and P3 all showed the sp2 aromatic C–H stretching band at 3100–2980 cm−1 and sp3 aliphatic C–H stretching vibration band at 2980–2830 cm−1. The peak at 1600 cm−1 corresponded to aromatic ring stretching, while the peak at 1450 cm−1 was attributed to –CH2– and –CH3 bending vibration or some aromatic rings. The three peaks at 900–700 cm−1 were caused by out-of-plane bending vibrations of the hydrogens attached to aromatic rings. Specifically, the peaks at 875, 815, and 750 cm−1 were attributed to isolated hydrogen, two neighboring hydrogens, and four neighboring hydrogens on aromatic rings, respectively. The aromaticity index (Iar) is always used to reflect the relative amounts of aromatic components. As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorbance band at 3100–2800 cm−1 could be deconvoluted into seven Gaussian peaks. The peak at 3040 cm−1 was caused by aromatic C–H stretching, while the rest of the peaks at 2953, 2920, 2891, 2870, 2850, and 2830 cm−1 were ascribed to vibration signals from aliphatic hydrogen, and the assignment details are listed in Table S1† (ref. ). The Iar was determined according to the ratio of the aromatic hydrogen peak area to the total peak area. The Iar values of P1, P2, and P3 were 0.665, 0.682, and 0.741, respectively.\nThe XRD patterns of the CTPs are shown in Fig. 1c and S2.† There was a broad and asymmetric 002 characteristic peak at around 2θ = 25°. The 002 peak could be fitted into two Gaussian peaks (γ band and π band). The γ band at around 20° represented the aliphatic chains and the π band at around 25° represented the stacking of aromatic molecules. The aromaticity index Iar could also be estimated from the XRD patterns. As listed in Tables S2,† the calculated Iar values of P1, P2, and P3 were 0.51, 0.69, and 0.77, respectively. The variation trend was consistent with the result from the FTIR analysis. These results signified that P1 had the most aliphatic chains and smaller aromatic nuclei, which tend to increase the fluidity of pitches. Moreover, the abundant aliphatic chains mean that P1 may have more sites that are easily attacked by oxygen. In contrast, larger aromatic nuclei and less aliphatic chains existed in P3, which tends to cause a lower fluidity and oxidation reactivity.\n\n3.2 Monitoring the pre-oxidation processes of the CTPs\nEx situ FTIR was used to investigate the chemical structure evolutions during the pre-oxidation. As shown in Fig. 1d and S2,† significant differences in the oxidation reactivity for the three CTPs could be discovered. The absorbance band at 1850–1680 cm−1 was attributed to CO, while the peak at 1720–1690 cm−1 was related to CO in ketone, aldehyde, and carboxyl groups. One could notice that P1 at 180 °C displayed almost no absorbance band at 1700 cm−1, indicating there was no formation of CO before 180 °C in P1. However, the absorbance peaks were observed at this temperature in P2 and P3. The absorbance intensity got increasingly stronger with the rise in the pre-oxidation temperature, suggesting more CO groups in ketone, aldehyde, or carboxyl were produced (Fig. S3†). The absorbance peak at 1735 cm−1 corresponding to CO in ester appeared at 300 °C in P1 and P2, but this peak in P3 started to appear at a lower temperature of 260 °C and the peak intensity was even stronger than that for the other two CTPs at 300 °C (Fig. S3†). Obviously, more CO groups in esters were formed in P3 than P1 and P2 below 260 °C. In view of the consideration the ester groups may come from the condensation of oxygen-containing groups, the more oxygen-containing groups in P3 will promote the earlier generation of ester groups than in P1 and P2. There also existed another two types of CO that were only observed in P3 (Fig. S3†). One related to the peak at 1770 cm−1 that appeared above 220 °C, which was attributed to esters with electron-withdrawing groups attached to single bonded oxygen, which may be caused by the condensation of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups; and another related to the other characteristic peak at 1835 cm−1 that appeared above 260 °C, which was attributed to CO in anhydride, indicating that the formation of anhydride may require a certain number of carboxyl or carbonyl groups. In addition, the absorbance band at 1300–1100 cm−1 was related to C–O stretching and O–H bending in phenoxy structures and ethers. With the prolonged pre-oxidation time, the absorbance intensity at 1300–1100 cm−1 was augmented and this band got distinctly higher when the temperature reached 260 °C in P3 (Fig. 1d). This suggested that the formation of phenol hydroxyl and ether groups had a high temperature dependence. It is also worth noting that the absorbance bands at 900–700 cm−1 and 3040 cm−1 became weaker obviously after pre-oxidation in P3, signifying the decreased content of aromatic hydrogen. This may be due to the attack of aromatic hydrogen by oxygen atoms and the more condensation reactions between the aromatic nuclei. The absorbance peak at 2980–2830 cm−1 in P3 also showed an apparent decline, which may be caused by the attack of aliphatic hydrogen by oxygen.\nTo further understand the changes after pre-oxidation, the chemical bonding states of C and O were analyzed by XPS. Fig. S4† shows the XPS spectra of the pristine CTPs and pre-oxidized CTPs (POP). The oxygen contents in P1, P2, and P3 were 3.78%, 3.60%, and 3.79% according to the XPS results, respectively. After pre-oxidation treatments, the oxygen contents increased by different degrees for the three CTPs, rising to 4.44%, 4.64%, and 10.44%, respectively. The C1s spectra displayed in Fig. 1e–g and S5† could be deconvoluted into six subpeaks at around 284.6, 285.2, 286.1, 287.6, 289.1, and 291.0 eV, corresponding to sp2 C (aromatic carbon), sp3 C (aliphatic carbon), C–OH/C–O–C, CO, O–CO, and π–π* shake-up, respectively. The fitting results manifested that CO and O–CO groups were produced after pre-oxidation. The contents of different oxygen-containing groups are shown in Fig. 1h. The C–OH/C–O–C groups were revealed to be the main existing types of oxygen components in the pre-oxidized CTPs. It could be noted that the contents of CO and O–CO in POP3 were significantly higher than that in POP1 and POP2, which was consistent with the results from the FTIR spectral analyses. The O1s spectra are also analyzed in the following. However it is to be noted that there exist divergences in the identification of the subpeaks in many literature, and so the O1s spectra were tentatively deconvoluted into two subpeaks here. As shown in Fig. S6,† the peak at 531.5 eV represented CO, while the peak at 533.1 eV was assigned to C–O. It was found the contents of both C–O and CO groups increased in the pre-oxidized CTPs. The oxygen content of P3 increased most significantly, and POP3 had the most C–O and CO components. Overall, these results based on FTIR and XPS spectral analyses revealed the higher oxidative reactivity of P3 than P1 and P2.\n\n3.3 Critical role of oxygen diffusion in oxidative stabilization\nChemical structures that are easy to transform into radicals are important in the pre-oxidation process, such as aliphatic side chains, which are easily attacked by oxygen. However, the above analyses based on FTIR and XPS disclosed that the oxidative degree had no relevance on the amount of aliphatic hydrogens in the present study. Some researchers have reported that the pre-oxidation of pitches was influenced by both chemical reactivity and oxygen diffusion. Oxygen diffusion is a non-negligible factor, but few literature studies have reported the important role of oxygen diffusion in isotropic pitches for constructing anodic HCs. Most of the related studies have focused on the pre-oxidation of pitch-based carbon fibers or mesophase pitches. For example, Singers et al. found that the stabilization process was controlled by oxygen diffusion for carbon fibers with large diameters, while the condition was inverse for fibers with small diameters (<10 μm), in which the stabilization process was oxidation reaction controlled rather than diffusion controlled. White et al. pointed out that high-viscosity mesophase pitches had shrinkage-crack porosity that allowed oxygen diffusion. Therefore, we presumed that the surface condition of pitches may be a critical factor for oxidative stabilization in the present study. To verify our speculation, ex situ optical images were used to track the state of CTPs during the pre-oxidation process. As shown in Fig. S7,† an obvious melting of the P1 particles happened at 180 °C due to their low Tg of 68 °C. The P2 particles did not completely melt into a high-fluidity liquid like the P1 particles did, but also formed big lumps at 180 °C due to their higher Tg of 93 °C and wider transition range (Fig. S8†). Also, the further rise of the pre-oxidation temperature resulted in a shape evolution from a drop to disk, which may be caused by the decrease in viscosity. Very different from the melting behaviors in P1 and P2, the P3 powder almost retained its pristine state throughout the pre-oxidation process, even when the temperature was higher than the glass transition range of P3 (Fig. S9†), implying the transition from the glass state to the liquid phase was inhibited.\nThe macrostructure difference before and after the pre-oxidation of the CTPs was also reflected in the sub-morphologies. As displayed in Fig. 2a–c, the pristine P1, P2, and P3 presented a similar granular morphology in shape. With the rise in temperature, a distinct morphology change gradually occurred. It can be seen in Fig. 2d and e that POP1 and POP2 presented a dense surface, indicating the P1 and P2 had completely melted and merged into one block during pre-oxidation. Contrary to this, the surface of POP3 was quite uneven (Fig. 2f), and the spherical-like particles adhered to each other, demonstrating a substantially weakened merging behavior between neighboring particles during the pre-oxidation in P3. Moreover, the P3 particles had diameters of tens of micrometers, which has been proven to be an essential condition for achieving sufficient oxidative stabilization in a limited duration time. A further magnified SEM image of POP3 is shown in Fig. S10,† where the coarse degree of the surface is more distinct. Some pores and microcracks could be discovered in the bulk of the pitch, which were conducive to expose more of the surface to air and form convenient oxygen diffusion pathways toward the internal area. To further verify the importance of oxygen diffusion pathways during the pre-oxidation process, another control sample (denoted as RPOP3) was designed and fabricated. In detail, P3 was pre-oxidized at 300 °C with a rapid rise rate of 10 °C min−1, and the duration time was kept to the same as that used in the preparation process of POPs. As shown in Fig. S11,† a dense structure of RPOP3 could be observed due to the rapid heating-induced transition from the glass state to the liquid phase. Moreover, according to the FTIR and high-resolution XPS C1s spectra of RPOP3 (Fig. S12†), there was only a little increase in the content of oxygen-containing groups. These results demonstrate that the dense structure and smooth surface caused by premature transition from glass state to liquid led to a difficulty of oxygen diffusion. For P1 and P2, the transition from the glass state to liquid played a more important role compared to the quantities of aliphatic hydrogens. In the case of POP3, the high content of large aromatic molecules constrained the molecular mobility and led to the high Tg and high glass transition temperature range, which preserved the access for oxygen diffusion in the initial stage of pre-oxidation. As the pre-oxidation proceeded, the increased cross-linking degree continually inhibited the transition from the glass state to liquid even at higher pre-oxidation temperatures, thus the oxygen diffusion channels could be well retained.\n\n3.4 Structural evolution of the CTPs during carbonization\nThe structural difference in the precursors had a profound impact on the microstructure of the resulting CTP-derived carbons, especially the quantity of oxygen groups.Ex situ XRD was used to investigate the microstructure changes during carbonization. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, for the POP1 and POP2 samples, the characteristic 002 diffraction of pitches at 2θ of ∼25° varied from a broad peak to a sharp one when increasing the temperature from 400 °C to 500 °C, indicating the stacking of PAH layers increased and that mesophase structures were generated. The optical images (Fig. S13†) revealed that all the CTPs except POP3 had completely melted at 500 °C, whereas there was limited caking in POP3. These results indicate that the insufficient oxygen cross-linking structures failed to convert the pitches from thermoplastic to thermosetting, which resulted in the melting states of POP1 and POP2 below 500 °C, and meanwhile the ordered arrangement of PAHs took place in the liquid phase. The similar changes in the 002 peak at 500 °C to that of POP1 and POP2 could also be observed in the pristine CTPs without pre-oxidation and RPOP3 (Fig. S14†), signifying the analogous liquid-phase carbonization process. With the further rise in carbonization temperature, the 002 peaks of POP1 and POP2 became sharper due to the formation of ordered carbon structures. In contrast, we observed a distinctly different variation trend for the 002 peak in POP3 (Fig. 3c). No obvious intensity change of these 002 peaks with the rising temperature was detected, suggesting the PAH layers stayed in a relatively disordered state during the carbonization.\nThe average interlayer distance of the 002 plane (d002), and thickness (Lc) and length (La) of the stacking layers were calculated according to Bragg's law and Scherrer equation, and the corresponding parameters and variation trends are listed in Table S3† and Fig. 3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3d, the d002 of POP1 and POP2 showed a decreasing trend below 600 °C. The reduction in d002 may be attributed to the formation of a mesophase and the removal of aliphatic chains and oxygen groups, in which the molecular planarity was enhanced. Nevertheless, the value of d002 for POP3 increased with the rise in temperature above 400 °C. The d002 variation trend of POP3 was very different from that for POP1 and POP2, which could probably be ascribed to the gas evolution and the inhibited rearrangement of the carbon skeleton due to the abundant oxygen cross-linking structure.\nThe variation trends of the Lc values with rising temperature are displayed in Fig. 3e. It could be observed that the Lc values increased and then decreased in POP1 and POP2 during the coking process, and the same trends also occurred in the pristine CTPs and RPOP3 (Fig. S15b†). According to the reported literature, the graphitizable carbons commonly present such a variation trend and the rise in Lc values may be ascribed to the increased stacking layer numbers of PAHs, while the decreased Lc values could be related to gas evolution and the collapse of some unstable layers. In this regard, some new insights are supplemented here. The asymmetric index (AI) of the 002 peak was investigated to elucidate the reason for the variation in the Lc values. The calculation for AI is shown in Fig. S16,† which was determined using the right FWHM (full width at half maximum) divided by the left FWHM. A large AI value indicates a high ordering degree in the crystalline structure. The variation trends of AI are displayed in Fig. 3f and S15c.† First, it could be easily understood that the rise in Lc values and AI of POP1 and POP2 were caused by the growth of mesophase structures in the initial coking process. With the further pyrolysis of POP1 and POP2, the Lc values and AI decreased. The fall in Lc values calculated by Scherrer equation signified the rise in FWHM (Table S3†), and meanwhile the fall in AI suggested the left FWHM increased significantly in this process, which may indicate a great transformation from the isotropic phase to some low-ordered structures instead of only a structural collapse. These low-ordered structures can improve the diffraction intensity in the low angle region and broaden the left FWHM, thus decreasing the average size of the crystalline thickness calculated by Scherrer's equation. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the decreases in Lc values and AI were caused by the great transformation from a disordered phase to low-ordered structures that occurred during the coking process in these CTPs in which an obvious melting existed. The low-ordered structures generated during the coking process made the subsequent growth of carbon microcrystalline easier. Therefore, it could be seen that the Lc values of POP1 and POP2 significantly increased at 1200 °C. Meanwhile, the Lc values of POP3 varied slightly during the whole carbonization process, indicating the microcrystalline growth in the C-axis direction was limited. Fig. 3g and S13d† display the variation trend of the La values. Similarly, the variation trend of La was also changed slightly in POP3 compared to other CTPs, signifying the microcrystalline growth of the other CTPs in the lateral direction was more remarkable than in POP3. Overall, the significant differences in the variation trend in the crystalline parameters between POP3 and the other CTPs indicated their diverse structural evolution process.\nThe morphology and texture differences of the CTP-derived carbons are discussed below. Fig. 2g–i and S17† display the SEM images of the CTP-derived carbons at 1200 °C. The obtained carbons from the thermoplastic pitch had lamellar structures. Meanwhile, POP3-1200 presented a bulk morphology probably benefiting from its high thermal stabilization after pre-oxidation. HRTEM was used to further investigate the texture of the three carbonized samples. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 presented relatively ordered structures with long-range carbon fringes. The carbon layers had a uniform orientation, demonstrating a graphite-like phase. In contrast, POP3-1200 showed a disordered structure consisting of stacks of curved carbon layers (Fig. 4c). The short and turbostratic carbon fringes in POP3 resulted in the formation of closed pores.\nThe crystalline characteristics of the CTP-derived carbons were further investigated by XRD analysis. According to the literature relating to the diffraction peaks of 002 plane, carbon structures can be divided into three subpeaks. The region with a d002 value larger than 4.0 Å could be attributed to disordered carbon, while the region with a d002 value between 3.6–4.0 Å is the pseudo-graphitic domain, which facilitates the intercalation of Na+. The region with a d002 value smaller than 3.6 Å represents the graphite-like domains. A small layer distance of a graphite-like structure is not favorable for sodium intercalation reactions and the access to closed pores. As shown in Fig. 4d–e and Table S4,† POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 mainly consisted of the graphite-like phase, for which the proportions in POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 were 85.79% and 86.85%, respectively. The same characteristics were also presented in the carbons derived from the pristine CTPs (Fig. S18 and Table S4†). Very differently, the XRD pattern for POP3-1200 (Fig. 4f) disclosed that it mainly consisted of the pseudo-graphitic phase with a high proportion of 70.22% and graphite-like phase with a low proportion of 23.30%, confirming the oxidative stabilization greatly suppressed the formation of the graphite-like phase.\nThe first-order Raman spectra provide more microstructure information. The Raman spectra could be deconvoluted into five subpeaks, and the assignment details are shown in Table S5† (ref. ). As presented in Fig. 4g–i, the G band at ∼1590 cm−1 represented the ideal graphitic lattice, and the D (D1) band at ∼1350 cm−1, D2 band at ∼1620 cm−1, and D3 band at 1500 cm−1 were related to defects in the graphene layer edges, surface graphene layers, and amorphous carbon, respectively. In addition, the D4 band at 1200 cm−1 was caused by sp2–sp3 bonds. The area ratios of the D and G bands (AD/AG) can be used to evaluate the graphitization degree. Here, the AD/AG values of POP1-1200, POP2-1200, and POP3-1200 were 3.22, 3.36, and 4.35, respectively. These results demonstrate that POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 both derived from thermoplastic precursors had higher graphitization degrees while POP3-1200 was relatively disordered. The crystalline size (La) could be calculated based on the method proposed by Cançado et al. and the equation: La = (2.4 × 10−10) λ4(AD/AG)−1, where λ is the laser line wavelength. Here, the La values calculated by the Raman spectra were 5.97, 5.72, and 4.42 nm for POP1-1200, POP2-1200, and POP3-1200, respectively. These results were close to the values obtained based on the XRD measurements, and both methods revealed that POP3-1200 had the smallest crystalline size. As a result, POP3-1200 had a more disordered arrangement of carbon layers and a larger interlayer distance as well as a smaller crystalline size compared to that for POP1-1200 and POP2-1200. These microstructural differences would significantly affect the sodium-storage behaviors of the CTP-derived carbons.\n\n3.5 Carbonization mechanism of the CTPs\nIt is well-known that HCs are generally obtained through pyrolyzing the thermosetting precursors with abundant oxygen species. For thermosetting pre-oxidized pitches, the oxygen cross-linking structures are thought to inhibit the mesophase formation, while the decomposition of oxygen-containing groups further enhance the disorder degree in the subsequent carbonization. Previous research into these aspects laid the foundations for high-performance SIB anodes. Nevertheless, because the pyrolysis of CTPs is a highly complex process, there remains a lack of in-depth understanding how the CTP-derived HCs are formed. Analyzing the differences between thermoplastic CTPs and thermosetting CTPs in the pyrolysis process may be helpful to further understand the carbonization mechanism of thermosetting CTPs via oxygen cross-linking. The pyrolysis behaviors of CTPs were revealed here by TGA. As shown in Fig. 5, the results suggest that the CTPs without pre-oxidation had a poor residue yield (Fig. 5a). The carbon yields of P1, P2, and P3 were 32.8%, 49.2%, and 50.1% at 800 °C, respectively. P1 with the most volatiles had the lowest starting weight loss temperature. When the temperature was increased to 180 °C, the removal of light components caused a distinct weight loss in P1. The weight loss in P2 and P3 began at a higher temperature of about 220 °C. The pre-oxidized CTPs presented a remarkable increase in carbon yields (Fig. 5b). Among them, POP3 had the highest carbon yield of 81.3% at 800 °C, while the carbon yields of POP1 and POP2 were 58.3% and 63.6%, respectively. These results demonstrate that pre-oxidation facilitated the condensation and the formation of lager molecules, preventing some small molecules from escaping during pyrolysis. Notably, the TG curve of POP3 showed a completely different trend from that of the other two pre-oxidized samples. Specifically, it showed a slope between 300 °C and 800 °C, representing a relatively uniform weight loss in this temperature range. In contrast, only a slight mass loss in POP1 and POP2 above 600 °C could be observed. Fig. 5c shows the corresponding DTG curves. The DTG curve of POP3 exhibited a smooth sloping line, while the DTG curves of POP1 and POP2 showed sharp peaks, which revealed the greater thermal weight-loss behavior of POP3 that occurred at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Moreover, the DSC curves displayed in Fig. 5d showed the apparently increasing heat flows of POP1 and POP2 below 200 °C, indicating that transition from the glass state to liquid phase occurred in POP1 and POP2, whereas POP3 showed a thermosetting behavior. These results demonstrate that POP3 had a significantly different pyrolysis behavior than POP1 and POP2.\nTG-MS analyses were used to further explore the differences in pyrolysis behaviors. Fig. 5e illustrates the evolution of the amount of hydrogen generated during carbonization in P3 and POP3. It can be seen that H2 began to be generated at around 100 °C in P3, inferring that condensation had occurred. When the temperature reached 450 °C, the content of released H2 began to increase rapidly in P3, corresponding to the condensation of PAHs or alkyl groups. Notably, there was almost no formation of hydrogen in POP3 below 500 °C. In general, the condensation of PAHs or alkyls required the collisions of active sites, but the steric hindrance caused by the cross-linking structure and the poor fluidity restricted the occurrence of collisions.\nCH4 mainly comes from the removal of alkyl groups. As shown in Fig. 5f, CH4 started to be formed significantly at 360 °C in P3, and its content which reached a maximum at 520 °C. Compared to P3, only a small amount of CH4 was formed in POP3, because the large amount of alkyl groups as reactive sites attacked by oxygen were consumed during pre-oxidation. The result was consistent with the FTIR spectrum, further proving that aliphatic chains were easily attacked by oxygen to form cross-linking groups, which contributed to the stabilization.\nThe formation of CO2 might be caused by the decomposition of O–CO. As shown in Fig. 5g, the decomposition of oxygen-containing groups in POP3 was a progressive process. The greatest decomposition of oxygen-containing groups began at 300 °C and continued up to about 650 °C in POP3, whereas little CO2 was generated during the pyrolysis in P3. With the rising temperature, more and more oxygen-containing structures decomposed in POP3, but the dehydrogenation condensation did not occur until the temperature was up to 500 °C. It is speculated that the start of dehydrogenation condensation of PAHs was related to the decomposition of the oxygen cross-linking structures, because the collapse of the cross-linking structures could allow the mobility of the PAHs and led to the formation of plastic layers, where similar behaviors have been observed in some oxygen-rich coals. According to the optical image of semi-coke derived from POP3 at 500 °C (Fig. S11†), the caking occurred in the coking process of POP3, indicating that increased molecular fluidity led to the plastic layer formation. However the cleavage of the oxygen-containing groups and the formation of plastic layers did not lead to a significant rearrangement of the PAHs (i.e., the development of the mesophase) in POP3. In fact, the development of the mesophase was highly dependent on the fluidity, which could also explain the lesser rearrangement in the semi-coke of POP3 since CTP and its semi-coke still had high similarity in their chemical structures. The DSC curves (Fig. 5d) of POP3 demonstrated that there was no significantly increased specific heat and apparent transition from the glass state to the liquid phase in the coking process. Also, as the above discussion mentions, the aliphatic side chains and light components that could provide fluidity had been consumed by condensation during the pre-oxidation in POP3. Moreover, in view of that, the decomposition of the oxygen-containing groups was a progressive process instead of a quick one (Fig. 5g). Therefore, the condensation of PAHs more possibly occurred in localized plastic layers with a semi-solid state due to the existence of partial oxygen cross-linking structures and large aromatic clusters. In this low-fluidity system, the development of the mesophase was difficult. One could notice that the dehydrogenation condensation reactions in POP3 were more intense than those in P3 at 650 °C and above. It is generally believed that the removal of oxygen cross-linking structures can lead to the transformation from oxygen-centered radicals to carbon-centered radicals (i.e., π radicals), which can accelerate the dehydrogenation condensation of PAHs at high temperature. Therefore, the rapidly generated larger aromatic components in POP3 further limited the mobility and rearrangement of the PAHs in semi-coke, then promoting its resolidification. Based on the above analyses, although dehydrogenation condensation occurred in both the pyrolysis processes of P3 and POP3, there were distinct differences. Specifically, the heating-induced improvement of the fluidity in P3 led to the liquid-phase rearrangement and dehydrogenation condensation of PAHs during the formation of the mesophase; whereas the dehydrogenation condensation reactions in POP3 were absent below about 500 °C due to steric effects caused by the oxygen cross-linking structures; then with the increasing temperature, the dehydrogenation condensation of PAHs occurred after partial decomposition of the oxygen groups during the semi-coking process.\nThe FTIR spectra of the semi-cokes derived from POP3 are shown in Fig. 5h. The absorbance intensity of the aromatic hydrogens between 900 and 700 cm−1 apparently declined from 500 °C to 600 °C, suggesting PAHs with a larger molecular weight were generated. Moreover, remarkably decreased absorbance intensities of CO at around 1700 cm−1 and C–O at 1300–1100 cm−1 were also observed at 600 °C. These results demonstrate that most oxygen cross-linking structures decomposed during the coking process, and the condensation of PAHs might be bound up with the decomposition of the oxygen cross-linking structures, which was consistent with the analysis results from the TG-MS. Based on the above discussions, a schematic diagram of the possible carbonization mechanism of thermoplastic and thermosetting CTPs is depicted in Fig. 5i. In this mechanism, for thermoplastic CTPs, they melt during the heating process and generate a mesophase in the liquid phase, accompanied by the dehydrogenation condensation of the PAHs. With the rising temperature, the fluidity decreases and the pitch transforms to semi-coke. The continual transformation from a disordered phase to relatively ordered phase in the semi-coking process facilitates the development of larger graphitic crystal grains. For the thermosetting CTPs, the carbon texture can be constructed by sufficient oxidative stabilization. The increased cross-linking C–O/CO groups prevent the mesophase formation and the dehydrogenation condensation of PAHs at the initial stage of the coking process. Although the oxygen cross-linking groups decomposes during the subsequent coking, the PAHs with a large molecular weight and the lack of fluidity components prevent the ordered rearrangement of the PAHs layers. In the subsequent carbonization, the rearrangement of carbon layers is greatly restricted, resulting in a texture with a rich pseudo-graphite phase and large interlayer spacing.\n\n3.6 Electrochemical behaviors of the CTP-derived carbons\nThe electrochemical behaviors of the CTP-derived carbons were evaluated by assembling 2025-type coin cells with Na metal foil as the counter electrodes. The galvanostatic discharge/charge (GCD) curves of the carbonized samples at a current density of 0.1C (1C = 300 mA g−1) are shown in Fig. 6a–d and S19.† The GCD curves could be divided into two regions: a sloping region above 0.1 V, attributed to the adsorption behaviors onto defective sites and the open surface, and a plateau region below 0.1 V, caused by Na+ intercalation into the graphene layers and pore filling. The POP1-1200 electrode exhibited a reversible capacity of 131.4 mA h g−1 with a low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 54.0%. Similarly, the POP2-1200 electrode also revealed a poor sodium-storage capacity of 154.3 mA h g−1 with an ICE of 52.8%. The derived carbons from the thermoplastic POP1 and POP2 exhibited poor plateau capacities due to their narrow average interlayer spacings of 3.42 nm and 3.43 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the high proportions of graphite-like structures that existed in POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 go against the Na+ intercalation and pore filling as well. In contrast, the POP3-1200 electrode exhibited a high reversible capacity of 276.8 mA h g−1 with an extended plateau capacity and a highest ICE of 67.5% (Fig. 6c). Compared to the P3-1200 electrode (Fig. 6d), there was a significant improvement in reversible capacity for the POP3-1200 electrode. It also benefited from the large interlayer spacing of 3.77 nm that facilitated Na+ intercalation/deintercalation and diffusion into closed pores. The weakened stacking behaviors of the carbon layers revealed by the SEM and TEM observations also demonstrated that POP3-1200 might provide more suitable sites for Na+ intercalation and pore filling, resulting in the prominent increase in capacity contribution from the plateau region. The cycle performance of the POP3-1200 electrode is presented in Fig. 6e, showing it still delivered a stable discharge capacity of 213.7 mA h g−1 at 0.25C after 500 cycles with a high capacity retention of 91.2%. In addition, the RPOP3-1200 electrode exhibited a poor reversible capacity of 148.4 mA h g−1 (Fig. S19†), suggesting the heating rate was crucial during the pre-oxidation process. According to the aforementioned analysis, the rapid heating rate (10 °C min−1) led to the premature transition from the glass state to the liquid phase due to the insufficient cross-linking reactions. This transition also caused a lack of oxygen diffusion channels, thus resulting in the low oxidative degree in RPOP3 and poor capacity in RPOP3-1200; while for POP3, the slower heating rate provided a wider oxidation window, where the transition into liquid phase was greatly suppressed, and the progressively increased oxygen cross-linking structures well retained the oxygen diffusion channels. Hence, a rational adjustment of the heating rate to prevent premature transition from the glass state to the liquid was conducive to a high oxidative degree and high reversible capacity.\nFig. 6f and S20† give the rate performance of all the CTP-derived carbon electrodes under stepwise increasing current densities from 0.1C to 2C. POP3-1200 delivered the highest capacity at all current densities. When the current density was reset back to 0.1C, a high reversible capacity of 261.4 mA h g−1 was restored, reflecting the favorable structural stability and electrochemical reversibility of the POP3-1200 electrode. The slope and plateau capacity contributions at the second discharge/charge cycle for all of the CTP-derived carbon electrodes are displayed in Fig. 6g and S21.† It could be seen that all the thermoplastic pitch-derived carbon electrodes presented obvious sloping-dominated capacity behaviors. Typically, the capacity contributions from the sloping regions for the POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 electrodes were 74.7% and 73.2%, respectively. Very different to these, the POP3-1200 electrode manifested a high proportion plateau capacity contribution of 50.8%. It could be noted that the sloping specific capacity of the POP3-1200 electrode was also the highest in all the samples, possibly resulting from its lowest graphitization degree (AD/AG value of 4.35) and the increased defects content that was inherited from POP3 with the most oxygen cross-linking structures. However, the reversible capacity of the POP3-1200 electrode at large current densities was also poor due to the sluggish diffusion kinetics in the plateau region. Especially, when increasing the current density to 2C, a capacity of only 87.0 mA h g−1 could be retained. Table S6† shows the electrochemical performance comparison between POP3-1200 and some pitch-derived carbons reported in the literature, where it could be seen that most of the materials with high plateau contributions also delivered poor reversible capacities at large current densities.\nFig. 6h further depicts the variation trend of the capacities for the plateau regions and sloping regions in the different CTP-derived carbon electrodes. It could be discovered that, very different from the relatively modest descending trend of the sloping capacity, the plateau capacity decreased dramatically as the current density increased. Therefore, the low capacity retention of the POP3-1200 electrode should be directly related to the high proportion of the plateau capacity. The comparison results among the different electrodes also implied the high sensitivity on the current density and inferior reaction dynamics of the electrochemical redox process in the plateau region.\nTo further understand the sodium-storage behavior in the plateau region, GITT measurements were carried out to calculate the diffusion coefficient (DNa+) at a pulse current of 0.1C (Fig. 7a). The DNa+ can be calculated by Fick's second law as below:\nwhere mB, VM, and MB are the mass, molar volume, and molar mass of the active material, respectively; τ is the duration of the pulse time; S is the area of the electrodes; ΔEs is the potential difference of two adjacent steady-states; and ΔEτ is the potential change due to the pulse current. The calculated values of DNa+ for the P3-1200 and POP3-1200 electrodes in the sodiation process are shown in Fig. 7b. When the voltage was above 0.1 V, the DNa+ values of the P3-1200 and POP3-1200 electrodes were very close, suggesting there were no obvious differences in their Na+ diffusion behaviors in the sloping region of the two electrodes, which represent a typical CTP-derived soft carbon and hard carbon, respectively. Remarkably, the rapid drop of DNa+ for the POP3-1200 electrode was observed below 0.1 V, confirming that the plateau capacity based on closed pore-filling and quasi-metallic cluster formation was involved in the sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics. Thus, the distinct decrease in the plateau capacity of the POP3-1200 electrode at large current densities could be elucidated. In contrast, the DNa+ of the P3-1200 electrode only presented a slight decrease below 0.1 V, suggesting the Na+ storage mechanism at this stage was still dependent on the surface adsorption, since the high proportion of the graphite-like phase with a small interlayer space limited the occurrence of intercalation reactions. The DNa+ in the subsequent charge process of the POP3-1200 electrode presented a similar variation trend (Fig. S22†), and the decreased values above 0.4 V in both the P3-1200 and POP3-1200 electrodes could be related to the decrease in sodium concentration during desodiation.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) was also used to further analyze the electrochemical redox reactions of the electrodes (Fig. 7c–f and S23†). All of the POP-1200 electrodes presented similar cathodic/anodic profiles, indicating their analogous redox processes. In the first scan, two irreversible reduction bands were observed at 0.7–1.5 V and 0.2–0.6 V, which could be attributed to the irreversible electrochemical process and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation. The broad cathodic peak at 0.2–2.0 V and the sharp peak below 0.1 V were attributed to the slope capacity and plateau capacity, respectively. It could also be observed that the peak intensity for the POP3-1200 electrode below 0.1 V was the highest among all the CTP-derived carbon electrodes, signifying its best electrochemical reaction activity at low potential. Kinetic analyses based on the peak current (ip) and different scan rates (v) (Fig. 7g and S24†) were performed using the power law equation:\nwhere a and b are constants. The b value was obtained from the slope of the plot between log(ν) versus log(ip). A b value of 0.5 indicates the reactions are a semi-infinite diffusion-controlled process, while a b value close to 1 corresponds to surface-controlled reactions. As shown in Fig. 7h, the b value for peak 1 of the POP3-1200 electrode was 0.62, demonstrating that the reactions for this electrode at low potential were a diffusion-dominated process with a slow diffusion kinetics. Fig. S25† shows the b values of the other CTP samples, all of which were higher than that for the POP3-1200 electrode, indicating more pseudo-capacitance reaction features in the thermoplastic CTP-derived carbon electrodes. It was notable that the b values of POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 were 0.67 and 0.65, which were close to the b value for POP3-1200, implying that similar sodium-storage behaviors with sluggish kinetics, such as intercalation and pore filling, might also exist in the POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 electrodes when the potential was close to 0 V. This result agrees with the GCD observation where the typical characteristic of soft carbon for POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 and the feature of hard carbon for POP3-1200 could be clearly distinguished, since the selected potential window for the b-value calculation was much narrower than the soft/hard carbon evaluation in the GCD method, which generally provides only a rough qualitative analysis. In addition, the higher diffusive contribution of the POP1-1200 and POP2-1200 electrode than the samples without pre-oxidation indicated the pre-oxidation increased the plateau capacity with sluggish kinetics, although complete melting occurred due to insufficient oxidative stabilization.\nFig. 7i and S26† show the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the CTP-derived carbon electrodes after 3 cycles under an open-circuit voltage condition. The semicircle in the high-frequency region and the sloping line in the low-frequency region are related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg impedance (W), respectively. Notably, the Rct value of the POP3-1200 electrode was the highest in all the samples (Table S7†), which could be ascribed to its inferior graphitization degree and small microcrystalline size. On the other hand, the derived carbons from thermoplastic CTPs displayed a well-developed and relatively ordered carbon microcrystalline texture with better conductivity, resulting in the faster charge-transfer kinetics.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Material preparations\nThree types of isotropic CTPs with different softening points of 116.1 °C, 179.5 °C, and 213.0 °C were employed as the raw materials and were named as P1, P2, and P3, respectively. First, 5 g pitch powder (300 mesh) of P1, P2 and P3 was separately placed in a porcelain boat with a size of 4 cm × 10 cm, and pre-oxidized at 300 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace at a rise rate of 0.5 °C min−1. An air flow of 20 mL min−1 was persistently supplied to avoid the influence of oxygen concentration fluctuation. The pre-oxidized pitches were denoted as POP1, POP2, and POP3, respectively. For preparing CTP-derived amorphous carbons, the three POPs were first pre-carbonized at 600 °C for 1 h in a tube furnace with a rise rate of 5 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere to obtain semi-cokes. The semi-cokes were further carbonized at 1200 °C for 2 h. The resulting amorphous carbons from the POPx precursors were denoted as POPx-1200. For comparison, the CTPs without pre-oxidation treatment were also subjected to the same carbonization treatment as the control samples, and were denoted as Px-1200, correspondingly.\n\n2.2 Microstructure characterizations\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted on a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 advance instrument with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-α+) was employed to investigate the surface chemical bonding of C and O. Raman spectra were collected on a HORIBA Scientific LabRAM HR evolution instrument with a 532 nm laser. The texture and morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7900F, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA-DSC) measurements were performed on a NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal gravimetric analyzer with a heat rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q20, TA) with a heat rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere, with the inflections of the transition region taken as the Tg. Gas-evolution analysis was performed on a SETSYS EVOLUTION TGA-DTA/DSC thermal analyzer coupled with a mass spectrometer (SETARAM Instrumentation, Lyon, France) under a N2 atmosphere.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nAll the electrochemical tests were conducted in CR2025 coin-type cells. The active material (80 wt%), conductive additives (super P, 10 wt%), and binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, 10 wt%) were mixed into a solvent of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a slurry, followed by coating it on copper foil and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h. Then the electrode was punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm and the mass loading of active material was controlled at approximately 1.4 mg cm−2. The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O and O2 < 0.1 ppm). Sodium metal foil and glass fiber membrane (Whatman GF/A) were used as the counter electrode and the separator, respectively. The electrolyte was a mixed solution of 1 M NaClO4 in dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylene carbonate (EC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 in volume) with 2% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive. Galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) tests were conducted on a land CT 2001A system within a voltage range from 0.01 V to 3 V (vs. Na+/Na), and the test temperature was controlled at about 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on a CHI660 electrochemical workstation. For the EIS measurements, the frequency range was from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz under an open-circuit voltage condition.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Material preparations\nThree types of isotropic CTPs with different softening points of 116.1 °C, 179.5 °C, and 213.0 °C were employed as the raw materials and were named as P1, P2, and P3, respectively. First, 5 g pitch powder (300 mesh) of P1, P2 and P3 was separately placed in a porcelain boat with a size of 4 cm × 10 cm, and pre-oxidized at 300 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace at a rise rate of 0.5 °C min−1. An air flow of 20 mL min−1 was persistently supplied to avoid the influence of oxygen concentration fluctuation. The pre-oxidized pitches were denoted as POP1, POP2, and POP3, respectively. For preparing CTP-derived amorphous carbons, the three POPs were first pre-carbonized at 600 °C for 1 h in a tube furnace with a rise rate of 5 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere to obtain semi-cokes. The semi-cokes were further carbonized at 1200 °C for 2 h. The resulting amorphous carbons from the POPx precursors were denoted as POPx-1200. For comparison, the CTPs without pre-oxidation treatment were also subjected to the same carbonization treatment as the control samples, and were denoted as Px-1200, correspondingly.\n\n2.2 Microstructure characterizations\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted on a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 advance instrument with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-α+) was employed to investigate the surface chemical bonding of C and O. Raman spectra were collected on a HORIBA Scientific LabRAM HR evolution instrument with a 532 nm laser. The texture and morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7900F, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA-DSC) measurements were performed on a NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal gravimetric analyzer with a heat rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q20, TA) with a heat rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere, with the inflections of the transition region taken as the Tg. Gas-evolution analysis was performed on a SETSYS EVOLUTION TGA-DTA/DSC thermal analyzer coupled with a mass spectrometer (SETARAM Instrumentation, Lyon, France) under a N2 atmosphere.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nAll the electrochemical tests were conducted in CR2025 coin-type cells. The active material (80 wt%), conductive additives (super P, 10 wt%), and binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, 10 wt%) were mixed into a solvent of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a slurry, followed by coating it on copper foil and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h. Then the electrode was punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm and the mass loading of active material was controlled at approximately 1.4 mg cm−2. The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O and O2 < 0.1 ppm). Sodium metal foil and glass fiber membrane (Whatman GF/A) were used as the counter electrode and the separator, respectively. The electrolyte was a mixed solution of 1 M NaClO4 in dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylene carbonate (EC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 in volume) with 2% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive. Galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) tests were conducted on a land CT 2001A system within a voltage range from 0.01 V to 3 V (vs. Na+/Na), and the test temperature was controlled at about 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on a CHI660 electrochemical workstation. For the EIS measurements, the frequency range was from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz under an open-circuit voltage condition.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Material preparations\nThree types of isotropic CTPs with different softening points of 116.1 °C, 179.5 °C, and 213.0 °C were employed as the raw materials and were named as P1, P2, and P3, respectively. First, 5 g pitch powder (300 mesh) of P1, P2 and P3 was separately placed in a porcelain boat with a size of 4 cm × 10 cm, and pre-oxidized at 300 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace at a rise rate of 0.5 °C min−1. An air flow of 20 mL min−1 was persistently supplied to avoid the influence of oxygen concentration fluctuation. The pre-oxidized pitches were denoted as POP1, POP2, and POP3, respectively. For preparing CTP-derived amorphous carbons, the three POPs were first pre-carbonized at 600 °C for 1 h in a tube furnace with a rise rate of 5 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere to obtain semi-cokes. The semi-cokes were further carbonized at 1200 °C for 2 h. The resulting amorphous carbons from the POPx precursors were denoted as POPx-1200. For comparison, the CTPs without pre-oxidation treatment were also subjected to the same carbonization treatment as the control samples, and were denoted as Px-1200, correspondingly.\n\n2.2 Microstructure characterizations\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted on a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 advance instrument with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-α+) was employed to investigate the surface chemical bonding of C and O. Raman spectra were collected on a HORIBA Scientific LabRAM HR evolution instrument with a 532 nm laser. The texture and morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7900F, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA-DSC) measurements were performed on a NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal gravimetric analyzer with a heat rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q20, TA) with a heat rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere, with the inflections of the transition region taken as the Tg. Gas-evolution analysis was performed on a SETSYS EVOLUTION TGA-DTA/DSC thermal analyzer coupled with a mass spectrometer (SETARAM Instrumentation, Lyon, France) under a N2 atmosphere.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nAll the electrochemical tests were conducted in CR2025 coin-type cells. The active material (80 wt%), conductive additives (super P, 10 wt%), and binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, 10 wt%) were mixed into a solvent of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a slurry, followed by coating it on copper foil and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h. Then the electrode was punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm and the mass loading of active material was controlled at approximately 1.4 mg cm−2. The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O and O2 < 0.1 ppm). Sodium metal foil and glass fiber membrane (Whatman GF/A) were used as the counter electrode and the separator, respectively. The electrolyte was a mixed solution of 1 M NaClO4 in dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylene carbonate (EC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 in volume) with 2% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive. Galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) tests were conducted on a land CT 2001A system within a voltage range from 0.01 V to 3 V (vs. Na+/Na), and the test temperature was controlled at about 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on a CHI660 electrochemical workstation. For the EIS measurements, the frequency range was from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz under an open-circuit voltage condition.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Previous studies have reported the use of PVP, as a connecting medium between the cathode active materials for LIBs and SIBs and the coating layer, to obtain uniform coatings. In this study, first, PVP could easily anchor to (NFM)C2O4 owing to its ability to donate a pair of electrons from the carbonyl oxygen to the metal cations on the surface or form complex bonds between nitrogen in five-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles and metal cations. Subsequently, after the addition of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, the Mo6+ ions complexed with PVP. Finally, the (NFM)C2O4 coated with Mo6+ ion-complexed PVP underwent synchronous sodiation. Through the calcination process at 860 °C in air with the Na source, the Mo6+ ion-complexed PVP on the surface underwent conversion to NMO, whereas the (NFM)C2O4 precursor at the center was transformed into NFM during the calcination process with Na2CO3 at 860 °C in air for 12 h. In addition, PVP on the (NFM)C2O4 precursor surface was completely removed during heat treatment in air. Typically, achieving a uniformly coated layer on the surface of a cathode material using conventional methods is often challenging because the coating precursor tends to exhibit an uneven distribution during the calcination process. Using the PVP-anchored complex coating process, the well-coated PVP on the (NFM)C2O4 precursor surface served as an effective connecting medium, facilitating the formation of a uniform NMO nanocoating layer. Furthermore, sodiation and oxidation of the active material precursor and coating material precursors were carried out simultaneously in a single step, making this method both simple and effective for coating.\nThe crystal structures of NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM were characterized by XRD, and the results are displayed in Fig. 2a. The results indicate that the patterns of all the samples can be indexed to the O3-type α-NaFeO2 structure (Rm space group). All diffraction peaks were sharp and had high intensities, indicating that all samples were well crystallized. No peak shift was found in any of the NMO-coated samples, indicating that the coating process, the PVP-anchored complex coating process, did not affect the bulk crystal structure of the NFM. Meanwhile, no characteristic peaks were observed, proving the existence of the NMO coating layer, in the XRD patterns of 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM. This can be attributed to the small amount of NMO. Since the crystallinity of the NFM cathode material is very strong, the peaks of coating materials with low contents are likely to be buried in noise on the XRD pattern. To verify that the NMO was well coated using the PVP-anchored complex coating process, the amount of NMO was increased to 30 wt%. In the XRD pattern of 30 wt% NMO–NFM, evident diffraction peaks that matched well with those of PDF #00-012-0773 were observed. Therefore, the PVP-anchored complex coating process successfully coated NMO onto NFM particles.\nTo investigate the influence of the NMO coating on the chemical valence state of the NFM cathode material, an XPS analysis was conducted. Fig. 2b–d present the XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Fe 2p, and Mn 2p for pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM. In all the three samples, the Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2b) displayed a spin–orbit doublet, which was identified by the binding energies of 854.3 and 871.6 eV for the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 core levels, respectively. In addition, the spectra displayed significant shake-up satellites at 860.4 and 878.7 eV. Because unresolved multiplet splitting causes slight asymmetry in the high-binding-energy side of the principal photoemission lines, the fit included two supplementary components (MS comp.) at 856.8 and 874.7 eV. The Fe 2p spectra (Fig. 2c) for all samples were fitted with two main peaks and two small shake-up satellites: two main Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks located at 710.5 and 723.9 eV and two shake-up satellites located at 731.1 and 717.7 eV, respectively. The Mn 2p spectra (Fig. 2d) showed a broad spin–orbit doublet: Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 peaks located at 641.96 and 653.2 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b–d, no significant differences were observed between the spectra of any of the samples. Consequently, the chemical valence state of the host-layered oxide remained unaffected by NMO modification. Furthermore, as shown in the Mo 3d spectra of 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM, the XPS analysis confirmed the presence of an NMO coating layer with Mo in the stabilized state of Mo6+ (Fig. 2e), which was evident from the characteristic binding energies of Mo6+ 3d5/2 (232.2 eV) and Mo6+ 3d3/2 (235.5 eV). However, the XPS spectrum of pristine NFM did not present any peaks at the binding energy positions corresponding to Mo 3d. This indicated that Mo was successfully distributed on the surfaces of 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM. The host-layered oxide remained unaffected by the NMO modification.\nThe morphological and structural features of pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM were characterized using FE-SEM (Fig. 3a–c). The SEM images presented in Fig. 3a–c indicate that the flake-shaped primary particles, with a size of approximately 1 μm, aggregated to form secondary particles with an average size of 15 μm in all the three samples. This type of morphology is a characteristic feature of several typical layered transition metal oxides. Therefore, the NFM cathode material was successfully synthesized through the oxalate coprecipitation method, and the NMO coating had no obvious effect on the particle size or shape.\nFig. 3d and e show the HR-TEM images of 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM, respectively. The images reveal that the 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM samples had uniform coating layers on the NFM particle surfaces, with thicknesses of approximately 8 and 14 nm, respectively. Notably, the coating-layer thickness increased proportionally with the amount of coating material used. Clear lattice fringes were observed in the coating layer with an interplanar spacing of 0.275 nm, corresponding to the (311) plane of NMO. Also, as shown in Fig. S1,† an interplanar distance of 0.322 nm was observed in the coating layer region of the 2 wt% NMO–NFM sample, which corresponds to the crystal plane (220). The lattice fringes observed in HR-TEM images also correspond well to XRD characterization of NMO, clearly affirming the presence of the NMO coating layer on the NFM particles. These results demonstrate the successful surface coating of the NFM cathode materials using the PVP-anchored complex coating process.\nFig. S2† displays elemental mapping images obtained through EDS for 1 wt% NMO–NFM, illustrating the distribution of the main chemical elements within the NMO-coated NFM particles. As shown in Fig. S2,† the uniform distribution of Mo element of NMO was confirmed. Furthermore, the distributions of Mo exhibited overlap with the distributions of Ni, Fe, and Mn, the main elements of the cathode material. This observation serves as evidence that the NMO coating layer was uniformly distributed on the surface of the NFM cathode material.\nTable S1† presents the results of the ICP analysis of elements in the final products, from which it can be seen that the molar ratio of Ni:Fe:Mn of all samples is close to 1:1:1. The calculation of the NMO content was based on the assumption that all the molybdenum ions transform into NMO coating layer during the calcination process. For the nominal compositions of 1 and 2 wt% NMO–NFM materials, it was determined that the NMO content amounted to 0.95 and 1.98 wt%, respectively. The presence of the Mo element in the coated samples was successfully confirmed through ICP-MS analysis, supporting the effective formation of the coating layer via the PVP-anchored complex coating process.\nThe electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized samples was tested using coin-type half cells in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V vs. Na/Na+. Fig. 4a shows the initial charge/discharge profiles of the pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM at a current density of 0.1C (1C = 130 mA g−1). The initial charge/discharge capacities were 136.68/129.48, 139.22/127.96, and 137.58/126.87 mA h g−1 for pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM, respectively. The 1st cycle discharge capacities decreased with increasing amounts of coating material, which can be attributed to the reduction in the content of the cathode material caused by the addition of the coating material. The specific capacity was determined by the electrochemical reaction of the cathode material; because NMO was not involved in this reaction, its presence in the coating layer did not contribute to the specific capacity.\nFig. 4b displays the CV curves of the pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM electrodes in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at 0.1 mV s−1. Generally, during the charge/discharge process, several pairs of redox potentials related to cathodic and anodic reactions are observed in the CV curves. The large peaks observed at approximately 3.0/2.8 V vs. Na/Na+ correspond to the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple, and the broad peaks observed around 3.6/3.5 V vs. Na/Na+ are associated with the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox reaction, as reported in previous studies. The reversibility of the crystalline structural changes during repeated charge/discharge processes is strongly related to the structural stability and electrochemical performance of the NFM cathode material, which can be estimated from the intensity and position of the cathodic and anodic peaks in the CV curves. As shown in Fig. 4b, the anodic peak near 3.0 V of 1 wt% NMO–NFM showed strong intensity at relatively low potential compared to those of 2 wt% NMO–NFM and pristine NFM. This right shift is caused by an increase in overall overpotential in the charge process, which may affect the reversibility or structural stability of the cathode material. Therefore, among the tested samples, the 1 wt% NMO–NFM showed a peak at a low voltage, and a small overpotential occurred, as evidenced by the CV curves obtained during charge/discharge processes, and it will be discussed in more detail in Fig. 5b. Also, higher peak current corresponds to a more rapid and reversible redox reaction. The reduction peak intensity at about 2.8 V in the CV curve is relatively lower in the 2 wt% NMO–NFM sample, as compared to that in the 1 wt% NMO–NFM sample. This phenomenon indicates that the rate of intercalation/deintercalation reaction on the surface of the cathode material was slowed due to the excessive coating amount of 2 wt% NMO–NFM in spite of the electronically conductive NMO. In addition, the highly reversible CV curve implies its promising cycling stability.\nThe cycling performance of the three samples was evaluated by testing them in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at a current density of 1C to assess the effects of the coating content. The cell was initially cycled at a current rate of 0.1C for three cycles to undergo formation and subsequently cycled at a current rate of 1C. As shown in Fig. 5a, the discharge capacity retention after 100 cycles for pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM were 51.96%, 62.95%, and 57.45%, respectively. Both NMO-coated samples exhibited increased capacity retention over cycling, and 1 wt% NMO–NFM demonstrated the best cycling performance, which was significantly better than that of the pristine NFM. Also, Fig. 5a demonstrated the coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of pristine NFM for the 1 wt% NMO–NFM and 2 wt% NMO–NFM during long-term cycling. All the electrodes showed a CE of around 91% at first cycle, indicating the similar values as reported in previous literature. Especially, the mean CE of 1 wt% NMO–NFM at 1C was greater than 99.2% during long-term cycling although the pristine electrode exhibited the mean CE around 98.7%. These results suggested that a coating content of 1 wt% NMO was optimal for improving the electrochemical performance of NFM cathode materials. An appropriate NMO coating significantly enhanced the cycling stability, as demonstrated by the improved capacity retention of the NMO-coated samples compared to that of pristine NFM. The improved cycling performance of the 1 wt% NMO–NFM was attributed to the protective NMO coating layer, which prevented direct contact between the NFM particles and electrolyte, thus inhibiting electrolyte decomposition and the growth of an undesirable SEI layer on the active material surface. In addition, the rapid decay of the discharge capacity during cycling was attributed to the surface structural deterioration of the NFM cathode material. However, the NMO coating improved the surface structural stability of the NFM particles, contributing to the enhanced cycling stability of the NMO-coated samples.\nFig. 5b depicts the average charge/discharge voltage variation with cycling for pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM. The increase in the average voltage is caused by an increase in the ionicity of the transition metal–oxygen (TM–O) bond in O3-type NaTMO2 (TM = Ni, Fe, or Mn). During the charge and discharge cycles, the structure of the O3-type NaTMO2 cathode material may gradually collapse or undergo phase transitions due to the insertion and extraction of sodium ions. This can affect the ionicity of the TM–O bond and the overall electrochemical performance of the material. After 100 cycles at 0.1C, the average discharge voltage of pristine NFM decreased significantly from 3.04 V to 2.71 V vs. Na/Na+ (ΔV = 0.33 V). By contrast, the average discharge voltage of 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM decreased slightly from 3.04 V to 2.91 V (ΔV = 0.13 V) and from 3.06 V to 2.79 V (ΔV = 0.27 V), respectively. The results indicated that the NMO-coated samples had improved structural stability and experienced a significantly lower increase in polarization during cycling than the pristine sample. Therefore, the NMO coating layer, which was distributed between the active material and electrolyte, effectively suppressed the rapid voltage decay of the O3-type layered oxide during cycling.\nTo obtain more insight into the changes in the crystal structure of NFM during the electrochemical cycle, XRD analysis of cycled electrodes was conducted after 100 cycles at discharged state (Fig. S3†). In the case of 1 wt% NMO–NFM, the original O3 phase maintained the major phase even after cycling. On the other hand, pristine NFM showed an overall low intensity of the main phase, and the appearance and presence of P3 phase was observed. These results suggest that the capacity fade, associated with the loss of Na ions, is due to the structural instability of O3 type cathode material after long-term cycling. In addition, it implies and validates the remarkable structural reversibility and stability of the NFM cathode material especially near surface region owing to the NMO coating.\nThe rate capacities of pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM under different current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10C in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) are shown in Fig. 6. These results demonstrated that the NMO-coated NFM cathode exhibited superior rate performance, particularly at a high current density. For example, at a current density of 1C, the discharge capacities of pristine NFM and 1 wt% and 2 wt% NMO–NFM were 97.05, 104.46, and 108.64 mA h g−1, respectively. In addition, at a high current density of 10C, the discharge capacity of 1 wt% NMO–NFM remained as high as 81.13 mA h g−1, whereas pristine NFM and 2 wt% NMO–NFM exhibited lower capacities of only 64.43 and 74.59 mA h g−1, respectively. The improved electrochemical performance of the NMO-coated NFM can be attributed to enhanced Na+ ion dynamics, as NMO is expected to have higher Na+ ion conductivity than insulating metal-oxide coating materials. In addition, NMO exhibits good electrical conductivity, which facilitates electron transport within the cathode material. Thus, the NMO coating layer significantly improved the electrochemical performance of the NFM cathode materials. Comparison of the rate performance of 1 wt% NMO–NFM and other SIBs cathode materials are listed in Table S2.†\nIn the process of forming a coating layer on the cathode material, if the coating layer does not completely cover the cathode material particles, the SEI layer becomes excessively thick due to side reactions during the cycle, and it results in degradation of electrochemical performance. However, an excessively thick coating layer to completely cover the cathode material particles may reduce the deintercalation/intercalation efficiency on the surface of the cathode material particles. Thus, optimizing the thickness of the coating layer is a very important step for the best rate performance. We performed a rate capability test for 0.5 wt% NMO–NFM to confirm the optimal coating thickness range. As shown in Fig. S4,† 0.5 wt% NMO–NFM exhibited lower capacity of 67.90 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 10C. Because of its low coating content, the 0.5 wt% NMO coating layer cannot provide satisfactory electronic conductivity. In addition, its ‘less coverage’ cannot suppress the formation of thick SEI layer and result in unsatisfactory electrochemical performances. Therefore, we believe that the coating around 1 wt% would be the optimal coating contents of NMO for the NFM cathode material to achieve excellent rate capability.\nO3-type sodium-layered oxides are well-known moisture-sensitive cathode materials. Therefore, O3-type sodium-layered oxides cause structural changes and degradation in cathode performance when exposed to humid air or water. Water exposure tests were conducted to confirm the effect of the NMO coating layer on moisture stability. In the water exposure test, pristine NFM and 1 wt% NMO–NFM were compared because 1 wt% NMO–NFM exhibited the best performance in previous evaluations. Fig. 7a shows the initial charge/discharge profiles of the pristine NFM and 1 wt% NMO–NFM after water exposure. Compared with the initial discharge capacity (Fig. 4a), the initial discharge capacity of pristine NFM decreased from 129.48 mA h g−1 to 91.52 mA h g−1 after water exposure. By contrast, the initial discharge capacity of 1 wt% NMO–NFM decreased slightly from 127.96 mA h g−1 to 119.37 mA h g−1 after water exposure. In addition, the initial CE of the 1 wt% NMO–NFM sample of 85.6% was higher than that of pristine NFM (80.4%). Additionally, to determine the effect of water exposure on the long-term cycle performance, the cycling performance of pristine NFM and 1 wt% NMO–NFM was evaluated after water exposure. The cycling performances of pristine NFM and 1 wt% NMO–NFM after water exposure are shown in Fig. 7b along with CEs. The discharge capacity of pristine NFM after 100 cycles was 44.79 mA h g−1, which was significantly lower than that of 1 wt% NMO–NFM (60.96 mA h g−1). Consequently, the NMO coating layer improved the moisture stability of the O3-type sodium-layered oxides.\nTo elucidate the cause of the initial discharge capacity loss, poor ICE, and degradation in the cycling performance, XPS analyses were performed on pristine NFM and 1 wt% NMO–NFM after water exposure. Fig. 8a–d show the XPS results of the two samples before and after water exposure. The C 1s spectrum consisted of three peaks corresponding to C–C, C–O–C, and Na2CO3, where the C–C peak at 284.9 eV and the C–O–C peak at 286.7 eV correspond to a contamination of the C species and Super P in the NFM electrodes. Notably, the Na2CO3 peak at 289.1 eV in pristine NFM was stronger than that in 1 wt% NMO–NFM after water exposure, as shown in Fig. 8a and c. Similarly, the presence of a peak at 531.3 eV in the O 1s spectrum could be attributed to the residual Na2CO3 on the NFM particle surfaces (Fig. 8c and d). The intensity of the O 1s peak of Na2CO3 was significantly higher in the pristine NFM sample than in the 1 wt% NMO–NFM sample, which was consistent with the C 1s results. When NFM was exposed to water and sodium was extracted from the bulk to form NaOH on the surface of the material, Na2CO3 formed on the surface of the NFM particles. The reaction between NaOH and carbon dioxide in air resulted in the formation of NaHCO3, which was subsequently converted into Na2CO3. Therefore, sodium consumption and Na2CO3 formation were suppressed because the application of the NMO coating layer, which was insensitive to moisture, reduced the exposure of the NFM cathode material to moisture.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

For the preparation of the (NFM)C2O4 precursor powder, nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O), iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O), and manganese(II) sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4·H2O) were used as starting materials. First, an aqueous solution containing the required stoichiometric amounts of NiSO4·6H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, and MnSO4·H2O with a concentration of 0.5 M was slowly added to a 0.5 M ammonium oxalate ((NH4)C2O4) solution. The ratio of ammonium oxalate to transition metals was equimolar. Simultaneously, an appropriate amount of a 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) solution was added to the above solution to maintain the pH at 7. Throughout the coprecipitation process, the solution was stirred continuously for 3 h, and the temperature was maintained at 50 °C. The resultant powder was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried overnight at 100 °C in a vacuum oven.\nThe NMO coating on the NFM surface was prepared using a PVP-anchored complex coating process. The as-prepared (NFM)C2O4 precursor (4.0 g) was added to a mixture of anhydrous ethanol and distilled water (1:1, vol%, 40 mL) and vigorously stirred until the powder was well dispersed. For coating with 1 wt% or 2 wt% NMO, 0.08 g or 0.16 g PVP (MW = 55000) was dissolved in the above solution under constant magnetic stirring for 1 h. Subsequently, 0.0257 g or 0.0514 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), corresponding to 1 wt% or 2 wt% coatings, was added to the above solution, and the mixture was stirred at 85 °C until the solvent was completely evaporated. The obtained powder was thoroughly mixed with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and calcined at 860 °C in air for 12 h to remove PVP and obtain NMO-coated materials. The total sodium content for each sample was calculated by summing the sodium contents required to form both the NFM parent material and NMO coating layer. To consider the loss of sodium during the high-temperature calcination process, an additional 5 wt% excess of Na2CO3 was introduced, based on the calculated sodium content requirements mentioned above. For the uncoated NFM, the PVP-assisted coating process was skipped, and calcination was performed by mixing the (NFM)C2O4 precursor with Na2CO3. The same calcination conditions were used for the uncoated (NFM)C2O4 precursors. The same calcination conditions were used for the uncoated (NFM)C2O4 precursors. The uncoated NFM and 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 30 wt% NMO-coated samples are denoted as pristine NFM and 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 30 wt% NMO–NFM, respectively.\n\nMaterials characterization\nThe crystalline phases of the pristine NFM and NMO–NFM were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; SmartLab, Rigaku) with a Cu Kα radiation source in the 2θ range of 10–80° at a scanning rate of 5 min−1. The elemental compositions and valences were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific), and all spectra were corrected considering the C 1s peak as the standard peak. The morphologies of the particles were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; SU8010, Hitachi High-Tech). The crystal structures and coating-layer thicknesses of the samples were observed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-ARM 200F, JEOL), and elemental distributions were acquired using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 7700X, Agilent Technologies) was conducted for the powder samples to investigate the elemental compositions of cathode materials. The XPS analysis of the material exposed to water was performed by exposing 1 g of the material to 1 mL of water and immediately drying it at 100 °C for 3 h in a vacuum oven.\n\nCell assembly and electrochemical testing\nThe electrochemical behavior of the pristine NFM and NMO–NFM cathode materials was analyzed using CR-2032-type coin cells. The active materials (pristine NFM or NMO–NFM powder), Super P (carbon black), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) were weighed at a mass ratio of 8:1:1, and an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was added to control the viscosity. Simultaneously, the solution was mixed until the formation of a uniform slurry. The obtained slurry was cast onto an Al foil, followed by drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum and punching into a round disk with a diameter of 12 mm. The prepared cathodes were selected as the working electrodes, and an Na metal disk with a diameter of 15 mm was selected as the counter electrode. A glass fiber filter with a diameter of 18 mm was used as the separator. The electrolyte solution comprised 1.0 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1, vol%) with 3 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). All the coin-cell assembly processes were carried out in an argon-filled glove box. The cell performance, in terms of galvanostatic charging–discharging, cyclic voltammetry (CV), cyclability, and rate capability, was examined using the WBCS 3000 (WonATech) battery cycler in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at room temperature (25 °C). The current densities and specific capacities of the samples were calculated from the masses of the active materials.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

For the preparation of the (NFM)C2O4 precursor powder, nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O), iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O), and manganese(II) sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4·H2O) were used as starting materials. First, an aqueous solution containing the required stoichiometric amounts of NiSO4·6H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, and MnSO4·H2O with a concentration of 0.5 M was slowly added to a 0.5 M ammonium oxalate ((NH4)C2O4) solution. The ratio of ammonium oxalate to transition metals was equimolar. Simultaneously, an appropriate amount of a 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) solution was added to the above solution to maintain the pH at 7. Throughout the coprecipitation process, the solution was stirred continuously for 3 h, and the temperature was maintained at 50 °C. The resultant powder was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried overnight at 100 °C in a vacuum oven.\nThe NMO coating on the NFM surface was prepared using a PVP-anchored complex coating process. The as-prepared (NFM)C2O4 precursor (4.0 g) was added to a mixture of anhydrous ethanol and distilled water (1:1, vol%, 40 mL) and vigorously stirred until the powder was well dispersed. For coating with 1 wt% or 2 wt% NMO, 0.08 g or 0.16 g PVP (MW = 55000) was dissolved in the above solution under constant magnetic stirring for 1 h. Subsequently, 0.0257 g or 0.0514 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), corresponding to 1 wt% or 2 wt% coatings, was added to the above solution, and the mixture was stirred at 85 °C until the solvent was completely evaporated. The obtained powder was thoroughly mixed with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and calcined at 860 °C in air for 12 h to remove PVP and obtain NMO-coated materials. The total sodium content for each sample was calculated by summing the sodium contents required to form both the NFM parent material and NMO coating layer. To consider the loss of sodium during the high-temperature calcination process, an additional 5 wt% excess of Na2CO3 was introduced, based on the calculated sodium content requirements mentioned above. For the uncoated NFM, the PVP-assisted coating process was skipped, and calcination was performed by mixing the (NFM)C2O4 precursor with Na2CO3. The same calcination conditions were used for the uncoated (NFM)C2O4 precursors. The same calcination conditions were used for the uncoated (NFM)C2O4 precursors. The uncoated NFM and 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 30 wt% NMO-coated samples are denoted as pristine NFM and 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 30 wt% NMO–NFM, respectively.\n\nMaterials characterization\nThe crystalline phases of the pristine NFM and NMO–NFM were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; SmartLab, Rigaku) with a Cu Kα radiation source in the 2θ range of 10–80° at a scanning rate of 5 min−1. The elemental compositions and valences were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific), and all spectra were corrected considering the C 1s peak as the standard peak. The morphologies of the particles were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; SU8010, Hitachi High-Tech). The crystal structures and coating-layer thicknesses of the samples were observed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-ARM 200F, JEOL), and elemental distributions were acquired using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 7700X, Agilent Technologies) was conducted for the powder samples to investigate the elemental compositions of cathode materials. The XPS analysis of the material exposed to water was performed by exposing 1 g of the material to 1 mL of water and immediately drying it at 100 °C for 3 h in a vacuum oven.\n\nCell assembly and electrochemical testing\nThe electrochemical behavior of the pristine NFM and NMO–NFM cathode materials was analyzed using CR-2032-type coin cells. The active materials (pristine NFM or NMO–NFM powder), Super P (carbon black), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) were weighed at a mass ratio of 8:1:1, and an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was added to control the viscosity. Simultaneously, the solution was mixed until the formation of a uniform slurry. The obtained slurry was cast onto an Al foil, followed by drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum and punching into a round disk with a diameter of 12 mm. The prepared cathodes were selected as the working electrodes, and an Na metal disk with a diameter of 15 mm was selected as the counter electrode. A glass fiber filter with a diameter of 18 mm was used as the separator. The electrolyte solution comprised 1.0 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1, vol%) with 3 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). All the coin-cell assembly processes were carried out in an argon-filled glove box. The cell performance, in terms of galvanostatic charging–discharging, cyclic voltammetry (CV), cyclability, and rate capability, was examined using the WBCS 3000 (WonATech) battery cycler in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at room temperature (25 °C).

To consider the loss of sodium during the high-temperature calcination process, an additional 5 wt% excess of Na2CO3 was introduced, based on the calculated sodium content requirements mentioned above. For the uncoated NFM, the PVP-assisted coating process was skipped, and calcination was performed by mixing the (NFM)C2O4 precursor with Na2CO3. The same calcination conditions were used for the uncoated (NFM)C2O4 precursors. The same calcination conditions were used for the uncoated (NFM)C2O4 precursors. The uncoated NFM and 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 30 wt% NMO-coated samples are denoted as pristine NFM and 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 30 wt% NMO–NFM, respectively.\n\nMaterials characterization\nThe crystalline phases of the pristine NFM and NMO–NFM were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; SmartLab, Rigaku) with a Cu Kα radiation source in the 2θ range of 10–80° at a scanning rate of 5 min−1. The elemental compositions and valences were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific), and all spectra were corrected considering the C 1s peak as the standard peak. The morphologies of the particles were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; SU8010, Hitachi High-Tech). The crystal structures and coating-layer thicknesses of the samples were observed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-ARM 200F, JEOL), and elemental distributions were acquired using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 7700X, Agilent Technologies) was conducted for the powder samples to investigate the elemental compositions of cathode materials. The XPS analysis of the material exposed to water was performed by exposing 1 g of the material to 1 mL of water and immediately drying it at 100 °C for 3 h in a vacuum oven.\n\nCell assembly and electrochemical testing\nThe electrochemical behavior of the pristine NFM and NMO–NFM cathode materials was analyzed using CR-2032-type coin cells. The active materials (pristine NFM or NMO–NFM powder), Super P (carbon black), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) were weighed at a mass ratio of 8:1:1, and an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was added to control the viscosity. Simultaneously, the solution was mixed until the formation of a uniform slurry. The obtained slurry was cast onto an Al foil, followed by drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum and punching into a round disk with a diameter of 12 mm. The prepared cathodes were selected as the working electrodes, and an Na metal disk with a diameter of 15 mm was selected as the counter electrode. A glass fiber filter with a diameter of 18 mm was used as the separator. The electrolyte solution comprised 1.0 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1, vol%) with 3 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). All the coin-cell assembly processes were carried out in an argon-filled glove box. The cell performance, in terms of galvanostatic charging–discharging, cyclic voltammetry (CV), cyclability, and rate capability, was examined using the WBCS 3000 (WonATech) battery cycler in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at room temperature (25 °C). The current densities and specific capacities of the samples were calculated from the masses of the active materials.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Fig. 1a and b illustrates the thin sheets-like morphology of the pristine NaCrO2 powder. The average size of the primary particle of NaCrO2 particles ranges from approximately 0.3–0.5 μm, as shown in Fig. 1c. The crystal structures of the NaCrO2 electrodes were also characterized by XRD (Fig. 1d). The XRD patterns for the pristine NaCrO2 powder, the composite NaCrO2 electrode coated on Al foil, Al-foil, and the NaCrO2 JCPDS data used as reference (JCPDS #: 00-025-0819) are shown in Fig. 1d. Powdered NaCrO2 was obtained from NEI Corporation (Product ID: NANOMYTE® NAB-10). The XRD spectra show the pure octahedral phase (O3) in the NaCrO2 powder. The stability of the NaCrO2 in the composite electrode was also confirmed by performing XRD, which resulted in the observation of the same O3 phase, accompanied by additional Al-foil peaks. These Al-peaks coordinated with the current collector substrate utilized for slurry coating.\n\nElectrochemical performance and mechanical deformations in NaCrO2\nThe electrochemical performance of NaCrO2 was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 50 μV s−1 between 2.3 and 3.5 V in 1 M NaClO4-PC electrolyte (Fig. 2a). Two current peaks were observed at 3.13 and 3.38 V during an anodic scan, and the corresponding peaks at 2.78 and 3.23 V during a cathodic scan in Fig. 2 and Fig. S4, S5 (ESI†). In literature, these peaks were associated with Cr3+/Cr4+ redox reactions in three solid solution regions of the cathode. These redox reactions lead to phase changes, O3R ↔ O3R + O3M ↔ O3M ↔ O3M + P3M ↔ P3M, in the cathode during sodiation and desodiation processes. O3R, O3M, and P3M represent O3-type rhombohedral, monoclinic with symmetry but distorted a–b planes and prismatic monoclinic phases in NaCrO2, respectively. The location of the current peaks did not change with the cycle number, but the intensity of the peaks decreased slowly with cycling (Fig. S4, ESI†).\nThe associated strain generation in NaCrO2 is shown in Fig. 2b. The positive and negative strain changes imply expansion and contraction in the electrode volume, respectively. In the first desodiation process, the electrode initially experienced −0.05% negative strains, followed by an increase of about 0.51% by the end of the first desodiation. During the first sodiation, there was a generation of −0.11% negative strains followed by a generation of 0.01% positive strains, and the cumulative strains became 0.52% by the end of the first cycle. The irreversible strain generation progressively slowed down in the later cycles and became 1.19% at the end of the fifth cycle. To provide a better picture, current evolution, and strain change during the third cycle are plotted in Fig. 2c and d. There are negligible deformations during the early stages of the third cycle desodiation until the voltage reaches 2.85 V. Then, the electrode began to contract at the onset of the current rise at 2.85 V, and −0.11% negative strains were generated until 3.1 V, where the current reached its peak. At higher voltages, the electrode experienced a positive strain generation of about 0.08% until the end of the third desodiation. The electrode underwent negligible deformation during the early stages of the third sodiation until 3.01 V. Then, the electrode experienced a negative strain generation (about 0.06%) between 3.01 and 2.87 V, followed by expansions of about 0.16% between 2.87 V and 2.69 V. At the lower voltages, there is a negligible deformation in the electrode until the end of the third cycle. Similar mechanical deformations behavior is observed in the subsequent desodiation and sodiation cycles (Fig. S5, ESI†).\nNaCrO2 cathode was sodiated/desodiated via galvanostatic cycling to further investigate the mechanical deformations in the electrode (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6, ESI†). The galvanostatic cycle allows the control reaction rate at the surface of the electrode. We chose to cycle the battery at C/25 because it takes about the same time when cycling via CV at 50 μV s−1. There is a voltage plateau at around 3.0 and 2.9 V during desodiation and sodiation, respectively.\nPrevious ex situ XRD studies observed O3R and O3R + O3M phases during the voltage plateau. Multiple shorter plateaus were recorded at the higher potentials associated with the phase changes, O3R + O3M ↔ O3M ↔ O3M + P3M ↔ P3M in the cathode. Desodiation and sodiation capacities in the first cycle were calculated as 93.8 mA h g−1 and 79.4 mA h g−1. The capacities became more reversible at later cycles. The desodiation and sodiation capacities in the 3rd cycle were 79.5 mA h g−1 and 76.0 mA h g−1, respectively. The theoretical capacity of the NaCrO2 electrode when discharged to Na0.5CrO2 is 125 mA h g−1. Since capacitates were slightly lower in strain measurements, we conducted additional measurements using a coin-cell configuration with a galvanostatic cycle at C/25. The capacity of the electrode was about 120 mA h g−1 in the coin cell experiments (Fig. S7, ESI†). Therefore, the experimental capacity of the NaCrO2 cathodes in our study is close to the theoretical capacity of the electrode. The slightly lower capacity in strain measurements is attributed to using much thicker electrodes in free-standing orientation in strain systems compared to coin-cell configurations.\nThe corresponding strain generation during a galvanostatic cycle is shown in Fig. 3b. During the first desodiation, a negligible strain was generated until capacity reached about 25 mA h g−1. Then, almost 0.3% strain was generated between a capacity of 25 to 70 mA h g−1, corresponding to a 3.0 V to 3.25 V voltage plateau. There is negligible strain generation at higher voltages (>3.25 V). The strain became 0.35% at the end of the first desodiation. During the first sodiation, the electrode initially contracted between 3.6 and 2.93 V, then expanded at a higher state of sodiation (2.92 to 2.3 V). The cumulative strains were about 0.43% at the end of the first cycle. The irreversible strain generation slowed down with further cycling, and it became 0.97% at the end of the fifth cycle. Interestingly, irreversible strain generation in the galvanostatic cycle (Fig. 3b) is very similar to the ones recorded during CV (Fig. 2b). There were similar irreversible strains in both cases after about 65 hours of electrochemical cycling by the end of the fifth cycle.\nBeyond the first cycle, the mechanical deformations were very similar between each sodiation and desodiation. Strain change and voltage profiles for the third cycle were plotted in Fig. 3c and d for better visualization. At the initial period of desodiation, there is a negative strain generation of about −0.12%, which coincides with the first voltage plateau at around ∼3.0 V. In literature, the voltage plateau has been linked with the phase change from O3R → O3M.\nAccording to the previous XRD studies, c-axis lattice parameter increases due to increasing interslab distance between CrO2 layers while a- and b-lattice parameters decrease due to shrinkage between the Cr–Cr distance. They attributed the continuous increase in c-axis to the increased repulsion between CrO2 slabs and the continuous decrease in a- and b-lattice axis to the increasing oxidation state of the Cr as more Na is extracted. The XANES spectra demonstrated an unexpected behavior in Na–Cr bond length, which contracts in a- and b-axis while expanding in c-axis during desodation. Strain measurement in our study is sensitive to volumetric changes in the composite electrode due to lattice volume change upon Na-ion intercalation; therefore, it does not provide directional changes in the lattice slabs. Since the electrode underwent contractions in our measurements, we propose that a decrease in Cr–Cr distance dominates the deformations leading to negative strains in the electrode during the initial desodiation period. At higher voltages (>3.0 V), the electrode experienced a positive strain generation (0.04%) until the end of desodiation. During this period, multiple shorter plateaus at the higher voltages and XRD analysis in the literature indicated the phase changes, O3M ↔ O3M + P3M ↔ P3M in the cathode. Interestingly, the slope of the positive strain changes during this period, indicating the fundamental difference in the crystal structure based on the phase changes. In this period, XRD studies in the literature reported increases in interslab distance between CrO2 layers while the Cr–Cr distance decreased. Since the composite electrode expanded during this period, the deformations in the lattice volume were dominated by increased interslab distance between CrO2 layers. During the initial period of the third sodiation, there was a negligible amount of strain generation in the electrode until voltages reached their first plateau. Then, the electrode experienced about −0.02% during the voltage plateau at 2.95 V. In the literature, the plateau has been associated with the phase changes from P3M → O3M. At higher sodiation capacity, the direction of the strains changed from negative to positive, and the electrode underwent 0.13% deformation during the second voltage plateau at 2.9 V. This is associated with phase changes from O3M → O3R in the literature.\nOverall, both galvanostatic and CV tests indicate that the electrode experiences contraction, followed by expansions during each desodiation and sodiation process. Strain generation in the electrode showed a strong correlation with the electrochemical behavior. It indicates the role of phase transition on the mechanical deformations in the electrode. In both tests, the electrode showed reversible and irreversible deformation. To better understand the mechanisms behind the reversibility, we conducted further analysis by calculating strain derivatives with potential and irreversible strain with time.\n\nStrain derivatives\nThe capacity derivative, dQ/dV vs. V plots, provides information about the electrochemical behaviours of battery materials, such as the mechanisms of redox reactions and associated phase transitions in the electrode. The dQ/dV vs. V plot typically shows distinct peaks and valleys corresponding to the redox reactions during the intercalation process. The capacity derivatives were calculated using the galvanostatic (de)-sodiation curves (specific capacity vs. voltage) in Fig. 4a. The strain derivative dε/dV vs. V provides information about the potential-dependent mechanical deformations in the electrode due to localized structural changes during intercalation. Although strain measurement is a macroscale measurement, the strain derivatives could mimic the nanoscale deformation behaviour in the electrodes. This unique ability was previously utilized to study phase-transition-induced deformations in graphite anodes, transition metal oxide cathodes, Prussian blue analogues, olivine-structure cathodes for alkali metal ion batteries, and commercial Li-ion pouch cells. Furthermore, the correlation between strain rates and electrochemical behaviour has been utilized to investigate proton insertion mechanisms of cathodes in aqueous electrolytes.\nFour distinct peaks are observed during desodiation, labeled with Roman letters i–iv, and three during sodiation, marked as v–vii in Fig. 4. The derivatives were calculated during sodiation when the voltage decreases, whereas during desodiation, the voltage increases. Therefore, minima in strain derivatives during sodiation indicate the onset of expansion, which correlates with the onset of contraction during desodiation. These capacity derivative peaks are associated with the redox reaction involving Cr+3/Cr+4, occurring within the potential range of 2.3 to 3.6 V. The peaks at different potentials were attributed to a sequence of phase transitions from O3R to O3M and then to P3M. The intensity of strain derivatives, as represented by the magnitude of the peak in the dε/dV vs. V plot. The evolution of strain derivatives hints at the structural changes in the electrode due to lattice mismatch between the Na-rich phases and the Na-poor phases in the electrode. The location of the minima/maxima of the strain derivatives aligns very well with the maxima during desodiation and minima during sodiation in the capacity derivatives with ± 0.02 V margin. This alignment indicates a correlation between redox reactions and structural changes in the lattice. The direction of the strain derivatives changes within the sodiation and desodiation cycles. This demonstrated the directional change in the mechanical deformations as lattice parameters were either contracted or expanded, depending on the phase transition. Strain peaks at i and vii are in negative directions, whereas all other strain peaks are positive. The directional patterns of the strain derivative peaks indicate the distinct difference in the deformations resulting from the phase transition between O3R ↔ O3R + O3M ↔ O3M ↔ O3M + P3M ↔ P3M. The variations in the lattice parameter have been studied using in situ XRD. The findings reveal that during the desodiation process, the lattice parameter ‘c’ is continuously increasing, whereas ‘a’ and ‘b’ are continuously decreasing. However, the study lacks information on the volumetric changes during cycling. Using the DIC technique, the intensity of strain derivatives gives the perspective about the extent of volume change during the phase transitions in the desodiation and sodiation process. During the desodiation process, the maximum intensity of dε/dV is also observed at ca. 2.97 V, relating to the peak intensity of dQ/dV (2.98 V). Similarly, during desodiation, the maximum peak intensity is observed at 2.93 V, relating to the peak intensity of dQ/dV (2.93 V). Overall, strain derivatives calculation provided insights into dynamic structural changes in the NaCrO2 cathodes during cycling.\nIt is important to address possible heterogeneity in the cathode during cycling. The ion intercalation may not occur at the same rate if there is a significant heterogeneity due to particle size differences at faster scan rates. A recent synchrotron nano-holotomography study demonstrated local network heterogeneity in composite NMC cathodes when cycled at 5C rates. We also presented the high heterogeneity in the composite lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes when cycled at faster rates (e.g., 2.5C). The heterogeneity was suppressed in the LFP cathodes when cycled at much slower rates (e.g., C/25). Here, the composite NaCrO2 cathodes were cycled at a C/25 rate to avoid heterogeneity in the composite network during cycling. To further verify it, we compared horizontal normal exx, vertical normal eyy, and shear strains exy in the composite electrode during galvanostatic cycling at C/25 rate in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The evolution of exx and eyy normal strains are similar during the cycling, and there is a negligible amount of exy strains in the composite electrode. Therefore, Fig. S3 (ESI†) indicates that heterogeneity in the composite NaCrO2 cathode was minimal when cycled at C/25 in our study.\n\nIrreversible strain generation\nIrreversible strain generation is plotted in Fig. 5 to shed light on its dependence on cycle number and cycle time. The objective is to discern cycling-induced trends in strain dynamics. Desodiation and sodiation strains are computed by resetting each cycle strain to zero, while an irreversible cumulative strain is defined as the overall strain generation at the end of the cycles (Fig. 5a and b). Notably, the desodiation strain displays a decreasing trend, with a significant strain during the initial desodiation process, gradually subsiding across subsequent cycles. Similarly, the first cycle exhibits substantial irreversible strain, diminishing with cycling, indicative of strain reduction. The sodiation process results in comparatively minimal strain generation. Both galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry show similar strain trends, emphasizing a consistent behaviour in deformations in the electrode.\nDelamination, swelling in the composite electrode, particle fracture, and the formation of cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers can lead to irreversible mechanical deformations in the electrode. Adhesion between the current collector and the composite electrode can be loosened upon repeated intercalation, leading to delamination in the composite electrode. In our study, we prepared free-standing composite electrodes for digital image correlation as described in the experimental part, and the electrode was tested only for the initial five cycles at a slow rate. Therefore, delamination is unlikely to be the factor behind the irreversible strains observed in our study. Swelling in the composite electrodes results from the interactions between electrolyte and polymer binders in the composite network. Organic electrolyte intake into the composite network leads to volumetric expansions in the electrode. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows a negligible amount of volumetric expansions during the open circuit period before the electrochemical testing; therefore, swelling is unlikely to contribute to irreversible strains in Fig. 5.\nThe electrode experienced large irreversible strain by the end of the first cycle compared to the subsequent cycles. The deformation mechanisms are much more complicated due to the CIE layers and mechanical instabilities in the electrode during the first cycle. The combination of DIC with XPS demonstrated the generation of large irreversible positive strains in lithium iron phosphate cathodes when cycled in LiPF6-containing organic electrolytes. The irreversible strains were attributed to the formation of the CEI layers. Interestingly, when the electrode cycled in LiClO4 salt, the irreversibility in the first cycle was much smaller than in LiPF6–containing electrolyte. Iron phosphate cathode experienced tremendous strain generation in the first cycle upon Na intercalation, leading to irreversible deformations in the electrode. Particle fracture is also reported in Ni-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries during the first cycle when cycled at high voltages.\nBeyond the first cycle, there is a linear relationship between cumulative irreversible strain generation and the square root of time (t0.5) in the NaCrO2 cathode in Fig. 5c, suggesting the irreversible strain generation due to CEI layer formation on the cathode. CEI layers typically originate from the degradation of electrolytes on the cathode electrode surface due to chemical reactions between electrolyte and electrode surface, generally at high voltages. It is well-documented in the literature about the correlation between the increase in the thickness of SEI on the anode or CEI layers on the cathode with the square root of time, t0.5.\nThe average slope in Fig. 5c is about 0.133 ± 0.015 (% h−0.5). Interestingly, in our previous study, the slope for the NaFePO4 electrode was found to be 0.134 (% h−0.5). Both NaCrO2 cathodes in this study and NaFePO4 cathodes in the previous study were cycled at the same rate and same electrolyte solution (NaClO4 in EC: DMC). The similarity in irreversible strain slope between two different cathodes further indicates that the irreversible are associated with the cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer formation.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The composite electrodes were made of an 8:1:1 weight ratio of NaCrO2 (NANOMYTE® NAB-10), conducting carbon (Super P Conductive), and binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Kynar HSV900), respectively in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, anhydrous) solvent. The free-standing composite electrode was prepared for the strain measurements described in the literature. The artificial speckle pattern was prepared by the synthesis method outlined in the referenced literature. To create a speckle pattern for DIC, the particles were diluted (20 times by volume), sonicated in ethanol, and then spin-coated onto the electrode surface at approximately 700 rpm ten times before assembling the custom cell. The natural speckle pattern of NaCrO2 dissolves after a couple of cycles, so the artificial speckle pattern is generated by spin-coating fluorescent silica nanoparticle solution on one side of the free-standing electrode surface. These electrodes were cut into ∼10 mm × 2.5 mm rectangular shapes.\n\nCustom cell design and assembly\nCustom cell assembly was employed to investigate the strain changes in the free-standing working electrode during battery cycling. A comprehensive description of the custom battery cell design and its assembly is described in detail in the literature and ESI.† Sodium metal was used as a counter/reference electrode. Both electrodes were placed inside the main body of the custom cell and are attached to stainless steel pins that protrude through the base of the cell for electrical connection. After sealing the custom cell in an argon-saturated glove box, the custom cell assembly was then installed on the optical table set-up and covered under a blackout blanket to prevent the effects of ambient light. The electrochemical tests were conducted after at least 24 hours of the open circuit period. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the strain generation during the open circuit and subsequent charge. A negligible amount of strains during the open circuit shows the stability in the electrode before cycling.\n\nElectrochemical cycling\nElectrochemical properties were studied in a half cell using sodium (Na) metal as the counter/reference electrode and NaCrO2 as the positive/working electrode. The cells were assembled inside an argon-filled glove box (MB-Unilab Pro SP, MBraun) (O2 content < 0.1 ppm, H2O content < 0.1 ppm). The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 (sodium perchlorate, anhydrous, ACS, Alfa Aesar) in the propylene carbonate (PC) (Anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) solvent. Galvanostatic sodiation/desodiation measurements were carried out using a multi-channel Arbin battery tester. The electrodes were cycled via galvanostatic cycling at a C/25 current rate in the voltage range of 2.3 V to 3.6 V at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed at the scan rate of 50 μV s−1.\n\nStrain measurements\nThe operando strain experimental setup was discussed in detail in our previous publication. Shortly, the installed set-up on the optical table was kept for a 24-hour OCV period for the electrolyte to penetrate inside the electrode and the system to stabilize. A 532 nm wavelength laser with a power of 75 mW was used to excite the fluorescent nanoparticles on the surface of an electrode. To capture only the emitted fluorescent light in the images, a 620 nm filter was used to filter out reflected laser light. A LabVIEW program developed in-house was used to capture the images. During electrochemical measurements, images were captured every 2 minutes, with a laser beam exposure time on the electrode surface of 1–2 seconds per image. The exposure time is restricted using a shutter to prevent the particles from bleaching. Vic2D software was used to measure the full-field strain on an area of interest with dimensions of ca. 750 μm × 500 μm, a subset size of 111 × 111 pixels, and a step size of 14. Using an internal MATLAB program, the strains were synced with the electrode's electrochemical response (current and voltage). The reported strains are horizontal normal strain, exx in the study except Fig. S3 (ESI†), where we compared vertical normal strains eyy and shear strains exy.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Developing off-grid portable clean energy storage devices, such as rechargeable metal-ion batteries, is one of the promising solutions. In general, rechargeable metal-ion batteries involve the shuttling of metal ions between the cathode (metal-ion source) and the anode (metal-ion host), thus requiring separate fabrication of each electrode. Recently, the concept of dual-ion batteries, avoiding the use of an alkali-metal-rich cathode, has been introduced. The electrolyte used in dual-ion batteries solely supplies the required cations and anions. In this case, simultaneous hosting of the cations and anions in the anode and cathode reduces the overall inactive mass of the electrode in the cell compared to the regular metal-ion batteries. This improves the energy density of the cell. The use of the same electrode material in both the cathode and anode leads to symmetric dual-ion batteries (SDIBs, Scheme 1), further simplifying the battery fabrication and operational cost, leading to a high commercial value.\nThe previous strategies for the fabrication of all organic SDIBs involve the development of symmetric organic molecules having p-type and n-type moieties either linked or fused together. Furthermore, a wide working electrochemical window is desirable to improve the energy density of the cell. This can be achieved by increasing the cathode potential or, decreasing the anode potential or both simultaneously. The sodiation/lithiation potentials for the intercalation-type anodes (graphite, hard carbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons) are found to be lower than those of the insertion-type organic anodes (i.e., having redox-active moieties). On the other hand, in the quest for efficient electrode materials, redox-active POPs have been found to satisfy some of the key energy storage performance metrics. POPs have been used in a wide range of applications ranging from water purification, catalysis and light harvesting, to energy storage, including batteries and supercapacitors. The flexibility in design and fabrication, tunable porosity, and well-defined redox properties of POPs are promising for their use as both cathode and anode materials. Thus, incorporating polyaromatic hydrocarbons and insertion-type cathode-active components into a porous network could be a worthwhile strategy in developing organic electrodes for SDIBs.\nHerein, we have developed a triphenylamine-pyrene-based nitrogen-rich redox-active porous organic polymer (TPA-Py, Scheme 1) for sodium-based organic SDIBs. The TPA-Py polymer possesses pyrene units for Na+ adsorption and triphenylamine moieties for hexafluorophosphate ion (PF6−) insertion. The TPA-Py POP was employed for both the anode and cathode using half-cells, and finally, a symmetric all-organic full-cell battery was fabricated. The current study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report on a sodium-based SDIB with POP having adsorption-intercalation-type anode and insertion-type cathode components, resulting in a wide working potential window.\nThe POP was synthesized by the cross-coupling reaction between 4,4′,4′′-triaminotriphenylamine (TPA) and 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene (Py) using palladium-catalysed Buchwald–Hartwig coupling (Scheme S1, ESI†). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis of the resulting TPA-Py POP showed a noticeable shift of the C–N bending vibrational band from 1612 cm−1 of TPA to 1592 cm−1 and the disappearance of the characteristic band at 3240–3460 cm−1 for N–H stretching of primary amines, suggesting C–N linkage formation (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the disappearance of the band at 1056 cm−1 of C–Br stretching in TPA-Py ascertained the successful polymer formation (Fig. 1a). The solid-state 13C-cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of TPA-Py revealed the closely-spaced characteristic peaks at ∼145 and 139 ppm from the carbons connected to the nitrogen atoms (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the closely-spaced intense peaks around 128 and 125 ppm could be attributed to the aromatic carbons (Fig. 1b).\nThe Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of TPA-Py was found to be 70 m2 g−1 from the N2 adsorption isotherm (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1, ESI†). The pore size distribution analysis revealed hierarchical porosity with both micropores and a wide range of mesopores (Fig. S2, ESI†). The high thermal stability up to 320 °C, as evidenced by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profile, suggests a promising scope of TPA-Py POP as an electrode material in high-temperature energy storage devices (Fig. 1d). It also provides a higher safety margin against accidental temperature rise. The TPA-Py POP appeared as irregular fused globular particles under field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Fig. 1e). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images also show a connected network architecture, typical for amorphous porous organic polymers (Fig. 1e, inset). The broad powder X-ray diffraction profile further substantiated the amorphous nature of the TPA-Py polymer (Fig. S3, ESI†).\nThe electrochemical performances of the TPA-Py polymer for dual-ion battery applications were investigated by fabricating half-cells (using Na-metal as a reference as well as a counter electrode and 1 M NaPF6 in diglyme as an electrolyte). The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the TPA-Py polymer was analysed in the potential window of 0.01 to 4.2 V (Fig. S7, ESI†). The CV profile of the TPA-Py polymer shows redox-active regions at two extreme potentials, suggesting its intrinsic nature for dual-ion storage. The potential range 0.01–2.5 V was chosen as anodic, whereas 2.5–4.2 V was chosen for the cathodic regions of the POP-based cell. The CV of the cell during the anodic scan revealed a strong and broad irreversible reduction peak between ∼0.3 and 0.9 V in the first CV cycle, representing the electrolyte decomposition and the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation (Fig. S8, ESI†). A prominent reversible redox peak at the lower potential of the CV of the anodic scan below 0.2 V, as shown in Fig. 2a, suggests the adsorption-intercalation of Na+ ions at the pyrene moieties and pore filling of TPA-Py POP (Fig. S14, ESI†). The current responses increased with higher scan rates suggesting faster sodiation/desodiation processes.\nThe capacitive contribution of TPA-Py POP for Na+ ion storage estimated using Dunn's method varies from ∼46% to 73%, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The major diffusion contribution (intercalation process) appears at significantly lower potential (<0.25 V). In contrast, the capacitive contribution comes majorly in the potential range ∼0.25 to 2.0 V. Thus, the simultaneous contribution from adsorption and intercalation facilitates Na+ ion storage by TPA-Py POP for a wider potential window. On the other hand, the two distinct redox peaks having E1/2 values of 3.1 V and 3.9 V in the CV of the cathodic scan signify the two-stage anion storage of the polymer. The peaks at ∼3.2 V and ∼4.0 V indicate the oxidation of tertiary nitrogen of triphenylamine moieties and secondary nitrogen of the bridging –NH-groups in the polymer, respectively (Fig. 2b). Upon oxidation, the triphenylamine moieties reversibly store two PF6− ions of the electrolyte through an anion-insertion mechanism, resulting in a quinoidal structure (Fig. S15, ESI†). Thus, the polymer could store dual-ions, i.e., Na+ and PF6−, through the adsorption-intercalation and insertion mechanism, respectively, during charging.\nThe specific capacity of the POP was similarly measured by making a half-cell for the anode and cathode by galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) experiments at different scan rates ranging from 20 to 2000 mA g−1. The first discharge cycle of the polymer as the anode exhibits a plateau near ∼0.9 V, corresponding to the SEI formation (Fig. S10, ESI†), which corroborates well with the CV data (Fig. S8, ESI†). The GCD profiles of the polymer in Fig. 2c and d show a decrease in specific capacity for both the anode and cathode, respectively, with increasing current density. The highest reversible capacities of the TPA-Py polymer as the anode and cathode at 20 mA g−1 are 109 and 65 mA h g−1, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). Furthermore, an appreciable rate capability was observed using TPA-Py POP in the case of anodic reaction (Fig. 2e). However, the rate capability has been impacted slightly during the cathodic reactions (Fig. 2f). The insertion of bulky PF6− ions in TPA-Py POP not only imparts a large volume change of the electrode but can get blocked in the narrow pores of the polymer resulting in sluggish electrode kinetics.\nThe galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was employed at different potentials to elucidate further the diffusion of Na+ and PF6− ions in the polymer matrix (Fig. S12, ESI†). The calculated diffusion coefficients of Na+ (DNa+) and PF6− (DPF6−) are ∼10−12 to 10−14 cm2 s−1 and ∼10−12 to 10−15 cm2 s−1, respectively. To evaluate the charge-transfer resistance of the polymer during charging, potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurement was carried out at different potentials. In the Nyquist plots of TPA-Py POP (Fig. S13, ESI†), the small semi-circle represents the charge transfer resistance (RCT), whereas the inclined straight line refers to the Warburg impedance (ZW). With increasing the DC bias, the RCT decreases, indicating faster charge transfer in the polymer matrix using it both as an anode and cathode.\nThe TPA-Py POP showed ∼85% and ∼80% capacity retention after 1000 GCD cycles with respect to the initial capacities for the anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively (Fig. 3a). This slight capacity loss might be due to the ohmic resistance increase (Fig. 3b and Fig. S11a, ESI†), electrode pulverization, and some extent of pore-clogging during the charge–discharge process by Na+ and PF6− ions. The coulombic efficiency for both the cathodic and anodic reactions remained stable in the range of 96–100% after the initial few cycles (Fig. 3a). Based on the cation and anion storage ability of TPA-Py POP, a sodium-based symmetric dual-ion battery was fabricated, where TPA-Py POP was used as both the cathode and anode (Fig. S14 and S15, ESI†). The electrochemical performance of a symmetric dual-ion battery is shown in Fig. 3c (Fig. S11b, ESI†).\nThe electronic structure of the building units and repeating unit of the polymer were computed using density functional theory calculation [B3LYP, 6-31G(d,p)] to get more insights into the electronic distributions. The smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap of TPA-Py indicates higher electronic conduction compared to its monomers, resulting in enhanced electronic conductivity and faster redox kinetics in the porous polymer (Fig. S17, ESI†). The molecular electrostatic potential (MESP)-mapped electron density calculation of the repeating unit revealed the preferred localization of Na+ ions near the pyrene units and PF6− closer to triphenylamine units (Fig. S18, ESI†).\nThe mechanistic investigation of dual-ion storage by the TPA-Py polymer was carried out using ex situ FTIR analysis of the battery electrodes. The strong absorption peaks at 1495 cm−1 (CC) decreased substantially after discharging to 0.01 V, and two new peaks appeared at 1427 and 879 cm−1, suggesting the n-doping of the pyrene moieties during Na+ ion storage. On the other hand, when the TPA-Py POP containing half-cell was charged to 4.2 V, two new characteristic peaks appeared. The peaks at 1660 and 840 cm−1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of CN from one of the possible quinoid-like structures of triphenylamine moieties, and P–F stretching vibration, respectively (Fig. S16, ESI†). Thus, the dual-ion charge storage process by TPA-Py POP has been ascertained through the adsorption-intercalation-insertion mechanism (Fig. S16, ESI†).\nIn summary, we have designed a novel porous organic polymer (TPA-Py) containing both anode and cathode active units for dual-ion batteries. The pyrene units in the polymer facilitate reversible Na+ ion adsorption-intercalation, and the redox-active triphenylamine units in the network assist in the reversible storage of PF6− ions. As a proof of concept, we have fabricated a symmetrical dual ion battery using TPA-Py polymer in both the cathode and anode. The present study employing a porous organic polymer as an adsorption-intercalation-type anode and the insertion-type cathode lights the way for further exploration of symmetric dual-ion batteries with a wide potential window leading to high energy density.\nWe thank SERB (project no.

The possibility to bring about compositional and morphological changes by tuning the elemental stoichiometry adds additional flexibility, thus improving their performance as active materials for various applications such as energy storage, electrocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices. Since the discovery of graphene, two-dimensional materials like transition metal oxides and sulfides possessing layered morphology have gained significant attention because of their fascinating properties. In the context of batteries, ternary metal sulfides (TMSs) have been found to exhibit superior electrochemical properties even without designing carbon composites.\nVarious synthetic routes, including solvothermal, ion exchange, wet chemical, electrodeposition, and solid-state methods, have been employed for synthesizing TMSs. Recently, Swathi et al. reported the synthesis of ternary copper iron sulfide (CuFeS2) nanoflowers anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using a hydrothermal method and studied them for water-splitting reactions. Krengel et al. synthesized iron vanadium sulfide (FeV2S4) by a high-temperature solid-state approach and used it in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), resulting in a specific capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.375 A g−1. However, obtaining pure-phase TMSs without any phase separation into binary sulfides along with the desired morphology still remains a challenge.\nA topochemical synthesis involves the conversion of the reactant to product by retaining the morphology/crystal structure. On the other hand, the solid–gas synthetic route offers a vital platform where a reactant (solid precursor) undergoes a reaction in the presence of a gaseous source under heating conditions. Combining the topochemical synthesis with the solid–gas reaction route offers good control over the morphology of the products and provides a unique strategy for the synthesis of various TMSs. Among group V metals, niobium possesses rich chemistry, enabling its incorporation into ternary metal sulfides. Nb-based compounds have also been reported to be highly stable anode materials for lithium-ion batteries and SIBs.\nThe present study involves the topochemical synthesis of a highly crystalline, pure-phase Nb3VS6 having a hexagonal crystal structure presented in Fig. 1(a) using a simple solid–gas method. A niobium–vanadium complex is decomposed at elevated temperatures using H2S gas as the sulfur source to obtain Nb3VS6. The fabricated electrodes for SIBs using the as-synthesized Nb3VS6 exhibited high cycling stability with a specific capacity of 101.15 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and a capacity retention of 100 percent after 2500 cycles without requiring any carbonaceous support.\nThe synthesis of Nb3VS6 is carried out using a niobium–vanadium–hexadecylamine (Nb–V–HDA) complex as the precursor and H2S gas as the sulfur source in a horizontal tubular furnace, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The metal–HDA precursors are organic–inorganic compounds consisting of the intercalated amine groups in the inorganic host, forming lamellar structures. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Nb–V–HDA precursor shown in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†) and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in Fig. S2(b)–(d) (ESI†) confirms the layered structure of the Nb–V–HDA precursor. Thus, Nb–V–HDA is chosen as a precursor for synthesizing Nb3VS6. During the solid–gas synthesis, parameters like temperature, time, and H2S concentration play a crucial role in determining pure-phase formation. The synthesis parameters are optimized by varying the temperature (750–950 °C), reaction time (15–45 min) and H2S flow rate (15–35 sccm). Among them, the optimized conditions for obtaining the pure phase of hexagonal Nb3VS6 are found to be heating at 950 °C for 45 minutes at a gas-flow rate of 35 sccm. The XRD pattern obtained under these conditions is shown in Fig. 1(b), which matches well with JCPDS no. 04-005-0908, confirming the formation of the pure phase. The XRD patterns obtained during the optimization process are presented in Fig. S3(a)–(c) (ESI†). Specific surface area (SSA) is obtained using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Nb3VS6 showed a type-IV isotherm with a surface area of 17.5 m2 g−1.\nTo study the morphology of the obtained products, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) is employed. It is observed that the products obtained for different conditions are found to have nanosheet-like morphology, as shown in Fig. S5(a)–(f) (ESI†). The FESEM image of the Nb3VS6 nanosheets obtained under the optimised conditions is shown in the inset of Fig. 1(d). To study the morphology of the precursor and the final product, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is employed. The low-resolution TEM image of the Nb–V–HDA is shown in Fig. 1(c), exhibiting a layered structure. The obtained Nb3VS6 is found to have nanosheet-like morphology, as shown in Fig. 1(d), confirming a topochemical synthesis. Further, a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1(e)) shows lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.28 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. 1(f) clearly indicates the crystallinity of Nb3VS6. Additionally, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is carried out, and the elemental mapping shows the homogenous distribution of niobium (Nb), vanadium (V), and sulfur (S) over the entire nanosheet for Nb3VS6 (Fig. S6, ESI†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the Nb3VS6 nanosheets is carried out, and the Nb 3d, V 2p, and S 2p spectra are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The observed peaks are in agreement with those previously reported in the literature. The peak at 210 eV arises due to the presence of Nb in a +5 oxidation state, indicating the sensitivity of Nb towards surface oxidation. The XRD pattern of Nb3VS6, stored under ambient conditions, is recorded after two months and is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The invariant XRD pattern indicates the stability of Nb3VS6 against bulk oxidation.\nTo analyze the electrochemical characteristics of the Nb3VS6 electrode for SIBs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) is carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 within the potential range of 0.01–2.5 V, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The broad peak in the first cathodic scan at around 1.2 V might correspond to both the insertion of Na+ and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). This can also be observed in the corresponding galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles recorded at 0.1 A g−1 shown in Fig. 2(b) exhibiting an extended plateau at similar potential. A decrease in specific discharge capacity from 517 to 179 mA h g−1 during the initial and subsequent cycles could be attributed to factors such as SEI formation, formation of irreversible oxides, and side reactions associated with surface defects/functional groups present in the active material. In addition to this, XRD of the anode is carried out after five cycles (Fig. S9(a) and (b), ESI†). The peaks of the pristine electrode match with that of the cycled electrode, indicating an insertion-type mechanism for the Nb3VS6 anode. A remarkable improvement in coulombic efficiency (CE) in subsequent cycles is observed, suggesting a reversible process after the first cycle. Fig. 2(c) displays rate capabilities at different sodiation/desodiation rates for the Nb3VS6 anode, wherein specific capacities of 148.89, 123.31, 112.4, 106.13, and 101.10 mA h g−1 are observed at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 A g−1. The specific capacity values do not undergo a major change with increasing current densities, indicating that the material is stable at higher rates without undergoing capacity fading, indicating fast charging possibility with further optimization. Moreover, as the anode is cycled back to 0.1 A g−1, an excellent capacity retention of ∼100% is shown by Nb3VS6, accounting for its robust nature during continuous charge/discharge that results in remarkable reversibility. Even at a higher current density of 5 A g−1, the anode can maintain nominal cycling stability and rate capability (Fig. S10, ESI†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is carried out before and after the CV of the Nb3VS6 anode is performed, and the corresponding Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), which clearly shows the decrease in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) value after five cycles. The decrease in impedance after five cycles is accounted for by the SEI formation along with increased activation of the electrode in the early charge/discharge cycles, leading to improved electrical contact between the electrode and electrolyte. The long-term cycling stability of the anode at 0.5 A g−1 is shown in Fig. 2(d), wherein a specific capacity of ∼115 mA h g−1 is obtained after 2500 cycles, with a capacity retention of ∼100% and a coulombic efficiency of ∼99% throughout. Additionally, a specific capacity of 58.87 mA h g−1 is observed after 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1 (Fig. S12, ESI†). The ternary sulfides exhibited excellent electrochemical characteristics by demonstrating good cycling stability without the need to utilize any carbon materials as additional conductive additives. In addition, the electrochemical performance of other trials obtained under different synthetic conditions is also tested in SIBs for comparison, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), which also exhibited similar rate capabilities.\nFig. S14 (ESI†) shows the scan rate-dependent CV measurements recorded in the range 0.1–10 mV s−1 for the electrochemical kinetic analysis of the Nb3VS6 anode. The proportions of capacitive and diffusion-limited currents that make up the overall current are assessed as shown in Fig. 3(a), and k1 and k2 are computed throughout the potential range for the CV curve at 0.1 mV s−1. The capacitive contribution at 0.1 mV s−1 is 35% and increases significantly with increasing scan rate, reaching up to a maximum value of 88% at 10 mV s−1. This indicates a significant pseudocapacitive contribution, leading to an improvement in ion transport due to the storage of Na+ at the surface of Nb3VS6 (Fig. 3(b)). As a result, the Nb3VS6 anode shows excellent stability even at high rates for over 2500 cycles. A comparison for the same is provided in Table S1 (ESI†) showcasing the remarkable cycling stability of the Nb3VS6 SIB anode compared to other materials reported in the literature.\nIn summary, a Nb–HDA complex is used as a precursor for topochemical synthesis of Nb3VS6 using H2S gas as a sulfidation agent. The spectroscopic and microscopic characterizations indicate the formation of a pure phase with a nanosheet-like morphology. When used as an anode for SIBs, a specific capacity of 101.15 mA h g−1 is obtained at 0.5 A g−1 along with excellent cycling stability with 100% capacity retention after 2500 cycles. The stability of the anode can be attributed to the pseudocapacitive nature of Nb3VS6 involving a surface-controlled capacitive process.\nP.

Among these, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as promising candidates due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources. Despite these advantages, the larger ionic radius of sodium ions poses challenges such as sluggish kinetics and significant structural changes during cycling, resulting in inferior electrochemical performance. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore and develop electrode materials with sufficient interstitial space to accommodate larger Na+ ions, capable of delivering superior cycling stability and rate performance for SIBs.\nTransition metal chalcogenides are increasingly recognized as promising anode materials for SIBs due to their versatile synthesis, robust structures, and high theoretical capacities. Among them, transition metal selenides (TMSes) like MnSe, CuSe, CoSe2, and MoSe2, have garnered significant attention for their superior electronic conductivity and smaller band gaps compared to transition metal sulfides, leading to better rate performance. However, TMSes undergo phase transitions during (de)sodiation, involving bond breaking and crystal structure rearrangement. This collapse and aggregation degrade cycling and rate performance, especially at high current densities. Strategies like nanostructure design and carbon modification are commonly employed to mitigate the above issues, however elaborate fabrication and unfavorable side reaction restrict their practical application.\nBimetallic selenides often exhibit superior electrochemical performance due to enhanced conductivity, enriched redox reactions, and synergistic effects between components. For instance, Wang et al. have synthesized the Co4Mo6Se8 nanosheet arrays grown on a carbon skeleton (CMSe/C), showing a reversible capacity of 474 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2400 cycles. Although some progress has been made in enhancing the performance of these materials, achieving stable cycling behavior at elevated current densities remains a persistent challenge. Moreover, the understanding of the function for each metal unit, as well as the design paradigm for bimetallic selenides, is not yet clear.\nIn this study, we report a novel cubic bimetallic selenide Cu3TaSe4 as a high-performance anode for SIBs, synthesized via a simple solid-state reaction. By integrating Ta–Se motifs into copper selenide as anti-aggregation units to form a cubic grid structure, the aggregation of copper atoms during conversion reaction can be suppressed by immobile tantalum atoms with large atomic mass, effectively alleviating the volume expansion and electrode failure issues during cycling. Furthermore, the synergy between Cu and Ta bimetals significantly enriches the electronic reaction process, leading to superior electrochemical performance. The Cu3TaSe4 anode exhibits outstanding performance, achieving a high specific capacity of 305 mAh g−1 at 1 C, superior rate capability with 286 mAh g−1 at 50 C, and exceptional cycling stability with 94% capacity retention after 3500 cycles at 20 C (Table S1, ESI†). The anti-aggregation-motif design strategy introduced in this study is anticipated to inspire the development of anode materials with high-rate capabilities and stable cycling for SIBs.\nThe schematic representation of the cubic grid Cu3TaSe4 structure is depicted in Fig. 1a, illustrating the assembly of Cu–Se and Ta–Se motifs. Tantalum and copper, each coordinated by four equivalent selenium atoms, form TaSe4 and CuSe4 tetrahedra, respectively. The Ta–Se and Cu–Se bonds in these structures are uniformly 2.4 Å in length. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthesized sample (Fig. 1b) matches well with the standard values of cubic Cu3TaSe4 (JCPDS 00-059-0158), exhibiting a P4m structure and lattice constants of a = b = c = 5.67 Å. The refinement reliability factors are Rp = 5.11%, Rwp = 7.05%, and Chi2 = 7.21. The primary characteristic diffraction peaks are observed at 15.62°, 27.23°, 35.39°, and 45.22°, corresponding to the (100), (111), (120), and (202) crystal planes, respectively.\nThe microstructure and elemental composition of Cu3TaSe4 were characterized using a suite of advanced microscopy techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imagery (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1, ESI†) reveals a predominantly quadrilateral shape of the Cu3TaSe4 particles, measuring approximately 2–3 μm in dimension. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. 1d) confirms a homogeneous distribution of Cu, Ta, and Se across the composite. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1e) display lattice fringes in two directions, identifying the (001) and (1–10) crystal facets with interplanar spacings of 0.566 nm and 0.405 nm, respectively, with an intersection angle of 90°. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 1f) from the [110] zone show clear diffraction spots, which are indexed to the (001), (1–10), and (1–11) planes of cubic Cu3TaSe4.\nThe electrical resistivity of Cu3TaSe4 exhibits a negative correlation with temperature, demonstrating semiconductor behavior (Fig. 2a). Additionally, it achieves a relatively high electrical conductivity of 102.5 mS m−1 at 300 K (the inset of Fig. 2a). Spectroscopic evidence of the formation of Cu3TaSe4 is confirmed by the Raman spectrum recording (Fig. 2b). The cubic lattice of Cu3TaSe4 is characterized by a predominant peak at 233.9 cm−1, corresponding to the E2 vibrational mode of Cu–Se. The weak peak observed at 110.2 cm−1 and the broad peak at 159.5 cm−1 are respectively attributed to the two-phonon structure of Ta–Se. The oxidation state of Cu3TaSe4 was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The Cu 2p XPS spectrum of Cu3TaSe4, shown in Fig. 2c, displays peaks at 932.4 eV and 952.2 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of the Cu+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states, respectively. Additionally, shake-up satellite peaks for Cu 2p are observed at 944.8 eV and 948.4 eV. The Ta 4f XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) features peaks at 24.2 eV and 26.1 eV, indicative of the Ta5+ 4f7/2 and Ta5+ 4f5/2 states, respectively. The Se 3d spectrum reveals two peaks, corresponding to Se2− 3d5/2 at 53.9 eV and 3d3/2 at 54.8 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†).\nThe initial three galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of the Cu3TaSe4 anode at 0.15 A g−1 (1C = 300 mA g−1), show initial discharge and charge capacities of 371.7 mAh g−1 and 328.7 mAh g−1, respectively, with a high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 88.4% (Fig. 3a). In subsequent cycles, the coulombic efficiency rapidly increases to above 99%, indicating highly reversible sodium storage behavior. The Na–Cu3TaSe4 half-cell exhibits reversible capacities of 291, 305, 295, 313, 326, 332, 328, and 286 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 C, respectively, indicating that 94% of the reference capacity measured at 1 C can be reversibly achieved within 1.5 minutes (Fig. 3b and Fig. S4, ESI†). When the rate returned to 0.2 C, the Cu3TaSe4 anode rapidly recovers its initial capacity, demonstrating superior rate performance compared to Cu2Se (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). Additionally, Fig. S7 (ESI†), Fig. 3c and d illustrate the long-term cycling performance of the Cu3TaSe4 anode at current densities of 1 C, 5 C, and 20 C, following initial low-current activation cycles. After 200 cycles at 1 C, the specific capacity remains steady at 416 mAh g−1 without any capacity decay (Fig. S7, ESI†). Similarly, at 5 C, the specific capacity is maintained at 304 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles, with a capacity retention rate approaching 100% (Fig. 3c). Under high-rate (dis)charge conditions at 20 C, the specific capacity remains stable at 272 mAh g−1 after 3500 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 94% (Fig. 3d). The initial capacity increase during the first 100 cycles is due to SEI layer formation and electrochemical milling, which boost electrochemical activity and stabilize the material. The improved performance of Cu3TaSe4 is attributed to the lattice synergy between Cu and Ta, which reduces volume expansion and prevents Cu atom agglomeration, leading to better capacity and electrode stability.\nThe charge storage behavior of Cu3TaSe4 was evaluated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization at scan rates from 0.4 to 1.5 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a). As the scan rate increased, both anode and cathode peaks rose similarly. According to the Randles–Sevcik (R–S) equation, i = aνb, where i is the peak current and ν is the scan rate. For a diffusion-controlled process, b = 0.5, while for a capacitance-controlled process, b = 1.0. The linear relationship between log(i) and log(ν) was derived from peaks at 1.92 V (peak 1) and 2.05 V (peak 2). The b values for peaks 1 and 2 were 0.94 and 0.98, respectively, indicating that sodium storage in the Cu3TaSe4 anode is primarily capacitive-controlled (Fig. 4b). According to the formula, i = k1v + k2v1/2, where k1 is the slope and k2 is the Y-intercept. The pseudocapacitive contributions at scan rates of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.5 mV s−1 were 93.3%, 93.4%, 93.5%, 94.0%, and 97.2%, respectively (Fig. 4c and Fig. S8, ESI†). To investigate the kinetics of Na+ migration, constant current intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements were performed (Fig. 4d and Fig. S9, ESI†). The Na+ ions diffusion coefficient (DNa+) of the Cu3TaSe4 anode ranged from 1.02 × 10−13 to 2.57 × 10−11 cm2 s−1, consistent with the trends observed in the CV curves (Fig. 4d).\nIn situ XRD was employed to monitor the structural evolution of Cu3TaSe4 during successive (de)sodiation processes in the first cycle, illustrating its working mechanism (Fig. 5a and Fig. S10, ESI†). Throughout the cycle, the peaks observed at about 38.9°, 41.5°, and 44.3° are attributed to BeO, while those at around 46.1°, 51.3°, and 53.2° correspond to Be, associated with the in situ cell window. The peaks at about 43.5° and 50.7° are due to the Cu foil used for the anode. In the initial stage, the peaks at approximately 15.8°, 22.4°, 27.5°, 35.6°, 39.1°, 48.4°, and 53.9° match the diffraction peaks of Cu3TaSe4. The entire (dis)charge process involves a series of distinct transformations. Initially, as the discharge process begins, sodium ions gradually insert into the Cu3TaSe4 lattice. This insertion is indicated by a slight shift in the diffraction peaks of the initial crystal plane of Cu3TaSe4 towards higher angles, resulting in the formation of NaxCu3TaSe4. As the discharge progresses, the initial diffraction peaks of Cu3TaSe4 completely disappear. Concurrently, characteristic peaks of Na2Se (220) emerge at approximately 37.3°, followed by the appearance of the Ta (051) peak at 47.0°. During the charging process, sodium ions gradually deintercalate, resulting in the gradual disappearance of the characteristic peaks of Na2Se (220) and Ta (051), while new peaks corresponding to metal selenides become observable. Upon recharging to 3 V, peaks associated with the Ta2Se3 (001), TaSe3 (102), and Cu3Se2 (111) crystal planes are observed.\nThe CV profiles of Cu3TaSe4 at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 further reveal electrochemical behavior (Fig. 5b). In the first cathodic scan, a prominent peak at approximately 0.48 V indicates the initial sodiation process and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation, while a minor peak at 0.05 V indicating Na+ insertion within the carbon matrix. During the subsequent anodic scan, a peak around 0.1 V corresponds to Na+ extraction from the carbon matrix. Peaks observed at 1.52 V, 1.92 V, and 2.05 V are attributed to the desodiation of Na2Se and the formation of TaSex and CuSex. After the initial scan, the subsequent curves display highly reproducible profiles, indicating excellent reversibility and stable kinetics. The electrochemical impedance spectra reveal a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance for the Cu3TaSe4 anode after several cycles (Fig. 5c). This is due to the anode activation process, which forms refined nanoparticles and a more uniform SEI film. Consequently, both electron and ion conductivity are enhanced, leading to improved electrochemical performance and stability of the Cu3TaSe4 anode.\nIn summary, Cu3TaSe4 was successfully synthesized via a one-step solid-state reaction. The incorporation of Ta–Se motifs into copper selenide to form a cubic grid structure effectively mitigates the aggregation of copper atoms during the conversion reaction, thus addressing the issue of structural degradation-induced electrode failures. The Cu3TaSe4 anode demonstrates exceptional sodium storage capabilities, maintaining a capacity retention of 94% from 0.2 C to 50 C, with specific capacities of 304 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles at 5 C and 272 mAh g−1 after 3500 cycles at 20 C in SIBs. The sodium storage mechanism of the Cu3TaSe4 anode was investigated using in situ XRD, revealing a stepwise bimetallic reaction. This anti-aggregation motif design strategy is anticipated to inspire the development of high-rate and long-lived anode materials for SIBs.\nY. H. and Z. L. contributed equally to this work.

However, the shortage of lithium resources has been the inherent bottleneck for their large-scale promotion. In recent years, sodium/potassium ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) have been deemed to be promising novel cost-effective secondary battery candidates owing to rich resources and similar physicochemical properties. Nevertheless, the large-sized Na+/K+ will bring about serious volume effects and sluggish reaction kinetics, which limit the rate capability and worsen the lifespan of SIBs/PIBs. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore suitable electrodes with large channels for Na+/K+ transfer and rational structure to endure the volume changes.\nFortunately, layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LTMDs) with large interlayers could facilitate Na+/K+ diffusion. As an essential representative of LTMDs, MoS2 with an interlayer spacing of 0.62 nm is regarded as an ideal candidate for Na+/K+ hosting, attributed to the weak interlayer van der Waals (vdW) force. Meanwhile, MoS2 anodes also suffer from spontaneous aggregation and unstable electrochemistry during the conversion reaction, which originate from the inherent poor conductivity and huge volume expansion. To address these issues, numerous efforts have been devoted to devise the architectures of LTMDs. Generally, a MoS2/carbon composite can increase the charge transfer and enhance its stability. On the other hand, nanostructure engineering can also decrease the diffusion distance of Na+, increase the interfacial charge storage, and effectively release the accumulated mechanical strain. Especially, as a unique type of hollow nanostructure, a yolk-shelled structure consisting of an active core and stable shell has large void spaces and rich interfacial boundaries, which provide sufficient spaces for volume expansion and enhance Na+/K+ reaction kinetics. Traditionally, yolk–shell structures are fabricated by several methods along the inside-to-outside and outside-to-inside directions. For example, the incorporation of iron in MoS2 (FMS@C) with a yolk–shell nanoarchitecture was prepared through a microemulsion strategy to deliver high structure stability, superior rate capability and impressive capacity retention. Besides, a few-layered MoS2@hollow porous carbon-sphere (MoS2@HPCS) with a yolk–shell structure was obtained in a hydrothermal process using a HPCS template, which boosted the K+ storage capability.\nHerein, a yolk shell-structured anode with a carbon coupled MoS2 core, carbon and MoS2 shell and large inner void (MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2) was designed for SIBs and PIBs based on a hard-template strategy. This ingenious structure provides sufficient space for the volume expansion of the Na+/K+ insertion. Meanwhile, the shell with carbon and MoS2 can provide large channels for the Na+/K+ transfer and increase conductivity, and also strengthen the structure stability. As a result, the Na+/K+ storage capability can be boosted, achieving excellent specific capacities, rate performance, and cycling stability.\nThe preparation process of MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 is shown schematically in Fig. 1a. Through self-polymerization, the polypyrrole-phosphomolybdic acid (PPy-PMo12) precursor was obtained, which was coated by SiO2 and resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) to create an inner void and carbon shell for the yolk–shell nanosphere. Through a carbonization and etching process, a hard template was obtained to grow MoS2 layers in a hydrothermal process, producing MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 with a yolk–shell structure. As shown in Fig. 1b, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were quite similar, related to the hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS no. 37-1492). The peaks at 13.8°, 32.6°, 39.5° and 58.3° were related to the (002), (100), (103) and (110) planes of MoS2, respectively. Based on the peak position, the interplanar spacing of (002) planes was calculated to be 0.64 nm, which can provide large channels for the Na+/K+ transfer. It is obvious that the (002) peak became weak for MoS2/C@Void@C and MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2, predicating the MoS2/C yolk to be well covered by the carbon shell. Raman spectra revealed the components of the samples (Fig. 1c). There were two strong bands at 378.5 cm−1 and 403.3 cm−1, belonging to the typical E12g (in-plane vibrational modes) and A1g modes (out-of-plane vibration) for the S–Mo bonds in MoS2, respectively. Another two bands at 1358.2 cm−1 (D band) and 1586.1 cm−1 (G band) were assigned to disordered carbon and vibration of sp2 carbon, respectively. The strong D band indicated the amorphous property of the carbon, providing more defect sites for the Na+/K+ reaction. The element oxidation states in MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 were also probed. We found that the involved Mo, S, C, N could be detected (Fig. S1, ESI†). The high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 1d) suggested that the peaks at 228.8, 232.1, 232.7 and 235.9 eV corresponded to Mo4+ 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2, Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2, respectively, while another peak at 226.1 was assigned to S 2s. The existence of Mo6+ was ascribed to the surface oxidation of the MoS2. For S 2p, two distinct peaks at 161.6 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.9 eV (S 2p1/2) confirmed the existence of S2− to form metal–S bonds. Another peak at 164.2 eV belonged to the S–C bond, demonstrating the strong interaction between MoS2 and carbon.\nThe structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2). We found that PPy-PMo12 and PPy-PMo12@SiO2@RF were smooth nanospheres (Fig. S2a and b ESI†). The resultant MoS2/C nanosphere had numerous nanosheets on the surface (Fig. S2c, ESI†). For MoS2/C@Void@C (Fig. S2d, ESI†), smooth nanospheres were observed owing to the carbon shell construction. Fig. 2a shows the SEM image of MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 nanospheres, and the surfaces were well covered by nanosheets. The TEM image (Fig. 2b) showed a typical yolk–shell nanosphere comprising a solid core, large inner void and stable shell. High-resolution TEM images (Fig. 2c and d) showed that the nanosheets were tightly bonded with the carbon. The lattice fringe spacings of the nanosheets in both the yolk and shell were 0.64 nm, and assigned to the (002) plane of MoS2. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images (Fig. 2e) demonstrated that Mo, S and C covered the whole yolk-shelled nanosphere, predicating the successful fabrication of MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2.\nConsidering the superiority of the MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 structure, it was used as anode material for SIBs/PIBs. Fig. 3a shows the CV curves of SIBs. There were five peaks in the first cycle. The peaks at 1.2 V and 0.95 V corresponded to the Na+ intercalation into the core and shell MoS2 interlayers to form NaxMoS2. The peak at 0.6 V was ascribed to the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers on enriched interfacial boundaries, which would lead to irreversible capacity loss and low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE). The peak at 0.38 V was assigned to the conversion reaction from NaxMoS2 to metallic Mo and NaxS. The strong peak at 0.12 V should have originated from Na+ storage in the electrode interfaces and carbon skeletons. The peaks for the subsequent four cathodic cycles moved to higher voltages owing to electrode activation. For the oxidation process, the weak peak at 0.37 V was assigned to Na+ removal from the interfaces and carbon. The peak at 1.8 V was attributed to the reversible oxidation reaction for form MoS2. Moreover, the CV curves almost overlapped from the second-to-fifth cycle, predicating its stable cycling performance. Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling was measured. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows selected discharge/charge profiles and the related dQ/dV curves. The difference of the first discharge profile was ascribed to SEI formation and electrode amorphization. Fig. 3b shows the rate performance, delivering capacities of 463.2, 433.3, 412.0, 393.2, 367.1 and 342.0 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 A g−1, respectively. High capacity retention of 73.8% could be maintained when the current increased 50-fold. The superior rate capability should have originated from the ingenious yolk–shell structure and carbon coupling, which can decrease ion-transfer distances and increase the conductivity. The cycling performance of MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 was further evaluated and compared with that of MoS2/C and MoS2/C@Void@C at 5.0 A g−1. The first discharge/charge capacities with an activation current of 50 mA g−1 were 1203.8/672.5 mA h g−1. After that, the capacity was 402 mA h g−1 in the second cycle at 5.0 A g−1, and the capacities were stable in the initial 300 cycles. After 1000 cycles, the capacity was kept at 313 mA h g−1, giving a high capacity retention of 77.9%. In contrast, MoS2/C showed high capacity in the initial cycles, which had obvious decay during cycling. Also, 213 mA h g−1 was achieved after 1000 cycles, giving a capacity retention of 48.5%. MoS2/C@Void@C showed a low capacity of 240 mA h g−1 in the second cycle with high capacity retention of 77.8%, benefiting from the yolk–shell structure and carbon protection. Consequently, the carbon shell could stabilize the cycling performance, while the outer MoS2 layer could increase the reaction activity for Na+ storage. The MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2//Na3V2(PO4)3@C full cell also showed impressive electrochemical performance (Fig. S5 ESI†).\nIn view of the superiority of MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 in SIBs, it was further studied as anode material in PIBs. The first CV curve (Fig. 3d) showed three obvious peaks. The peaks above 0.5 V were assigned to K+ intercalation into MoSe2 layers to form KxMoSe2, accompanied by the formation of SEI layers. The peak at 0.26 V was related to the conversion from KxMoSe2 to metallic Mo. In the subsequent anodic process, the weak peak between 1.5 and 2.5 V was related to the reversible formation of MoSe2. The curves in the following cycles almost overlapped. The selected voltage profiles and dQ/dV curves are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and gave similar results to the CV. The rate performance was measured at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1, delivering capacities of 486.1, 430.3, 385.4, 336.5 and 287.1 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 3e). When the current returned to 0.2 A g−1, the capacity could recover almost to the initial capacity of 470.5 mA h g−1, revealing a good rate capability. Meanwhile, its cycling performance was compared with that of MoS2/C and MoS2/C@Void@C at 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. 3f). MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 delivered first discharge/charge capacities of 1003.4/573.1 mA h g−1 with an activated current of 50 mA g−1, producing an ICE of 57.1%. MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 showed higher capacities than those for the MoS2/C and MoS2/C@Void@C over the whole cycling at 1.0 A g−1. It showed capacity of 503.5 mA h g−1 in the second cycle and 326.9 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles, which were higher than those for MoS2/C (356.0 mA h g−1 and 239.7 mA h g−1) and MoS2/C@Void@C (369.2 mA h g−1 and 239.7 mA h g−1). These data demonstrated that MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 also possessed superior cycling and rate performance in PIBs owing to the synergistic effect of the carbon@MoSe2 shell and large voids in the yolk–shell structure.\nTo explore the underlying promotion of the high-rate Na+/K+ storage capability, kinetic properties were performed through capacity contribution analysis, and comparison of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Attributed to enriched interfacial boundaries, the charge storage was contributed by both faradaic and pseudocapacitive processes. According to the analysis of CV curves with different scan rates of the MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 anode, the capacity contribution could be separated (Fig. S6, ESI†). The capacitive contribution gradually increased along with an increase in the scan rate, and could reach 93% at 1.0 mV s−1 from 82% at 0.2 mV s−1. These data revealed the high-rate sodium capability to be mainly promoted by the capacitive behaviour. Similarly, the superior high-rate K+-storage capability was also dominated by the capacitive contribution (Fig. S7, ESI†). Moreover, the enhanced reaction kinetics of MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 were confirmed by EIS and GITT. Fig. 4a and b show the Nyquist plots for SIBs and PIBs, which had similar shapes. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 anode in the semicircle region was the lowest among the three electro des both in SIBs and PIBs, implying its higher ionic conductivity. Solid-state diffusion of Na+/K+ (DNa/DK) also affected the reaction kinetics, and the GITT could be used to determine the DNa and DK values in the whole charging/discharging process. Based on Fick's second law, it became obvious that MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 had higher DNa and DK values (Fig. S8, ESI†). These data suggested that the yolk–shell structure with a C@MoS2 shell could boost the reaction kinetics for Na+/K+. DFT calculations were further performed to reveal the diffusion energy barrier (Eb) of Na+ and K+ across C and C@MoS2 shells. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used to calculate the diffusion path and Eb of Na+ and K+. The optimized Na+ and K+ diffusion paths are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Obviously, the Eb of 0.034 eV for Na+ and 0.013 eV for K+ across the C@MoS2 shell was lower than those for the C shell. This finding suggested that introduction of MoS2 on the carbon shell could reduce the Eb and, thus, facilitate the diffusion of Na+ and K+, resulting into improved reaction kinetics and activity.\nIn summary, yolk-shelled MoS2/C@Void@C@MoS2 was synthesized and demonstrated to be superior anode material for SIBs and PIBs. This interesting structure could effectively buffer volume changes, facilitate Na+/K+ diffusion and fast charge transfer. These features could increase conductivity and DNa/DK values, and decrease the Eb of Na+/K+, achieving superior high-rate performance in SIBs/PIBs. This work illustrates the importance of the yolk–shell structure and shell design, opening up a way to construct advanced anode materials for SIBs/PIBs.\nMang Niu: methodology, investigation, and writing (original draft, review and editing).

Introduction\nWith the rapid pace of industrialization, the demand for mechanical systems with higher energy supply standards continues to grow, while fossil fuels are concerning owing to their non-renewable nature and significant environmental impact. This highlights the urgent need for alternative energy storage solutions, such as supercapacitors and rechargeable ion batteries. Among them, electrochemical energy storage technology stands out as a promising option owing to its stability, safety, high energy density and portability. Hence, the development of high-performance energy storage systems has gained critical importance across diverse applications.\nResearch on electrochemical energy storage technologies has primarily focused on secondary batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), alkali metal batteries (AMBs), and lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), along with metal–air batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). Despite the widespread adoption of LIBs in daily life and industrial sectors, the limited availability of lithium resources presents significant challenges in meeting the future demands for large-scale production and consumption. In contrast, sodium, being abundant and cost-effective, has emerged as a promising alternative. Moreover, the chemical similarities between sodium and lithium enable analogous operational principles between SIBs and LIBs, enabling the transfer of design concepts and production infrastructure from LIBs, thereby substantially reducing the production cost of SIBs and accelerating commercialization. As one of the promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries exhibit the lower cost and superior performance. However, SIBs face several technical challenges due to kinetic constraints during sodium ion intercalation into commercial graphite anodes in comparison with Li, prompting intensive research into high-capacity, stable electrode materials. The present research on anode materials for SIBs mainly focuses on carbon materials, alloy materials, metal oxides (MOs) and metal sulfides (MSs). Among them, carbon materials offer the highest conductivity and simple preparation methods. However, they suffer from poor dispersibility, leading to aggregation during synthesis and composite formation with other materials. Alloy materials offer high capacity but suffer from significant volume expansion during cycling, which compromises cycling stability and safety. In contrast, MSs have attracted considerable attention due to the balance among capacity, conductivity, and redox properties. The bond of M–S in MSs is weaker than that of M–O in MOs, which is kinetically favorable for conversion reactions. Additionally, the reaction products of MSs, such as Na2S, offer better conductivity than metal oxides (Na2O), which is more favorable for electrochemical reactions from a kinetic standpoint. Sodium storage in MSs involves a combination of the insertion, conversion and alloying reactions. However, this process is often accompanied by pulverization and detachment of the active materials, as well as volumetric expansion, leading to reduced cycling stability and capacity degradation. To address these issues, researchers have explored strategies such as rational structural design, material compositing, and elemental doping to enhance the sodium storage capacity of MSs.\nIn this review, a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in MSs as anodes for SIBs, focusing on iron sulfides, tin sulfides, cobalt sulfides and other metal sulfides (Fig. 1), is provided. The synthesis methods, reaction mechanisms of MSs, and performance enhancement strategies are detailed, followed by conclusions and perspectives on the development of MSs, with the aim of guiding the design of structurally optimized, high-performance MS anodes for next-generation SIBs.\n\n\n2. Synthetic strategies for nanostructured MSs\nThe synthesis methods for MSs mainly include hydrothermal/solvothermal and calcination. By modulating synthesis conditions (such as temperature, reaction time, and solution), diverse nanostructures, including microspheres, nanotubes, and core-shell structures can be obtained. These morphological designs play a pivotal role in enhancing the surface area of the materials and providing more active sites for Na+ storage. Additionally, hollow structures can provide buffer space for active materials, mitigating capacity degradation caused by volume expansion during cycling. The nanoflower morphology endorses the material with a larger specific surface area and provides more active sites of Na+, which in turn facilitates improved cycle reversibility. In contrast, the microsphere morphology offers a larger specific surface area and provides a certain structural stability, which is beneficial to maintain structural stability during the cycle and contributes to improved cycle performance. Studies have demonstrated that elemental doping and materials composite strategies can effectively enable the formation of heterojunctions. The heterojunctions formed between materials with different band gaps facilitate the creation of stable electron transport channels, which in turn enhances electron conductivity. The integration leads to synergistic effects where the overall performance of the composites surpasses the individual contributions of each component.\n\n2.1. Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods\nHydrothermal and solvothermal methods are the most widely used techniques for synthesizing metal sulfides. These methods facilitate the formation of uniform and stable crystal structures, and support the growth of MSs on various substrates, such as carbon cloth and copper foil (Fig. 2). During synthesis, metal ion precursors (e.g., FeCl3·6H2O, ZnCl2, and SbCl5) and sulfur sources (e.g., sulfur powder, thiourea, and thioacetamide) are typically dissolved in solvents, including deionized water, ethanol, and DMF. The choice of solvent, reaction temperature, and duration significantly influence the morphology and properties of the synthesized MSs. In the previous reports, various nanostructures of metal sulfides have been successfully synthesized using these approaches, including 1T-Ni–MoS2 nanoflowers and FeS2 microspheres.\nFor instance, 1T-MoS2 exhibits enhanced conductivity and larger interlayer spacing compared to 2H-MoS2, which facilitates the rapid diffusion of Na+. However, the structural stability of 1T-MoS2 presents challenges during synthesis. Zhang et al. addressed this issue by developing a novel one-step hydrothermal method to induce the phase transition from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2. The team successfully synthesized 1T-Ni–MoS2 nanoflowers (Fig. 3a) by incorporating nickel, which modifies the electronic configuration of Mo 4d orbitals, thereby stabilizing the 1T phase. The resulting 1T-Ni–MoS2 exhibits characteristic nanoflower morphology (Fig. 3b and c) with improved capacity performance. Huang et al. fabricated Co3S4@NiS2 heterostructures by in situ growth of NiS2 on CoS spheres, as shown in Fig. 3d. CoS precursors were synthesized using a one-step solvothermal method, followed by an in situ growth of Ni-MOFs on the CoS precursors to obtain CoS@Ni-MOFs. Subsequent annealing results in the formation of the Co3S4@NiS2 heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 3e, the SEM image of Co3S4@NiS2/C reveals a surface that is rich in nanostructures, while the MOF-derived heterostructure introduces additional active sites for Na+ reactions, significantly enhancing the electrochemical activity. Wang et al. synthesized MoS2 precursors via a hydrothermal process and controlled the aggregation of Sn4+ on the MoS2 surface using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Fig. 3f). This step ensures tight encapsulation of MoS2 by Sn4+ before reacting with thioacetamide (TAA). The subsequent hydrothermal reaction leads to the formation of closely packed SnS2 nanospheres (Fig. 3g). TEM images (Fig. 3h) confirmed the presence of the characteristic crystal facets of MoS2 and SnS2, along with the existence of a heterostructure.\n\n2.2. Calcination methods\nCompared to hydrothermal and solvothermal methods, calcination requires higher temperatures and must be performed in a protective atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen or argon) to prevent oxidation and the formation of metal oxides, making the preparation process more complex. During calcination, sulfurization can occur either through the sublimation of sulfur powder or the intrinsic sulfurization of the precursor. Additionally, precursors compounded with other substances may undergo transformations during annealing. For example, carbon-based precursors can evolve into amorphous carbon, facilitating the formation of various structures (e.g., carbon shells, carbon fiber networks, or carbon cloths) that encapsulate composite materials. This encapsulation enhances electrical conductivity and improves the structural stability of the resulting materials. Yu et al. addressed the challenge of poor electrical conductivity and cycling stability in MoO3 as an anode for SIBs by synthesizing MoOx-MoS2 heterostructures. Nanorod-shaped MoO3 (MO) was prepared via hydrothermal reaction, followed by vapor-phase deposition of sulfur derived from thiourea, leading to sulfidation (Fig. 4a). At high temperatures, thiourea decomposition generated H2S gas adsorbed onto the MO surface. Subsequently, S2− ions gradually replaced O2− ions, converting MoO3 into MoS2 while facilitating internal restructuring. The post-annealing process preserved the nanorod morphology (Fig. 4b), significantly enhancing the specific surface area and electrolyte wettability and ensuring uniform stress distribution. TEM images (Fig. 4c) confirmed the coexistence of MoO3 and MoS2 lattice fringes, validating the presence of the heterostructure. Dong et al. synthesized potato chip-shaped nitrogen-doped carbon-coated ZnS/Sb2S3 heterojunctions (ZnS/Sb2S3@NC) through sulfidation and subsequent metal cation exchange between Zn2+ and Sb3+ (Fig. 4d). The unique potato chip-shaped structure ZnS/Sb2S3@NC allowed efficient electron and ion transport within the material (Fig. 4e and f), demonstrating its potential for high-performance SIB anodes.\nAnnealing temperature plays a critical role in determining nanostructures. Lower temperatures tend to reduce crystallinity, increase the proportion of the amorphous phase, and elongate the Na+ diffusion pathways, slowing down kinetic processes. In contrast, higher temperatures can disrupt engineered nanostructures, negatively affecting Na+ storage performance. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the effect of annealing temperature on crystallinity without compromising the integrity of the nanostructures. Gao et al. systematically investigated SnS2 nanosheets on Zn-, N-, and S-doped carbon frameworks (SnS2@ZnNS) at three distinct temperatures (300, 350 and 400 °C) to evaluate the morphological and electrochemical characteristics of the resulting materials (Fig. 4g). The results show that excessively high temperatures (400 °C) cause significant damage to the nanosheet structures, while structures remain intact at 300 °C and 350 °C (Fig. 4h–j). These findings offer valuable insights into selecting appropriate calcination temperatures that balance crystallinity with structural preservation to achieve superior Na+ storage performance.\n\n2.3. Other methods\nBeyond the widely used hydrothermal, solvothermal, and calcination techniques, other novel synthesis approaches have emerged, offering new possibilities for the design of high-performance MS anodes for SIBs. For example, electrospinning technology can be used to fabricate MS anodes for sodium-ion batteries. This enables the formation of three-dimensional network architectures, which effectively shorten the sodium ion transport pathways and increase the number of available reactive sites. In the process of electrospinning, fibers with different morphologies, diameters and pore sizes can be obtained by controlling various spinning solution parameters (e.g., concentration, molecular weight and viscosity), the setting of spinning parameters (e.g., voltage and spinning distance), environment (temperature and humidity) and equipment (needle aperture, nozzle). Notably, temperature and humidity are crucial factors and typically require consistent control under constant conditions to ensure optimal fiber formation. In a previous study, a three-dimensional network structure was constructed using electrospinning, followed by coating with polydopamine (PDA), and subsequent carbonization and sulfidation. This approach yielded MOF-SnSx/NC@N-doped carbon nanofibers embedded within a bean pod-shaped hollow framework. As illustrated in Fig. 5a and b, the interconnected carbon fiber network enhances ion and electron transport, while Sn-MOF serves as a sacrificial template for dopamine polymerization, creating hollow intermediates and preserving tin components. After sulfidation, SnSx/NC nanoparticles are integrated into the three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers, forming a distinctive bean pod-shaped hollow structure (Fig. 5c). This unique architecture offers a buffering space to accommodate SnS expansion during cycling, providing significant advantages in enhancing the performance of electrode materials, particularly in terms of high-rate capacity and long cycle life. Gao et al. designed MoS2@CoS2 heterostructure tube-in-tube hollow nanofibers through a simple electrospinning, pyrolysis, and sulfidation process. The sequential crystallization of MoO3 and Co3O4 at different temperatures leads to tube-in-tube structures (Fig. 5d and e) with optimized interstitial spaces and abundant MoS2@CoS2 heterointerfaces (Fig. 5f). These features effectively mitigate volume changes during reactions and enhance electrolyte permeation. With the diversification of research methodologies and the continued exploration of nanoscale phenomena, the study of MSs as anode materials for SIBs has gained increasing prominence. Future efforts are expected to focus on structure optimization and further performance improvement.\nDifferent synthesis methods allow for the creation of MSs with optimized structures and properties. A performance comparison of MSs synthesized by different methods is presented in Table 1. Typically, heterostructures can be prepared using the hydrothermal/solvothermal method, and the construction of such heterogeneous structures contributes to enhanced cycle performance. MSs synthesized using the calcination method possess higher crystallinity, which results in improved conductivity and excellent rate performance. The electrospinning method enables the formation of MSs with a three-dimensional cross-linked structure, which is associated with superior cycle stability.\n\n\n3. MS anodes in SIBs\n\n3.1. Iron sulfides\nIron sulfides, such as FeS2 (894 mAh g−1), FeS (609 mAh g−1), and Fe7S8 (663 mAh g−1), are notable for their high theoretical capacities, abundance, and non-toxic nature, making them attractive for diverse applications for the energy storage system. Liu et al. designed a Fe3O4/Fe/FeS triple-phase heterogeneous structure with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube scaffolds (FHNCS) using a modified MIL-88B template, catalytic growth and sulfidation as shown in Fig. 6a. The lamellar stacked MIL-88B (Fe) template (Fig. 6b) facilitated Fe catalysis in an N2/H2 atmosphere, which promoted the growth of interconnected Fe3O4Fe/FeS heterojunctions on the carbon nanotube scaffold (Fig. 6c). This structure, characterized by iron nanoparticle nodes, provided additional active sites for sodium ions, reduced diffusion distances and mitigated volume expansion. Furthermore, the scaffold forms a three-dimensional network (Fig. 6d) that enhances electron diffusion along the interfaces, thereby improving conductivity and, consequently, improving cycling stability and capacity. Cai et al. synthesized Fe7S8/FeS2 multiphase materials in situ on hollow carbon nanotubes (NHCFs-Fe7S8/FeS2) by modulating the oxidation states of iron-based sulfides. The intrinsic electric field generated by distinct band gaps between Fe7S8 and FeS2 disrupted the accumulation of charges at the material interfaces and enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics (Fig. 6e and f). Additionally, Gibbs free energy differences between the two phases create Na+ concentration gradients during charging, driving an electric field that promotes Na+ diffusion. The resulting composite electrode demonstrates a high capacity and excellent rate performance, retaining a capacity of 268.8 mAh g−1 even at a high current density of 100 A g−1 (Fig. 6g and h), which addresses the importance of internal electric fields in optimizing diffusion kinetics and electrochemical performance improvement.\n\n3.2. Tin sulfides\nTin sulfides (SnS and SnS2) have drawn attention owing to their cadmium iodide (CdI2) type layered structure, which offers a large interlayer spacing and high theoretical capacity, resulting from transformation-alloying reactions. However, significant volumetric expansion during cycling limits their stability. To address these issues, structural design improvements and material modification are explored. For example, the carbon coating technique is widely used to reduce volumetric expansion in energy storage materials. Cheng et al. developed SnS quantum dots embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (SnS QDs@NCF) using lithium azide (LiN3). The repulsive forces generated during the thermal decomposition of LiN3 suppressed the agglomeration of SnS, allowing sulfur to penetrate the nanofibers and form SnS quantum dots while SnS remained on the fiber surface in the absence of LiN3 (Fig. 7a1–a3 and b1–b3). Finite element analysis reveals that SnS embedded within the fibers experiences reduced stress, which enhanced cycling stability, retaining a specific capacity of 422.3 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1 (Fig. 7c). After 5800 cycles at 2 A g−1, the electrodes demonstrated a discharge capacity of 484.6 mAh g−1, and after 7880 cycles at 10 A g−1, they demonstrated a discharge capacity of 430.9 mAh g−1 (Fig. 7d). Yin et al. synthesized carbon-coated SnS nanotubes (CN/SnS) with tightly woven cloth for robust encapsulation (Fig. 7e), achieving a reversible capacity of 298.2 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 in SIBs. Yang et al. constructed a cubic heterostructure of C@SnS2/SnS@C by controlling the calcination temperature to modulate the phase transition between SnS and SnS2. This structure integrated SnS and polypyrrole (PPy) encapsulation, effectively mitigating volumetric expansion and enhancing cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 502.5 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles and a minimal capacity decay rate of only 0.035% per cycle (Fig. 7f). In situ XRD analysis indicated that SnS2 and SnS undergo sequential conversion to generate elemental Sn and Na2S, followed by alloying reactions at low potentials to form Na15Sn4 (Fig. 7g–i). Binders in traditional electrode fabrication processes may compromise the energy density of batteries. Therefore, the development of integrated self-supporting electrodes has emerged. Wang et al. developed a self-supporting MXene/SnS2@NCFs film using Aspergillus niger spores as a carbon source to anchor SnS2, while MXene serves as a binder to produce a self-supporting film through vacuum filtration. The resulting MXene/SnS2@NCFs film effectively mitigated the self-aggregation of MXene and showed outstanding flexibility (Fig. 7j). Structural characterization revealed that SnS2 nanoparticles are encapsulated between MXene layers, with distinct lattice distributions (Fig. 7k and l). The MXene/SnS2@NCF electrode demonstrated excellent cycling stability, maintaining a specific capacity of 435.0 mAh g−1 with 71.3% retaining after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 7m).\n\n3.3. Cobalt sulfides\nCobalt-sulfides, such as Co9S8 and CoS, are considered promising materials owing to their multi-phase structure and impressive specific capacity. However, volumetric expansion commonly exists among cobalt sulfides during their practical application. To address these issues, various strategies have been explored. Li et al. developed a hybrid material comprising Co9S8−x, nitrogen-doped carbon foam, and Co nanoparticles (Co9S8−X@Co-NC) (Fig. 8a). The rich porous structure provides additional reactive sites, while the built-in electric field created by the Mott–Schottky-like heterojunction facilitates charge transfer between the active material and the conductive nitrogen-doped carbon scaffold during cycling. The dQ/dV curves at varying current densities (Fig. 8b) demonstrated only a slight peak shift (0.046 V) with increasing current density, indicating its outstanding tolerance at high current densities. The materials achieved capacities of 472.2 and 311.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Zeng et al. developed a Co9S8/CoS wrapped in nitrogen-doped carbon (Co9S8/CoS@NC) using precipitation and thermal treatment (Fig. 8c). The carbon layer enhanced conductivity and protected the active material (Fig. 8d and e), offering a versatile strategy for MS fabrication. Chen et al. developed a dual-purpose strategy to precisely control the phase transitions by combining ultrafine Co1−xS–CoS2 heterostructured particles with S-doped carbon nanofibers. The resulting Co1−xS–CoS2 (Fig. 8f) exhibits a heterostructure consisting of a yolk-like configuration with nanoscale active material encased within a carbon shell (Fig. 8g). This structure enhances cycling stability and shortens the sodium ion diffusion pathway, exhibiting exceptional rate performance (495.3 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and cycling stability (380.1 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles).\n\n3.4. Other sulfides\nBeyond the previously mentioned MSs, other commonly used metal sulfides for anodes include MoS2 and Sb2S3. As the most prominent two-dimensional layered metal sulfide, MoS2 possesses a relatively large interlayer spacing that is advantageous for ion intercalation. This characteristic makes MoS2 a promising candidate for SIBs. However, sodium intercalation/deintercalation in MoS2 is also accompanied by severe volumetric expansion. To mitigate this issue, several strategies have been proposed, such as expanding the interlayer spacing or combining the material with other substances to form composites. For example, Pan et al. developed a dual-enhanced layered expandable MoS2 composite by incorporating hollow nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped carbon as an internal carrier and surface-rich MXene as an external carrier. This design results in a tightly cross-linked composite (Fig. 9a). The hollow N,P co-doped carbon matrix effectively prevented the agglomeration of MoS2 layers, while the amorphous carbon component significantly increased the interlayer spacing, alleviating volumetric expansion and enhancing cycling stability. After 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1, the NPC@MoS2/MXene exhibited a maximum reversible capacity of 279 mAh g−1. Similarly, Sb2S3, an anisotropic layered material with a high theoretical capacity and moderate potential, has attracted considerable attention. However, its practical application is hindered by issues related to volumetric expansion. To overcome these limitations, the incorporation of alloy-type metal antimony (Sb) with sulfides has proven effective in improving electrochemical performance. For instance, Zhang et al. designed a novel core–shell–shell structure composite of Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C nanorods, consisting of an internal Sb2S3/Sb heterostructure core surrounded by an oxygen-deficient TiO2 shell and a conductive carbon shell (Fig. 9b and c). During the carbon thermal reduction process, the Sb2S3 nanorod core is partially reduced to metallic Sb, and the resulting oxygen vacancies generated in the reduced TiO2 significantly enhance the conductivity of Sb2S3. This unique double-shell structure effectively confines the active material, thereby alleviating volumetric expansion. The nanorods exhibited improved performance, achieving an initial coulombic efficiency of approximately 73.46% at 0.8 A g−1, with a reversible capacity of 422.6 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles. This study highlights the potential of double-shell structures in improving the energy storage performance of electrode materials. Wang et al. also synthesized a dual-confined nano-heterostructure Sb/Sb2S3@Ti3C2Tx@C using a solvothermal method combined with low-temperature thermal treatment. The MXene and carbon layers in this composite provided robust protective confinement for Sb/Sb2S3, effectively mitigating volumetric expansion. In addition, the carbon layer acted as a barrier, which prevented the oxidation of MXene and reduced side reactions by isolating the active material from direct contact with the electrolyte, thus improving cycling stability. After 2500 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g−1, the composite achieved a reversible capacity of 250 mAh g−1 (Fig. 9e). This work gives insight into the innovative structural design for advancing electrode material performance. A comprehensive comparison of the electrochemical performance of representative MSs in SIBs is presented in Table 2, offering a comprehensive perspective on their capabilities and advancements.\n\n\n4. Summary and perspectives\nIn this review, recent advances in various synthesis approaches and MS anodes for SIBs are comprehensively summarized. Although MSs exhibit significant potential due to their affordability, high theoretical capacities, and excellent electrochemical properties, challenges such as limited cycling lifespan and low current density have persisted. During the charging and discharging processes, MSs experience significant volume expansion, adversely affecting cycling stability. Additionally, side reactions with copper current collectors and ester-based electrolytes lead to capacity loss. To address these issues, rational structural regulation and design are required. Strategies such as nano nano-buffer structure design, favorable element doping, and heterostructure engineering are proposed. These strategies can increase the specific surface area, provide more active sites, reduce stress variations during conversion reactions, prevent fragmentation and detachment, increase the electrode–electrolyte contact area, optimize ion and electron diffusion pathways or improve the conductivity of the MS anodes, and consequently contribute to capacity improvement. To fully achieve the potential of MS-based anodes for SIBS, a few perspectives are proposed.\ni) Cost-effective synthesis: current synthesis methods for MSs, such as hydrothermal and calcination techniques, are typically expensive and have low yields, significantly limiting their commercial viability. Developing scalable, cost-efficient synthesis routes is critical to advance the practical applications of SIBs.\nii) Mechanistic insights: despite significant advancements in the structural and interfacial design of MSs and their composites, the mechanisms driving interfacial coupling and performance enhancement remain insufficiently understood. High-precision characterization techniques, coupled with theoretical modeling, are essential for uncovering the underlying principles and guiding material optimization.\niii) System integration: the development of anode materials cannot proceed in isolation, while their compatibility with other components of Sibs, including electrolyte and cathode materials, must be considered to identify overall system configurations and device performance.\nIn conclusion, MSs show significant promise as anode materials in SIBs. This review highlights various MS anode materials for SIBs from the perspectives of synthesis approaches and modifications while addressing existing challenges. With continued research and innovation, MSs are expected to emerge as a key solution to the anode of MSs by addressing future energy challenges.\n\n\nData availability\nThe data supporting the findings of this study are available from the authors upon reasonable request.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nZhilong Yan: writing-original draft.

Compared with pristine graphite, the Derjaguin–Müller–Toporov (DMT) modulus of cycled graphite is significantly reduced (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating that the surface of graphite is covered with a low-modulus interphase after cycling. As shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), the force–displacement curve of diglyme-derived SEI on the cycled graphite response as an elastic region without fracture behavior. To further quantify the difference, Young's modulus of SEI on cycled graphite was calculated and it was found to be 652 MPa, far lower than that of pristine graphite (7043 MPa).\nAfter confirming the existence of SEI preliminarily, the capacity loss and CE change of graphite anodes after calendar aging were measured to quantify the solvated Na+ loss and SEI evolution in 1 M NaPF6 diglyme. It is worth noting that the graphite electrodes were fabricated without conductive agents (high surface area carbon black) to eliminate the interference of the electrochemically active area on the analysis. Before the aging protocol, the Na‖graphite half cells were pre-cycled for 10 times until the CE was over 95% (Fig. S3, ESI†), aiming to stabilize the ether-derived SEI. After that, the graphite anodes starting from SOC100 and SOC60 were stored at an open circuit for 300 hours of aging, respectively. During the 300 h storage, the graphite anodes at these two states undergo disparate potential ranges and phase transition (Fig. 1a). The graphite anode at SOC100 obtained a voltage uplift from 0.01 V to 0.72 V in the voltage plateau region, while that at SOC60 realized a potential increase from 0.6 V (plateau region) to 1.03 V in the slope region. Actually, the transition of low-staged ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs) mainly occurs at the plateau region, and the slope region is dominated by high-staged t-GICs. Thus, the SEI evolution during different phase transitions was unveiled through this simple SOC setup, which will be discussed later. Afterwards, the graphite anodes were completely desodiated and then cycling was restarted again. The charge capacity before and after storage is monitored to determine the capacity loss, and the SEI stability is evaluated by CE change synchronously (detailed parameters are available in Fig. S4, ESI†).\nAccording to the mechanism of calendar aging in lithium‖graphite batteries, the capacity loss of graphite at SOC100 would be more than that at SOC60 owing to severe electrolyte reduction induced by a stronger thermodynamic driving force. However, the result is the opposite in low-concentrated ether-based sodium‖graphite batteries. After the storage aging process, the capacity loss of graphite at SOC60 is as high as 60%, while that at SOC100 is 36% (Fig. 1b). Similar anomalies are also reflected in the change of CE at different SOCs (Fig. 2c). The CE of graphite at SOC60 decreased after aging indicating that the SEI may be damaged in the aging process. This is also illustrated by the fact that the CE of the second cycle after aging returned to its original level. In contrast to this, graphite at SOC100 showed an increase in CE after aging, corresponding to the growth of SEI. Furthermore, besides the SEI growth mechanism in lithium‖graphite systems, another reported cause of capacity loss during calendar aging is SEI dissolution. To investigate the possible influence of SEI dissolution on calendar aging, we measured the aging of cells with a less volume of electrolyte, which could mitigate SEI dissolution. However, after the electrolyte volume is reduced from 90 μl to 40 μl, the changes in capacity loss and CE in graphite at SOC100 after 300 h of aging are almost negligible (Fig. 1d and e). Thus, it can be concluded that under the condition of solvent-involved intercalation, the abnormal calendar aging of graphite anodes at targeted SOCs is not influenced by SEI dissolution.\nWe further age the cells under a variety of factors that affect the parasitic reaction of electrolytes, including ambient temperature, specific surface area of the anode and storage time (Fig. S5, ESI†). A high ambient temperature shows a strongly detrimental effect on capacity loss and CE. When the cell is aged at 55 °C, the capacity loss of the graphite anode increases to 94% (Fig. 1f) and inferior CE degradation appears (Fig. 1g). We also found the abnormal polarization in potential curves and a roughly aged graphite electrode after aging at a high temperature (Fig. S6, ESI†), which is different from other factors (Fig. S7, ESI†). This result may be related to the drastic electrolyte reduction under high temperatures, which causes interfacial destruction. The nanostructured design of carbonaceous anode is generally considered to enhance the kinetics, while a large electrochemically active area would accelerate electrolyte decomposition. Few-layer graphitic carbon (FGC) exhibits an increased capacity loss to 90% after 300 h of storage because of the high specific surface area (Fig. S8, ESI†). Moreover, as the storage time is extended, continuous capacity loss of aged cells was found in both FGC and graphite (Fig. 1h), and the more rapid loss is shown in FGC. This result provides another view for limiting the specific surface area of anode materials.\nTo elaborate on storage-induced intercalation compound degradation, we collected X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the graphite anodes at targeted SOCs before and after aging (Fig. 2a and b). The graphite at SOC100 forms typical stage 1 t-GICs, and the three characteristic peaks at 15.21°, 22.87° and 30.65° are indexed as (002), (003) and (004), respectively. After 300 h of aging, graphite at SOC100 undergoes the loss of solvated Na+ inventory to generate a small amount of stage 2 t-GICs. This suggests that during calendar aging, the phase degradation of graphite at SOC100 is mainly a low-staged t-GIC transition. In contrast, graphite at SOC60 transforms from the mixture phases with stage 1 and stage 2 t-GICs to high-staged t-GICs (higher than stage 3) after storage, which are manifested as two bulges at 25.58° and 27.58° (Fig. 2b). The peak positions of different t-GICs before and after aging are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Compared with low-staged t-GICs, the patchy distribution of ions in high-staged analogues causes the carbon layer to endure greater stress. Thus, previous studies reported that reducing the presence of high-staged intercalation compounds is an optimized strategy for cycling stability of carbon anodes for potassium and sodium ion batteries. With this in mind, a possible hypothesis is proposed that severe intercalation degradation during calendar aging would explain the inferior capacity loss and CE of graphite at SOC60.\nTo quantify the volume change determined by intercalation degradation, the cross-sectional views of graphite anodes at targeted SOCs are captured. All sodiated graphite electrodes show obvious shrinkage and void disappearance after calendar aging. Compared to the homogeneous shrinkage at SOC100 (Fig. 2c and e), the structural fluctuation of graphite at SOC60 is heterogeneous with pit formation after calendar aging (Fig. 2d and f). Furthermore, the observed electrode colors originated from the degradation of the intercalation phase, which is from dark blue to blue-green at SOC100 and light blue to gray at SOC60. It is worth noting that even if the color of graphite at SOC60 turns gray like unintercalated graphite, the thickness is still higher than that of the pristine graphite electrode (Fig. S9, ESI†), which is consistent with previous results of the structural rearrangement and loosened network under co-intercalation. To observe the shrinkage intuitively, we further measured the calendar aging induced change of electrode thickness. After 300 h of storage, graphite at SOC100 shrinks from 51 μm to 44 μm with a slight change of 7 μm (Fig. 2g), while that at SOC60 suffers from violent shrinkage of nearly 16 μm (Fig. 2h). Combined with the results of intercalation degradation and volume shrinkage during storage, graphite at SOC100 undergoes the low-staged t-GIC transition with slight and uniform structural fluctuation, while that at SOC60 generates large and inhomogeneous strain deformation caused by the formation of high-staged t-GICs.\nThe CE value is generally associated with the stability of SEI, wherein a high CE condition shows a passivating SEI and a decreasing CE is attributed to interphase damage. Thus, we investigate the SEI evolution of graphite at these two SOCs to verify the hypothesis that storage-induced intercalation degradation affects CE deterioration. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely performed to describe SEI evolution and quantify its ionic conductivity. Owing to the small impedance of an Na‖Na symmetrical cell after aging (Fig. S10, ESI†), the Na‖graphite half-cell configuration is applied to test the interfacial resistance. The processes of solvated Na+ diffusion across SEI and charge transfer have similar time constants (τ), resulting in a coupled semicircle response in Nyquist plots (Fig. S11, ESI†). Herein, the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) is used to decouple interfacial resistance (RSEI), and the τ peak at 10−5 to 10−3 s is assigned to ion transport through the SEI layer. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, with the extension of storage time, graphite at targeted SOCs shows the disparate trends of RSEI. At SOC100, the τ peak of RSEI clearly increases and shifts rightward (Fig. 3a), resulting from the continuous decomposition of the electrolyte. By contrast, the complicated τ peak change is found in graphite at SOC60. At the initial aging stage, the peaks of graphite at SOC60 show a similar increasing trend with the SOC100 one, while a slight decrease occurred once the storage time was over 200 h (Fig. 3b). According to the frequency response range (high frequency) of RSEI divided by DRT, we further quantified the trend of interfacial resistance during calendar aging via Randles circuit model fitting, as shown in Fig. S11c (ESI†). Three independent cells are evaluated to verify the repeatability of the above trends, as shown in Fig. 3c. These results suggest that, unlike the growth mechanism in graphite at SOC100, the interphase evolution of graphite at SOC60 is dominated by SEI growth at initial storage and then followed by SEI breakage, corresponding to the abnormal CE change.\nHRTEM images of storage-induced SEI evolution on graphite further confirm the discrepancy of resistance trends at targeted SOCs. A representative image of graphite with homogeneous and amorphous interphase is observed benefiting from the pre-cycled protocol (Fig. 3d and e). This thin and compact SEI below 10 nm is consistent with the previous reports of this system. After graphite at SOC100 is aged for 300 h, the observed thickness of compact SEI increases noticeably, which validates the SEI growth (Fig. 3f). For aged SOC60 graphite, we note the irregular SEI feature (Fig. 3g), demonstrating the co-existence of SEI growth and destruction during storage. These observations are also supported by the above resistance behaviors in EIS measurements. Collectively, graphite exhibits larger impedance and SEI growth after storage, which is driven by the electrolyte reduction at a low potential. However, the compact SEI on the graphite at SOC60 failed into thick and rough after calendar aging. This unanticipated result coincides with the transition of heterogeneous intercalation compounds during calendar aging, where the formation of high-staged t-GICs in the aged SOC60 causes pronounced volume shrinkage. Thus, we determined that the abnormal SOC-dependent calendar aging is related to the destructive effect of intercalation degradation on aged SEI.\nThe composition and chemistry of calendar aging induced SEI are analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Fig. 4a–d), including the evolution of growth and destruction. Considering the interference of the XPS signal by solvent-involved intercalation, we terminated all cells at desodiated states (2 V) to eliminate artifacts from the co-intercalated solvent. Besides the graphitic carbon (g-C) peaks at 284 eV and C–C/C–H at 284.8 eV, C 1s peaks of cycled graphite (Fig. 4a and c) are mainly dominated by C–O–Na (285.7 eV) and C–O–C (287.2 eV) compared with pristine graphite (Fig. S12, ESI†), which are those of sodium alkoxides produced by the decomposition of ethers. Furthermore, F 1s peaks (Fig. 4b and d) are fitted to P–F (688.1 eV) and Na–F (684.9 eV), corresponding to NaxPFy and NaF generated from NaPF6 reduction, respectively. Therefore, the SEI formed on graphite primarily consists of organic compounds such as alkoxides, with a minor presence of inorganic components such as NaF, Na2O, Na2CO3, and NaxPFy (Fig. 4h and Fig. S13–S15, ESI†). This organic-rich SEI is attributed to the repulsion of anions in the Helmholtz layer due to the negative potential at the graphite anode according to previous research on lithium systems.\nThe aged evolution of SEI chemistry is investigated by the relative intensities between the SEI component and graphitic carbon in the C 1s peaks. After aging, the C–O–Na peak exhibits an obvious increase at SOC100 and a reduced trend at SOC60, corresponding to the thickening SEI and SEI breakage, respectively. In addition, there is a minor intensity adjustment of inorganic NaF after aging, and the intensity change of the P–F bond displays similar fluctuations as that of C–O–Na (Fig. 4b and d). The aged electrodes were subjected to cycling to further elucidate the impact of calendar aging on SEI. The intensities of C 1s and F 1s peaks show almost no change after the subsequent cycle for aged graphite at SOC100 (Fig. 4a and c), indicating that there is no continued electrolyte decomposition for SEI repair. That is why a CE improvement after aging is observed in Fig. 1c. However, a significant increase of C–O–Na peaks in the aged SOC60 graphite with subsequent cycle suggests restoration of damaged SEI, which corresponds to CE degradation. Therefore, the storage-induced SEI component analysis reveals that the growth of SEI on graphite at SOC100 and the destruction–rebuilding process on that at SOC60 are dominated by organic species, such as sodium alkoxides.\nSolution-phase NMR spectroscopy is an effective technology to probe the organic species of SEI with high sensitivity, making it suitable for tracking the evolution of sodium alkoxides during aging. Since the amount of diglyme-derived SEI on graphite is relatively small, several graphite electrodes (the total mass is around 45 mg) are used to collect sufficient SEI. The reacted electrodes are rinsed with DME and soaked in 0.1 M DCl D2O solution to ensure the complete extraction of SEI. The reaction products (alcohol) from conversions of sodium alkoxides in DCl solutions are used to identify organic species in SEI (Fig. S16, ESI†). In contrast to pristine 1 M NaPF6 diglyme electrolyte (Fig. 4g and Fig. S17, ESI†), two distinct sets of peaks were detected in the 1H NMR spectra of extracted SEI, including a singlet at 3.35 ppm and two multiplets at 3.57 ppm and 3.72 ppm. The singlet is CH3 in methanol (CH3OD, MeOD) and the multiplets correspond to two CH2 in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OD, MOE) as shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The SEI candidates of sodium alkoxides were identified as sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) and CH3OCH2CH2ONa, which are consistent with the density functional theory calculations in the previous literature. As shown in Fig. 4e, graphite at SOC100 delivers more MeOD and MOE after calendar aging and minor effects on SEI organic species after the following cycle, which suggests the storage-induced SEI growth. In contrast, stronger MOE and weaker MeOD peaks are simultaneously observed in the 1H NMR spectra of aged graphite at SOC60, originating from the coexistence of interphase growth and destruction (Fig. 4f). The damaged SEI is repaired during a subsequent cycle, that is, more alkoxides are identified with the 1H NMR results. Overall, the SOC dependences of calendar aging indicators, intercalation degradation and SEI evolution exhibited high consistency. Under the condition of SOC100, storage-induced SEI growth is dominated by sodium alkoxides (CH3ONa and CH3OCH2CH2ONa), and this mechanism still exists for the SOC60 graphite. Whereas, owing to the heterogeneous intercalation degradation, serious SEI destruction occurs on the aged SOC60 aggravating the capacity loss and CE decrease, which would be repaired in the following cycle.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The FB molecules are connected to HC surface by hydrogen bonding, which is attributed to the dehydration condensation between –OH of HC and –COOH of FB assisted by the dehydrating agent (Fig. 1 and Fig. S4, S5, ESI†). The FB occupies the –OH bonds that irreversibly capture sodium ions on the HC, thereby reducing the partial irreversible sodium loss at the interface. Meanwhile, fluorinated FB molecules functionally have reversible sodium storage capacity through internal structural transitions and offer extra F atoms to assist in the construction of NaF-rich SEI. Notably, the FB molecules cannot affect the bulk morphology and internal disordered carbon layer structure of the commercial HC (Fig. S6–S8, ESI†). By comparing X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectral information of HC and FHC, we demonstrated the successful complexation of FB molecules on the HC surface (Fig. S9–S11, ESI†).\nOwing to the existence of oxygen-containing functional groups and electrolyte decomposition, commercial HC has an irreversible capacity loss of ∼36.1% in the initial cycles, of which the slope capacity loss accounts for ∼26.4% (Fig. S1b, ESI†). As a comparison, the optimized FHC exhibits a low initial capacity loss of ∼10.6% and the irreversible capacity loss of the slope area is reduced to 10.5% (Fig. S3, ESI†). The elevated slope region capacity is ascribed to an internal structural shift in FB, which is demonstrated in the following section. The FB molecule occupies the unfavorable –OH site on HC, minimizing its irreversible adsorption of sodium ions in the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the FB molecule has two CO bonds for reversible sodium ion adsorption, which enhances the adsorption behavior in the slope region, thus converting the irreversible sodium loss on commercial HC into reversible sodium adsorption. Moreover, the fluorinated FB molecules provide extra F atoms to assist in the construction of NaF-rich and robust SEI (Fig. 1). An SEI, featuring thin, robust, and homogeneous compositions, can simultaneously minimize sustained reductive decomposition of the electrolyte, reduce ionic transport barriers, and strengthen cell cycling stability.\n\nStructural evolution of FB molecules\nTo clarify the structural evolution of FB molecules during the charging and discharging process, we measured FB|Na half-cells. Meanwhile, we employed an FTIR spectrometer to disentangle the structure of FB molecules in the discharged and charged states, which facilitated the elucidation of the sodium storage mechanism of FB molecules without HC intervention. Three states of the FB molecule, before cycled, discharged state and charged state, were probed separately. Fig. 2a shows the FTIR characteristic peaks of the CO bond attached to the benzene ring in the three states. The signal of the CO bond (1723 and 1690 cm−1) in the FB molecule disappears in the discharge state, indicating that the CO bond is broken during the discharge process. Subsequently, it reappears in the charged state, indicating that CO is reversibly present in the charging and discharging process, which is consistent with previous reports. The structural evolution of the benzene ring was evidenced by the FTIR signals of the C–H and CC bonds (Fig. 2b and c). The C–H diffraction peaks located at 746.5 cm−1 and 690.7 cm−1 changed in the discharged state and reemerged in the charged state. At the same time, the unique unsaturated CC bond signal on the benzene ring changed, indicating that its architecture has evolved. Differently, the characteristic peaks of the C–F bond on the FB molecule vanished in the discharged state without appearing in the charged state, which may be due to the dissociation of the easily reducible C–F bond (Fig. 2d). Tailored F is favorable to assist in the construction of NaF-rich SEI. According to the above FTIR evidence and previous studies, we propose a sodium storage mechanism for the FB molecule, as displayed in Fig. 2e. An FB molecule can theoretically store two Na+ ions through the evolution of the benzene ring and the CO bond. To further verify the sodium storage capacity of FB molecules, we performed the charge/discharge test for the FB|Na half-cell (Fig. 2f). The GCD profile of the FB|Na half-cell demonstrated the sodium storage possibilities of the FB molecule. Therefore, when the FB is grafted onto the HC, it may enhance the storage capacity of the FHC in the slope region.\n\nElectrochemical cycling\nTo justify the role of FB molecules on the HC surface, we performed electrochemical cycling of HC and FHC. At a low current density of 0.05 A g−1, HC and FHC are capable of stable servicing for 180 cycles with superior cycling stability, which is attributed to the stable structure of the HC body (Fig. 3a and Fig. S14, ESI†). Differently, FHC has a high sodium storage capacity of 325.5 mA h g−1 after cycling, while HC has 267.1 mA h g−1. The boosted capacity is contributed by the adsorption mechanism of FB molecules. Fig. 3b is the initial galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of HC and FHC. Owing to irreversible Na+ adsorption in the slope region, HC exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of 399.1 mA h g−1, but a low ICE of 71.8%, indicating that ∼112.5 mA h g−1 capacity is lost. As a comparison, FHC with a 90.0% high ICE has a reversible capacity of 335.8 mA h g−1, losing only 37.3 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, indicating that the FB molecule can reversibly adsorb Na+. Such a state can be maintained continuously throughout the calendar life of the battery (Fig. 3c and Fig. S15, ESI†). To demonstrate the cycling stability and durability of the FHC, we conducted a test of 1000 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, as displayed in Fig. 3d and Fig. S17 (ESI†). The FHC displays an impressive capacity retention of 96.7% and a reversible sodium storage capacity of 309.3 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. Fig. 3e shows the GCD profiles of the FHC from the 10th to 1000th cycles. The highly overlapping GCD curves indicate that Na+ can be reversibly stored in the plateau and slope regions.\nRate performance is a key indicator to evaluate the electrochemical behavior of a battery. Fig. 3f shows the rate performance of HC and FHC. FHC has superior rate properties than HC, especially at high current densities. When the current density is consistently raised, the FHC exhibits relatively low capacity decay and maintains a high specific capacity of ∼215.0 mA h g−1 even at 2.0 A g−1. Conversely, HC shows a large capacity fade, with only an unsatisfactory capacity of ∼85.7 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1. As the current returned to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity of FHC (∼329.0 mA h g−1) reverted to the previous level (∼331.0 mA h g−1) and continued to serve steadily for 100 cycles, showcasing superior stability. The GCD curves of FHC at different current densities are shown in Fig. 3g. The profiles of the plateau and slope regions are well maintained, indicating that the FHC is capable of stabilizing sodium storage at different rates. Furthermore, we compared the rate performance of the FHC to previously reported advanced HC-based studies, as displayed in Fig. 3h. Our work shows excellent sodium storage capacity and relatively minor capacity degradation at various current densities, revealing its competitive potential in the market. To evaluate the fast-charging capability of the FHC, we performed a cycling test on it at a high current density of 2.0 A g−1 (Fig. 3i and Fig. S18, ESI†). The FHC is capable of stable sustained servicing for 5000 cycles and retains a capacity retention rate of up to ∼70.2%, displaying remarkable durability and stability. Conversely, the sodium storage capacity of commercial HC continues to decline and ends its lifespan after 340 cycles.\n\nSEI detection\nWe attributed the above superior cycling stability and long calendar life to the formation of a robust SEI at the FHC interface. Fig. 4a and b show the TEM images of HC and FHC after 30 cycles. The commercial HC surface forms a non-uniform thickness of SEI, resulting in a spatially inhomogeneous flux of Na+. A ∼20.0 nm thick SEI implies excessive decomposition of the electrolyte at the HC surface, contributing to severe irreversible Na+ losses, which causes a continuous decline in the sodium storage capacity of the commercial HC. Conversely, a ∼5.0 nm thin, homogeneous SEI is observed on the FHC surface, which can be ascribed to the FB molecules and NaPF6 salts tailoring numerous F atoms, enabling the formation of a NaF-rich and robust SEI. To visualize the SEI surface, we employed the atomic force microscope (AFM) to probe the HC and FHC surface flatness after cycling, as shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. S20 (ESI†). After cycling, the surface of HC presented a heterogeneous morphology with uneven heights, indicating the formation of an inhomogeneous SEI layer on its surface, which is consistent with the results of the TEM test. In sharp contrast, the SEI formed on the surface of the FHC is flatter without dramatic undulations.\nTo further probe the compositional distribution in SEI, we performed elemental visualization of the FHC surface by using the time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) technique (Fig. 4d and Fig. S23, S24, ESI†). NaF− presents a high-intensity signal, indicating that the SEI formed on the FHC surface is enriched with NaF. At the same time, the relatively low composition of Na2O− is formed by solvent decomposition. Additionally, XPS depth profiling was further employed to characterize the component composition of the SEIs generated on the HC and FHC surfaces, as displayed in Fig. 4e–h and Fig S25 (ESI†). Fig. 4e and f show the XPS O 1s characteristic peaks of HC and FHC at different etching depths. Three distinct diffraction peaks located at 531.1, 532.5, and 535.6 eV are observed, which can be assigned to CO32−, C–O, and Na KLL, respectively. The intensity of the CO32− and C–O bonds in FHC progressively decreases with increasing etching depth, indicating that the content of Na2O and Na2CO3 in SEI is relatively low (Fig. 4f and Fig. S25, ESI†). Conversely, the HC surface showed strong Na2O and Na2CO3 signals (Fig. 4e and Fig. S25, ESI†). The diffraction peak intensity of the XPS F 1s was employed to probe the content of NaF in the SEI of HC and FHC, as displayed in (Fig. 4g–h). Compared to HC, the NaF signal intensity is stronger in SEI on the FHC surface, indicating that NaF-rich SEI is generated on the FHC surface, which is consistent with the results of the TOF-SIMS test. A robust, flat, and NaF-enriched SEI is conducive to minimizing electrolyte consumption, homogenizing Na+ flux, and reducing interfacial impedance, thereby dramatically improving battery cycle stability and longevity.\n\nApplication potential\nTo demonstrate the real-world potential of the optimized anode, we assembled and tested the SIBs full-cell. The SIB full-cell was coupled by employing the FHC anode and the NVP cathode (FHC|NVP full-cell). Fig. 5a describes the operating mechanism of the FHC|NVP full-cell. In the charging process, Na+ ions are released from the NVP cathode driven by the external voltage, passing through the electrolyte and embedding in the FHC anode side, while electrons are transferred from the external circuit. During the discharge process, Na+ ions are transferred from the FHC anode, through the electrolyte, to the NVP cathode, which is the opposite of the charging process.Fig. 5b presents the GCD curves of NVP|Na, FHC|NVP, and FHC|Na cells after normalized capacity. The voltage range of the FHC|NVP full-cell was set to 1.5–3.9 V to maximize its electrochemical performance. Fig. 5c is the initial GCD curves of the HC|NVP and FHC|NVP full-cells. The FHC|NVP full-cell with 91.8% ICE exhibits a high sodium storage capacity of 106.8 mA h g−1, while the HC|NVP full-cell has only 66.5% ICE. Moreover, HC|NVP and FHC|NVP full-cells were tested at 0.1 A g−1 to evaluate their durability and stability, as displayed in Fig. 5d. The FHC|NVP full-cell shows superior cycling stability and is capable of maintaining a sodium storage capacity of 100.6 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles. Conversely, the FHC|NVP full-cell presents unsatisfactory cycling stability and a continuously decaying capacity (only 45.9 mA h g−1 after 116 cycles). Owing to the limited sodium source from the NVP cathode and electrolyte in the HC|NVP full-cell, the serious sodium loss and unstable SEI at the surface of commercial HC inevitably contribute to the progressive capacity decay and low capacity retention. The GCD curves of the FHC|NVP full-cell from the 10th to 100th cycles are shown in Fig. 5e. The nearly overlapping GCD profiles indicate that the FHC|NVP full-cell is capable of stabilizing the (de)embedding of Na+. Fig. 5f is the rate performance of HC|NVP and FHC|NVP full-cells. Owing to the unstable SEI, the HC|NVP full-cell suffered uncontrollable capacity degradation and only retained ∼21.0 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1. Differently, the FHC|NVP full-cell is capable of retaining good cycling stability and sustaining a high sodium storage capacity of ∼61.4 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1, which is a three-fold improvement over the HC|NVP full-cell. Additionally, the FHC|NVP full-cell has superior capacity recoverability compared to the HC|NVP full-cell, elucidating that it preserves the electrode structure and interfacial stability during the cycling process. To verify the practical application of FHC, we employed a fully charged FHC|NVP button-type battery to light up the “NJU” sign (Fig. 5g). The assembled FHC|NVP full-cell shows tremendous commercialization potential and attractive application prospects.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Fig. 1a–d display the corresponding XRD Rietveld refinement patterns, and all the diffraction peaks could be well indexed to the rhombohedral symmetry O3-type structure (α-NaFeO2, JCPDS no. 01-082-1495) with a space group of Rm. The specific refined results are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). All the R-variance factors are within reasonable ranges, indicating the reliability of the calculated results. The comparisons of the lattice parameters among the four samples are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The a values of the NFM, SNFM, LNFM, and LSNFM samples are 2.9486, 2.9522, 2.9455, and 2.9506 Å, respectively, while the c values of the four samples are 16.3253, 16.3579, 16.2028, and 16.2188 Å, respectively. The results demonstrate that incorporating Sn4+ in Fe sites causes a left shift of the (003) diffraction peaks, resulting in an expansion of the a- and c-lattice parameters, which can be attributed to the higher bonding energy of Sn–O (528 kJ mol−1) than that of Fe–O (407 kJ mol−1) and the larger radius of Sn4+ (0.69 Å) than that of Fe3+ (0.645 Å). As shown in Fig. 1e, the (003) diffraction peak shifts to a higher degree after Li substitution, leading to the contraction of the c-lattice parameter, because of the increased electrostatic attraction to the neighboring oxygen layers and reduced electrostatic repulsion among oxygen anions in the NaO2 layer, consistent with the calculated results shown in Fig. 1f. The lengths of Mn–O bonds and distances of Na+ layers from Rietveld refinement results are displayed in Table S3 (ESI†). The illustration of lattice evolution in Fig. 1g demonstrates that the interlayer spacing of TM slabs (dTM), dO–Na–O, and the ratio of dTM/dO–Na–O all decrease after Li/Sn co-substitution, suggesting the enhanced structure stability. Additionally, the decrease of dMn–O from 2.0335 to 2.0305 Å signifies that Li/Sn co-substitution suppresses the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+.\nHigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was utilized to further confirm the change of the lattice structure at the atomic level after substitution. The HR-TEM images in Fig. 2a and b reveal that the interlayer spacing along the (003) plane of the NFM sample is 5.461 Å, whereas that of the LSNFM sample slightly reduces to 5.409 Å. This contraction aligns with the findings from X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement results. Additionally, the scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS) analysis was conducted to examine the local morphology and elemental distribution of NFM and LSNFM, as depicted in Fig. 2c and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The SEM–EDS images show that both NFM and LSNFM consist of flaky particles with sizes ranging from 3 to 5 μm. The elements Na, Sn, Ni, Fe, and Mn are evenly dispersed across the entire secondary particles with no discernible segregation observed.\n\nElectrochemical performances\nThe electrochemical performances of the as-prepared samples were evaluated in half cells versus sodium metal over the potential range of 2.0 to 4.0 V. As depicted in Fig. 3a, the LSNFM electrode exhibits a 27.2% capacity increase after Li/Sn co-substitution with the lowest polarization (85.6 mA h g−1 for NFM, 89.3 mA h g−1 for SNFM, 100.1 mA h g−1 for LNFM, and 109 mA h g−1 for LSNFM). Compared to the smooth galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of NFM and SNFM electrodes, those of LNFM and LSNFM cathodes display a noticeable voltage plateau at 2.85 V, indicating that more TM ions participate in redox reactions in the high-voltage region, as evidenced by the following dQ/dV and cyclic voltammetry results. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3a, the region below 2.5 V can be considered as the redox reaction of Mn3+/4+. The LSNFM electrode exhibits a significantly lower specific capacity below 2.5 V compared to the NFM electrode, indicating that fewer Mn3+/4+ redox pairs participate in the electrochemical redox reaction. The combination of these two phenomena not only improves the reversible specific capacity of the LSNFM electrode, but also inhibits the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ to enhance the structural stability.\nThe charge/discharge curves of NFM and LSNFM electrodes for the first 20 cycles at 0.1 C are shown in Fig. 3b and c. It is clearly demonstrated that the capacity attenuation of the LSNFM electrode is much slower than that of the NFM electrode, revealing enhanced reversibility and cycling stability after Li/Sn co-substitution. The corresponding differential capacity (dQ/dV) curves are shown in Fig. 3d and e. Clearly, the strength of the redox peaks at 2.87/3.00 V for the LSNFM electrode is much higher than that for the NFM electrode, indicating that more Ni2+ participates in redox reactions in the high-voltage region, coinciding with the GCD curves. In addition, the voltage gap between the oxidation and reduction peaks of Ni2+/3+ is only 0.10 V for the LSNFM electrode, much smaller than that for the NFM electrode (0.18 V), suggesting less polarization and better reversibility after Li/Sn co-substitution. On the other hand, the Mn3+/4+ redox peaks of the NFM electrode below 2.5 V are much stronger than those of the LSNFM electrode, indicating that the Li/Sn co-substitution inhibits the reaction activity of Mn3+/4+, then suppresses the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ and improves the structural stability.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) was further used to confirm the abovementioned conclusions. Fig. 3g and h depict the CV profiles of NFM and LSNFM electrodes at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V during the initial ten cycles. Notably, the intensity of cathodic and anodic peaks in the LSNFM electrode is obviously elevated at above 2.5 V after Li/Sn co-substitution, suggesting an enhancement of redox activity. The redox peaks observed at 3.18 V/2.67 V can be attributed to the Ni2+/3+ couple, while those at 3.65 V/3.52 V can be identified as the Fe3+/4+ couple. The redox peaks below 2.5 V attributed to the Mn3+/4+ couple are barely visible for the LSNFM electrode, whereas the NFM electrode exhibits relatively stronger peaks. In addition, the voltage gap between the oxidation and reduction peaks of Ni2+/3+ is only 0.28 V after 10 cycles for the LSNFM electrode, much smaller than that for the NFM electrode (0.40 V), suggesting less polarization. Evidently, Li/Sn co-substitution effectively stimulates more TM ion redox reactions (Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+) above 2.5 V, decreases the polarization and suppresses the activity of Mn3+ below 2.5 V, which is consistent with the abovementioned electrochemical results shown in Fig. 3a–e.\nThe impact of Li/Sn co-substitution on Na+ diffusion kinetics was further investigated using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). The charge/discharge GITT curves in the first cycle are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the corresponding DNa+ values calculated as a function of testing time during the charge/discharge process are plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Notably, apart from the late stage of discharge, the LSNFM electrode exhibits higher DNa+ values compared to the NFM electrode throughout almost all the tested periods, indicating that Li/Sn co-substitution enhances Na+ diffusion kinetics in the high-voltage region. Conversely, at the late stage of discharge, the NFM electrode exhibits higher DNa+ values, which could be ascribed to the stronger Jahn–Teller effect to accelerate Na+ diffusion. Besides, inflection points at approximately 3.00 V during charging and 2.86 V during discharging corresponded to the phase transitions evidenced by in situ XRD analysis below. The decrease of DNa+ within these two periods can be attributed to the sluggish Na+ transfer within the O3 phase relative to the P3 phase. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3f, the specific capacities of the LSNFM electrode are 108.5, 106.4, 101.6, 96.7, 89.9, 75.3, and 57.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. By contrast, the LSNFM electrode exhibits the best rate performance with an 82.9% capacity retention (2 C/0.1 C), whereas the NFM, SNFM, and LNFM electrodes show only 61.8%, 63.2% and 81.1%, respectively.\nFurthermore, the LSNFM electrode presents a capacity retention of 84.0% after 500 cycles at 1 C and exhibits the best cycling performance compared with the other three electrodes (Fig. 3i). In addition, the excellent long-term cycling performance of the LSNFM electrode at a high rate is demonstrated in Fig. 3j. Even after 2000 cycles at 5 C, the LSNFM electrode exhibits an 84.7% capacity retention, whereas the NFM, SNFM and LNFM electrodes show only 33.6%, 58.3%, and 71.4% retention, respectively. Besides, the coulombic efficiency of the NFM electrode fluctuates continuously with cycling, whereas the LSNFM electrode keeps a steady trend. The cycling performances of the recent representative and important layered oxide cathode materials are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). By comparison, the LSNFM material in our work exhibits the best long-term cycling performance among all the reported literature studies to date.\nIn a word, the above results indicate that the Li/Sn co-substitution suppresses the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ and activates more high-voltage TM ion redox reactions, resulting in the enhancement of structural stability and electrochemical performances. Meanwhile, it is evidenced that Li/Sn co-substitution improves the dynamic performance. It is important to emphasize that the LSNFM material has not undergone any form of optimization or modification, such as surface coatings, implying that there is considerable potential for further enhancement in its electrochemical performance to meet the requirement of practical SIBs.\n\nCharge transfer and structural evolution\nEx situ XPS measurements were conducted to investigate the redox mechanism and charge compensation during the charge/discharge process by observing the valence state changes of surface elements. Fig. 4a and b display the Mn 2p spectra of NFM and LSNFM samples, respectively. The deconvolutions of these spectra reveal four characteristic peaks within the Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 regions. The 642.0 and 653.6 eV peaks are attributed to Mn3+, while the 643.3 and 654.8 eV peaks correspond to Mn4+. Both NFM and LSNFM samples are found to contain Mn3+ and Mn4+ in their initial state with the proportion of Mn3+ being greatly lower in the LSNFM sample, suggesting that Li/Sn co-substitution could suppress Jahn–Teller distortion by elevating the valence state of manganese ions. Upon charging to 4.0 V, the peak area corresponding to Mn4+ increases in both NFM and LSNFM samples, demonstrating that Mn3+ participates in the charge transfer process and contributes to the capacity. When fully discharged to 2.0 V, Mn4+ is reduced. By comparison, the Mn3+/4+ redox pairs participating in the reaction of the LSNFM sample are much fewer than those of the NFM sample, suggesting that Li/Sn co-substitution suppresses the reactivity of Mn3+/4+, consistent with the previous electrochemical results. Fig. 4c and d present the Ni 2p spectra, where the main peaks appear at 854.7 and 872.3 eV, accompanied by satellite peaks, indicating that Ni solely exists in a divalent form initially. Upon charging to 4.0 V, an additional Ni3+ 2p3/2 peak emerges at 857.6 eV, demonstrating the oxidation of a portion of Ni2+ to Ni3+. With the following discharge back to 2.0 V, the newly formed Ni3+ is fully reverted to Ni2+, showing that Ni2+ participates in electrochemical redox reactions with excellent reversibility during sodium (de)intercalation. Significantly, more Ni3+ ions are activated in the LSNFM sample during charging and discharging processes. In the Fe 2p region shown in Fig. 4e and f, the peaks at 710.3 and 723.8 eV correspond to Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, each accompanied by a satellite peak. Similar to the Ni 2p spectra, upon charging to 4.0 V, a peak indicative of Fe4+ 2p3/2 emerged at 713.8 eV, evidencing that Fe also engages in the charge compensation during sodium (de)insertion. Meanwhile, the Fe3+/4+ redox activity is enhanced after Li/Sn co-substitution. The above XPS results confirm that Li/Sn co-substitution suppresses the Mn3+/4+ redox activity while activating more Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ redox pairs, which agrees with the preceding electrochemical test results.\nIn situ XRD measurements were carried out to further monitor the structural evolution during the first cycle within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. In Fig. 5a and b, the peaks corresponding to the Al current collector and beryllium window are denoted by asterisks and diamonds, respectively. The intensity contour maps for all diffraction peaks are displayed in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). During the initial charging process, when Na+ is extracted, the (003), (006), and (108) peaks progressively shift to lower angles, while the (101) and (102) peaks migrate to higher angles, implying the contraction of the ab-plane and the elongation along the c-axis due to the enhanced repulsion between adjacent TM layers and the weakening of TM–TM bond energy. This demonstrates that the O3 phase begins to transform to the P3 phase. Notably, upon reaching 3.12 V, the (104) peak abruptly disappears and all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to a hexagonal P3 phase, indicating the completion of the O3–P3 transition. Upon fully charging to 4.0 V, the P3 structure remains unchanged, concurrent with a smooth curve in the electrochemical measurements, suggesting that this stage mainly involves a solution reaction. During the discharge process, the peaks associated with the LSNFM material undergo a nearly complete reversible reaction, whereas irreversible transitions occurred in the NFM electrode. Remarkably, a portion of the P3 phase persists till the discharge reaches 2.0 V in the NFM electrode, indicative of the structural irreversibility. In contrast, the LSNFM electrode completely reverts to the O3 phase at the end of discharging, thereby demonstrating that Li/Sn co-substitution effectively boosts structural robustness and inhibits the detrimental irreversible phase transitions, contributing to improving the electrochemical performance, especially in terms of long-term cycling stability.\n\nTheoretical computations\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanism behind the exceptional electrochemical performance of LSNFM, migration energy and projected density of states (PDOS) calculations were conducted using first-principles based on density functional theory (DFT). Fig. 6a displays the optimized atomic structure of LSNFM, modeled in line with experimental atomic ratios and site occupancies. As shown in Fig. 6b, the calculated Na+ migration energy barrier in LSNFM is 0.46 eV, significantly lower than that in NFM (0.83 eV). This supports the notion that Li/Sn co-substitution could facilitate easier Na+ diffusion, thereby enhancing rate performance. Additionally, Fig. 6c compares the PDOS for NFM and LSNFM materials. It is evident that the Mn PDOS in LSNFM exhibits a gradual positive shift, suggesting a reduction in the d-band filling of manganese ions (oxidation of manganese ions) due to the charge balancing effect of the low-valence Li. Simultaneously, the 3d band centers of Ni and Fe shift from −2.17 eV and 1.53 eV to −2.01 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively. These findings are intuitively visualized in the schematic representation of the electronic structure shown in Fig. 6d. The positive shift of Mn, Ni and Fe PDOSs significantly optimizes the localized electronic structure, leading to a decrease in the activity of Mn3+/4+ and an increase in the activity of Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. The theoretical computation results align well with the previous electrochemical data, demonstrating that the synergistic effect of Li/Sn co-substitution effectively suppresses the Jahn–Teller effect of Mn3+ below 2.5 V and activates more TM ion redox reactions above 2.5 V. Consequently, the LSNFM material exhibits high structural stability and excellent electrochemical performance.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The metal oxides, including Mn2O3 (Aladdin, 99%), Fe2O3 (Aladdin, 99.9%), NiO (Aladdin, 99%), SnO2 (Aladdin, 99.99%), carbonate Na2CO3 (Aladdin, 99.8%) and Li2CO3 (Aladdin, 99%), were mixed via planetary ball-milling at 500 rpm for 8 h with an appropriate stoichiometric ratio. The resulting mixture was then dried, pressed into tablets, and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h, followed by sintering at 920 °C for 12 h in an oxygen atmosphere. Subsequently, the samples were cooled to room temperature in a furnace and then transferred to a glove box filled with argon gas.\n\nMaterials characterization\nHigh precision X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained at room temperature using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer operating with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and then refined using the FullProf program. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6390) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM 2100F, 200 kV) were employed to examine the morphologies and crystal structures of the materials. XPS measurements were conducted using an Escalab 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV).\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nCathode electrodes were prepared by coating the slurries, consisting of 80 wt% active substance, 10 wt% conductive agents (Super P), and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, with an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution onto an aluminum foil. The prepared electrodes were then punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm and a mass loading of approximately 3.5 mg cm−2. Sodium metal was used as an anode electrode, and glass fiber (GF/B, Whatman) was used as a separator. Subsequently, Na half cells (CR2032) were assembled in a glove box filled with argon gas. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed using both LAND (CT2001A, Wuhan Jinnuo Electronics Co., Ltd) and Neware battery testing systems within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 at 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments were conducted using a Neware battery testing system, with the cells tested at a rate of 0.1 C for 30 minutes, followed by a 10-hour rest period. The Na+ diffusion coefficients (DNa+) were calculated using the following formula:\nwhere τ is defined as the relaxation time of a single current pulse, mB, Vm and MB represent the mass (g), molar volume (cm3 mol−1), and molar mass (g mol−1) of the active substance in the electrode, respectively, S represents the effective contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, ΔEs signifies the value change of the adjacent steady-state voltage, and ΔEτ represents the voltage change induced by a current pulse. Fig. S2 (ESI†) illustrates the voltage versus time profile for a single titration event.\n\nTheoretical calculations\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the VASP code. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed for exchange–correlation processing, while the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotential was utilized with a kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV to describe the expansion of the electronic eigenfunctions. A vacuum thickness of 25 Å was set to minimize interlayer interactions. The Brillouin-zone integration was sampled using a Γ-centered 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point. All atomic positions were fully relaxed until the energy and force reached a tolerance of 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1, respectively. The dispersion-corrected DFT-D method was employed to account for long-range interactions. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used to compute the minimum energy pathway of the cyclization reaction and its corresponding activation barrier.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Sodium metal was used as an anode electrode, and glass fiber (GF/B, Whatman) was used as a separator. Subsequently, Na half cells (CR2032) were assembled in a glove box filled with argon gas. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed using both LAND (CT2001A, Wuhan Jinnuo Electronics Co., Ltd) and Neware battery testing systems within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 at 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments were conducted using a Neware battery testing system, with the cells tested at a rate of 0.1 C for 30 minutes, followed by a 10-hour rest period. The Na+ diffusion coefficients (DNa+) were calculated using the following formula:\nwhere τ is defined as the relaxation time of a single current pulse, mB, Vm and MB represent the mass (g), molar volume (cm3 mol−1), and molar mass (g mol−1) of the active substance in the electrode, respectively, S represents the effective contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, ΔEs signifies the value change of the adjacent steady-state voltage, and ΔEτ represents the voltage change induced by a current pulse. Fig. S2 (ESI†) illustrates the voltage versus time profile for a single titration event.\n\nTheoretical calculations\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the VASP code. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed for exchange–correlation processing, while the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotential was utilized with a kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV to describe the expansion of the electronic eigenfunctions. A vacuum thickness of 25 Å was set to minimize interlayer interactions. The Brillouin-zone integration was sampled using a Γ-centered 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point. All atomic positions were fully relaxed until the energy and force reached a tolerance of 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1, respectively. The dispersion-corrected DFT-D method was employed to account for long-range interactions. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used to compute the minimum energy pathway of the cyclization reaction and its corresponding activation barrier.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The Na+ diffusion coefficients (DNa+) were calculated using the following formula:\nwhere τ is defined as the relaxation time of a single current pulse, mB, Vm and MB represent the mass (g), molar volume (cm3 mol−1), and molar mass (g mol−1) of the active substance in the electrode, respectively, S represents the effective contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, ΔEs signifies the value change of the adjacent steady-state voltage, and ΔEτ represents the voltage change induced by a current pulse. Fig. S2 (ESI†) illustrates the voltage versus time profile for a single titration event.\n\nTheoretical calculations\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the VASP code. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed for exchange–correlation processing, while the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotential was utilized with a kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV to describe the expansion of the electronic eigenfunctions. A vacuum thickness of 25 Å was set to minimize interlayer interactions. The Brillouin-zone integration was sampled using a Γ-centered 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point. All atomic positions were fully relaxed until the energy and force reached a tolerance of 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1, respectively. The dispersion-corrected DFT-D method was employed to account for long-range interactions. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used to compute the minimum energy pathway of the cyclization reaction and its corresponding activation barrier.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 Stabilities and exfoliation of M2B2 monolayers\nThe structures of hexagonal bulk MB2, MB2 monolayer and M2B2 monolayer are exhibited in Fig. 1. These structures exhibit a high similarity, consisting of stacked metal atom layers and honeycomb boron ring layers. Inspired by the structural similarity of these systems and the elemental diversity of MB2 covering transition metal and main group metal, we investigated the I–IIIA metal M2B2 monolayers by ab initio calculations to expand the hexagonal MBene family. Initially, we verified the dynamic stabilities of hexagonal bulk MB2 (where M = Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca, Al, Ga, In, Tl) through phonon calculations. The results in Fig. S1† show that all I–IIIA metal bulk MB2 are dynamically stable except for the bulk KB2. Subsequently, we focused on screening new hexagonal IA, IIA and IIIA metal M2B2 monolayers. We calculated the phonon spectra of M2B2 monolayers for the same metal elements as MB2 to investigate their dynamic stabilities. Except for the Be2B2 monolayer, all these monolayers were verified to be dynamically stable without imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra as displayed in Fig. S2.† Interestingly, the bulk KB2 is dynamically unstable whereas the K2B2 monolayer is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we calculated the exfoliation energies of M2B2 monolayers from bulk MB2 and compared them to that of MB2 monolayers. The detailed results are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2.† In Fig. S5,† the exfoliation energies of stable I–IIIA metal M2B2 monolayers (0.30–1.37 J m−2) are significantly lower than those of transition metal M2B2 (M = Ti, Zr and Hf) monolayers (2.35–2.59 J m−2), whose nanosheets have been exfoliated in experiments. In Table S2,† the exfoliation energy values of M2B2 and MB2 monolayers are very close with a maximum difference no more than 0.001 J m−2, indicating that both can potentially be exfoliated from bulk MB2. To determine the surface stability of M2B2 and MB2 monolayers, we calculated their surface formation energies using eqn (1) and (2), respectively. Fig. S6 and Table S3† shows that the surface formation energies of M2B2 for all M elements are smaller than that of MB2, indicating that M2B2 terminated by M atoms on both sides is more stable than MB2 terminated by M atoms on only one side. These results demonstrate that the M2B2 monolayers are more easily exfoliated from the bulk MB2 than the MB2 monolayers by breaking the M–B bonds at the blue dashed line instead of the red dashed line as shown in Fig. 1. Additionally, the surface formation energies of non-transition metal M2B2 and MB2 monolayers (0.046–0.750 J m−2 and 0.264–1.329 J m−2) are smaller than that of transition metal systems such as Ti, Zr and Hf (1.141–1.458 J m−2 and 0.264–2.158 J m−2). This indicates that non-transition metal monolayers require less energy to be obtained than that of transition metal monolayers.\nMotivated by the applications of hexagonal MBenes in metal-ion battery anodes, we investigated hexagonal non-transition metal M2B2 systems for LIB and NIB anodes. Considering the stability and molecular weight, we selected the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers as candidate anode materials for further investigation.\n\n3.2 Structures and stabilities of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers\nThe optimized structures of hexagonal Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers with the P6/mmm space group are displayed in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The M–M distances in planes are 3.078 Å and 3.333 Å and the thicknesses are 3.393 Å and 3.714 Å for Mg2B2 and Ca2B2, respectively. First of all, the previous calculated phonon spectra in Fig. 3a and b show that the hexagonal Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers are dynamically stable without imaginary phonon frequencies in the whole Brillouin zones. Subsequently, we calculated the elastic constants (cij) of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 to evaluate their mechanical stabilities. The results in Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the ESI† demonstrate that these two 2D hexagonal crystals are mechanically stable satisfying c11 > 0 and c11 > |c12|. Furthermore, in order to evaluate their thermal stabilities, we conducted AIMD simulations for 10 ps at 300, 600, 900, 1200 and 3000 K, respectively. At 300 K, the average values of the total energies remain almost constant throughout the simulations as depicted in Fig. 3c and d. The corresponding structure snapshots show the intact geometries with only minor deformations in Fig. 3e and f. These results indicate that the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers remain stable at room temperature. The energy fluctuations and structure snapshots of AIMD simulations at other temperatures are presented in Fig. S7 and S8,† respectively. The Mg2B2 monolayer keeps stable until 1200 K indicating the high stability for the application in metal-ion battery anodes. The Ca2B2 monolayer begins to tear and coalesce into chains at 900 K and the average of energies fluctuates drastically. Nonetheless, it remains stable at 600 K, which is enough for the application of anode materials.\n\n3.3 Electronic properties of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers\nThe intrinsic electronic conductivity has a profound effect on the cyclability and rate performance of the anode materials. Hence, we first calculated the PBE band structures and density of states (DOS) for Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers to investigate their electrical behaviors. In Fig. 4, the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers exhibit metallic behaviors with electronic bands passing through the Fermi level and notable peaks of total DOS at the Fermi energy, which indicates their good electronic conductivities. The projected DOS of Mg2B2 shows that the B orbitals contribute dominantly while the Mg orbitals contribute partially near the Fermi level. For Ca2B2, the DOS is jointly contributed by the Ca and B orbitals. Besides, the HSE06 bands and DOS show that there is no band gap for Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 as shown in Fig. S9.† With excellent electronic conductivities, the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers have the potential for applications as anode materials for LIBs and NIBs compared with the semi-conducting or insulating anode materials.\n\n3.4 Li/Na adsorption and storage capacities of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers\nThree adsorption sites were identified for the hexagonal Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers, including the hollow (S1), bridge (S2) and top (S3) sites, as shown in Fig. 5a. The S1 site is positioned above the B atom corresponding to the hollow site of the triangle of M atoms. The S2 site is located at the top of the B–B or M–M bridges. And the S3 site is above the M atom. Utilizing eqn (3), we calculated the single atom adsorption energies (Ead) for Li and Na on these sites, as shown in Fig. 5b. The single atom Ead of Li and Na on S1 are both the lowest for the Mg2B2 (−0.287 and −0.533 eV) and Ca2B2 (−0.102 and −0.477 eV) monolayers, indicating that the S1 is the most favorable adsorption site. All the most stable configurations are exhibited in Fig. S10.† Besides, the single atom Ead of Na are lower than those of Li at the same site of Mg2B2 or Ca2B2, suggesting that the single Na atom adsorption configurations are more stable than those of Li. Furthermore, the single Li/Na atom Ead of Mg2B2 is lower than Ca2B2, indicating that the adsorption configuration of Mg2B2 for a single Li/Na atom is more stable than that of Ca2B2.\nAfter identifying the most favorable adsorption site, we focused on determining the specific capacity of the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers. Charging or discharging in LIBs and SIBs involves a gradual process of ion adsorption or release. To determine the adsorption configurations at different ion concentrations, we first investigated the average adsorption energies (Eave) of the configurations with one layer of Li/Na on both sides. There are 8 hollow (S1) sites on one side of the monolayers. To determine the maximum numbers of Li/Na atoms that the monolayers can accommodate in one layer, we constructed two types of configurations adsorbed with different numbers of atoms. In Fig. 6, the Li2/Na2M2B2 (M = Mg, Ca) configurations have 4 adsorbed atoms at S1 alternatively on each side of the monolayers. In Fig. S11,† all 16 hollow sites of the monolayers are adsorbed with atoms in the Li4/Na4M2B2 configurations. The calculated Eave of Li4/Na4M2B2 and Li2/Na2M2B2 according to eqn (4) are listed in Table S4.† All Li4/Na4M2B2 configurations have positive Eave, which means the monolayers cannot adsorb Li/Na atoms at all hollow sites. Conversely, the Eave of all Li2/Na2M2B2 configurations are negative indicating that the monolayers can accommodate 8 atoms on hollow sites in one layer alternately. To analyze the adsorption configurations from the perspective of crystallography, we compared the (0 0 1) crystallographic planes of the monolayers with the (1 1 0) crystal planes of body-centered cubic Li and Na as plot in Fig. S12.† In Fig. S12,† to distinguish different hollow sites (S1) on the surface of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2, we labeled the S1, the nearest S1 and the next nearest neighbor S1 as A, B and C in Fig. S12,† respectively. The distances between S1 and the next nearest neighbor S1 (dA–C) of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 are 3.078 and 3.333 Å, respectively. While the distances between S1 and the nearest neighbor S1 (dA–B) of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 are 1.777 and 1.924 Å, respectively. For body-centered cubic Li and Na, the distances between the body-centered atom and the nearest atom in corner (db–c) in the (1 1 0) crystallographic planes are 2.996 and 3.638 Å, respectively. The mismatching ratios between dA–C and db–c (r1) and the ones between dA–B and db–c (r2) are listed in Tables S5 and S6,† respectively. The absolute values of r1 are smaller than the ones of r2. In other words, dA–C have a higher matching degree with db–c, which indicates the monolayers undergo a smaller change in bond length by adsorbing the Li/Na atoms on hollow sites alternately instead of all hollow sites in one layer. In terms of the electronic structure, the charge difference densities of Li2/Na2M2B2 configurations (in Fig. S13†) reveal that the electrons accumulate between the M atom layers of the monolayers and the Li/Na atom layers leading to the Li/Na–M bonds. The strong chemical bonds between the Li/Na atoms and the monolayers prevent the formation of Li/Na clusters, which is beneficial to the applications of these monolayers in anode materials.\nBased on the most favorable adsorption configurations for one-layer Li/Na atoms, we constructed a series of Lix/NaxM2B2 configurations where x ranged from 0.25 to 3 in increments of 0.25 and calculated the corresponding Eave using eqn (4). The results of Eave are presented in Fig. 7. For LixCa2B2 and LixMg2B2, the Eave are all negative values in 0 < x < 2 and two consecutive positive values appear at x = 2.25 and 2.5. The maximum Li atom concentrations for Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 are both x = 2 at which the adsorption configurations remain energetically stable. According to eqn (5), the specific capacities of the hexagonal Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers for Li atoms are 764 and 527 mA h g−1, respectively. Their capacities significantly exceed those of graphene, MXenes and most MBenes due to their much smaller molecular weights. For NaxCa2B2 and NaxMg2B2, no positive adsorption energies occur in x < 2, while continuous values close to zero occurs in x > 2. Specifically, the Eave of NaxMg2B2 at x = 2.5 and 2.75 are −0.080 and −0.057 eV, respectively, and the Eave of NaxCa2B2 at x = 2.25 and 2.5 are −0.003 and −0.067 eV, respectively. These values in the range of −0.1 to 0 eV indicate that the corresponding configurations are energetically unstable. As a result, the 2 × 2 × 1 Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 can accommodate 9 and 8 Na atoms corresponding to the Na2.25Mg2B2 and Na2Ca2B2 configurations, respectively. Consequently, the specific capacities of the hexagonal Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers are 859 and 527 mA h g−1, respectively, surpassing the capacities of recently reported MoS2, WB4, Nb2Se2C, all MXenes and most MBenes. Notably, we observed that the Eave values of Li3Mg2B2, Li3Ca2B2 and Na3Ca2B2 configurations are negative. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that charging is a gradual and continuous process of ions on anodes. Consequently, configurations at x = 3 cannot form since the charging processes terminate at x = 2.\nSmall bond length changes, cross-sectional area change ratios and volume change ratios are important properties for 2D electrode materials. The structural schematics of the monolayers adsorbed with one layer of ions on both sides are displayed in Fig. 8a. The distances between the ion layers and the monolayers (d1), the thicknesses of the monolayers (d2) and the M–M, B–B and M–B bond lengths (lM–M, lB–B, lM–B) have small changes of approximately 10−2 Å in magnitude from the M2B2 to the Li/NaM2B2 or Li2/Na2M2B2 configurations. All these values of the distances are listed in Table S7.† Besides, the histograms of the Eave and the corresponding cross-section area (Scross) change ratios of the monolayers with one layer of ions adsorbed on the only top side (Li/NaM2B2) and one layer of ions adsorbed on both sides (Li2/Na2M2B2) are plotted in Fig. 8b. Among these configurations, Na2Mg2B2 possesses the highest Scross change ratio which is not exceeding 4.9%. These results demonstrate that the bond length changes and the Scross changes of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers are very small, meeting the requirements of electrode materials. Furthermore, apart from the cross-section area change ratio, we also investigated the volume change ratio (γ) of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 at different Li/Na concentrations. The results are shown in the Fig. S14 in the ESI.† In Fig. S14,† the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 exhibit volume expansion and reduction at different Li/Na loading stages without obvious trend. The absolute values of γ of Lix/NaxMg2B2 (x, 0.25 to 2 with the increment of 0.25) are less than 2.5% in the whole charging or discharging process. The maximum of the absolute values of γ of LixCa2B2 and NaxCa2B2 are 4.3% (x = 1) and 6.3% (x = 0.75), respectively, which are comparable to the transition metal MBene anode materials (<7%). The small volume changes observed at different ion loading stages further demonstrate the structural stabilities of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers.\nTo evaluate the influence of mechanical properties on the anode performance, we calculated the Young's modulus (E), shear modulus (G) and Poisson's ratio (μ) of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 and compared them with other hexagonal MBenes. The results of E, G and μ can be found in Fig. S3, S4 and Table S1 in the ESI.† Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 exhibit high E and G (141 and 60 N m−1, 114 and 51 N m−1 respectively) and low μ (0.17 and 0.11 respectively) indicating their excellent mechanical stabilities and processing properties. Despite possessing lower E and G values than transition metal MBenes such as Ti2B2 (234 and 101 N m−1) and Zr2B2 (230 and 97 N m−1), Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 as strong as MoS2 (124 and 50 N m−1) still meet the performance requirements for anode materials.\n\n3.5 Electronic structures of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers adsorbed with Li/Na ions\nThe conductivity during the charge or discharge process has a great influence on the rate performance of the anode materials. To comprehensively understand the electrical conductivity during charging and discharging, we investigated the evolutions of the elemental projected DOS for the monolayers as shown in Fig. S15 and S16.† For Li0.25Mg2B2 (Fig. S15a†) and Li2Mg2B2 (Fig. S15b†), the B-p orbitals contribute dominantly at Fermi level while the contributions of the other orbitals are neglectable. Hence, Li atoms have a weak effect on the electronic structure of LixMg2B2. From Na0.25Mg2B2 (Fig. S15c†) to Na2Mg2B2 (Fig. S15d†), the dominance of the B-p orbitals remains with a slight increase in the contribution of Na-s orbitals, which is comparable to that of the Mg-p orbitals. From Li0.25Ca2B2 (Fig. S16a†) to Li2Ca2B2 (Fig. S16b†), the orbital contributions at the Fermi level change from the dominant contribution of B-p orbitals to the coupling contribution of Ca-p and B-p orbitals as the number of Li atoms increases. While the Li-s orbitals are negligible in the orbital contributions. For Na0.25Ca2B2 (Fig. S16c†), the B-p orbitals contribute dominantly at the Fermi level. For Na2Ca2B2 (Fig. S16b†), the Na-s, Ca-p and B-p orbitals make the coupling contribution while the contribution of B-p orbitals reduces a lot comparing to Na0.25Ca2B2. Hence, the electronic structure of Ca2B2 is more sensitive to Li/Na atoms than Mg2B2. In general, these systems both remain metallic behaviors at low and high concentrations of Li/Na atoms, thereby exhibiting excellent electrical conductivities as anode materials in LIBs or SIBs.\n\n3.6 Theoretical open-circuit voltages of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers\nA good anode material should possess low OCVs ranged from 0 to 1 V, which prevent the anode from forming dendrites during charge or discharge and provide a large voltage window to match the cathode. To acquire the OCV profiles of the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers, we calculated the formation energies (Ef) of Lix/NaxM2B2 configurations (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) using eqn (6) and constructed the convex hull of Ef. The convex hulls of Ef for LixMg2B2 and NaxMg2B2 are exhibited in Fig. 9a and b, respectively. Blue points located on the convex hull correspond to the configurations more thermodynamically stable than others. The red points correspond to the metastable configurations. All the points corresponding to the configurations with positive Eave are excluded in the convex hulls of Ef. For LixMg2B2, the configurations corresponding to x = 0.25, 1.0 and 2.0 are more stable than the other configurations. For NaxMg2B2, the configurations at x = 0.25, 1.25, 2.0 and 2.25 are more stable. According to the eqn (7), the OCV plateaus between two adjacent stable configurations were calculated with the corresponding energy differences between them. The OCV profiles of LixMg2B2 and NaxMg2B2 are exhibited in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9c, the three voltage plateaus for stable LixMg2B2 adsorption configurations (x ≤ 2) are 0.287, 0.436 and 0.463 V corresponding to Mg2B2 → Li0.25Mg2B2, Li0.25Mg2B2 → Li1.0Mg2B2 and Li1.0Mg2B2 → Li2.0Mg2B2, respectively. However, the plateau corresponding to Li2.0Mg2B2 → Li3.0Mg2B2 cannot form due to the unstable adsorption configurations in 2 < x < 3. The average OCV for LixMg2B2 is 0.395 V vs. Li/Li+. In Fig. 9d, NaxMg2B2 has four OCV plateaus in 0 ≤ x ≤ 2.25, including 0.532, 0.240, 0.230 and 0.114 V, and the average OCV of these four plateaus is 0.279 V vs. Na/Na+. These results indicate that Mg2B2 is a promising anode material providing low OCVs and large voltage windows for LIBs and SIBs. The convex hulls of Ef and corresponding OCV profiles for LixCa2B2 and NaxCa2B2 are displayed in Fig. 10. For LixCa2B2, two relatively stable configurations (x = 1.0 and 2.0) lead to two OCV plateaus (0.266 and 0.284 V) within the negative Eave range (x ≤ 2) in Fig. 10c. For NaxCa2B2, the stable configurations at x = 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 1.5 and 2.0 result in five OCV plateaus (0.476, 0.375, 0.318, 0.326 and 0.315 V) within the negative Eave range (x ≤ 2) in Fig. 10d. The average OCVs of LixCa2B2 and NaxCa2B2 are 0.275 V vs. Li/Li+ and 0.362 V vs. Na/Na+, respectively. The initial and average potentials of Ca2B2 are quite low making it suitable for anode materials in LIBs or SIBs.\n\n3.7 Li/Na diffusion on Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers\nIn addition to a high specific capacity and low OCVs, a high charging or discharging rate capability is essential for a promising anode material. The rate performance of anode materials is affected by the ionic diffusion coefficient related to the diffusion energy barrier. In Fig. 5, it is obvious that the adsorption energy difference between S1 and S2 is smaller than that between S2 and S3 for the same system. Hence, Li/Na ions prefer diffusing along the S1–S2–S1 path on the surfaces of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 as shown in Fig. 11a and b, respectively. We calculated the Li/Na diffusion energy barriers of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 by the CI-NEB method. As shown in Fig. 11c and d, for the Li0.25/Na0.25M2B2 configurations at delithiated/desodiated states, the Li/Na diffusion energy barriers of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 are 27/14 and 16/12 meV, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of graphene, MoS2 and MXenes. Besides, it is easier for Na ions to diffuse than Li ions owning to their lower diffusion energy barriers. Furthermore, we calculated the diffusion coefficients of Li/Na atom on the Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers according to eqn (8). The results are listed in Table S8.† The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na on Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 at 300 K are 2.6 × 10−3/4.3 × 10−3 and 3.7 × 10−3/4.3 × 10−3 cm2 s−1, respectively, which are significantly higher than graphene (6.0 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 for Li) and most hexagonal transition metal MBene. For the Li2/Na2M2B2 configurations at fully lithiated/sodiated states, the Li/Na ions on different surface of the monolayers migrate in an alternating way by one side stationary and the other side moving as a whole with the lowest diffusion energy barriers. In Fig. 11e and f, the corresponding Li/Na diffusion energy barriers of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 at are 187/58 and 52/34 meV, respectively. It is worth noting that the Li diffusion energy barrier of Mg2B2 at the 6th site is 56 meV arising from the alternative migration ions on different side of the Mg2B2 monolayer. The diffusion energy barriers for the fully lithiated/sodiated states of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 is higher than that of the delithiated/desodiated states because the repulsive interactions between Li/Na ions on the surface of the monolayers. However, the energy barriers for full lithiation/sodiation is still much lower than that for delithiation/desodiation in graphite (450–1200 meV), indicating that Li/Na ions possess strong migration ability on the surface of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2.\n\n3.8 Comparison with other anode materials\nTo evaluate the performance of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers as anode materials for LIBs and NIBs, we compared their theoretical specific capacities and average voltages with MBenes, MXenes and other 2D materials as shown in Fig. 12. In the plot of average voltage vs. theoretical capacity, the closer the data point is to the lower right corner, the better the overall performance of the anode material with higher theoretical specific capacity and lower average voltage. In Fig. 12a, the theoretical specific capacity of the Mg2B2 monolayer for LIBs (764 mA h g−1) surpasses that of the WB4 (708 mA h g−1), SbP3 (499 mA h g−1), and VSeTe (416 mA h g−1) monolayers, the orthorhombic Fe2B2 (665 mA h g−1) and Mo2B2 (444 mA h g−1) MBenes, as well as the hexagonal Zr2B2 (764 mA h g−1), Sc2B2 (480 mA h g−1) and Ti2B2 (456 mA h g−1) MBenes and the Ti3C2 (448 mA h g−1) MXene. Moreover, the diffusion energy barriers of Mg2B2 monolayer for Li atoms (27 meV) is much lower than graphite (450–1200 meV) and the orthorhombic Fe2B2 (240 meV) and Mo2B2 (270 meV) MBenes, as listed in Table S9.† The results indicate that the Mg2B2 monolayer is a promising anode material with excellent overall performance. The Ca2B2 monolayer exhibits a relatively low average voltage for LIBs (0.275 V), slightly higher than that of the hexagonal Zr2B2 (0.236 V). Additionally, its theoretical capacity for LIBs (527 mA h g−1) comparable to Zr2B2 (526 mA h g−1) makes Ca2B2 also a good 2D anode material. For SIBs, the theoretical specific capacity of Mg2B2 (859 mA h g−1) and Ca2B2 (527 mA h g−1) monolayers are comparable to BCN (647 mA h g−1) and higher than MoC2 (447 mA h g−1), Ti3C2 (352 mA h g−1), Nb2Se2C (335 mA h g−1), WB4 (472 mA h g−1), Ti2B2 (342 mA h g−1) and MoS2 (146 mA h g−1) as shown in Fig. 12b. Furthermore, the quite low average voltages (0.279 and 0.362 V) and diffusion energy barriers (14 and 12 meV) for Na atoms of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers add merits to themselves as anode materials in SIBs as show in Table S10.†\n\n3.9 Anode performance of multilayers\nTo understand the effect of the multi-layer structures on the anode performance, we investigated the Eave, specific capacities and OCVs of M3B4 and M4B6 (M = Mg, Ca) for Li/Na ions. The Eave of Lix/NaxM3B4 are displayed in Fig. S17† and the energy differences of Eave between the Lix/NaxM3B4 and Lix/NaxM2B2 configurations are listed in Table S11.† Compared to the Ca2B2 monolayer, there is no significant change in the Eave of the Ca3B4 multilayer for Li/Na ions. The same case is observed for the Eave of the Mg3B4 multilayer for Li ions. However, the Eave of the Mg3B4 multilayer for Na ions decreases significantly when x > 2, leading to an increase in the maximum Na ion concentration (x = 2.75). The Eave of Lix/NaxM4B6 are displayed in Fig. S18† and the energy differences of Eave between the Lix/NaxM4B6 and Lix/NaxM2B2 configurations are listed in Table S12.† Specifically, the Eave of the Mg4B6 multilayer for Na ions also exhibits a significant decrease comparing to the Mg2B2 monolayer, which results in the maximum Na ion concentration reaching x = 2.75. In this way, the calculated specific capacities of Mg3B4, Ca3B4, Mg4B6 and Ca4B6 for Li/Na ions are 462/635, 328/328, 331/455 and 239/268 mA h g−1, respectively. As the layer thickness and the molecular weight increase, the specific capacities of these MBenes exhibit varying degrees of decline, even if the number of ions adsorbed on the surface increases for some MBenes. Besides, as exhibited in Fig. S19–S22,† the average OCVs of Mg3B4, Ca3B4, Mg4B6 and Ca4B6 for Li/Na ions are 0.360/0.353, 0.343/0.353, 0.423/0.341 and 0.341/0.312 V, respectively, showing no significant changes compared to their corresponding monolayers. Additionally, as shown in Fig. S23,† the diffusion energy of Mg3B4, Ca3B4, Mg4B6 and Ca4B6 for Li/Na ions are 22/12, 7/3, 23/12 and 29/4 meV, respectively. Among them, due to a relatively large decrease (−0.070 eV) in adsorption energy from LixCa2B2 to LixCa4B6, the diffusion energy of the Ca4B6 multilayer for Li ions (29 meV) has increased compared to that of the Ca2B2 monolayer (16 meV). Overall, the OCVs and Li/Na ion diffusion energy barriers of hexagonal 2D Mg and Ca borides are less affected by the multilayer structure, while the decreases in specific capacities lead to a decline in overall anode performance.\n\n3.10 Effects of functionalization\nDuring the synthetic process, MXenes tend to be terminated by surface functional groups, such as O, OH, and F. However, no functional groups were observed on the surfaces of synthetic Cr2B2, Mo2B2, and Ti2B2 MBenes. Besides, using ultrasonication in suitable solvents, the unmodified 2D metal borides nanosheets were exfoliated from the bulk MB2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Cr, Al, and Mg). To investigate the O-functionalization effect on Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers, we constructed and relaxed the Mg2B2O2 and Ca2B2O2 structures and conducted phonon calculations and AIMD simulations at 300K for 10 ps. The results are displayed in Fig. S24 in the ESI.† The phonon spectra of Mg2B2O2 and Ca2B2O2 show imaginary frequencies in the Brillouin zones indicating that the O-modified Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers are dynamically unstable. The total energies drop fast in the first 300 steps in AIMD simulations and then maintain a certain average. The snapshots show that the inner boron atom layer produces distortion and segregation under the influence of the surface oxygen atoms. However, the entire monolayers remain in one piece. We conclude that functionalization will oxidize the structure of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers and affect the anode performance. Hence, the synthesis of corresponding anode materials should avoid the contamination of functionalization groups by employing strict synthetic procedures in suitable solvents.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The thickness/mass loading for the samples was adjusted by adjusting the number of deposition steps and/or the deposition time. To allow for optimisation of the electrolyte composition in the initial phase of the study, a minimal layer thickness of 60 nm was chosen as the nano-dimensions can facilitate the volume change associated with cycling without cracking, thereby negating any capacity fade related to loss of active material from the current collector. XRD characterisation of the pristine samples shows the presence of elemental Sn and Sb, and the SnSb alloy phase which forms spontaneously (Fig. S1e†). For these thin layer samples, the morphology of the SnSb resembles a porous layer.\nTo compare the performance of SnSb in HCE and SCE galvanostatic (dis)charge testing was used. Fig. 1a shows poor capacity retention of SnSb in the SCE, with the specific capacity dropping to below 80% of its maximum value by the 9th cycle. It continued to fade in subsequent cycles, dropping to below 10% capacity retention by 86 cycles. The coulombic efficiency was also poor in SCE, with an average of 90.2% from cycle 20 to 100. In contrast, SnSb with the HCE showed better coulombic efficiency at 95.6% in the same cycle range, and high-capacity retention, with a slight increase in capacity after initial activation. Low CE in early cycles is a common issue that requires optimisation for commercial viability of alloying materials and is a direct result of the large volume change that occurs during the charge/discharge process. It was noted that for the SnSb electrodes in both electrolytes, the CE improves over time and is >99% beyond 400 cycles. To clarify the role of both the HCE and SEI layer in the improved capacity retention and initial CE, a disassembly-reassembly technique was used. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, this process involved generating an SEI layer in the HCE in a half-cell, with subsequent disassembly and transfer of the SnSb electrode to a new coin cell, assembled with the SCE electrolyte. The reverse process was also performed on a different electrode wherein the SEI layer was formed using the SCE and subsequently transferred into the HCE for longer term cycling. As shown in Fig. 1b, the cycling performance of the SnSb anode with the SEI layer initially formed in HCE and subsequently cycled in SCE was improved compared to the SCE only cell, taking 31 cycles to reach 80% capacity retention and retaining 176 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (compared to 23 mA h g−1 for the SCE only electrode in Fig. 1a). The SnSb with a SEI layer formed initially in SCE and subsequently cycled in HCE (Fig. 1b) showed a capacity retention similar to the HCE only cell (Fig. 1a). What is notable, is that CE of each cell was always higher when cycled in the HCE versus the SCE. In the SEI generation phase (cycles 1–5) in Fig. 1b, the electrode in HCE has a higher CE than the electrode in SCE, averaging 72.3% and 81.4% respectively and subsequently, after generating the SEI layer, the electrode transferred to the HCE had a higher average CE of 94.8% compared to 93.5% for the SCE after reassembly. The fact that the CE is less than 100% in both cases demonstrates that SEI decomposition and regeneration is a continuous process for SnSb. The higher CE in the HCE indicates that the SEI is more robust than that generated by SCE, and therefore the HCE is a key enabler of higher capacity retention of these anodes. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was used to compare the Na+ diffusivity in SnSb in each electrolyte as seen in Fig. S3a.† Representative titration peaks are presented for the HCE and SCE systems in Fig. S3b and c† respectively. Diffusivity was plotted as a function of voltage in Fig. S3d.† During sodiation both electrolyte systems have similar solid state diffusivity trends, with both systems showing higher diffusivities at higher potentials during the initial sodiation starting from 0.9 V, with the diffusivity in SnSb in the HCE being greater from 0.9 to 0.71 V, whereas the SCE system shows greater diffusivity from 0.7 to 0.55 V. This is the voltage range where Sb sodiation occurs. Sodiation at lower potentials shows almost identical diffusivity for both electrolytes. During desodiation the HCE system showed far greater diffusivity in the range of 0.19 to 0.41 V, where Sn desodiation is occurring. It also shows a marginally higher Na+ diffusivity from 0.76 to 0.79 V. These findings show that HCE better facilitates Sn desodiation via greater Na+ diffusivity in the active material.\nThe long-term electrochemical performance of SnSb with HCE was evaluated by galvanostatic cycling in a half-cell configuration versus Na/Na+ in a potential window of 0.005–1 V. Rate capability testing (RCT) in Fig. S2† was performed on the electrode material using currents of 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and back to 500 mA g−1. The first 4 cycles at 50 mA g−1 show a gradual increase in discharge capacity, indicative of an activation/morphology transformation of the material which is common for alloying materials. There is a noticeable capacity decrease at 250 mA g−1 but beyond this the capacity remains relatively stable up to 1000 mA g−1. Long term cycling was performed as a continuation of this RCT and is presented in Fig. 2a. After 1500 cycles at 500 mA g−1 the capacity was 378 mA h g−1 as can be seen in Fig. 2a. Some regular fluctuation in the capacity was present throughout the test due to ambient temperature variation. The voltage profiles and differential capacity plots for the 2nd, 50th, and 1500th cycles are shown in Fig. 2b and c respectively. The differential capacity plot indicates that Sn sodiation in the 2nd cycle begins at 0.15 V. By cycle 50, overpotential causes this sodiation potential to drop to 0.05 V, reducing the capacity contribution from Sn. However, by cycle 1500 the overpotential has decreased, with sodiation occurring at 0.1 V, leading to an increased capacity contribution from Sn. The excellent capacity retention achieved over this long cycling period at the moderately fast rate of 500 mA g−1 shows the merits of this simple electrode architecture.\nPost-mortem characterisation of the SnSb electrodes was performed on desodiated samples after 100 cycles to assess the effect that cycling has on the structure of the material. Post-mortem SEM images in Fig. 3a and b, and TEM and HRTEM images in Fig. 3c and d show that the material forms a porous morphology during cycling. This has been reported for alloying materials such as Si and Ge after extended cycling in LIBs in previous works. This porous structure is advantageous as it is better able to accommodate the volume change during sodiation/desodiation and mitigate pulverisation, which explains the excellent capacity retention of these electrodes over long term cycling. Fig. 3e and f show even distribution of Sn and Sb in the post-mortem sample. Post-mortem XRD after 3 cycles in Fig. S4† showed SnSb re-forming after desodiation.\nIn order for the SnSb anodes to be viable for practical SIBs, the mass loading must be scalable. Using the same PVD method described earlier, 50 nm sequential layers of SnSb were deposited onto stainless steel up to a mass loading of 0.42 mg cm−2. The upper voltage cut off was increased from 1 V to 1.5 V to ensure complete desodiation at each cycle. As seen in Fig. 4d the capacity retention was poor, with an immediate capacity fade of the cell to <50 mA h g−1 within 8 cycles. This is due to the planar nature of the current collector not allowing the alloys sufficient room to expand during sodiation causing a build-up of stress within the material and subsequent delamination from the current collector. This is evident from the postmortem SEM images in Fig. S5† which clearly shows that the SnSb has delaminated from the SS after 540 cycles. This did not occur for the lower mass loading layer on SS as pores were present within the thinner layer that allowed for the active material to expand laterally (Fig. S1†).\nTo improve the capacity retention at higher mass loadings, SnSb was evaporated onto dendritic copper (DCu), which can better accommodate the volume changes of the SnSb due to the 3D nature of the current collector. SnSb/DCu shows a much improved capacity retention, maintaining >360 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating clearly that the surface morphology (planar or 3D) of the current collector is highly influential for binder and conductive additive free electrode configurations.\nPost-mortem SEM images of higher mass loading samples show the same porous morphology forming as in the lower mass loading samples after extended cycling. The textured structure of the underlying dendritic copper current collector plays an important role in helping the SnSb maintain contact during repeated charging/discharging. The three-dimensional nature of the dendritic copper provides additional space facilitating the volume change during sodiation/desodiation without delamination as seen in Fig. 4c. This explains why the latter current collector shows superior performance at higher mass loading and SnSb on the flat current collector fails rapidly regardless of cycling rate.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The SS was cut into individual current collectors before washing with toluene, 2-propanol, and acetone. Both the Sn and Sb were deposited on the SS current collectors via physical vapour deposition. A Mbraun system was used to thermally evaporate the Sn and Sb onto the current collector in two sequential layers for the low mass loading electrodes (0.038–0.040 mg cm−2), and in multiple sequential layers for higher mass loading samples (0.42 mg). Dendritic copper foil with a thickness of 20 μm as procured from Schlenk Metal Foil.\n\nElectrochemical testing\nElectrochemical testing of the material was performed using a half-cell configuration in 2032 coin-cells that were assembled in an Ar filled glovebox. The SnSb electrode was cut to 8 mm × 8 mm and used as the working electrode. Na foil was used as the counter electrode. GF/D glass fibre was used as the separator. 100 μL of electrolyte was used in each cell. The electrolytes used were 1M NaClO4 in DME with 3% FEC as an additive (SCE) and 4M NaClO4 in DME with 3% FEC as an additive (HCE). This electrolyte was prepared in an Ar-filled glovebox. Galvanostatic testing was carried out using both a Neware CT-4008T and a Biologic MPG-2 potentiostat in a potential range of 0.01–1.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) and 0.01–1.5 V for higher mass loading samples. For disassembly-reassembly testing the cells were assembled as normal and an SEI layer was generated over 7 cycles. The cells were then opened in a glovebox and the working electrode with the generated SEI layer was transferred to a new coin-cell with new electrolyte, Na counter electrode and separator. Cycling was resumed assuming no mass loss. No OCV rest is used in the reassembled cells. Note that in this study charge refers to sodiation and discharge refers to desodiation.\n\nMaterial characterization\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed on a Hitachi SU-70 system operating at 8 kV. Pristine electrodes required no further treatment before SEM analysis. Post-mortem samples were washed to remove the SEI layer before microscopy. The wash procedure involved briefly dipping the electrodes in an aqueous 1 mM acetic acid solution, deionised water, then ethanol. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out with a Joel JEM-2100F field emission microscope equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan CCD camera and EDAX Genesis EDS detector. Samples were placed into a small volume of ethanol and placed into an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes. The dispersed samples were drop casted onto lacey carbon TEM grids. The mass of SnSb deposited onto the current collectors was measured using a Sartorius Microbalance (Sartorius SE2, ±0.25 μg repeatability). XRD was performed on an Empyrion with Cu Kα X-ray gun.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nTo examine the structural and morphological changes of the samples before and after the coating treatment, XRD and SEM analyses were conducted on the three samples. As shown in Fig. 1b–d, the XRD patterns confirm that all synthesized materials retain the typical α-NaFeO2 layered hexagonal structure (space group Rm), indicating that the crystal structure of the materials was not altered by the coating process. The lattice parameters refined through Rietveld analysis (Tables S1–3†) reveal changes in the calculated sodium-ion occupancy and the c-axis value. After coating, the sodium content in NFMT-B and NFMT-L decreases slightly, indicating that a small amount of sodium atoms reacts with titanium on the surface to form the coating layer. This reaction increases the Na–O layer spacing and leads to an expansion of the c-axis value. These results suggest that during the high-temperature treatment at 800 °C, trace amounts of titanium are incorporated into the surface transition metal layer. NFMT-L exhibits the largest interlayer spacing, as the surface coating and doping achieved through the liquid-phase coating method are the most uniform. In contrast, some TiO2 in NFMT-B does not integrate with the substrate, resulting in a less uniform coating layer and reduced titanium incorporation into the material. Fig. 1e and f display the SEM images along with the corresponding EDS characterization, revealing the microstructure and elemental distribution of the samples. The pristine NFM sample exhibits spherical secondary particles (∼10 μm) formed by the aggregation of numerous plate-like primary particles. However, the surface of the bare NFM particles contains numerous small, viscous particles, likely residual alkaline substances such as Na2CO3. After high-temperature sintering, both NFMT-B and NFMT-L samples preserve the spherical morphology of the original material. Notably, in the NFMT-B sample, which underwent milling with TiO2, high-temperature sintering triggers a reaction between TiO2 and residual surface alkaline substances. This reaction produces island-like coatings that gradually fill surface pores and partially cover the material. In contrast, the NFMT-L sample, treated via liquid-phase coating, exhibits a clean and smooth surface with a uniformly distributed coating layer.\nThe microstructure and morphology of the coated samples were further compared using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming the uniformity of the Na2Ti3O7 coating (5–8 nm) on the NFMT-L sample. Fig. S2† and 2a show the high-magnification TEM images of the NFM-P and NFMT-B samples, respectively. In Region I, the lattice fringe spacing of 0.254 nm corresponds to the (−212) crystal plane of Na2Ti3O7. Region II exhibits an interlayer spacing of 0.318 nm, which matches the (012) crystal plane of the NFM-P material, indicating that the crystalline structure of NFM-P remains unchanged during the coating process. However, due to the uneven distribution of TiO2 during the ball milling process, the coating layer in Fig. 2a shows significant thickness non-uniformity. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping further reveals regions in the coating layer containing only Ti and O, suggesting incomplete reaction of TiO2 during the high-temperature treatment. Additionally, as shown in Fig. S3,† lattice fringes corresponding to the (101) crystal plane of the rutile TiO2 phase were detected in the coating layer.\nIn contrast, as depicted in Fig. 2b and S4,† the NFMT-L sample prepared using the liquid-phase coating method with tetrabutyl titanate exhibits a uniform and continuous coating layer. In Region III, an interplanar spacing of 0.263 nm was observed, corresponding to the (112) plane of Na2Ti3O7. In Region IV, lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.213 nm, observed through fast Fourier transform (FFT), matched the (104) plane of NFM-P. This further confirms that the coating process preserved the layered crystal structure of the NFM-P material.\nAdditionally, the EDS results further verified the uniformity of the Na2Ti3O7 coating.\nTo explore the mechanism by which different coating methods affect the material's surface, XPS analysis was performed. Compared to NFM-P, the Ni 2p peak intensity of the NFMT-B and NFMT-L samples was enhanced, while the CO peak was weakened, indicating that the sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) on the NFM-P surface was consumed. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Ni signal was weakest in the NFM-P sample due to the coverage of sodium carbonate. The proportion of Ni3+ significantly increased in the Na2Ti3O7-coated samples. This is due to the exposure of the cathode material to air during the coating process, which causes sodium to be extracted from the material's surface, leading to an increase in Ni3+ content. The ball-milled coated NFMT-B sample exhibited the strongest Ni signal, likely due to uneven coating. The Ni 2p peak of the NFMT-L sample, prepared by the liquid-phase coating method, was relatively stronger, indicating that the Na2Ti3O7 coatings of sample NFMT-L were thin and uniform.\nThe C 1s spectrum of NFM-P shows a distinct CO peak at 289.6 eV, attributed to residual alkaline substances such as Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 on the surface (Fig. 3b). After coating, the intensity of the CO peak significantly decreased in both coated samples, suggesting that the sodium-containing surface compounds were transformed into a Na2Ti3O7 coating layer during the coating process. In the Ti 2p spectrum shown in Fig. 3c, two peaks at 462.3 eV and 456.6 eV correspond to Ti4+. These peaks are absent in NFM-P but are observed on the surfaces of Ti-modified NFMT-B and NFMT-L, confirming the presence of Na2Ti3O7 in the coating. Notably, the Ti 2p signal in the NFMT-L sample is weaker, further indicating the formation of a thinner Na2Ti3O7 layer. This observation is consistent with the uniform Na2Ti3O7 coating observed in the TEM analysis.\nThe wettability of an electrode is mainly related to the number of hydrophilic functional groups of binder-based materials and the pore distribution of the electrode, which can be evaluated using the dynamic contact angle measurements (Fig. 4a). The pristine sample (NFM-P) exhibits a hydrophobic surface (average contact angle: 108°) due to the PVDF binder. After coating, NFMT-B shows a reduced contact angle (95°), attributed to partial Na2Ti3O7 coverage. Notably, NFMT-L achieves a significantly lower contact angle (79°) owing to the uniform ultrathin Na2Ti3O7 coating on secondary particles, which enhances electrolyte wettability. This demonstrates that uniformity in coating critically improves interfacial compatibility.\nAdditionally, electrode adhesion strength was tested (Fig. 4b and c). The results showed that the peel strength of NFM-P, NFM-B, and NFM-L gradually increased. This phenomenon can be attributed to the excessive residual alkaline substances on the NFM-P surface, which led to PVDF crosslinking and formed weak bonding points between the material particles and the current collector. These weak bonds made it easier for the particles to detach during the peel test, thus reducing the adhesion strength. To further verify this observation, the stirring time for the titration of the residual alkaline substances on the material surface was determined (Fig. 4d), and the contents of Na2CO3 and NaOH on the surfaces of the three samples were titrated (Fig. 4e). A comparison of residual alkali titration before and after coating indicated that the sodium source in the coating layer primarily originated from residual sodium-containing compounds, such as Na2CO3 and NaOH, on the material surface. The results were consistent with previous experiments, confirming that the Na2Ti3O7 coating effectively reduced the residual alkaline content on the material surface.\nFig. 5a presents the in situ XRD patterns of NFM-P during charge and discharge, revealing the mechanism by which Na2Ti3O7 influences the crystal structure throughout the cycling process. The continuous shift in the diffraction peak positions of NFM-P indicates structural transitions between the O3 and P3 phases. The significant changes in lattice parameters reflect substantial crystal volume variation during cycling, which leads to the cracking of spherical particles and negatively impacts battery performance. The pronounced lattice parameter changes in NFM-P are primarily attributed to intense phase transitions and side reactions between the material and the electrolyte. In contrast, Fig. 5b shows the in situ XRD patterns of NFMT-L under the same current density during charge–discharge cycling. The Na2Ti3O7 coating effectively suppresses the P3–O3 phase transition, resulting in minimal lattice parameter changes throughout the entire cycle. These findings underscore the critical role of the Na2Ti3O7 coating in stabilizing the interface structure and mitigating side reactions between the material surface and the electrolyte.\nDifferent coating processes created distinct surface coverage environments on the cathode material particles. Fig. 6 compares the electrochemical performance of the three materials to evaluate the effectiveness of the two coating techniques. The cycling performance was assessed at 120 mA h g−1. After 200 cycles, the capacity retention rates of NFM-P, NCMT-B, and NCMT-L were 67.69%, 78.10%, and 85.66%, respectively (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b shows the activation process at 25 °C and a current density of 12 mA g−1. The initial discharge capacities of NFM-P, NFMT-B, and NFMT-L are 135.62 mA h g−1, 137.51 mA h g−1, and 139.54 mA h g−1, respectively. The residual alkali on the surface of the samples was consumed to form Na2Ti3O7, which lowered the voltage of the redox reactions. As a result, both NFMT-B and NFMT-L exhibited higher initial coulombic efficiencies. It can be seen from Fig. 6b that the first charge curve of the electrode from the uncoated sample showed severe polarization, a plateau potential of ∼3.5 V, and the highest charging capacity. A large number of literature studies have reported that these three features are the electrochemical characteristics of surface residual alkali. The modified samples exhibit redox reactions at ∼3.1 V, which is a normal plateau voltage for O3-NFM cathodes with lower polarization.\nThe cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of all three cathodes for the first three cycles are provided in Fig. S5.† It can be observed that the NFM-P sample exhibits poor reproducibility during the initial cycles, with a relatively high oxidation voltage in the first cycle. This behavior is attributed to the residual alkaline substances on the surface, which hinder the redox reactions in the battery. In contrast, the modified NFMT-B and NFMT-L cathodes show good peak-repeatability, indicating that the Na2Ti3O7 coating effectively reduces the surface residual alkali and further enhances material stability, consistent with the charge–discharge results in Fig. 6b. The delayed oxidation peak in NFMT-L reflects slower CEI formation, consistent with enhanced structural stability (Fig. 6b). The shift in the oxidation peak in the first cycle for NFMT-L is due to the more uniform Na2Ti3O7 coating, which slows down the formation of the CEI (solid electrolyte interphase) layer during the initial charging process.\nCoating the particle surface with Na2Ti3O7, a fast sodium-ion conductor substantially enhanced the rate performance of the material by improving its ion transport kinetics. As the current density increased, the performance gap between the uncoated NFM-P and the coated samples became more evident. At a high current density of 10C, NFM-P retained a capacity of only 70.67 mA h g−1, while NFMT-B and NFMT-L maintained capacities of 82.57 mA h g−1 and 85.77 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 6c). This demonstrates that the more uniform coating in NFMT-L contributes to its superior rate capability.\nThe sodium-ion diffusion coefficients (DNa+) calculated using GITT during the charge and discharge processes (Fig. 6d and e) indicate that the coated materials (NFMT-B and NFMT-L) consistently outperform NFM-P. In particular, NFMT-L demonstrates exceptional sodium-ion kinetics, which is consistent with its superior rate performance. Fig. 6f–h compare the dQ/dV profiles of the three samples during the 10th and 200th cycles, where NFMT-L exhibits the smallest differences in redox peaks. Fig. 6i–k present electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) at different voltage positions during the first charge and discharge cycle, which can be used to evaluate interfacial impedance. The impedance was modeled, with the semicircles representing the solution resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct). At 2.7 V, the Rct for NFMT-L was only 652.3 ohms (Table S4†), indicating that its uniform Na2Ti3O7 coating offers excellent sodium-ion transport kinetics.\nIn this study, detailed characterization was performed on the cycled samples. The modified NFMT-L and NFMT-B samples exhibited minimal deviations in the characteristic diffraction peaks (003) and (104) compared to the standard JCPDS card, indicating that their crystal structures were well preserved (Fig. 7d). In contrast, the XRD results of cycled NFM-P showed significant differences. After cycling, the secondary particles of NFM-P developed cracks, which hindered the reinsertion of some sodium ions. This resulted in an increased interlayer spacing, causing the (003) plane to shift to a lower angle and the intensity of the (104) plane to weaken. Consequently, a sodium-deficient P3 phase structure was formed. Further analysis of Fig. 7a1–a2 reveals pronounced cracking in the NFM-P material after 200 cycles. This behavior is likely due to severe structural transformations during electrochemical cycling, compounded by side reactions with the electrolyte. Such structural instability is a critical factor in the degradation of electrochemical performance. For the NFMT-B sample, localized SEM images (Fig. 7b1–b2) revealed the presence of some fractured particles. However, the NFMT-L sample exhibited superior structural integrity, with its particles maintaining a more intact morphology (Fig. 7c1–c2). This demonstrates that the modification applied to NFMT-L was more effective in preserving the structural stability of the material during cycling. The enhanced stability of NFMT-L likely plays a key role in improving its electrochemical performance and extending its cycling life. These findings underscore the importance of surface modification strategies in stabilizing the phase transitions of cathode materials, offering valuable insights for advancing the performance and durability of sodium-ion battery cathodes.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Synthesis of materials\nO3-type Na0.95Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM-P) with controlled crystal facets was prepared via a molten salt method. Pre-calculated Na2CO3 (5% excess, Aladdin, 99.0%) and Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3(OH)2 (CNGR, 99.9%) were uniformly mixed and pressed into pellets under 10 MPa. The mixture was placed in an atmospheric furnace, heated to 850 °C (3 °C min−1) in dehumidified air, held for 20 h, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. For the preparation of NFMT-B, NFM-P and TiO2 were mixed at a mass ratio of 1:1000 via simple solid-state ball milling, sintered at 800 °C for 2 hours, naturally cooled, and ground into powder. For NFMT-L, NFM-P was mixed with an ethanol solution of tetrabutyl titanate at a 5 wt% ratio, stirred for 20 minutes, and vacuum-filtered. The sintering process for NFMT-L was the same as that for NFMT-B, and the resulting product was ground into powder to obtain the NFMT-L sample (Fig. 1a).\n\n2.2. Material characterization\nAll materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Bruker Advance). In situ XRD tests were performed at a current density of 12 mA g−1 to study the structural evolution of the materials during sodium-ion deintercalation. The XRD results were refined using the Rietveld method with GSAS software. The microstructure of the materials was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL), while energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed to analyze the surface elemental distribution. The electrolyte contact angle was measured using a DataPhysics OCA20 instrument (Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi, UK) was used to investigate the elemental states of surface elements.\n\n2.3. Electrochemical measurements\nFirst, the cathode material and acetylene black (SP) were added to an agate mortar and ground together. Then, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were added, and the mixture was stirred evenly to prepare the composite slurry. The resulting slurry was coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 100 °C for 12 h to remove NMP, forming the cathode. CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with extremely low oxygen and moisture levels.

Synthesis of materials\nO3-type Na0.95Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM-P) with controlled crystal facets was prepared via a molten salt method. Pre-calculated Na2CO3 (5% excess, Aladdin, 99.0%) and Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3(OH)2 (CNGR, 99.9%) were uniformly mixed and pressed into pellets under 10 MPa. The mixture was placed in an atmospheric furnace, heated to 850 °C (3 °C min−1) in dehumidified air, held for 20 h, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. For the preparation of NFMT-B, NFM-P and TiO2 were mixed at a mass ratio of 1:1000 via simple solid-state ball milling, sintered at 800 °C for 2 hours, naturally cooled, and ground into powder. For NFMT-L, NFM-P was mixed with an ethanol solution of tetrabutyl titanate at a 5 wt% ratio, stirred for 20 minutes, and vacuum-filtered. The sintering process for NFMT-L was the same as that for NFMT-B, and the resulting product was ground into powder to obtain the NFMT-L sample (Fig. 1a).\n\n2.2. Material characterization\nAll materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Bruker Advance). In situ XRD tests were performed at a current density of 12 mA g−1 to study the structural evolution of the materials during sodium-ion deintercalation. The XRD results were refined using the Rietveld method with GSAS software. The microstructure of the materials was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL), while energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed to analyze the surface elemental distribution. The electrolyte contact angle was measured using a DataPhysics OCA20 instrument (Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi, UK) was used to investigate the elemental states of surface elements.\n\n2.3. Electrochemical measurements\nFirst, the cathode material and acetylene black (SP) were added to an agate mortar and ground together. Then, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were added, and the mixture was stirred evenly to prepare the composite slurry. The resulting slurry was coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 100 °C for 12 h to remove NMP, forming the cathode. CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with extremely low oxygen and moisture levels. Electrochemical performance tests were conducted in the voltage range of 2–4 V at 30 °C using the NEWARE CT-4008 system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests (frequency range: 0.01–10 kHz, amplitude: 5 mV) were performed on an IVIUM electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests were carried out on the NEWARE CT-4008 system at 12 mA g−1 for charge/discharge experiments.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The NCVP can also be indexed to the same space group, but an impurity phase (Cu) is observed. Tables S1–S3 (ESI†) list the lattice parameters and detailed atomic occupancies of the materials. The crystal structure of NCFVP is provided in Fig. 1b, and the doped Cu and Fe occupy the V sites. The NCFVP consists of MO6 (M = V, Fe or Cu) octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra connected in a three-dimensional way, which provides an ideal diffusion pathway for Na+.\nDue to the presence of citric acid and acetate ions in the raw materials, the products contain a certain amount of carbon, which effectively increases the electrical conductivity of the materials. From thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. 1c), the carbon contents of NCFVP, NFVP, and NCVP are calculated to be 7.8, 7.3, and 9.4 wt%, respectively. The difference carbon contents are originated from the different Cu(CH3COO)2Cu·H2O feeding amounts, which contains carbon. Raman spectra (Fig. 1d) is used to probe the microstates of carbon. The peaks at 1334 and 1580 cm−1 correspond to the D and G bands of carbon, respectively. The calculated ID/IG for NCFVP, NFVP, and NCVP are 0.98, 0.99, and 0.97, respectively. The relatively low ID/IG value suggests the partial graphitization of carbon. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR, Fig. S2, ESI†) spectra reveals structural information of the samples. The symmetric stretching vibration of P–O bond is observed at 1185 cm−1, while the asymmetric stretching vibration is reflected by the bands at 576 and 1023 cm−1. The peaks located at 631 and 976 cm−1 are observed for all the samples, which are from the vibrations of V–O bonds in the VO6 octahedra. From the nitrogen sorption analysis (Fig. 1e and f), the surface areas and pore size distributions (PSD) can be obtained. The surface areas of NCFVP, NFVP, and NCVP are 69.5, 36.5, and 21.6 m2 g−1, respectively. All samples contain abundant mesopores as can be observed in the PSD curves (Fig. 1f). The abundant mesopores would facilitate the penetration of electrolyte, contributing to the rate performance.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) offers information on the elemental composition and surface valence states of the transition metal species. The survey spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†) identify the elemental composition of NCFVP, NFVP, and NCVP. The C 1s spectrum of NCFVP (Fig. S4, ESI†) exhibits three components from C–C (284.8 eV), CO–C (286.5 eV), and COO bonds (289.5 eV). The V 2p spectrum (Fig. 1g) present two major peaks at 524.0 and 517.0 eV from the V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 of V(III), respectively. The Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 1h) shows characteristic peaks at 712.3 (2p3/2) and 724.6 eV (2p1/2) from Fe(II), 715.6 (2p3/2) and 726.4 eV (2p1/2) from Fe(III). The Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 1i) presents characteristic peaks of Cu(II) at 934.4 (Cu 2p1/2) and 954.3 eV (Cu 2p3/2).\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows the microstructure of NCFVP. The NCFVP is composed of micron spheres with sizes of 0.5–5 μm (Fig. 2a and b). The NFVP and NCVP also present a micron spherical morphology with a non-negligible fraction of broken spheres (Fig. S5, ESI†). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) shows that the highly crystalline NCFVP is encapsulated by a thin carbon layer (∼5 nm) on the surface (Fig. 2c). By zooming into the square region in Fig. 2c, stripes with a lattice spacing of 0.28 nm is observed, coinciding with the (116) spacing of the rhombic NCFVP (Fig. 2d). Fast Fourier transform pattern (Fig. 2d inset) confirms the high crystallinity of the NCFVP. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings reveal that the Na, Cu, Fe, V, P, O, and C are evenly distributed within the microspheres (Fig. 2e).\nThe Na storage capacity of the materials was tested in a potential window of 1.5–3.8 V with Na sheet as the reference electrode. Fig. 3a and Fig. S6 (ESI†) present the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of NCFVP, NFVP, and NCVP. The NCFVP shows redox peaks at 1.65/1.58 V, 2.55/2.44 V, and 3.51/3.33 V, which are from the V2+/V3+, Fe2+/Fe3+, and V3+/V4+ redox couples, respectively. The cathodic peak at ∼3.3 V splits into two, one at 3.33 V and the other at 3.37 V. The splitting of the cathodic peak can be attributed to the structural rearrangement caused by the migration of Na+ from Na (1) site to Na (2) site. The overlapping CV profiles demonstrate the excellent Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation reversibility. The CV profiles of NFVP also exhibit three redox pairs, almost identical to those of NCFVP. The NCVP presents three pairs of redox peaks, one from V2+/V3+ (1.73/1.56 V), one from V3+/V4+ (3.47/3.30 V), and the other from Cu+/Cu2+ (3.01/2.19 V).\nThe cycling performances of NCFVP, NFVP and NCVP are compared at 0.2 C (1 C = 150 mA g−1). The first discharge capacity of NCFVP at 0.2 C reaches 121.6 mA h g−1 (Fig. 3b and c). Over 200 cycles, the capacity keeps at 120.4 mA h g−1, and the capacity degradation is as low as 1%. At the same C rate, the NFVP and NCVP exhibit much lower initial discharge capacities (100.5 mA h g−1 for NFVP and 109.8 mA h g−1 for NCVP) and capacity retentions (86.8% for NFVP and 62.7% for NCVP) (Fig. S7, ESI†). The NCFVP presents three well-defined charge/discharge plateaus at ∼3.5, 2.5, and 1.6 V. From high potential to low potential, the charge/discharge plateaus are from the V3+/V4+, Fe2+/Fe3+, and V2+/V3+ redox couples. The absence of charge/discharge plateaus for Cu2+/Cu+ may related to its relatively low content.\nThe rate performances of NCFVP, NFVP, and NCVP are tested at 0.1–5 C. For NCFVP, discharge capacities of 160.0, 131.5, 117.8, 104.6, 94.7, and 87.7 mA h g−1 are obtained at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C (Fig. 3d and e), respectively. With the returning of C-rate to 0.1 C, the capacity recovers to 156.9 mA h g−1. Compared to both NFVP and NCVP, the NCFVP manifests much higher discharge capacity, no matter what the C-rate is (Fig. S8, ESI†). Fig. 3f compares the capacity, average discharge potential, and energy density of NCFVP with other phosphate/pyrophosphate-based SIBs cathode materials. Based on a first discharge capacity of 160 mA h g−1 and an average discharge potential of 2.8 V, the energy density of NCFVP reaches ∼450 W h kg−1, which exceeds most phosphate/pyrophosphate-based SIB cathode materials.\nThe samples are then cycled at 2 C for 1000 cycles (Fig. 3g). The NCFVP manifests a first discharge capacity of 107.2 mA h g−1 and a capacity degradation of 14.6%. Compared to NCFVP, the NFVP and NCVP exhibit much lower initial discharge capacity and capacity retention. Ex situ XRD (Fig. S9, ESI†) reveals the crystal structure of NCFVP is well maintained after cycling, verifying the ideal structural stability of NCFVP. The robust crystal structure is responsible for the ideal cyclability of NCFVP.\nGalvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and multi-scan rate CV are employed to study the reaction kinetics of NCFVP. The GITT time-potential curve and the corresponding Na+ diffusion coefficients (DNa+) are plotted in Fig. 4a (the calculation method can be found in the ESI†). The cells are charged/discharged at a steady rate of 0.1 C for 20 minutes, and then the current is cut off with a 20-minute relaxation period to reach equilibrium (Fig. S10, ESI†). The DNa+ is in the range of 10−9–10−12 cm2 s−1, which is comparable to most reported NASICON type cathodes.\nThe multi-scan rate CV profiles are shown in Fig. 4b. The DNa+ can be calculated from the slopes of the fitted straight lines in Fig. 4c (the calculation method can be found in the ESI†). The DNa+ calculated from the redox peaks 1–6 are 3.6 × 10−11, 6.1 × 10−11, 8.9 × 10−11, 8.0 × 10−11, 1.1 × 10−9, and 1.0 × 10−9 cm2 s−1, respectively (Fig. 4c). The relationship between peak current (i) and scan rate (v) provides information on the charge storage mechanism: i = avb. The electrochemical reaction is dominated by diffusion as b approaches 0.5, and capacitive behavior predominates as b approaches 1. The calculated b-values for peaks 1–6 are 0.88, 0.88, 0.73, 0.77, 0.70, and 0.77 (Fig. S10, ESI†), respectively. This indicates that both diffusion and capacitive controlled behaviors play significant roles in the electrochemical process of NCFVP. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. S11, ESI†) shows a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 310.0 Ω for NCFVP. This value is smaller than that of NFVP (413.2 Ω) while larger than that of NCVP (161.4 Ω). The Rct decreases with increasing Cu content, suggesting the introduction of Cu is beneficial for promoting the Na+ diffusion.\nThe structural evolution of NCFVP during Na+ insertion/extraction is studied by in situ XRD. Before cycling, characteristic diffractions of NCFVP can be clearly observed (Fig. 4d). All the diffractions move toward high angle continuously during charging and move back to their original positions during discharging, suggesting a solid solution reaction mechanism. The highly reversible change of diffractions demonstrates the ideal electrochemical reversibility as well as the robust structural stability of NCFVP. Take the (116) diffraction as an example, both the peak position and intensity can be recovered to its original state after one charge and discharge cycle (Fig. S12, ESI†).\nA full cell (N/P = 1.2) is assembled with NCFVP as the cathode and pre-sodiumed commercial HC as the anode (Fig. 5a). The commercial HC manifests a steady capacity of 264.8 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. S13, ESI†). CV curves of the full cell show two anodic peaks at 2.33 and 3.58 V and two cathodic peaks at 1.94 and 3.12 V (Fig. 5b). The NCFVP//HC full cell manifests a capacity of 74.1 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C and a capacity degradation 22.5% over 100 cycles (Fig. 5c and d). Based on the mass of NCFVP, the full cell offers a high capacity of 100.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C. Even at 2 C, a capacity of 64.5 mA h g−1 is achieved (Fig. 5e and f).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nThe XRD pattern and the crystal structure of the as-synthesized NFMTO are displayed in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The XRD pattern can be well indexed with the Rm space group. Rietveld refinement reveals the presence of <1% NiO impurity in the as-synthesized material (Fig. 1a) which is often encountered in the syntheses of nickel-based sodium transition metal oxides. The obtained cell parameters of the NFMTO cathode are a = b = 2.9794(8) Å and c = 16.0204(8) Å with an interlayer spacing of NaO6 and those of TM/LiO6 are 3.103 Å and 2.237 Å, respectively. The corresponding crystallographic parameters are listed in Table S1 of the ESI.† Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis reveals the composition of the NFTMO cathode to be Na0.987Li0.112Ni0.296Fe0.104Mn0.247Ti0.252O2, which is closer to the targeted composition. The morphology of the NFMTO cathode was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1c reveals that the cathode consists of hexagonal-shaped particles in the range of 1 to 5 μm. The EDS mapping confirms the uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, Mn, Ti, Na, and O in the as-synthesized material.\nThe electrochemical sodium storage performance of the NFMTO cathode material was first investigated in the potential window of 4.0–2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 at a 0.1C rate (Fig. 2a). During the first cycle, it exhibits charge/discharge capacities of 132/123 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 93%. The voltage profiles entail a short plateau at 3.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 followed by a slopping region until 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0, which can be ascribed to the activity of the Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+ redox couple. The corresponding dQ/dV profiles show sharp and broad redox peaks at ∼3.0 V and ∼3.56 V vs. Na+/Na0, corresponding to the O3 to P3 phase transformation and solid-solution formation, respectively. It is worth noting that a small kink in the dQ/dV profiles is noticed closer to 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0, which could be the onset of OP2 phase formation and will be discussed later in the manuscript. Furthermore, we extended the upper cut-off voltage of galvanostatic cycling to 4.2 V vs. Na+/Na0 to enhance the Na storage capacity of the NFMTO cathode. As a result, a greater amount of sodium ions is exchanged compared to in the 4.0–2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 window, leading to the first charge/discharge capacities of 150/135 mA h g−1. The corresponding dQ/dV profiles display a prominent redox peak at ∼4.1 V vs. Na+/Na0 due to the P3–OP2 phase transition. Furthermore, we studied the cycling stabilities of the NFMTO cathode in the 4.0–2.0 and 4.2–2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 potential windows at 1C and 2C rates. In the 4.0–2.0 V window, the NFMTO cathode retains 93% and 88% of its initial capacity after 100 and 200 cycles, respectively, at 1C rate (Fig. 3a). It is worth mentioning that the NFMTO cathode displays comparable or even better capacity retention compared to the recently reported Ni/Mn-based HEO-type cathodes (Table S2†). Upon extending the upper cut-off voltage to 4.2 V, the same cathode displays slightly inferior capacity retention (84 and 78% retention after 100 and 200 cycles, respectively). Similar trends in the capacity retention are also observed at 2C rate (Fig. 3b). The NFMTO cathode retains 77% and 66% of its initial discharge capacity in the potential range of 4.0–2.0 V and 4.2–2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 at 2C rate, respectively after 400 cycles. The capacity decay occurring in the 4.2–2.0 V window can be ascribed to more P3–OP2 phase transition at higher voltages. The stacking defects of TMO2 layers along the c-direction give rise to the OP2 phase.\nThe cycling stability of the NFTMO cathode is further corroborated with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 3d). The first small semicircle in the high-frequency region (Fig. S1a–d†) corresponds to the impedance due to the electrified interface (RIF) arising from adsorption/desorption and migration of Na+-ions on the surface of the cathode, while the second semicircle in the high-mid frequency region denotes the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the cathode/electrolyte interface. The slopping line at the low-frequency region represents the Warburg impedance (Zw) attributed to the diffusion of Na+-ions into the cathode material. As the cycling proceeds, another semicircle was noticed in the high-mid frequency region of EIS spectra (Fig. S1b–d†), due to the electrolyte decomposition, which in turn produces a passivation layer on the surface of the cathode and creates an additional resistance for the movement of ions and electrons across the cathode-electrolyte interface (RCEI). The EIS fittings show the increase in RCEI and Rct values for the initial ten cycles (Table S3†). However, these values stabilize after 50–100 cycles (Fig. S1c and d†), explaining the robustness of the CEI and better cycling stability of the NFMTO cathode (93% retention after 100 cycles at 1C).\nNext, we checked the rate capability of the NFMTO cathode at various C-rates in the windows of 4.0–2.0 and 4.2–2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0. The NFMTO cathode delivers discharge capacities of 122.5, 118, 113, 108, 102.5 and 78 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5C rates, respectively, in the window of 4.0–2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0. However, the same cathode renders slightly lower capacities at higher C-rates upon increasing the upper cut-off voltage to 4.2 V (130, 116.8, 105, 96.5, 86.8, and 63 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5C rates, respectively) (Fig. 3c). The drop in the discharge capacities could be ascribed to the lower Na+-ion mobility due to generation of more stacking faults at high voltages along with oxygen redox activity.\nTo examine the effect of Li/Ti co-substitution on the Na+-ion intercalation kinetics, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiment was performed to determine the apparent diffusion coefficient of sodium ions (DNa+) during the charge/discharge processes. The GITT voltage profiles of the NFTMO cathode and the calculated DNa+ for the charge/discharge processes are displayed in Fig. 3e and the schematic illustrations of single current pulses are shown in Fig. S2.† At the start of the charging process, the DNa+ is estimated to be in the range of 2.6 × 10−9 to 4.5 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 until 3.0 V vs. Na+/Na0, which diminishes to 1.31 × 10−10 to 1.04 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 during the O3–P3 transition. As the charging proceeds through the slopping voltage region (3.2–3.93 V vs. Na+/Na0), the DNa+ is maintained in the range of 9.31 × 10−10 to 1.13 × 10−9 cm2 s−1. Thereafter, we notice a drop in the DNa+ values (3.48 × 10−10 to 2.72 × 10−10 cm2 s−1) as the voltage reaches 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 due to the formation of OP2. However, these values are higher than most of the reported values (10−11 to 10−12 cm2 s−1), which corroborates the enhanced rate performance of the NFMTO cathode at higher C-rates. Overall, we estimate that the DNa+ values of the NFTMO cathode are in the range of 10−9 to 10−10 cm2 s−1 during the charge/discharge process, which is at least one order higher than that of the reported HEOs. The Li/Ti co-substitution in the HEO cathode enhances the Na+-ion diffusion kinetics, rendering better rate capabilities at higher C-rates.\nInspired by the enhanced electrochemical performance of the NFMTO cathode, we performed in situ XRD and ex situ XAS measurements to understand the changes in the crystal structure and oxidation states during the (de)sodiation processes in the 4.0–2.0 V window. Previous reports showed that binary layered oxides such as NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 undergo a series of phase transitions (O3–O′3–P3–P′3), while the ternary cathodes (e.g., NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2, and NaNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 display alleviated phase changes (O3–P3–P′3) during the cycling in the potential window of 4.0–2.0 V. Fig. 4a displays the in situ XRD patterns of the NFMTO cathode during the first cycle. The refined lattice parameters from the corresponding XRD patterns are displayed in Fig. 4b. During the removal of the first 0.18 moles of Na ions, the (003) and (006) peaks shift toward lower 2θ values (indicating increased interplanar d-spacing due to the repulsion between adjacent TMO2 layers), whereas the (102), (102) and (104) peaks shift toward higher 2θ values due to the contraction in the ab-plane. As a result, the c- and (a/b)-parameters increase and decrease, respectively. During the subsequent Na-ion removal in the range of 0.8 < x < 0.77, another set of reflections appears at 2θ = 15.8, 32.0, 36.0 and 37.2° in addition to the O3 phase, which could be indexed with the P3-type structure. This phase transformation also hints at an inhibition for Fe-migration from the TM-layer to the Na-layer. Furthermore, the P3 phase remains stable until 3.93 V vs. Na+/Na0 (or x = 0.54 moles) with a gradual left shift in the (003) peak due to Na-removal from the structure. As the charging voltage reaches 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0, a slight shift for the (003) peak to higher 2θ values with diminished intensity was observed, which corresponds to the OP2 phase. The overall changes in a, c, and V parameters during the first charge are estimated to be 3.08%, 4.87%, and 1.69% respectively, which is comparable to those of recently reported multielement HEO materials. During the subsequent discharge, the reverse order of the above-mentioned phase transitions is observed without any additional phases, indicating the complete reversibility of phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe highly reversible phase transitions of O3–P3–OP2 from the 2D contour plot of the in situ XRD patterns collected during two successive cycles (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, we performed XRD and SEM measurements on the cycled NFMTO cathodes after 200 cycles. The XRD pattern of the cycled NFMTO cathode shows the retention of the original O3 structure regardless of the P3–OP2 transformation at high voltages (Fig. S3†) which is different from what has been previously reported. The SEM images confirm the retention of particle morphology after extensive cycling. Overall, we find that the Li/Ti co-substitution not only suppresses the phase transitions starting from the O3 structure but also enables highly reversible phase transformations, leading to better structural stability during cycling.\nNext, to probe the charge compensation mechanism during the first charge/discharge cycle, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were performed on the pristine and cycled NFMTO cathodes. The change in average oxidation states of transition metal elements (Ni, Mn, Fe, and Ti) was analyzed using normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Fig. 5a–d). Comparing the XANES spectra of the reference compounds (e.g., NiO, LiNiO2, Mn2O3, MnO2, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and TiO2) it was confirmed that the pristine NFMTO cathode contains Ni, Fe, Mn, and Ti in +2, +3, +4, and +4 oxidation states, respectively. No apparent shifts in the edge energy lines of Mn, Fe, and Ti K-edges are observed (Fig. 5a–c), which suggests that no further oxidation occurs for these elements (i.e., electrochemically inactive) during the charging process. But the decrease in the intensity of the edge energy line implies probable changes in the local environment. Moreover, the intensities of pre-edges increase as the voltage is increased to 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 (see the inset of Fig. 5a–c), confirming the distorted environments of (Fe/Mn/Ti)O6 octahedra. The Ni K-edge shifts from 8341.31 eV to 8344.01 eV as the cathode is charged to 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na0, indicating the oxidation of Ni2+. We estimate a removal of 0.5 moles of sodium during the first charge. Considering the electrochemical inactivity of Fe, Mn, and Ti, the extraction of 0.3 moles of Na ions can be ascribed to the concomitant oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and the remaining 0.2 moles is removed through the oxidation of Ni3+ to Ni4+, with an estimated overall Ni oxidation state of +3.7 at the end of the first charge. The observed energy shift ΔE ≈ 2.7 eV matches with the expected oxidation state changes of the NFMTO cathode. As the cathode is fully discharged back to 2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0, all the transition metal K-edges shift back to their original positions, indicating full structural reversibility during sodium (de)intercalation.\nFurthermore, to test the practical applicability of the NFMTO cathode material, a full Na-ion cell was assembled with a hard carbon anode. The hard carbon was pre-cycled before assembling the full cell. Fig. 6a shows the voltage-capacity profiles of the full hard carbon‖NFMTO Na-ion cell cycled in the potential window of 4.0–1.5 V vs. HC at 0.1C rate. It delivers a reversible capacity of 116 mA h g−1cathode at an average voltage of 2.9 V, leading to an energy density of 336.4 W h kgcathode−1. The full cell also sustains higher rates and delivers capacities of 116, 93, 82, 70, and 58 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C rates, respectively (Fig. 6b). Most importantly, the NFMTO‖hard carbon cell retains 62% of its initial capacity even after 1000 cycles at 0.5C rate (Fig. 6c).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of O3-Na1.0Li0.1Ni0.3Fe0.1Mn0.25Ti0.25O2 (NFMTO)\nThe O3-Na1.0Li0.1Ni0.3Fe0.1Mn0.25Ti0.25O2 (NFMTO) compound was synthesized through solid-state synthesis using sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) (≥99.997%, Sigma-Aldrich), manganese oxide (Mn2O3) (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), nickel oxide (NiO) (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), iron oxide (Fe2O3) (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and titanium oxide (TiO2) (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors. Stoichiometric amounts of these precursors were mixed in a stainless-steel jar by planetary ball milling at 1080 rpm for 40 min. After collecting the mixture, it was heated at 600 °C for 5 h in air to ensure the removal of the carbonates and adsorbed moisture. Next, the sample was ground and pressed into a pellet, and it was refired at 850 °C for 24 h in air. After completion of the reaction at around 200 °C it was quickly transferred to an Ar-filled glovebox to prevent any air-exposure.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nThe powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the NFMTO compound was recorded using a Rigaku Smartlab SE diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 10–90° in Bragg–Brentano geometry. Structural refinements were performed using Fullprof software. The morphology and the elemental distribution of the NFMTO cathode were investigated with a field emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Gemini SEM 500, FEI Inspect F 50 operating at 10 kV). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed on the cathode materials collected at different states of charge (SOCs). The electrodes were sealed inside Kapton tape to avoid air exposure during the measurements. Spectra were collected at room temperature for the Ni–K edge (8383 eV), Mn–K edge (6589 eV), Fe–K edge (7162 eV) and Ti–K edge (5016 eV) in transmission and fluorescence mode at PETRA III (P65 beamline, operating at 100 mA and 7 GeV), DESY, Germany. The standard samples (LiNiO2, NiO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, Mn2O3, MnO2, and TiO2) were mixed with boron nitride and pressed into pellets (10 mm diameter, thickness 0.9–1.1 mm). The dwell time for each scan was 180 s and two scans were collected for each sample. Normalization of XANES spectra was performed using ATHENA software. Elemental analysis was executed by using an Avio 220 max inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectrometer, PerkinElmer.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nAll the electrochemical measurements were performed in two-electrode Swagelok cells. To prepare the NFMTO cathode, a weight ratio of 80% active material, 10% carbon black (TimCal, C45), and 10% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder were thoroughly mixed with a sufficient amount of N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) to form a thick slurry, which was coated on a piece of carbon-coated aluminum foil and was dried under vacuum at 120 °C overnight. Thereafter, electrodes were punched into ∼10 mm diameter circular disks and the active mass loading of the electrodes were estimated to be ∼2–3 mg cm−2. We studied the electrochemistry of the NFMTO cathode in sodium half cells using 1 M NaClO4/ethylene carbonate (EC):propylene carbonate (PC):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (weight ratio of 4.5:4.5:1.0) + 3 wt% FEC as the electrolyte and sodium metal (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) as the anode. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (MBraun, O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm) and evaluated in a battery cycler (BT-lab, Biologic) over different voltage ranges at different C-rates. For galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments, a current equivalent to a C/10 rate was applied for 10 minutes followed by a 1 h relaxation. Prior to the GITT experiments, the cells were cycled at C/10 for two cycles. In situ XRD measurements were conducted using a BRUKER D8 diffractometer with a Cu-Kα source in an in situ cell fitted with a Be window. The cell was cycled from 4.0 to 2.0 V vs. Na+/Na0 at a C/10 rate. Full Na-ion cells were fabricated using NFMTO and hard carbon as the cathode and anode, respectively. The hard carbon anode was pre-sodiated at a current rate of 35 mA g−1 for four cycles before assembling the full cell. The capacity ratio between the anode and cathode was maintained at ∼1.25. The full cell, NFMTO‖HC, was cycled at 0.1C rate in the potential window of 4.0–1.5 V.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Herein, in the course of the experiment, it was difficult to completely dissolve monomorphic iron into hydrofluoric acid solution. After a certain amount of H2O2 solution was added, the solution faded from iron-brown to colourless, indicating complete dissolution. The reason is that in a strong oxidizing environment, Fe3+ can easily form a strong complex ion group (FeF63−) with fluoride ions, which makes the iron dissolve quickly. In contrast, in a weak oxidizing environment, iron cannot dissolve completely and forms a brown cloudy solution containing Fe2+, FeF64−, Fe3+ and undissolved metallic iron. The chemical mechanisms of the reactions are shown in the following chemical equations, respectively:\nThe chemical equilibrium constant for eqn (2) is Kf = 1015.04, which means that in a strongly oxidizing environment iron ions are almost always present as FeF63−. To further verify that highly stable FeF63− was produced, saturated saline was added to the solution from Scheme 1, which instantly produced a yellowish precipitate, the XRD pattern of which (Fig. S1†) indicates that the structure is Na3FeF6. In Fig. 1a, the substance obtained after cryodesiccation is FeF3·3H2O (Fig. S2†). To verify the scalability of this doping method, in addition to the doping of Sn, the doping of Zn, Ti, and Ni was also attempted. Fig. S3–S5† sequentially reveal the synthesis, structure and component information of the samples doped with different elements. With the addition of H2O2 (Fig. S3b†), the turbid and brown solution gradually became transparent and clarified, forming a stable and colourless group of FeF63− ions. The structural information was explored using XRD tests (Fig. S4†), and the positions of the diffraction peaks were found to correspond roughly to those of the standard PDF no. 76-1262 card, which indicates the feasibility of the preparation method of this doped material. Further, the morphology of all the materials prepared by this method consisted of nanometre (nm)-sized spherical particles (Fig. S5†). Due to the absence of graphene, these primary nanometre (nm)-sized particles agglomerated to form micrometre (μm)-sized secondary particles. Finally, EDS mapping analysis shows (Fig. S5†) that there is no segregation phenomenon in the distribution of elements at the micrometre scale, further indicating the uniformity and tunable properties of the preparation method for this doped material.\nFig. 1b shows the TG (thermogravimetric) curve of FeF3·3H2O, which demonstrated three weightless stages according to the relative molecular weights of FeF3·3H2O, FeF3·0.33H2O (HTB, hexagonal tungsten bronze) and FeF3(HTB). According to the above stages, FeF3·3H2O was heated up to 60 °C, 220 °C, and 600 °C in turn and held for 1 h. Samples S60, S220, and S800 were obtained and the corresponding XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S6.† S60 is still the FeF3·3H2O phase, and S220 is FeF3·0.33H2O (HTB). However, S600 is a mixture of FeF3, FeF2 and Fe2F5. Interestingly, it was found that the water in FeF3·0.33H2O (HTB) belongs to zeolite water, indicating that water molecules are lost at low temperatures, while the octahedral structure remains unchanged during the conversion from FeF3·0.33H2O (HTB) to FeF3 (HTB), as shown in Fig. 1b. Moreover, at relatively high temperature (above 254 °C), FeF3 (HTB) is irreversibly converted to FeF3 (ReO3), followed by a gradual transformation of FeF3 (ReO3) to FeF2 (TiO2), which reveals the importance of controlling temperature in the preparation process of the materials. Using this method to prepare FeF3·0.33H2O (HTB) materials avoids the issue of low material yield caused by the dissolution of iron fluoride materials in solvents such as HF solution. Theoretically, when calculated based on iron element loss, the yield of this method can reach 100%. Despite some transfer losses during actual laboratory operations, the practical yield still exceeds 95%.\nAs shown in Fig. 1c, when one Fe site in the crystal lattice of FeF3·0.33H2O is replaced by one Sn atom, the Sn-doping concentration is 8.3%, which indicates that Sn8 is closest to the ideal crystal structure. Fig. 1c shows structural evolution before and after 8% Sn modification obtained by computational simulation, resulting in the enlargement of the crystal cell (expansion of the value of d220 from 3.19 to 3.28 Å). In Fig. S3d,† Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8 and Sn10 show significantly different colours as the Sn-doping concentration increases, with the colour gradually changing from green to light yellow.\nFig. S7† shows the XRD patterns generated by simulation using the DFT calculation model of FeF3·0.33H2O from Fig. 1c. Compared to the standard PDF no.76-1262 card, the positions of the diffraction peaks are consistent, indicating the accuracy of the DFT calculation model. The inset of Fig. S7† shows the simulated diffraction peak of Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O from Fig. 1c, which is left-shifted with respect to the simulated diffraction peak of FeF3·0.33H2O. According to Bragg's equation (2dsinθ = nλ), the leftward shift in the value of 2θ implies an increase in the interplanar spacing.\nFig. 1d shows the XRD patterns of all samples (Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8 and Sn10), matching well with the standard peaks of PDF no.76-1262. The diffraction peaks of 220 and 002 from FeF3·0.33H2O shift slightly to smaller angles as the concentration of doped Sn increases, which is attributed to the fact that the radius of the Sn atom is larger than that of the Fe atom. In Fig. 1d, a pronounced diffraction peak of 110 (the strongest diffraction peak of the (SnF)2SnF6 standard card in Fig. S7†) appeared in the Sn10 sample, which indicated that excess Sn formed tin fluoride.\nIn Fig. 1e, the Fe sites in the crystal are divided into S1 and S2 positions based on Bader charge analysis. Herein, S2 positions stand for the high charge number Fe (2.05), while S1 positions represent the low charge number Fe (2.04, 2.03, and 1.55). In the XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) test, the area ratio of S2/S1 can measure the charge number of Fe in the material system; a higher S2/S1 value indicates a higher proportion of Fe with a high charge number, while a smaller S2/S1 value indicates a higher proportion of Fe with a low charge number. In order to investigate the chemical environment of each element in the material, XPS testing was performed. The XPS spectra of Sn4, Sn6, Sn8, and Sn10 are shown in Fig. S8,† exhibiting the characteristic peaks of C 1s, Sn 3d, O 1s, F 1s, and Fe 2p at approximately 284 eV, 487 eV, 532 eV, 684 eV, and 713 eV, respectively. The Sn0 sample, which does not contain doped Sn, did not show the Sn 3d feature peak at approximately 487 eV. Fig. 1f shows the XPS spectra of Fe 2p for Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8 and Sn10, respectively, which usually consist of two sub-diffraction peaks, Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, accompanied by two satellite peaks in turn (Fe 2p3/2 satellite and Fe 2p1/2 satellite). In Fig. 1f, the XPS spectrum of Fe 2p3/2 is positioned above 710 eV, which indicates that Fe3+ is the dominant oxidation state. Combined with the Bader charge analysis of Fig. 1f, the XPS spectrum of Fe2p3/2 is fitted with the two peaks of S1 (713.56 eV) and S2 (715.96 eV). In Fig. 1f, the S2/S1 values of Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8, and Sn10, are 0.65, 0.60, 0.51, 0.46 and 0.31, respectively. As the Sn concentration increases, the value of S2/S1 decreases, indicating a higher proportion of Fe with lower oxidation states. Additionally, due to the splitting of the Fe 2p spin–orbit orbitals, the peak area ratio of the chemical states corresponding to Fe 2p2/3 and Fe 2p1/2 orbitals is 2:1, and this principle was considered during the fitting process (S1/Sa = S2/Sb = 2). Meanwhile, Fig. S9† shows the XPS spectra of Sn 3d for Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8, and Sn10, with Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 peaks located at 468.73 eV and 495.13 eV, respectively, indicating that Sn4+ is the main oxidation state due to the introduction of H2O2.\nThe morphology of Sn0 (FeF3·0.33H2O/GO) and Sn8 (Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O/GO) was characterized by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. The SEM image shows that the nanometre (nm)-sized spherical active materials are uniformly distributed on graphene nanosheets, and the unique spherical morphology may be attributed to the surface tension of water during the low-temperature freeze-drying process. In the TEM image, enlarged local details of the nanospheres revealed that they were composed of numerous microcrystalline particles with a diameter of approximately 50 nm stacked together. HRTEM images showed the polycrystalline nature, exhibiting various crystal planes (220, 202, 224, etc.). SAED (selected area electron diffraction) signal collection was performed on the microcrystalline particles to obtain detailed structural information. The diffraction pattern of Sn8 exhibited distinct polycrystalline diffraction rings. However, the diffraction pattern of Sn0 not only contained diffraction rings but also included more regular diffraction spots, indicating that Sn8 led to a more disordered crystal face orientation in the material. Additionally, the interplanar spacing was calculated from the diffraction spots. The interplanar spacing of various crystal faces in Sn8 (d220 = 0.36 nm, d202 = 0.29 nm, and d224 = 0.19 nm) was larger than that in Sn0 (d220 = 0.32 nm, d202 = 0.26 nm, and d224 = 0.16 nm). EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) was used to confirm the composition of the particles. EDX mapping images demonstrate that the nanocrystals of Sn0 were mainly composed of evenly distributed F, Fe, and O elements, which are prominent features of FeF3·0.33H2O nanoparticles. Sn8 exhibited a uniform distribution of Sn within the FeF3·0.33H2O particles, indicating that Sn doping occurred in the FeF3·0.33H2O crystal.\n\nElectrochemical performance analysis\nA series of electrochemical performance tests were conducted on sodium-ion half-cells, where cathode electrodes were assembled using Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8, and Sn10 samples, to explore the effects of Sn-doped FeF3·0.33H2O on their sodium storage capacity and cycling stability. Fig. 3a showcases the cycling performance of Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8, and Sn10 at a low current density of 20 mA g−1. The analysis of the data in Fig. 3a reveals that, during the initial charging process, Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8, and Sn10 exhibit specific capacities of 194.0, 160.0, 148.9, 141.0, and 101.7 mA h g−1, respectively. It demonstrates a decreasing trend in capacity as the Sn-doping concentration increases, indicating that the Sn incorporated into the crystal lattice may not contribute to the capacity. Furthermore, in Fig. 3a, the capacities of Sn0, Sn4, and Sn6 consistently decrease with an increase in the number of cycles, especially with Sn0 showing the most significant decay. In contrast, except for the initial few cycles, the capacities of Sn8 and Sn10 show less apparent attenuation with an increase in the number of cycles. After 100 cycles, the reversible specific capacity of Sn0 has decreased to 93.1 mA h g−1 (a capacity retention of 49%), while the reversible specific capacity of Sn8 remains at 115.4 mA h g−1 (a capacity retention of 82%). It indicates that Sn doping can enhance the cycling stability of the material.\nThe first charge–discharge voltage profiles of Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8, and Sn10 at a current density of 20 mA g−1 and embedded data of the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) are shown in Fig. 3b. Except for Sn10, the ICE of Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, and Sn8 increases sequentially, indicating that Sn doping contributes to the improvement of material reversibility. Based on the crystal model analysis, it is known that an Sn-doping concentration of 8% is closest to the ideal crystal structure with one heteroatom replacement (8.3%). Iron fluoride (an ICE of 81.4% at Sn8) exhibits significant irreversible capacity during the initial charge–discharge cycles, likely attributed to intense phase transformations occurring at lower voltages during the first conversion reaction, leading to partial deactivation of active materials. Additionally, despite sintering at 220 °C for 6 hours during material preparation to remove crystalline water completely and retain the HTB-type framework, trace amounts of residual water remain, thereby reducing the initial coulombic efficiency of the material. In contrast, the ICE of Sn10 was significantly reduced when the Sn-doping concentration exceeded 8%, In Fig. 1d, a pronounced diffraction peak of 110 (the strongest diffraction peak of the (SnF)2SnF6 standard card in Fig. S7†) appeared in the Sn10 sample, which indicated that excess Sn formed tin fluoride. The XPS spectrum (Fig. S9†) and Bader charge analysis (Fig. 5i) reveal that the Sn in the material exists as Sn4+.The step where Sn4+ gains electrons to form Sn2+ is considered irreversible. For Sn10 (Fig. 3b), during the initial discharge process, additional tin fluorides gain electrons and contribute to the capacity, but they are unable to provide the corresponding charge capacity during the first charge process, exacerbating the irreversibility of the material's conversion reaction at low voltages. These irreversible tin fluorides lose their activity after the first discharge, preventing the formation of HTB-type frameworks again at low voltages, making the migration path of sodium ions more tortuous and ultimately reducing the rate of sodium ion migration in the material. In summary, excess tin is present in the form of tin fluoride, which is categorized as an anode material for SIBs and exhibits irreversibility in the high voltage range, thereby greatly reducing the reversibility of the first cycle of Sn10.\nIn Fig. 3b, two voltage plateaus appear in the initial discharge curve, at approximately 2.8 V and 1.5 V, corresponding to the following two reaction processes, respectively:\nTo further investigate the battery reaction mechanism, cyclic voltammetry was performed for the Sn0 and Sn8 button batteries, as shown in Fig. 3e. The mechanism of energy storage in the FeF3 conversion reaction was proposed and experimentally demonstrated by Hua et al. Drawing on the research results of Hua, the conversion process of FeF3·0.33H2O can be considered to consist of the following three stages:\nand\nThe reactions occurring in the region centered around peaks I and II in Fig. 3e correspond to eqn (5) and (6) respectively, while region III below 1.57 V corresponds to eqn (7). The difference between the voltages of the oxidation (Io or IIo) and reduction (Ir, or IIr) peaks measures the electrochemical reversibility; the smaller the difference, the better the reversibility, and vice versa. The differences of Io–Ir (0.27 V) and IIo–IIr (0.57 V) for Sn8 are smaller than those of Io–Ir (0.62 V) and IIo–IIr (0.83 V) for Sn0, respectively, suggesting that Sn8 has better reversibility for use in SIBs, probably thanks to the improved conductivity of the material. In addition, cyclic voltammetry curves for Sn4, Sn6, and Sn10 are shown in Fig. S10.† In Fig. S10,† Sn10 exhibits a stronger irreversible reduction peak during the first discharge, below 1.57 V, relative to the other samples. This is attributed to the irreversible tin fluoride providing additional capacity, leading to lower ICE, which also indirectly proves the existence of additional tin fluoride.\nThe rate performances of Sn0, Sn4, Sn6, Sn8 and Sn10 at various current densities (20–1000 mA g−1) with each rate for 10 cycles are presented in Fig. 3c to further understand the influence of Sn doping on the rate performance. The capacity of all samples gradually decreased with increasing current density. Sn8 displays capacities of 128.1, 104.9, 82.0, 65.5, 50.2 and 33.1 mA h g−1 at 20, 40, 100, 200, 400 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Sn0, by contrast, shows capacities of 152.0, 113.0, 77.2, 56.7, 39.8 and 24.5 mA h g−1 at 20–1000 mA g−1. Although the initial capacity of Sn0 is higher than that of Sn8, the capacity of Sn8 exceeds that of Sn0 with the increase of the number of cycles and current density (after 30 cycles at 100 mA g−1), and it is obvious that Sn doping enhances the rate performance of the material. To further evaluate the cycling stability of the electrode, the cycling performances of all samples at a large current density (1000 mA g−1) are illustrated in Fig. 3d. The capacities of Sn8 and Sn0 are 63.7 and 49.2 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles, respectively. Remarkably, Sn8 exhibits better cycling stability than Sn0.\nIn Fig. 3f, to explain the intrinsic effect of Sn doping on the electrochemical properties of the material, EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) of all samples was performed. To ensure test consistency, the button cell underwent four uniform cycles for EIS measurements. All samples have similar characteristics, including a semicircular charging transfer resistance (Rct) in the high-frequency region, representing the reaction kinetics of the electrode reaction, and a diffusion impedance (ZW) with a quasilinear slope in the low-frequency region, related to the diffusion of ions in the electrode material. Nyquist spectra have been fitted and the corresponding equivalent circuit model is depicted in the inset of Fig. 3f. The electrolyte resistance (Rs) reflects the total impedance of the electrolyte and electrode material. From the fitted impedance parameters in Table 2, it can be seen that the values of Rct and Rs for Sn8 are smaller than those of the other samples, which is attributed to the suitable Sn-doping concentration of Sn8 to enhance the conductivity of the material.\nIn addition, EIS data can be utilized to calculate the diffusion rate of sodium ions in the material (DNa+), which can be calculated using the following equation (eqn (8)):\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T represents the Kelvin temperature (298 K), A is the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte (1.13 cm2), n represents the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction (3.0), F is the Faraday constant (96500C mol−1), C is the molar concentration of sodium ions in the electrolyte (1 × 10−3 mol cm−3), and σ is the Warburg factor, which can be obtained from the linear relationship between Z′ and ω−1/2 as shown in Fig. 3g, where ω = 2πf. Ultimately, the calculated diffusion rate values of sodium ions (DNa+) for all samples are listed in Table 2. Apparently, Sn8 has a faster diffusion rate of sodium ions compared to the other samples. Obviously, compared to the other samples, Sn8 (5.58 × 10−10 cm2 s−1) exhibits a faster diffusion rate of sodium ions, which indicates that the expansion of the unit cell caused by Sn doping is beneficial for enhancing the diffusion rate of sodium ions.\nThe diffusion rates of sodium ions during charge–discharge processes were analyzed using GITT testing. The diffusion rates can be calculated using the following equation (eqn (9)):\nThe calculated parameters are summarized in Table S1.† In Fig. 4, it was observed that the diffusion rates of sodium ions in Sn8 were consistently higher than those in Sn0 at almost all titration equilibrium voltages. The order of magnitude of the sodium ion migration rate values calculated from both the EIS test and the GITT test is around −10, which mutually corroborates the reliability of the data. It is noteworthy that, unlike the deintercalation reactions observed in layered oxides, iron fluoride materials undergo conversion reactions at low voltages. At the end of discharge and the beginning of charge, the migration rates of sodium ions differ by approximately 1000-fold, corresponding to the regeneration of iron fluoride frameworks, which hinders the migration of sodium ions.\n\nFirst-principles calculations\nIn 1983, researchers for the first time revealed that FeF3·0.33H2O crystallizes in the orthorhombic system with cell dimensions of a = 7.42 Å, b = 12.73 Å, and c = 7.52 Å, belonging to the space group Cmcm, and it was found that the framework of the FeF6 octahedra is related to that of hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) Rb0.29WO3. Based on the experimental data mentioned above, an initial crystal cell model of FeF3·0.33H2O was constructed, and the structural optimization calculation was performed to obtain the lowest energy model as shown in Fig. S11d.† Afterward, as shown in Fig. S11a–c,† three different cases were considered in which one Sn atom was replaced on the Fe site, resulting in a doping concentration of 8.3% for the Sn element. In addition, the binding energies of the three doping models, labeled as Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-top, Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid, and Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-bot, are −194.903 eV, −194.942 eV, and −194.935 eV, respectively, while the binding energy of FeF3·0.33H2O is −196.991 eV. This indicates that Sn doping leads to an increase in the system's energy. One of these three models, the Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid structure, shows the smallest energy increase. Therefore, when one Sn atom replaces an iron site, it is more likely to form the Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid structure. Compared to the cell size of FeF3·0.33H2O (a = 7.41 Å, b = 12.69 Å, and c = 7.46 Å), it is observed that the cell size after Sn doping has significantly increased, indicating that Sn doping leads to an enlargement of the hexagonal tunnels, which is beneficial for reducing the migration resistance of sodium ions within the unit cell.\nFig. 5a shows the (111) crystal plane model of the unit cell of FeF3 in the cubic system with the cell dimensions of a = b = c = 10.41 Å, belonging to the space group Fd3m. Additionally, Fig. 5d and g display the (001) crystal plane models of the unit cell of FeF3·0.33H2O and the unit cell of Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid, respectively. To present the deformation charge density and Bader charge analysis more clearly, data plots were created specifically for the (111) or (001) crystal planes. Fig. 5b and e display the deformation charge density of FeF3 and FeF3·0.33H2O, respectively, calculated using the formula:\nThe expanded form of formula (10) in Fig. 5b is Δρ = ρ(FeF3) − ρ(Fe) − ρ(F), while in Fig. 5e, the expanded form is Δρ = ρ(FeF3·0.33H2O) − ρ(Fe) − ρ(F) − ρ(H) − ρ(O). The deformation charge density provides visualizations of properties such as charge transfer and bond polarization during electron coupling. In Fig. 5b and e, the yellow region represents an increase in electron cloud density, while the lake blue region indicates a decrease in electron cloud density. Fig. 5h represents the charge density difference of Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid relative to FeF3·0.33H2O, calculated using the formula:\nThe expanded form of formula (11) in Fig. 5h is Δρ = ρ(Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O) − ρ(FeF3·0.33H2O). In Fig. 5h, it is worth noting that the calculation model for FeF3·0.33H2O (AC) in this case involves directly replacing the Sn site from Fig. 5g with Fe, rather than using the model shown in Fig. 5d. As shown in Fig. 5h, it is evident that the introduction of Sn has a significant impact on the charge distribution of the horizontally bonded Fe atoms, which directly affects the conductivity of the material. To further quantify the electron transfer situation, Bader charge analysis was performed. From Fig. 5f and i, it can be seen that the introduction of Sn leads to a decrease in the charge number of the adjacent Fe atom (Fe3 and Fe1 2.04|e| → 2.03|e|, Fe2 2.05|e| → 1.55|e|), which indicates that the Sn doping can weaken the strength of the F–Fe bond and is beneficial for improving the conductivity of the material.\nThe spin band structure and corresponding DOS (density of states) for the materials FeF3, FeF3·0.33H2O, and Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid are shown in Fig. 6a–c, respectively. The calculation results indicate that the band gap of pure FeF3 (2.84 eV) is significantly larger than that of FeF3·0.33H2O (1.03 eV), which implies that, compared to pure FeF3, the band structure of hydrated FeF3 is more favorable for electron transport. In addition, compared to FeF3·0.33H2O (1.03 eV), Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid (0.98 eV) exhibits a slight reduction in the band gap, indicating that Sn doping can enhance the electronic conductivity of the material to some extent. Further analysis of the DOS of FeF3 and FeF3·0.33H2O, as shown in Fig. 6a and b, reveals the presence of O 2p orbitals and a small number of H 1s orbitals near the Fermi level in FeF3·0.33H2O, which reduce the bad gap from 2.84 eV for pure FeF3 to 1.03 eV for the FeF3·0.33H2O structure.\nAs shown in Fig. 6b and c, compared to FeF3·0.33H2O, Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid has a significantly increased number of valence electron bands between −2.0 eV and the Fermi level. Especially, in Fig. 6c there is an additional spin-down Fe 3d band at 0.49 eV, indicating a noticeable change in the electron cloud of a specific iron site due to the introduction of Sn. It results in an increased number of valence electrons near the Fermi level, and these electrons have a higher probability of transitioning to the conduction band. Comprehensively analyzing Fig. 6a–c, it is found that the impurity energy band of zeolite water appears isolated in the forbidden band with a width of 2.84 eV, which greatly reduces the band gap but not the forbidden bandwidth, whereas the introduction of Sn directly reduces the width of the forbidden band from 2.84 eV to 2.54 eV, which is very beneficial for the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of FeF3·0.33H2O. In order to further investigate the influence of Sn introduction on the band structure, Partial Density of States (PDOS) calculations were performed on Fe2 and Fe5 (shown in Fig. 5i) in Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O-mid, as shown in Fig. 6d. The calculation indicates that the energy ranges from −1 eV to the Fermi level (0 eV) in Fig. 6c and is solely contributed by the Fe2 atom, which further confirms that Sn doping significantly alters the 3d orbital electronic configuration of Fe2 atoms. In conclusion, the calculations using first-principles electronic structure calculations based on DFT indicate that Sn doping leads to an increase in electron cloud density in Fe2, resulting in a reduction of the band gap and an increase in the number of bands within the energy range from −1 eV to the Fermi level. It can be predicted that Sn doping will lead to a significant enhancement of the conductivity of FeF3·0.33H2O.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by a modified Hummers' method and dried graphene oxide was obtained through freeze-drying.\nThe GO preparation process has been described in detail in our previous work. Briefly, after graphite was oxidized and turned bright yellow upon the addition of H2O2, the mixture was naturally coagulated with 5−10% HCl solution and washed with deionized water several times until the pH > 2. Then the GO solution (5 mg mL−1) was dispersed via ultrasonic-assisted dispersion for 30 min until the appearance of the liquid crystal phenomenon. Subsequently, the optimized amount of lauramide propyl amine oxide was added slowly with the assistance of mechanical agitation, until all GO sheets separated from the aqueous solution and the solution became transparent. The precipitate was purified by repeatedly dispersion it in water filtration through a 0.2 μm CA filter membrane. Eventually, the filtered product was freeze-dried at −35 °C and 6–8 Pa for 12 h to remove the residual water for subsequent processing.\nSynthesis of FeF3·0.33H2O/GO and MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO. Scheme 1 displays a schematic diagram of the synthesis process of MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO (Me = metal, such as Sn, Zn, Ti, and Ni) composites. As shown in Scheme 1, the fabrication process was performed using plastic beakers. First, 6 mL of concentrated HF acid was transferred to a plastic beaker and 2 g of pre-prepared iron powder and other metal powders or metal oxide powders were added while stirring. Their stoichiometric ratios are shown in Table 1. When the brown color of the solution is no longer dark, H2O2 is added drop by drop until the solution becomes clear and transparent, where the volume ratio of HF and H2O2 is 3:10. Then, 0.4 g GO is added to the aforementioned clear and transparent solution and stirred for 30 min, resulting in a dark gray solution. Note that the above process is completed in a fume hood. It should be noted that the stirring operation should not be replaced by ultrasonic treatment, as yellow iron fluoride crystals will be partially precipitated. After stirring for 30 min, the obtained dark gray solution is transferred to the cold trap of a freeze vacuum dryer at −60 °C and frozen for 2 h. Then, it is freeze-vacuum dried for 24 h to obtain FeF3·3H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·3H2O/GO (0 < x ≤ 0.1). Finally, FeF3·3H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·3H2O/GO was placed in a tube furnace with an argon flow (40 cm3 min−1) and sintered at 220 °C for 6 h to obtain the final product FeF3·0.33H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO.\nMaterial characterization. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-TTRIII), Japan, (Cu Kα radiation, scan rate of 10° min−1), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7900F, Japan) were used to test the morphology and structure of all samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using an ESCA-3400 instrument with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600, New Castle, DE, USA) was performed in Ar, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.\nElectrochemical characterization. The prepared samples, conductive carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 7:2:1 were ground in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. Then the slurry was coated on the surface of aluminum foils and vacuum dried for 6 h at 100 °C. After that, the foils were punched into wafers with a radius of 6 mm for cell assembly. The areal density of the cathode material was 2–4 mg cm−2. Meanwhile, CR2025 cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox using the as-prepared electrode wafer with glass fiber (Whatman GF/D) as the separator, a Na metal foil as the counter electrode, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) solution (volume ratio 1:1) with 5.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte.\nA NEWARE BTS Client battery system was employed to test cycle performance from 1.2 to 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) at various current densities. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation in the same voltage range at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. After the button cell completed 4 CV cycles, the CHI760E electrochemical workstation was used to perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an alternating current voltage amplitude of 5 mV at the open-circuit voltage. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test, the cells were charged at 10 mA g−1 (0.1C) for 3 min and then allowed to relax for 30 min.\nCalculation method. All computational simulations were performed using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) software based on density functional theory (DFT). The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) technique and Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method were employed to address the core-electron interaction and exchange–correlation potential, respectively, when processing. The unit cell of FeF3, similar to the ReO3 structure with the space group Fd3m, consists of 64 atoms (16 Fe and 48 F). Likewise, the unit cell of FeF3·0.33H2O, resembling the hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) structure with the space group Cmcm, contains 60 atoms (12 Fe, 36 F, 4 O, and 8 H), while the unit cell of Sn-doped HTB-FeF3·0.33H2O (Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O) comprises 60 atoms (1 Sn, 11 Fe, 36 F, 4 O, and 8 H). The PBE pseudopotentials used for the calculations have atomic valence layer configurations of 3d74s1, 4d105s25p2, 2s22p5, 2s22p4, and 1s1 for Fe, Sn, F, O, and H. Since not all of the d-electron orbitals in the element Fe are in the occupied state, a correction was made using the GGA + U method, and the effective parameters chosen, U and J, were 6.8 and 0.89 eV. In the PAW basis set, a kinetic energy cut-off of 520 eV is chosen to determine its span in reciprocal space. For the unit cell of FeF3·0.33H2O and Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O, the Monkhorst–Pack scheme is applied with a 9 × 5 × 9 k-point mesh to sample the Brillouin zone. Similarly, for the unit cell of FeF3, the Brillouin zone is sampled using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a 9 × 9 × 9 k-point mesh. The convergence criterion for ionic relaxation is set to 0.1 meV per cell, while the convergence criterion for self-consistent field (SCF) iterations of electronic calculations is set to 0.01 meV per cell. In addition, the behavior of water in this calculation is accurately described using the optB88-VDW calculation method in VASP. Spin polarization calculations were implemented in all calculations.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by a modified Hummers' method and dried graphene oxide was obtained through freeze-drying.\nThe GO preparation process has been described in detail in our previous work. Briefly, after graphite was oxidized and turned bright yellow upon the addition of H2O2, the mixture was naturally coagulated with 5−10% HCl solution and washed with deionized water several times until the pH > 2. Then the GO solution (5 mg mL−1) was dispersed via ultrasonic-assisted dispersion for 30 min until the appearance of the liquid crystal phenomenon. Subsequently, the optimized amount of lauramide propyl amine oxide was added slowly with the assistance of mechanical agitation, until all GO sheets separated from the aqueous solution and the solution became transparent. The precipitate was purified by repeatedly dispersion it in water filtration through a 0.2 μm CA filter membrane. Eventually, the filtered product was freeze-dried at −35 °C and 6–8 Pa for 12 h to remove the residual water for subsequent processing.\nSynthesis of FeF3·0.33H2O/GO and MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO. Scheme 1 displays a schematic diagram of the synthesis process of MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO (Me = metal, such as Sn, Zn, Ti, and Ni) composites. As shown in Scheme 1, the fabrication process was performed using plastic beakers. First, 6 mL of concentrated HF acid was transferred to a plastic beaker and 2 g of pre-prepared iron powder and other metal powders or metal oxide powders were added while stirring. Their stoichiometric ratios are shown in Table 1. When the brown color of the solution is no longer dark, H2O2 is added drop by drop until the solution becomes clear and transparent, where the volume ratio of HF and H2O2 is 3:10. Then, 0.4 g GO is added to the aforementioned clear and transparent solution and stirred for 30 min, resulting in a dark gray solution. Note that the above process is completed in a fume hood. It should be noted that the stirring operation should not be replaced by ultrasonic treatment, as yellow iron fluoride crystals will be partially precipitated. After stirring for 30 min, the obtained dark gray solution is transferred to the cold trap of a freeze vacuum dryer at −60 °C and frozen for 2 h. Then, it is freeze-vacuum dried for 24 h to obtain FeF3·3H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·3H2O/GO (0 < x ≤ 0.1). Finally, FeF3·3H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·3H2O/GO was placed in a tube furnace with an argon flow (40 cm3 min−1) and sintered at 220 °C for 6 h to obtain the final product FeF3·0.33H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO.\nMaterial characterization. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-TTRIII), Japan, (Cu Kα radiation, scan rate of 10° min−1), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7900F, Japan) were used to test the morphology and structure of all samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using an ESCA-3400 instrument with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600, New Castle, DE, USA) was performed in Ar, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.\nElectrochemical characterization. The prepared samples, conductive carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 7:2:1 were ground in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. Then the slurry was coated on the surface of aluminum foils and vacuum dried for 6 h at 100 °C. After that, the foils were punched into wafers with a radius of 6 mm for cell assembly. The areal density of the cathode material was 2–4 mg cm−2. Meanwhile, CR2025 cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox using the as-prepared electrode wafer with glass fiber (Whatman GF/D) as the separator, a Na metal foil as the counter electrode, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) solution (volume ratio 1:1) with 5.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte.\nA NEWARE BTS Client battery system was employed to test cycle performance from 1.2 to 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) at various current densities. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation in the same voltage range at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. After the button cell completed 4 CV cycles, the CHI760E electrochemical workstation was used to perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an alternating current voltage amplitude of 5 mV at the open-circuit voltage. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test, the cells were charged at 10 mA g−1 (0.1C) for 3 min and then allowed to relax for 30 min.\nCalculation method. All computational simulations were performed using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) software based on density functional theory (DFT). The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) technique and Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method were employed to address the core-electron interaction and exchange–correlation potential, respectively, when processing. The unit cell of FeF3, similar to the ReO3 structure with the space group Fd3m, consists of 64 atoms (16 Fe and 48 F). Likewise, the unit cell of FeF3·0.33H2O, resembling the hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) structure with the space group Cmcm, contains 60 atoms (12 Fe, 36 F, 4 O, and 8 H), while the unit cell of Sn-doped HTB-FeF3·0.33H2O (Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O) comprises 60 atoms (1 Sn, 11 Fe, 36 F, 4 O, and 8 H). The PBE pseudopotentials used for the calculations have atomic valence layer configurations of 3d74s1, 4d105s25p2, 2s22p5, 2s22p4, and 1s1 for Fe, Sn, F, O, and H. Since not all of the d-electron orbitals in the element Fe are in the occupied state, a correction was made using the GGA + U method, and the effective parameters chosen, U and J, were 6.8 and 0.89 eV. In the PAW basis set, a kinetic energy cut-off of 520 eV is chosen to determine its span in reciprocal space. For the unit cell of FeF3·0.33H2O and Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O, the Monkhorst–Pack scheme is applied with a 9 × 5 × 9 k-point mesh to sample the Brillouin zone. Similarly, for the unit cell of FeF3, the Brillouin zone is sampled using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a 9 × 9 × 9 k-point mesh. The convergence criterion for ionic relaxation is set to 0.1 meV per cell, while the convergence criterion for self-consistent field (SCF) iterations of electronic calculations is set to 0.01 meV per cell. In addition, the behavior of water in this calculation is accurately described using the optB88-VDW calculation method in VASP. Spin polarization calculations were implemented in all calculations.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Then, 0.4 g GO is added to the aforementioned clear and transparent solution and stirred for 30 min, resulting in a dark gray solution. Note that the above process is completed in a fume hood. It should be noted that the stirring operation should not be replaced by ultrasonic treatment, as yellow iron fluoride crystals will be partially precipitated. After stirring for 30 min, the obtained dark gray solution is transferred to the cold trap of a freeze vacuum dryer at −60 °C and frozen for 2 h. Then, it is freeze-vacuum dried for 24 h to obtain FeF3·3H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·3H2O/GO (0 < x ≤ 0.1).

The areal density of the cathode material was 2–4 mg cm−2. Meanwhile, CR2025 cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox using the as-prepared electrode wafer with glass fiber (Whatman GF/D) as the separator, a Na metal foil as the counter electrode, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) solution (volume ratio 1:1) with 5.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte.\nA NEWARE BTS Client battery system was employed to test cycle performance from 1.2 to 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) at various current densities. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation in the same voltage range at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. After the button cell completed 4 CV cycles, the CHI760E electrochemical workstation was used to perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an alternating current voltage amplitude of 5 mV at the open-circuit voltage. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test, the cells were charged at 10 mA g−1 (0.1C) for 3 min and then allowed to relax for 30 min.\nCalculation method. All computational simulations were performed using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) software based on density functional theory (DFT). The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) technique and Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method were employed to address the core-electron interaction and exchange–correlation potential, respectively, when processing. The unit cell of FeF3, similar to the ReO3 structure with the space group Fd3m, consists of 64 atoms (16 Fe and 48 F). Likewise, the unit cell of FeF3·0.33H2O, resembling the hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) structure with the space group Cmcm, contains 60 atoms (12 Fe, 36 F, 4 O, and 8 H), while the unit cell of Sn-doped HTB-FeF3·0.33H2O (Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O) comprises 60 atoms (1 Sn, 11 Fe, 36 F, 4 O, and 8 H). The PBE pseudopotentials used for the calculations have atomic valence layer configurations of 3d74s1, 4d105s25p2, 2s22p5, 2s22p4, and 1s1 for Fe, Sn, F, O, and H. Since not all of the d-electron orbitals in the element Fe are in the occupied state, a correction was made using the GGA + U method, and the effective parameters chosen, U and J, were 6.8 and 0.89 eV. In the PAW basis set, a kinetic energy cut-off of 520 eV is chosen to determine its span in reciprocal space. For the unit cell of FeF3·0.33H2O and Sn0.08Fe0.92F3·0.33H2O, the Monkhorst–Pack scheme is applied with a 9 × 5 × 9 k-point mesh to sample the Brillouin zone. Similarly, for the unit cell of FeF3, the Brillouin zone is sampled using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a 9 × 9 × 9 k-point mesh. The convergence criterion for ionic relaxation is set to 0.1 meV per cell, while the convergence criterion for self-consistent field (SCF) iterations of electronic calculations is set to 0.01 meV per cell. In addition, the behavior of water in this calculation is accurately described using the optB88-VDW calculation method in VASP. Spin polarization calculations were implemented in all calculations.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by a modified Hummers' method and dried graphene oxide was obtained through freeze-drying.\nThe GO preparation process has been described in detail in our previous work. Briefly, after graphite was oxidized and turned bright yellow upon the addition of H2O2, the mixture was naturally coagulated with 5−10% HCl solution and washed with deionized water several times until the pH > 2. Then the GO solution (5 mg mL−1) was dispersed via ultrasonic-assisted dispersion for 30 min until the appearance of the liquid crystal phenomenon. Subsequently, the optimized amount of lauramide propyl amine oxide was added slowly with the assistance of mechanical agitation, until all GO sheets separated from the aqueous solution and the solution became transparent. The precipitate was purified by repeatedly dispersion it in water filtration through a 0.2 μm CA filter membrane. Eventually, the filtered product was freeze-dried at −35 °C and 6–8 Pa for 12 h to remove the residual water for subsequent processing.\nSynthesis of FeF3·0.33H2O/GO and MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO. Scheme 1 displays a schematic diagram of the synthesis process of MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO (Me = metal, such as Sn, Zn, Ti, and Ni) composites. As shown in Scheme 1, the fabrication process was performed using plastic beakers. First, 6 mL of concentrated HF acid was transferred to a plastic beaker and 2 g of pre-prepared iron powder and other metal powders or metal oxide powders were added while stirring. Their stoichiometric ratios are shown in Table 1. When the brown color of the solution is no longer dark, H2O2 is added drop by drop until the solution becomes clear and transparent, where the volume ratio of HF and H2O2 is 3:10. Then, 0.4 g GO is added to the aforementioned clear and transparent solution and stirred for 30 min, resulting in a dark gray solution. Note that the above process is completed in a fume hood. It should be noted that the stirring operation should not be replaced by ultrasonic treatment, as yellow iron fluoride crystals will be partially precipitated. After stirring for 30 min, the obtained dark gray solution is transferred to the cold trap of a freeze vacuum dryer at −60 °C and frozen for 2 h. Then, it is freeze-vacuum dried for 24 h to obtain FeF3·3H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·3H2O/GO (0 < x ≤ 0.1). Finally, FeF3·3H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·3H2O/GO was placed in a tube furnace with an argon flow (40 cm3 min−1) and sintered at 220 °C for 6 h to obtain the final product FeF3·0.33H2O/GO or MexFe1−xF3·0.33H2O/GO.\nMaterial characterization. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-TTRIII), Japan, (Cu Kα radiation, scan rate of 10° min−1), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7900F, Japan) were used to test the morphology and structure of all samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using an ESCA-3400 instrument with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600, New Castle, DE, USA) was performed in Ar, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.\nElectrochemical characterization. The prepared samples, conductive carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 7:2:1 were ground in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. Then the slurry was coated on the surface of aluminum foils and vacuum dried for 6 h at 100 °C. After that, the foils were punched into wafers with a radius of 6 mm for cell assembly.

After the button cell completed 4 CV cycles, the CHI760E electrochemical workstation was used to perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an alternating current voltage amplitude of 5 mV at the open-circuit voltage. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test, the cells were charged at 10 mA g−1 (0.1C) for 3 min and then allowed to relax for 30 min.\nCalculation method. All computational simulations were performed using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) software based on density functional theory (DFT).

The PBE pseudopotentials used for the calculations have atomic valence layer configurations of 3d74s1, 4d105s25p2, 2s22p5, 2s22p4, and 1s1 for Fe, Sn, F, O, and H.

Similarly, for the unit cell of FeF3, the Brillouin zone is sampled using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a 9 × 9 × 9 k-point mesh. The convergence criterion for ionic relaxation is set to 0.1 meV per cell, while the convergence criterion for self-consistent field (SCF) iterations of electronic calculations is set to 0.01 meV per cell.

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 Structure and morphology\nNFPP/CC particles were prepared through a sol–gel method combined with either a “calcination” or a modified combustion step referred to as “combustion”, followed by an annealing step. The optimum annealing temperature was determined to be 500 °C by TGA analysis of the sol–gel precursor (Fig. S1a†) under an inert atmosphere. Dehydration of the amorphous intermediate product occurs in the first zone until 180 °C. The primary weight loss in the range of 180–300 °C is attributed to the decomposition of citric acid to form a thin carbon layer on the surface of NFPP. After calcination at 300 °C, the second major loss is observed due to the phase transition of the intermediate complex. An exothermic peak starts to appear after 570 °C indicating the decomposition of NFPP into the thermodynamically stable maricite NaFePO4 impurity. Therefore, for the first trial, the sol–gel precursor was subjected to 10 min of combustion in a tube furnace at 550 °C in air. However, the XRD pattern (see Fig. S2†) discloses that, after the annealing at 550 °C in air, the obtained orange-reddish powder showed the highly crystalline structure of monoclinic γ-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 with the Fe2O3 impurity. Similar behavior was observed in previous studies where TGA of the as prepared NFPP/CC was performed between room temperature and 800 °C under air flow to determine the carbon content by using the following equations.\nThese results indicated that preheating or firing at 300 °C may be necessary to form the amorphous carbon coating layer on the NFPP surface by the decomposition of citric acid and subsequent high temperature calcination under a reducing atmosphere should be performed for the transformation of (PO4)3− into (P2O7)4−.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to evaluate the particle morphology of the samples and the effect of the atmosphere for different synthesis routes. In Fig. S3a,† it can be seen that after only 10 min of calcination, nanosized sodium ferric phosphate particles with some agglomerates below 1 μm were obtained. EDX mapping indicates the uniform distribution of Na, Fe, P and O within the structure (Fig. S3b†). Thus, the formation of crystalline Na3Fe2(PO4)3 nanoparticles by performing a short calcination in air can be adapted to transform into a pyrophosphate phase under a reducing atmosphere by a limited annealing time as well.\nThe crystal structure and the purity of NFPP synthesized either by “calcination” or “combustion” were investigated by XRD (see Fig. S4†). Both Ar and Ar/H2 atmospheres lead to the formation of the orthorhombic NFPP crystal structure. In addition to the NFPP main phase, maricite (NaFePO4) and Na2FeP2O7 impurities were detected for the NFPP synthesized under an Ar flow as shown in Fig. S4a.† However, using an Ar/H2 (95:5 vol%) reducing atmosphere results in the elimination of Na2FeP2O7 and a significant decrease of maricite (NaFePO4) impurities (Fig. S4a†). This is also reflected in cyclic voltammetry showing that the use of Ar/H2 instead of Ar leads to the elimination of a small peak around 2.51 V assigned to the Na2FeP2O7 impurity (see Fig. S10 and its related discussion in the ESI†). Therefore, the results indicate that the atmosphere plays a crucial role in the reduction of Fe3+ if calcination is used as the method of synthesis.\nFig. S4b† compares the effect of the intermediate step, combustion vs. calcination, when using an Ar/H2 atmosphere during the 2nd thermal treatment. The diffraction patterns of “NFPP calcination” and “NFPP combustion” show that in both cases, NFPP is formed as the main phase. However, maricite was detected as an impurity regardless of the synthesis conditions.\nThe quantity of the maricite impurity in the NFPP material obtained by “combustion” and “calcination” was determined by a structural analysis using the Rietveld method (Fig. 1b and c). In both cases, the main NFPP phase can be indexed with the Pn21a space group with lattice parameters and the atomic positions (Tables S1 and S2†) in agreement with the ones reported in the literature. The four Na positions were refined, but only the Na2 position resulted in a slightly lower occupancy as also previously observed which is due to the Na2 being the first sodium to be extracted from the NFPP material. This suggests Na deficiencies in the as-prepared material before the final annealing. From the refinement, the amount of electrochemically inactive NaFePO4 was determined to be ≈5 wt% in the “combustion” sample and about 9 wt% in the “calcination” one. This suggests that using a combustion pre-treatment assists in decreasing the quantity of the undesired NaFePO4 phase.\nThe chemical composition and the surface electronic valence of iron were evaluated by XPS. The full spectra in Fig. S8a† confirm the presence of Na, Fe, P, O, and C in both compounds. The binding energy of the main peaks in Fe 2p spectra at around 724.2 and 710.5 eV suggests the Fe2+ oxidation state which is consistent with previous reports. However, XPS reveals only the surface composition of samples, and therefore the possible presence of Fe3+ as an impurity in the bulk could not be detected through XPS.\nTo further investigate the synthesized material, Mössbauer spectroscopy was carried out to determine the oxidation state and coordination of Fe within the NFPP compound, which has three different Fe2+ sites (Fe1, Fe2, and Fe3).\nThe two Mössbauer spectra of the pristine materials are almost identical (see Fig. 2 for the combustion sample and Fig. S9† for the calcination sample) and they show mainly a broad two-line pattern. The de-sodiated sample mainly displays a narrow doublet with some extra lines having larger velocities (Fig. 2). Fitted results are presented in Table S3† and the two pristine samples differ only in the amount of the pattern FeW (high-spin Fe3+). The pristine “combustion” sample contains a Fe3+ component having 7% of the total absorption spectrum, while the corresponding Fe3+ intensity for the “calcination” sample is 10%; these components are further discussed later in this section. Otherwise, the results from the fittings were within the margin of error for the two pristine samples. The Mössbauer spectra for the pristine samples in this work are comparable to the ones presented by Kim et al. where another synthesis procedure was utilized indicating the similar structural properties achieved using the herein investigated synthesis routes.\nFittings of the Fe2+ components in the pristine samples were carried out with the same spectral area for patterns X, Y and Z. These patterns may represent the three different equally occupied sites in the pristine Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) compound. The assignment of the patterns X, Y and Z to the three crystallographic sites Fe(1), Fe(2) and Fe(3) is challenging due to the non-resolved character of the spectra. With the present information of hyperfine parameters, we have to refrain from any such assignments. A neutron diffraction study and a first-principles calculation by Kim et al. indicated the same Biso factor for all sites, justifying the assumption of equal resonance areas in the Mössbauer spectra.\nAnother challenge affecting the fitting results and assignments is the possibility of the previously discussed impurity phase maricite (NaFePO4). The Mössbauer spectrum of pure NaFePO4 at room temperature, studied by Kosova et al., provided a center shift (CS) = 1.20 mm s−1 and an electric quadrupole splitting (QS) = 2.19 mm s−1. These parameters would give a component which overlaps with the present absorption spectrum of Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (CS = ∼1.2 and QS = ∼2.1–2.8). During de-sodiation the main peaks of the Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) that would overlap with NaFePO4 peaks are decreased. If there was a considerable amount of NaFePO4 then these peaks would become more visible (as NaFePO4 is inactive) and there is about 10% Fe2+ remaining in the de-sodiated sample. However, the Fe2+ Mössbauer parameters in the de-sodiated spectra (CS = 1.16, QS = 2.42) and especially the QS indicate that this is more likely the Fe atom in the pristine sample that has not been electrochemically active in the de-sodiation and thereby remains in the Fe2+ state. This is also later supported by electrochemical results as discussed later.\nFor the pristine samples, 7% Fe3+ in the “combustion” and 10% Fe3+ in the “calcination” synthesized NFPP are observed. The Mössbauer parameters of the Fe3+ in the de-sodiated samples are in good agreement with the fitted peaks for the Fe3+ component in the spectra of the pristine samples. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider these 7 and 10% not as an impurity, but rather as Na deficiencies of the idealized material. Hence the starting material would be Na3.79(6)Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) for the 7% Fe3+ in the pristine “combustion” sample.\nThe atomic ratio of Na, Fe and P in NFPP synthesized with “calcination” and “combustion” was calculated through ICP where Na/Fe/P = 4.2:2.7:4 and 3.8:3.3:4, respectively. These results are consistent with Mössbauer and refinement findings that Na is deficient in the combustion synthesized sample whereas higher Na content of the calcination product may be related to the higher intensity of the maricite impurity. From CHNS analysis, carbon contents for “calcination” and “combustion” samples were found to be 9% and 5%, respectively. The lower carbon content of the “combustion” synthesized product can be attributed to the firing step under an air atmosphere. The content of carbon in the NFPP compounds synthesized by the sol–gel method reported in the literature can be as high as 8–16 wt% (Table S4†). However, it is crucial to control the carbon content to ensure appropriate electronic conductivity by forming a thin and dense carbon layer. High carbon contents are well known to result in a significant loss in energy density and, thereby not suitable for practical applications. Additionally, TGA of the NFPP final products synthesized by both methods was done under an air atmosphere to estimate the carbon contents by using the law of conservation of mass as shown in Fig. S1b.† The mass loss between 300 °C and 570 °C can be related to the amorphous carbon. The carbon content results for both methods are close to the results obtained by CHNS analysis.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to evaluate the effects of the calcination atmosphere and different synthesis methods on the morphology of NFPP. From Fig. S5,† it can be speculated that the choice of argon gas during calcination leads to incomplete conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ with the formation of Fe3+ precipitates on the surface of NFPP particles. These results are in line with Mössbauer findings (Fig. 2).\nThe NFPP synthesized by “calcination” crystallizes as highly agglomerated micron-sized particles with nanoporous architecture on the surface (Fig. 3a and b). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the particle size and morphology. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to determine the thickness of the carbon coating and crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 3d, it can be seen that primary nanoparticles below 200 nm are not homogeneously distributed within the bulk structure. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps show that the carbon is distributed on the surface of secondary particles non-uniformly. Fig. 4c and S15† suggest that carbon particles or agglomerates are deposited on the particle surface rather than forming a uniform carbon coating. The particle growth and agglomeration of particles could be related to the low quality of the carbon coating (Fig. 3e). However, the combustion method leads to the formation of more uniform and smaller particle size and better nanoporous structure with a lower degree of agglomeration, as well as more uniform distribution of Na, Fe, P, O, and C, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally, the development of a thin, dense, and uniform carbon cloth takes place due to the control of carbon content that may lead to improvement of the electrical conductivity. The size of the primary nanoparticles is below 100 nm with numerous mesopores and macropores with a size of 80–200 nm, as shown in Fig. S6 and S7.† The specific surface area of NFPP synthesized by “calcination” and “combustion” was determined by Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) theory (Fig S16a and b†). The specific surface areas of “calcination” and “combustion” NFPP were found to be 34.67 and 35.82 m2 g−1, respectively. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) desorption average pore diameter of “calcination” and “combustion” samples are 14.94 and 14.71 nm, respectively. A larger surface area and smaller particle size can significantly facilitate the contact between the electrode and electrolytes shortening the diffusion pathway for Na+, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance.\n\n3.2 Electrochemical performance\nThe electrochemical performances of NFPP cathodes synthesized by “calcination” and “combustion” were determined by galvanostatic charge–discharge tests in half-cells in the voltage range of 1.8–3.8 V at a current rate of 0.1C, see Fig. 5.\nNFPP synthesized via “combustion” delivers a reversible capacity of 102 mA h g−1 showing more stable cycling performance whereas, the value remains around 88 mA h g−1 for the “calcination” NFPP cathode due to higher amount of the electrochemically inactive maricite impurity and amorphous carbon residues. The 1st cycle coulombic efficiency (CE) values for the “calcination” and “combustion” synthesized NFPPs were equal to 87% and 91%, respectively (Fig. S12†). After 100 cycles, the cell with NFPP “calcination” retains 98.7% of its initial capacity while the combustion process results in a slightly higher capacity retention of 99.7% as shown in Fig. 6a.\nFig. 6b shows the rate capability tests at different current rates. The “calcination”, provided discharge capacities of 91, 89, 87, 84, 80, and 75 mA h g−1, whereas the combustion sample delivered higher capacities of about 104, 102, 100, 97, 94, to 90 mA h g−1 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2C rates, respectively. When the rate was changed back to C/20 at 111th cycle, the capacity increased to 104 mA h g−1 and 91 mA h g−1 for the combustion and calcination samples, respectively. The lower electrochemical performance of the “calcination” sample is likely due to the presence of irregular pores and large agglomerates which impede ionic diffusion (Fig. 3a and b).\nThe electrochemical activity of the material can also be monitored by comparing the Mössbauer spectra for the pristine “combustion” sample to the de-sodiated one. As can be seen in Fig. 2b and Table S3†, most of the Fe2+ are oxidized to Fe3+ during Na-extraction. After de-sodiation there is 10(2)% Fe2+ remaining in this sample. If this is a part of the starting material that was not possible to de-sodiate, it would mean that the sodium content is not 1 but rather 1.30(6) in this sample. Going from 3.79(6) Na (due to a Na-deficiency as explained earlier) to 1.30(6) means that 2.49(12) Na atoms have been extracted out of the theoretical maximum 3, meaning that 83(4)% (2.49/3 = 0.83) of the theoretical capacity has been extracted in the first de-sodiation. If this is now compared to the electrochemical de-sodiation results in the first cycle in Fig. 5a, where it is possible to extract ∼110 mA h g−1 from this sample. This corresponds to 85% of the theoretical capacity (110/129 = 0.85) and this is in good agreement with the 83(4)% suggested by the Mössbauer analysis and these results support the interpretation of the minor peaks in the Mössbauer spectra originating from the deviation of the Na content as compared to the idealized sample.\nTo evaluate the structure change, the ex situ XRD analysis of the pristine electrode, after the first charge and after the first discharge is carried out (Fig. S13†). It can be seen that the diffraction peak at 45.4° indexed to (424) planes of the pristine NFPP electrode shifts to a smaller angle during charging and returns to its original state after the first discharge indicating the structural stability and high reversibility of NFPP as a promising cathode material.\nTo further evaluate the practical application of high purity NFPP for SIBs, hard carbon (HC) was used as the anode to assemble full cells. The first five cycles of the HC anode in the voltage range of 0.001–2.5 V at a current density of 30 mA g−1 are shown in Fig. S14.† It delivers a reversible capacity of 281 mA h g−1 with an initial CE of 92%. As given in Fig. 7, the first three formation cycles of the NFPP//HC full-cell were performed at 0.05C followed by 40 cycles at 0.1C in a voltage window of 1.0–3.8 V. NFPP/HC full-cells were cycled with three different electrolytes to investigate the optimum cycling stability. The full-cell using 1 M NaPF6 in EC:DEC with 5 wt% FEC is the worst performing one showing a rapid capacity decay during the formation cycles (Fig. 7b). As shown in Fig. 7a, the cell using 1 M NaPF6 diglyme electrolyte exhibits its first discharge capacity around 80 mA h g−1 at 0.05C and then the C-rate increase to 0.1C; this value fades to 70 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles. Nevertheless, its long-term cycling stability in 1 M NaPF6 diglyme electrolyte was not as good as in half cell configuration. Therefore, cycling tests were performed by using 1 M NaPF6 in PC with the addition of 5 wt% FEC electrolyte as given in Fig. 7c and d. The first discharge capacity during formation cycles was around 80 mA h g−1 whereas 74 mA h g−1 of reversible discharge capacity is delivered at 0.1C with a capacity retention of 90% and a CE above 99.4% during all cycles (Fig. 7d). The average discharge voltage of the NFPP//HC full cell is 2.98 V with a maximum energy density of 219 mW h kg−1. It should also be noted the pre-sodiation of HC was not carried out to decrease the irreversible capacity loss.\nThe electrochemical performance of NFPP fabricated by “calcination” and “combustion” methods in this study was compared with state-of-the-art results reported in the literature, as summarized in Table S4.† The NFPP cathode synthesized via the “combustion” method exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of approximately 102 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, with an impressive capacity retention of 99.7% over 100 cycles. This performance surpasses that of NFPP cathodes modified with some specific carbon coatings, graphene, or nanotubes, which aim to improve electronic conductivity but may compromise the intrinsic properties and energy density of the material. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the “combustion” synthesized NFPP reported in this study can be attributed to the effective elimination of impurities and more homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles and pores within the structure. These improvements were realized through the combustion process in combination with the use of a reducing atmosphere during calcination. By addressing the intrinsic limitations of NFPP without obviously sacrificing its energy density, this study demonstrates a promising approach for the development of high-performance cathode materials for SIBs, paving the way for future developments in sustainable energy storage solutions.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)\nNFPP was synthesized by a modified combustion process using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.99%), ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99), NaH2PO4·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98) and citric acid (C6H8O7) (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5) as precursors. First, 0.045 mol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (oxidant) as the Fe3+ precursor was dissolved in 150 mL distilled water at room temperature and was converted into the Fe2+ state by the addition of a pinch of ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) resulting in a color change from brown to colorless jade-green. After that, 0.06 mol NaH2PO4·2H2O was added into solution and stirred until dissolution. Finally, 0.034 mol citric acid (fuel) was added to the mixture to trigger the exothermic reaction. The final reaction and the calculation for the required minimum citric acid can be written as follows by using the combustion index:\nThe resulting solution was heated using an oil bath at 80 °C until a gel formed. After the evaporation of excess water, the precursor powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dried metal-citro-nitrate complex gel was then pressed into cylindrical pellets, which hereinafter may be referred to as the “sol–gel precursor”. A first set of sol–gel precursor pellets were fired in a tube furnace at 300 °C for 10 min under an air atmosphere to initiate the combustion which resulted in the evolution of NOx gases. For comparative tests, a second set of sol–gel precursor pellets were calcined at 300 °C for 5 h under an Ar/H2 gas (95:5 vol%) flow with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to eliminate organic components. Finally, the amorphous intermediate products obtained after combustion and calcination, respectively, were ground in an agate mortar and pelletized again using a disc-shaped mold (Φ = 13 mm). The pellets of intermediate “combustion” and “calcination” were further annealed at 500 °C for 10 h under flowing Ar/H2 gas (95:5 vol%) as a reducing atmosphere with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. During calcination at high temperature, carbonaceous sources are thermally decomposed to form an in situ amorphous carbon coating (CC) layer on the NFPP surface. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the nanosized NFPP/CC product was obtained. The final samples are hereafter denoted as “NFPP calcination” in the case of the calcination pretreatment or “NFPP combustion” for the combustion pretreatment as shown in Fig. 1a.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nPowder X-ray powder diffraction (PXPD) was used to determine the crystal structure and purity of the “combustion” samples and “calcination” samples, respectively, using a Bruker D8 Twin–Twin diffractometer equipped with a CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA over the range of 5–70 °(2θ) with a scanning step of 0.01° s−1. The refinement was performed using the Rietveld method with the TOPAS software. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra were recorded in transmission mode using a 57Co Rh source at constant acceleration at room temperature. Mössbauer samples were prepared in an argon filled glovebox with a concentration of about 20 mg cm−2. Calibration spectra were recorded from a natural α-Fe metal foil held at 295 K. The resulting spectra were analyzed using a least squares Mössbauer fitting program. Two different pristine materials were examined, one synthesized by “calcination” and one by “combustion” as mentioned in Section 2.1. The electrochemically de-sodiated “NFPP combustion” sample was also studied. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to determine the thermal stability and carbon content of as-synthesized products by using a TA instruments analyzer Q500 by loading 3–5 mg sample in a platinum pan in the TGA furnace under flowing air (25 mL min−1) in the range of 25 °C to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector was used to investigate the morphology, particle size and elemental distribution of the samples using a Zeiss SEM 1550 with an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV. As-prepared powders were mounted on an aluminum stub sample holder using carbon tape. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, the samples were crushed and then directly dispersed on Cu TEM grids with holey carbon supporting films without any solvent. A double aberration-corrected Thermo Fisher Themis Z equipped with a Super-X EDS detector was used for STEM imaging and EDS experiments. The electron microscope was operated at 300 kV and aberrations in the condenser system lenses were corrected up to fifth order. The convergence angle of 21 mrad and probe current of 120 pA were applied for imaging and EDS analysis. To evaluate the particle size, porosity and elemental distribution of samples, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission microscopy (STEM-HAADF) and –BF images were acquired using a Fischione ADF detector and Thermo Fisher BF detector, respectively. The collection angle of HAADF- and BF-STEM images was 63–200 mrad and below 35 mrad, respectively. Imaging and EDS acquisition and analysis were performed using a Thermo Fisher Velox. The atomic ratios of Na, Fe, and P were determined using inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES Varian Vista MPX) and carbon contents were determined by using an elemental analyzer (FLASH EA 1112 CHNS-O). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Kratos Ultra DLD (AXIS) instrument with a monochromatic aluminum Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All peaks were calibrated based on the hydrocarbon species C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The spectra were analyzed using CasaXPS software. The specific surface area and the pore size distribution of samples were determined using a surface area porosity analyzer (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2020).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical performance of NFPP samples was investigated in pouch cells assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox in which O2 and H2O levels were below 1 ppm. Electrodes were fabricated by mixing the active material with conductive carbon black (C-ENERGY Super C65, Imerys) and the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Kynar HSV 900) binder in an 80:10:10 weight ratio using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (Sigma-Aldrich®) as the solvent. The resultant slurry was cast onto carbon-coated aluminum foil on a bar coater with a thickness of 400 μm using the doctor blade method. The electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight and further punched into 20 mm diameter discs with an active material loading of 4–5 mg cm−2. The punched electrodes were then dried in a Büchi oven under vacuum at 120 °C overnight inside a glovebox. Pouch cells were assembled in an argon filled glove-box using glass fiber membranes (Whatman®, 26 mm diameter, 240 μm thick) as separators, 22 mm of Na disks punched from metallic Na cubes (Sigma-Aldrich®) serving as the counter and reference electrodes, and 200–250 μL of 1 M NaPF6 (Stella, 99%) in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme) (Sigma-Aldrich®, ≥99.99%) as the electrolyte. For full-cell fabrication, hard carbon anodes were prepared by mixing hard carbon (HC) (KURANODE™, Kuraray, Japan) with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (Imerys) binder in ∼6 mL deionized water per gram in a 95:5 ratio by weight. The slurry was coated on carbon-coated aluminum foil using a 200 μm gap applicator rod. The as-fabricated hard carbon anodes were punched into 22 mm diameter discs and dried at 170 °C overnight in a glove box. In full-cells, 200–250 μL of 1 M NaPF6 (Stella, 99%) in propylene carbonate (PC) (Sigma-Aldrich®, ≥99.99%) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the electrolyte.\nThe galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling tests of half-cells were carried out using a Neware battery tester BTS4000 in a potential window of 1.8–3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ at 25 °C after 12 h rest to ensure proper wetting of electrodes. The full cells were cycled in the voltage range of 1.0–3.8 V. The areal mass loadings of NFPP and HC are 4.3 mg cm2− and 1.4 mg cm2−, respectively. The negative/positive (N/P) ratio of full cells was 1.1:1. The carbon content within the NFPP/CC was excluded to calculate the specific capacities for each cell. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted by using a Bio-Logic® MPG2 potentiostat.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)\nNFPP was synthesized by a modified combustion process using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.99%), ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99), NaH2PO4·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98) and citric acid (C6H8O7) (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5) as precursors. First, 0.045 mol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (oxidant) as the Fe3+ precursor was dissolved in 150 mL distilled water at room temperature and was converted into the Fe2+ state by the addition of a pinch of ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) resulting in a color change from brown to colorless jade-green. After that, 0.06 mol NaH2PO4·2H2O was added into solution and stirred until dissolution. Finally, 0.034 mol citric acid (fuel) was added to the mixture to trigger the exothermic reaction. The final reaction and the calculation for the required minimum citric acid can be written as follows by using the combustion index:\nThe resulting solution was heated using an oil bath at 80 °C until a gel formed. After the evaporation of excess water, the precursor powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dried metal-citro-nitrate complex gel was then pressed into cylindrical pellets, which hereinafter may be referred to as the “sol–gel precursor”. A first set of sol–gel precursor pellets were fired in a tube furnace at 300 °C for 10 min under an air atmosphere to initiate the combustion which resulted in the evolution of NOx gases. For comparative tests, a second set of sol–gel precursor pellets were calcined at 300 °C for 5 h under an Ar/H2 gas (95:5 vol%) flow with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to eliminate organic components. Finally, the amorphous intermediate products obtained after combustion and calcination, respectively, were ground in an agate mortar and pelletized again using a disc-shaped mold (Φ = 13 mm). The pellets of intermediate “combustion” and “calcination” were further annealed at 500 °C for 10 h under flowing Ar/H2 gas (95:5 vol%) as a reducing atmosphere with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. During calcination at high temperature, carbonaceous sources are thermally decomposed to form an in situ amorphous carbon coating (CC) layer on the NFPP surface. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the nanosized NFPP/CC product was obtained. The final samples are hereafter denoted as “NFPP calcination” in the case of the calcination pretreatment or “NFPP combustion” for the combustion pretreatment as shown in Fig. 1a.\n\n2.2 Material characterization\nPowder X-ray powder diffraction (PXPD) was used to determine the crystal structure and purity of the “combustion” samples and “calcination” samples, respectively, using a Bruker D8 Twin–Twin diffractometer equipped with a CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA over the range of 5–70 °(2θ) with a scanning step of 0.01° s−1. The refinement was performed using the Rietveld method with the TOPAS software. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra were recorded in transmission mode using a 57Co Rh source at constant acceleration at room temperature. Mössbauer samples were prepared in an argon filled glovebox with a concentration of about 20 mg cm−2. Calibration spectra were recorded from a natural α-Fe metal foil held at 295 K. The resulting spectra were analyzed using a least squares Mössbauer fitting program. Two different pristine materials were examined, one synthesized by “calcination” and one by “combustion” as mentioned in Section 2.1. The electrochemically de-sodiated “NFPP combustion” sample was also studied. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to determine the thermal stability and carbon content of as-synthesized products by using a TA instruments analyzer Q500 by loading 3–5 mg sample in a platinum pan in the TGA furnace under flowing air (25 mL min−1) in the range of 25 °C to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector was used to investigate the morphology, particle size and elemental distribution of the samples using a Zeiss SEM 1550 with an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV. As-prepared powders were mounted on an aluminum stub sample holder using carbon tape. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, the samples were crushed and then directly dispersed on Cu TEM grids with holey carbon supporting films without any solvent. A double aberration-corrected Thermo Fisher Themis Z equipped with a Super-X EDS detector was used for STEM imaging and EDS experiments. The electron microscope was operated at 300 kV and aberrations in the condenser system lenses were corrected up to fifth order. The convergence angle of 21 mrad and probe current of 120 pA were applied for imaging and EDS analysis. To evaluate the particle size, porosity and elemental distribution of samples, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission microscopy (STEM-HAADF) and –BF images were acquired using a Fischione ADF detector and Thermo Fisher BF detector, respectively. The collection angle of HAADF- and BF-STEM images was 63–200 mrad and below 35 mrad, respectively. Imaging and EDS acquisition and analysis were performed using a Thermo Fisher Velox. The atomic ratios of Na, Fe, and P were determined using inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES Varian Vista MPX) and carbon contents were determined by using an elemental analyzer (FLASH EA 1112 CHNS-O). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Kratos Ultra DLD (AXIS) instrument with a monochromatic aluminum Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All peaks were calibrated based on the hydrocarbon species C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The spectra were analyzed using CasaXPS software. The specific surface area and the pore size distribution of samples were determined using a surface area porosity analyzer (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2020).\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical performance of NFPP samples was investigated in pouch cells assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox in which O2 and H2O levels were below 1 ppm. Electrodes were fabricated by mixing the active material with conductive carbon black (C-ENERGY Super C65, Imerys) and the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Kynar HSV 900) binder in an 80:10:10 weight ratio using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (Sigma-Aldrich®) as the solvent. The resultant slurry was cast onto carbon-coated aluminum foil on a bar coater with a thickness of 400 μm using the doctor blade method. The electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight and further punched into 20 mm diameter discs with an active material loading of 4–5 mg cm−2. The punched electrodes were then dried in a Büchi oven under vacuum at 120 °C overnight inside a glovebox. Pouch cells were assembled in an argon filled glove-box using glass fiber membranes (Whatman®, 26 mm diameter, 240 μm thick) as separators, 22 mm of Na disks punched from metallic Na cubes (Sigma-Aldrich®) serving as the counter and reference electrodes, and 200–250 μL of 1 M NaPF6 (Stella, 99%) in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme) (Sigma-Aldrich®, ≥99.99%) as the electrolyte. For full-cell fabrication, hard carbon anodes were prepared by mixing hard carbon (HC) (KURANODE™, Kuraray, Japan) with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (Imerys) binder in ∼6 mL deionized water per gram in a 95:5 ratio by weight. The slurry was coated on carbon-coated aluminum foil using a 200 μm gap applicator rod. The as-fabricated hard carbon anodes were punched into 22 mm diameter discs and dried at 170 °C overnight in a glove box. In full-cells, 200–250 μL of 1 M NaPF6 (Stella, 99%) in propylene carbonate (PC) (Sigma-Aldrich®, ≥99.99%) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the electrolyte.\nThe galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling tests of half-cells were carried out using a Neware battery tester BTS4000 in a potential window of 1.8–3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ at 25 °C after 12 h rest to ensure proper wetting of electrodes. The full cells were cycled in the voltage range of 1.0–3.8 V. The areal mass loadings of NFPP and HC are 4.3 mg cm2− and 1.4 mg cm2−, respectively. The negative/positive (N/P) ratio of full cells was 1.1:1. The carbon content within the NFPP/CC was excluded to calculate the specific capacities for each cell. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted by using a Bio-Logic® MPG2 potentiostat.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

For Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, a small amount of Na2CO3 is detected with ATR-FTIR, whereas the absence of these surface impurities is confirmed for Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 by ATR-FTIR measurements as presented together with the reproduced batches in ESI Fig. S8.† Elemental analysis with ICP-OES results in Na0.69Ni0.34Mn0.66O2 and Na0.60Mn0.74Ni0.26O2, respectively, which is in good accordance with the targeted stoichiometries. Based on the knowledge that Mn3+/Mn4+ takes place at a lower potential than Ni2+/Ni3+ redox, we can derive the formal oxidation states Na0.69Ni0.34IIMn0.01IIIMn0.65IVO2 and Na0.60Mn0.08IIIMn0.66IVNi0.26IIO2, respectively. In both samples, nickel is dominantly divalent and manganese is mainly tetravalent. Particle morphology was characterized using SEM (Fig. 2A–D). Both samples consist of secondary particles with a spherical morphology. The crystal structure was characterized using powder XRD and ND. The diffraction patterns for Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 are presented in Fig. 2E–H. For both materials, the obtained XRD pattern (Fig. 2E and F) can be indexed with the hexagonal space group P63/mmc (SG 194), indicating phase pure P2-type crystalline structures. For P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, the small reflexes located at Q = 1.9 Å−1 and Q = 2.0 Å−1 originate from the LLZ Na+/vacancy ordering (see the inset of Fig. 2E). For P2-Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, these superstructure reflexes are absent in accordance with the discrepancy in sodium content (see the inset of Fig. 2F). For P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, a subtle split of the (100) and (20) reflections at Q = 2.5 Å−1 and Q = 4.3 Å−1 in the XRD pattern suggests a slight orthorhombic distortion of the hexagonal unit cell. Additionally, in both XRD patterns the broadening of (10l) reflections hints at stacking faults. The ND patterns of both samples exhibit reflections between Q = 1.3 Å−1 and Q = 2.4 Å−1, indicating the presence of a Ni/Mn honeycomb ordering with predominantly a C2C3 stacking sequence (compare ESI Fig. S5†). Based on these findings, we performed a joint Rietveld refinement of XRD and ND patterns using the “big unit cell” (P6322, SG 182) with a honeycomb Ni/Mn ordering and a C2C3 stacking sequence. For P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, C2221 (SG 20) was used to account for the slight orthorhombic distortion (b/a = 1.728). The results are further refined using “P3-type stacking faults” to account for anisotropic broadening and C1C1 stacking faults. The refined lattice parameters, occupancies and staking fault probabilities are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Both materials, Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, exhibit a honeycomb Ni/Mn ordering. For the latter one, this Ni/Mn ordering is partially disrupted as 27% of the nickel site is occupied by manganese. Please note that a different Ni/Mn ordering for the higher Mn content in Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was evaluated, however, the corresponding simulated ND pattern does not match with the experimentally observed one (ESI Fig. S9†). To evaluate any potential influence of the sodium content on the Ni/Mn superstructure, a third sample, Na2/3Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, was synthesized and characterized respectively. The characterization results for Na2/3Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 are presented in ESI Fig. S10 and ESI Table S7.† Na2/3Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 exhibits a similar honeycomb Ni/Mn ordering as Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 with approximately one quarter of the nickel site being occupied by manganese in accordance with the stoichiometry. Therefore, no influence of the sodium content on the Ni/Mn superstructure is observed.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nCoin half-cells were assembled using P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 or P2-Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 as the cathode active material. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was performed to evaluate the quasi-open circuit voltage (OCV) curve for both materials. The results of the GITT experiments are presented in Fig. 3, where an OCV hull curve is added as a blue line and the on-load hull curve is presented in red colour.\nFor P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 both the OCV and on-load voltage curves exhibit distinct voltage jumps at x ≈ 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3 (Fig. 3A). These voltage jumps are accompanied by flat voltage regions as evidenced by the dQ/dV plot (inset of Fig. 3A). In the literature, these voltage jumps are associated with distinct Na+/vacancy orderings. The flat voltage profiles in proximity to these voltage jumps correspond to order/disorder transitions between unordered and Na+/vacancy ordered phases. The voltage profile of P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, – both at equilibrium and under current load – is considerably smoother than those of P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 (Fig. 3A and B). At the same sodium stoichiometries x = 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3, the voltage profile exhibits small shoulders in accordance with smaller peaks in the dQ/dV analysis (inset of Fig. 3B).\nWhereas the nature of the actual Na+/vacancy orderings have been reported in the literature for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, to the best of our knowledge, for P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the nature of Na+/vacancy orderings has not been elucidated so far. However, the similarities in composition and structure suggest similar Na+/vacancy orderings in both materials. The significantly reduced voltage jumps for P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 compared to P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 hint to partially suppressed or disrupted Na+/vacancy orderings in P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2.\nTo further investigate the nature and extent of Na+/vacancy orderings in both materials, synchrotron operando XRD measurements were performed. Waterfall diagrams of the obtained diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 4A and B for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, respectively. For both materials, the measurements start with sodiation from the charged state. The diffraction patterns corresponding to sodium contents of x = 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3 are highlighted in red, magenta and green colour, respectively. For P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, clear superstructure reflections in proximity to the sodium content of x = 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3 are apparent. Simulated diffraction patterns based on the reported in-plane Na+/vacancy ordering by Lee et al. and Huang et al. are presented in ESI Fig. S11,† in which the range of experimentally found superstructure reflections is highlighted in yellow colour for the ease of comparison. At sodium stoichiometries of x = 2/3 and 1/3, the observed superstructure reflexions match the simulated pattern based on the Na+/vacancy ordering reported by Lee et al. For x = 1/2, observed superstructure reflections match the report by Huang et al. in accordance with a previous publication.\nFor P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, similar superstructure reflections in proximity to x = 2/3 and 1/3 are apparent, however, the superstructure reflection at x = 2/3 is very weak. For P2-Na1/2±δMn3/4Ni1/4O2, no superstructure reflection is observed, indicating that no long-range Na+/vacancy ordering exists at this stoichiometry. The comparably low intensity of the Na+/vacancy superstructure reflection in P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 is indicative of either decreased long-range order (disrupted ordering) or a smaller weight fraction of the ordered phase (partial ordering). For both materials, the similarity of the superstructure reflection at x = 2/3 and 1/3 supports the assumption that the in-plane Na+/vacancy ordering is the same for both materials. These observations are in accordance with diffraction patterns obtained by ex situ capillary transmission XRD, as presented in ESI Fig. S12.† For both materials, the heat maps of the obtained diffraction patterns as well as the refined lattice parameters (Pawley method) are presented in ESI Fig. S13 and S14.† A good agreement of refined lattice parameters as well as the nature and extent of the detected Na+/vacancy ordering is found for synchrotron operando XRD and ex situ capillary transmission XRD, indicating that the operando measurement is close to equilibrium.\nTo measure the extent of Na+/vacancy orderings at various stoichiometries, entropymetry measurements were performed. A detailed description of the method is provided in the ESI.† In short, the equilibrium voltage at different sodium contents was measured at 40 °C, 25 °C and 10 °C following a GITT procedure including temperature change at every equilibrium step. The change in measured equilibrium voltage EOCV with the change in temperature ΔT is proportional to the entropy change ΔS at the corresponding sodium content x, according to:\nSeveral factors, such as the configurational entropy, phonon entropy and electronic entropy, can contribute to the entropy change of a material. However, the course of the entropy change is reported to be highly dominated by the configurational entropy, making entropymetry a valuable tool to investigate it.\nThe entropy change derived from several independent cells is presented in Fig. 5A and B for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, respectively. For P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, the entropy change curve exhibits a distinct double-S shape in proximity to sodium contents x ≈ 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3. As described in the ESI,† such a double-S shaped course of the entropy change is expected in proximity to Na+/vacancy ordered phases. For P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the entropy change curve follows a double-S shape at x ≈ 2/3, 0.54, 1/2 and 1/3, indicative of Na+/vacancy ordering at these stoichiometries. For P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the variation of entropy change at x ≈ 2/3 and 1/2 is significantly smaller compared to P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, indicating a reduced extent of Na+/vacancy orderings in the former material. The double-S shaped course of the entropy change in proximity to x ≈ 0.54 might correspond to a weak Na+/vacancy ordering resembling the reported Na+/vacancy ordering in Na4/7CoO2. We have estimated the expected potential jump based on the measured configurational entropy change and summarized the estimated potential differences due to Na+/vacancy orderings in ESI Table S8.† The results further corroborate more pronounced Na+/vacancy orderings at x = 2/3 and 1/2 for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 compared to P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. Furthermore, the measured voltage jumps in GITT measurements (Fig. 3) at x = 2/3, 1/3 in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and at x = 1/3 in P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 significantly exceed the estimated potential jumps due to configurational entropy change (i.e., Na+/vacancy ordering), suggesting additional processes contributing to these voltage jumps. For x = 2/3 in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, the energy difference between Ni2+/3+ redox and Mn3+/4+ redox is expected to significantly contribute to the voltage jump at x = 2/3 in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2. For both materials, the onset of the P2–O2 phase transition is expected to contribute to the voltage jump at x = 1/3.\nOverall, GITT, operando XRD, ex situ XRD, and entropymetry indicate similar Na+/vacancy orderings at x = 2/3 and 1/3 in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. For x = 2/3 and x = 1/2, XRD and entropymetry measurements suggest a disrupted Na+/vacancy ordering in P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. For x = 1/3, no significant influence of the Ni/Mn ratio on the Na+/vacancy ordering is detected.\nIn general, Na+/vacancy orderings in these structures result from the high stability (low Gibbs free enthalpy) of the ordered configurations. In Na+/vacancy ordered phases, Gibbs free enthalpy is eventually reduced by (i) minimized Na+–Na+ repulsion within the sodium layer and (ii) advantageous interaction of Na+ with the immediate environment of the MO2 slab (i.e., low energy sodium lattice sites). For the herein investigated materials, the transition metals, nickel and manganese, are known to adopt different formal oxidation states depending on the applied electrode potential. Hence, the stability of sodium sites is eventually influenced by the transition metals in the immediate environment and the formal oxidation states thereof. The resulting difference in energy for various sodium sites potentially contributes to the preferential occupation of these sites (i.e., preferential occupation of low-energy sodium sites).\n\nComputational\nComputational methods were employed to gain further insights into the origin of Na+/vacancy orderings in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. First, we identify the thermodynamically stable phases. Then, we evaluate the electronic structure and the charge density distribution of the transition metals in these materials. Subsequently, we evaluate the existence of low-energy sodium lattice sites in the absence of Na+–Na+ repulsion. Finally, we analyse the charge ordering within the MO2 slab and correlate these findings with the existence and stability of Na+/vacancy orderings.\nSpin polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed to determine the thermodynamically stable phases and construct the convex hull for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. For P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, the implemented unit cell includes 24 transition metal atoms arranged in a characteristic honeycomb Ni/Mn ordering in accordance with our characterization results and the literature (Fig. 6A). By substituting every fourth Ni by Mn, the unit cell for P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 with a defect honeycomb transition metal ordering is obtained according to the characterization results (Fig. 6B). Even though the in-plane sodium arrangement has been reported for the Na+/vacancy orderings at x = 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3 in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, to the best of our knowledge, the relation of this in-plane sodium ordering to the honeycomb ordered MO2 slabs has not been analysed so far. To fill this gap, we have calculated the free enthalpy for the reported in-plane sodium vacancy orderings at various sites in these large Ni/Mn ordered superstructure cells. The calculated convex hull is presented in Fig. 6C and D for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, respectively. For P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, solely the O2-structure at x = 0 and the Na+/vacancy ordered P2-structures at x = 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 are located on the convex hull. At x = 1/2, the Na+/vacancy ordering, as reported by Huang et al., was calculated to be energetically favourable, which is in accordance with our operando XRD results and literature reports for Na1/2CoO2. At x = 2/3, the determined stable structure exhibits the same in-plane Na+/vacancy ordering; however, the stacking sequence differs from reports on P2-Na2/3CoO2. For P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the O2-structure at x = 0 and the P2-structures at x = 1/3, 5/12, 1/2, 7/12 and 2/3 are located on the convex hull. At x = 1/2, the reported ordering by Lee et al. was calculated to be slightly more stable than the ordering reported by Huang et al. The marginal difference in energy between both orderings is in accordance with the disrupted Na+/vacancy ordering observed with operando XRD and entropymetry measurements.\nIn general, configurations located on the convex hull (Fig. 6C and D) are stable, whereas all configurations with formation enthalpies above the convex hull are unstable or metastable. The convex hull directly relates to the enthalpy difference between sodium in intercalated and metallic form, whereas the measured OCV curve, as presented in Fig. 3, represents the Gibb's free energy (enthalpic plus entropic contribution) of the same reaction. In the convex hull, segments of solely unstable configurations (e.g., 0 < x < 1/3 in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2) represent a miscibility gap between the respective stable endmembers (e.g., O2-Na0Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-Na1/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2). The corresponding two-phase reaction results in a characteristic voltage plateau in the electrochemical potential profile. Overall, the calculated convex hull well describes the course of the experimentally determined OCV curve, suggesting that the enthalpy change dominates the course of the Gibb's free energy, however, small differences between the convex hull and the experimentally derived OCV curve exist. For P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 (Fig. 6C), the miscibility gap in the ranges 1/3 < x < 1/2 and 1/2 < x < 2/3 is expected to cause a voltage plateau. Experimentally, we find two small voltage plateaus associated with the order/disorder transitions in proximity to the respective Na+/vacancy orderings and observe distinct voltage jumps for Na+/vacancy ordered phases. The difference between the expected potential profile based on the convex hull and the measured voltage profile eventually arises from (finite) temperature effects. For P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 (Fig. 6D), no miscibility gap is expected between 1/3 < x < 2/3 based on the convex hull in line with the much smoother electrochemical voltage profile in Fig. 3B.\nTo elucidate the nature of the M–O and Na–O bonds, Density Overlap Regions Indicators (DORI) were determined for P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 as presented in Fig. 7. The DORI analysis was developed to distinguish covalent from noncovalent interactions, while differences between metallic and ionic bonding cannot be resolved. In this framework, covalent interactions are revealed by localized overlap indicators, while noncovalent interactions are characterized by fully smeared out overlap indicators. This analysis is not restricted to interactions in molecules as similar bonding characteristics exist in solids and DORI was already successfully applied to Mn-oxides.\nHence, the DORI analysis in Fig. 7 allows tracking qualitative differences in bonding character between the different bonds in the system. Qualitatively identical results were observed independent of Na content and the Ni/Mn ratio and are depicted in ESI Fig. S15.† While the Mn–O and Ni–O bonds are characterized by localized basins of DORI values close to 1, indicating increased covalent character, the Na–O bonds show entirely smeared out overlap indicators implying ionic bonding. The revealed covalent nature of the M–O bond is in good agreement with what has been found for many other comparable oxides and corresponds to a distribution of the electron density along the M–O bond. Thus, only formal oxidation states, which do not necessarily agree with the true charge at the ion, can be assigned. This observation is in accordance with the calculated Bader charges, which indicate lower electron density at the transition metal ion than that suggested by the formal oxidation state (see Table 3).\nTo further elucidate the nature of the M–O bonding, we determined the partial density of states (PDOS) shown in Fig. 8A. Indeed, no Na 2s states are found in the valence band region in agreement with the ionic character of the Na–O bond. In contrast, the M-3d states are found to strongly hybridise with the O-2sp3 states in the valence band region, possibly indicating the prevalence of covalent bonding in the MO2 layer. While this supports the simplified picture of the Na atoms donating their electrons to the MO2 layer, it raises the question of the charge density distribution in the MO2 slab. Specifically, it is of interest whether electrons (e−) are entirely localized in M–O bonds or whether they are delocalized over several transition metal atoms. In fact, transition metal compounds are well known to delocalize electrons through direct exchange or super exchange interactions. In the present case, however, no direct overlap between metal 3d orbitals are possible owing to the long metal–metal distance and the ferromagnetic coupling between ions. Instead, delocalisation is achieved through a super-exchange interaction whereby electrons are delocalized through an at least partially covalent M–O–M two electron three center (2e3c) bond. This is a well known bonding scheme in inorganic chemistry which has also been observed for related compounds such as manganese hydroxo complexes and Cu2O. These observations suggest that similar bonding characteristics can possibly lead to delocalization of e− also in the here investigated samples.\nFor P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 (Fig. 8A), independent of Na content, the low spin Ni t2g orbitals are fully occupied in both spin majority and minority directions and are found in the range from −6 eV to 0 eV. The Ni orbitals are either empty (x = 0) and form the conduction band or are partially occupied (x > 0) and situated below the Fermi level, depending on the Na content in the structure. During sodiation of NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, first the low lying Ni are partially occupied and shifted below the Fermi energy. At a sodium content of x = 1/3 the Ni atoms are formally Ni3+ and undergo a Jahn–Teller splitting of the into occupied dx2−y2 and unoccupied dz2 states (Fig. 8B). This is followed by further reduction of Ni from Ni3+ to Ni2+ with increasing Na content leading to fully occupied Ni states at a Na content of x = 2/3. Independent of the sodium content x (2/3 > x > 0), Mn t2g orbitals are fully occupied in the spin majority direction and empty in the spin minority direction and are found in the range between −6 eV and 0 eV. The Mn orbitals are situated between 1.5 eV and 2.5 eV independent of the Na content x and hence do not contribute to the electrochemical processes in this material (0 < x < 2/3). The significant potential jump at x = 2/3, as observed in GITT measurements (Fig. 3), is qualitatively supported by the observed energy difference between Ni and Mn states in PDOS.\nIn P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, PDOS features appear similar, however, they are shifted in sodium content. Due to the reduced Ni content in NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the respective Ni redox processes are shifted to lower Na contents and Ni is fully occupied at x = 1/2. For x = 2/3, the Mn orbitals are partially occupied and shifted below the Fermi level. With increasing sodium content, the continuously increasing occupation of the Ni and Mn can be rationalized considering octahedral crystal field splitting (Fig. 8B) in conjunction with the formal oxidation states of the transition metal centre. Thus, sodiation beyond x = 1/2 leads to Mn redox activity and the formation of Jahn–Teller active Mn3+ by partial occupation of Mn states.\nTo corroborate the observations in the PDOS, we have analysed local magnetic moments μ and Bader charges of the transition metal atoms and summarized the results in Table 3. The local magnetic moment allows distinguishing between transition metals of different formal oxidation states based on the number of unpaired electrons expected from the crystal field splitting as presented in Fig. 8B. In contrast, Bader charges are determined by charge partitioning of the charge density obtained using DFT and yield qualitative trends for charge situated at the transition metal centre. Despite their fundamentally different methodologies, both methods show similar trends in agreement with the analysis of the PDOS.\nFor P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, with increasing sodium content, the local magnetic moment increases and Bader charges decrease for Ni, whereas both values remain invariant for Mn. Hence, with increasing sodium content, Ni is gradually reduced from Ni3+ at x = 1/3 to Ni2+ at x = 2/3, while Mn is redox inactive. At x = 1/2, Ni3+ and Ni2+ are detected in equal amounts.\nFor P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2, with increasing sodium content, the local magnetic moment increases and the Bader charges decrease for Ni from x = 1/3 to x = 1/2, whereas Mn remains invariant within this sodium range. Further sodiation from x = 1/2 to x = 2/3, leads to increasing local magnetic moment and decreasing Bader charges for Mn, whereas Ni is invariant. Hence, Ni is redox active for x < 1/2 and Mn is redox active at sodium contents x > 1/2.\nOverall, the analysis of PDOS, the local magnetic moment μ and Bader charges, suggest that charge within the MO2 slab is considerably localized at the covalently bonded transition metals, making formal oxidation states an acceptable descriptor for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2. Please note that similar charge disproportionation has been reported for P2-NaxCoO2 and O′3-NaxMnO2 with experimental and computational methods.\nAs described above, various transition metal oxidation states within the MO2 slab potentially result in low energy sodium sites. The interplay between the preferential occupation of these low energy sodium sites and Na+–Na+ repulsion eventually results in Na+/vacancy orderings. To deconvolute these two effects, we have calculated sodium site energies at a high vacancy limit by placing one sodium atom in a supercell with 24 transition metals (x = 1/24). The supercell volume was fixed to the one of a calculated, hypothetical empty P2-structure. Subsequently, we analysed the difference in energy between the respective site and the lowest energy site. Since only one sodium atom is placed within the large supercell, Na+–Na+ repulsion can be neglected and solely the influence of the immediate environment is modelled. Please note that these structures constitute a model system and do not reflect the experimentally found configurations (P2–O2 two-phase reaction).\nFor P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, the honeycomb arrangement of the metal atoms distinguishes the Naf sites in NaMn–Mnf and NaMn–Nif that either sit in between two Mn octahedra (Mn–Na–Mn dumbbell) or in between a Ni and a Mn octahedra (Ni–Na–Mn dumbbell), respectively, while all Nae are equivalent. In P2-Na1/24Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, the sodium site energies follow the trend Nae < NaMn–Nif < NaMn–Mnf as presented in Fig. 9A. This qualitative trend can be rationalized when considering that the insertion of one Na atom leads to the reduction of one Ni centre from Ni4+ to Ni3+. Since the Na–O bond is ionic, Na+ interacts with the charge density distribution in the MO2 slab and Na sites in vicinity of Ni centres are beneficial due to their lower formal oxidation state. In P2-Ni1/24Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, the substitution of 1/12 of the Ni atoms by Mn atoms leads to further inequivalence of the Na sites when the nearest neighbour transition metals are considered, which is reflected in the sodium site energies as presented in Fig. 9B. The Na site energy is substantially increased for Naf sites in Mn–Na–Mn dumbbells and the surrounding Nae sites. This phenomenon is caused by the redox-inactive nature of the Mn atoms at such small sodium contents. Mn atoms remain in the formal 4+ oxidation state and therefore lead to significant electrostatic repulsion of the adjacent Na cations. The charge is compensated by a reduction of nearest-neighbour Ni atoms, which are considerably far from the particular high-energy sodium lattice sites. Overall, the calculated sodium site energies suggest preferential occupation of Nae sites over Naf sites in accordance with expectations based on Pauling's principles. For P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 (Fig. 9A), two energetically different Naf sites are available, which arrange in a distinct pattern. For P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2 (Fig. 9B), additional Mn–Na–Mn dumbbells result in an energy penalty for corresponding Naf sites and adjacent Nae sites. For P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the simple site energy pattern, as observed for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, is disrupted. In this model experiment, site energies differ in more than 200 mV, suggesting a potentially strong influence of site energies on Na+/vacancy orderings.\nEncouraged by these results, we have analysed the most stable structures for x = 2/3, 1/2 and 1/3 in terms of charge ordering within the MO2 slab and its relation to Na+/vacancy ordering. Please note that the analysed structures are in accordance with the experimental characterization and therefore most likely resemble the physical reality. Respective structure files are provided in the ESI.† A depiction of the calculated most stable structures following the in-plane Na+/vacancy orderings as reported by Lee et al. is presented in Fig. 10A and B for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2, respectively. For x = 1/2, an additional comparison between the Na+/vacancy orderings reported by Lee et al. and Huang et al. is presented in ESI Fig. S16.† In both figures, the three-dimensional crystal structure is presented as stacking of three slices with [0 0 1] orientation. Charge ordering within the transition metal slab as derived from magnetic moments and Bader charges (Table 3) is depicted in the colour code. In-plane Na+/vacancy orderings are presented in red colour for occupied Naf sites and petrol colour for occupied Nae sites (following the colour code in the publication by Lee et al.). Occupied sodium sites are categorized by their closest neighbour transition metals and the respective oxidation state.\nOrderings following Lee et al. (Fig. 10) – for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, solely Ni2+ and Ni3+ next to Mn4+ are observed at x = 2/3 and 1/3, respectively, resulting in simple hexagonal charge orderings within the MO2 slab. At x = 1/2, Ni2+ and Ni3+ arrange in alternating lines, which is in contrast to a more homogeneous charge distribution within the MO2 slab following a hexagonal pattern. A similar charge ordering in lines has been observed for Na1/2CoO2. For P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the change in Ni/Mn stoichiometry leads to a shift to lower oxidation states as discussed above. At x = 2/3, the addition of manganese to the structure leads to two adjacent Mn3+ atoms. At x = 1/2, solely Ni2+ and Mn4+ is present. At x = 1/3, a line ordering of Ni3+ and Ni2+/Mn4+ is observed. Overall, the simple charge orderings observed in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 are disrupted in P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2. As a result of the simple charge orderings in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, Naf sites are exclusively occupied if one of the nearest neighbour transition metals is Ni2+. For each sodium stoichiometry, all occupied Nae sites exhibit the same transition metal oxidation state environment. For P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2, the disrupted charge ordering within the MO2 slab causes more diverse nearest-neighbour environments for occupied Nae and Naf sites.\nOrdering following Huang et al. (ESI Fig. S16†) – for both P2-Na1/2Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-Na1/2Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, we find the same transition metal charge orderings for the in-plane Na+/vacancy ordering reported by Huang et al. and Lee et al. Independent of the Ni/Mn ratio, two Naf sites with different nearest-neighbour environments (Mn4+–Na+f–Ni2+ and Mn4+–Na+f–Mn4+) and two energetically different Nae sites are occupied. The nearest-neighbour environment of these Nae sites is influenced by the Ni/Mn ratio, eventually influencing the stability of the Na+/vacancy ordering.\nComparison of evaluated Na+/vacancy orderings at x = 1/2 – both operando XRD experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the Na+/vacancy ordering as reported by Huang et al. is present in P2-Na1/2Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. For P2-Na1/2Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, no indication for long-range Na+/vacancy ordering is found in operando XRD experiments and DFT calculations suggest a marginal energy benefit for the ordering reported by Lee et al. Please note that the ordering reported by Huang et al. incorporates a lower fraction of Nae sites (Nae/Naf = 1) compared to the reported in-plane Na+/vacancy ordering by Lee et al. (Nae/Naf = 2). Furthermore, the ordering reported by Huang et al. is characteristic for increased mean squared Na+–Na+ distances, resulting in an energy benefit by minimizing in-plane Na+–Na+ repulsion. For P2-Na1/2Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, the minimized Na+–Na+ repulsion (Huang ordering) seems to prevail over the effect of low energy sodium sites (Lee ordering). For P2-Na1/2Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, the disruption of the transition metal charge ordering destabilizes the ordering reported by Huang et al. As a result, none of both Na+/vacancy orderings results in a significant energy gain and long-range Na+/vacancy ordering is disrupted.\nInfluence of Ni/Mn stoichiometry on Na+/vacancy orderings – if we compare the same Na+/vacancy ordered structure for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 (vertical comparison in Fig. 10 and ESI fig. S16†), Na+–Na+ distances remain constant. Therefore, the relative stability of the compared Na+/vacancy orderings is solely influenced by the transition metal environment. At x = 2/3, the decrease in the Ni/Mn ratio from P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 to P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 leads to the occupation of energetically more diverse sodium sites. Consequently, the Na+/vacancy ordering is partially disrupted in P2-NixMn3/4Ni1/4O2. At x = 1/2, the transition metal charge ordering in rows in P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 is disrupted when the Ni/Mn ratio is increased (P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2). As a result, the energy benefit of the Huang ordering is lost and any long-range Na+/vacancy ordering is suppressed. At x = 1/3, no influence of the Ni/Mn ratio and the transition metal charge ordering on Na+/vacancy ordering is found. Enabled by the relatively low sodium content, only low energy sodium sites are occupied in both materials and we conclude that Na+/vacancy ordering at x = 1/3 is dominated by the effect of Na+–Na+ repulsion.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The dense, spherical Ni1/3Mn2/3(OH)2 and Mn3/4Ni1/4(OH)2 hydroxide precursors were prepared under vigorous stirring in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR, volume = 1 liter). The reactor was constantly fed with deaerated, aqueous solutions of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (Carl Roth) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Carl Roth), NH3 (Carl Roth) and NaOH (Carl Roth). The precipitate collected at the reactor outlet was filtered and washed to remove residual salt solutions and dried. Subsequently, these hydroxide precursors were mixed with respective amounts of aqueous NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich) solution and dried at 80 °C following a wet impregnation procedure. The dried mixture was then calcined in a box furnace (Carbolite Gero). Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 was calcined for 10 h at 900 °C in a pure oxygen atmosphere, Na2/3Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was calcined for 10 h at 900 °C in air as described elsewhere and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was calcined for 10 h at 1000 °C in pure oxygen. After passive cooling to 200 °C, the powders were directly transferred into a Büchi glass oven, where they were kept at 200 °C under dynamic vacuum overnight. Subsequently, the CAM powders were transferred without any further contact with ambient air into an Ar-filled glovebox (MBraun, H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). Consecutive powder handling, electrode preparation and cell assembly were conducted in the same glovebox.\nFor powder characterization with ND, a second batch of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was prepared based on the same hydroxide precursor and following the same synthesis procedure. A comparison of the characterization results for the two batches is presented in ESI Fig. S6 with ESI Tables S3 and S4 and ESI Fig. S7 with ESI Tables S5 and S6† for Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, respectively.\nAdditionally, P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, P2-Na3/4Ni1/4Li1/12Mn2/3O2, P2-Na2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2, P2-Na2/3Ni2/9Al1/9Mn2/3O2 and P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Al1/9Mn5/9O2 were synthesized. The respective synthesis route, main characterization results and electrochemical testing procedure are described in the ESI.†\n\nMaterial characterization\nInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Spectro Arcos SOP) with a diluted aqua regia solution was used for analysis of the chemical composition. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR) was performed using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer with an Alpha-P ATR unit placed in an Ar-filled glovebox. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the powder morphology using a Leo 1530VP (Zeiss) equipped with an Everhart–Thornley SE detector at 5 kV acceleration voltage. Powder XRD patterns were collected on a D8Advance (Bruker) in Bragg–Brentano geometry equipped with a Cu X-ray tube and a LynxEye XE-T detector. Neutron diffraction patterns were recorded at MEREDIT instrument at the Nuclear Physics Institute CAS located in Řež near Prague, Czech Republic. A joint refinement of XRD and ND patterns was performed to obtain lattice parameters, Wyckoff sites and site occupations using the FullProf Suite software. Lattice parameters were refined independently for XRD and ND patterns, due to potentially different measurement temperatures and the different sensitivities of X-ray and neutron radiation. Instrumental broadening was determined from SiO2 powder on a mosaic Cu(222) monocrystal for ND and NIST640c Si powder for XRD. Based on the results of the joint ND and XRD refinement, FAULTS software was deployed to obtain the stacking probability of P3-type stacking faults from the XRD patterns and to analyse the stacking probability of C1C1 stacking faults from ND patterns. The refinement procedure is described in more detail in the ESI.† Throughout the manuscript, depictions of the crystal structures were prepared using VESTA software.\nEx situ capillary transmission XRD measurements were performed on the same D8Advance (Bruker) instrument. For this purpose, CR2032 coin cells were galvanostatically (dis)charged to obtain the desired active material sodium content and subsequently opened inside an argon filled glovebox. After rinsing with dimethyl carbonate (DMC), the electrode composite was carefully scratched off the aluminium current collector foil and filled into glass capillaries (Ø 0.3 mm, Hilgenberg). The glass capillaries were sealed inside an argon filled glovebox to avoid any contact with the ambient environment.\n\nElectrochemical investigations\nSlurries were prepared by homogeneously dispersing a CAM powder, polyvinylidene difluoride binder (PVDF, Solvay Solef 5130) and conductive carbon (SuperP-Li, Imerys Graphite & Carbon) with an 8:1:1 weight ratio in an appropriate amount of anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich). These slurries were cast on aluminium current collector foils using the doctor blade technique. Electrodes with Ø12 mm and a typical active material mass loading of approximately 4 mg cm−2 were punched from the dried electrode sheets. The electrodes were further dried in a Büchi glass oven at 130 °C and dynamic vacuum (≈2 × 10−5 bar) overnight. Alumina coated CR2032 coin cells (Hohsen) were prepared using these electrodes, two layers of a glass fibre separator (GFA, Whatman, Ø16 mm), 150 μl of 1 M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) + 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as electrolyte and sodium metal foil as the counter electrode (Acros Organics, Ø16 mm). The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was performed on a VMP3 potentiostat (Biologic) using specific current pulses of 17.3 mA g−1 for 10 min within the voltage range of 1.5–4.3 V. Equilibrium was assumed when the absolute voltage change was <0.0001 V h−1. Entropymetry measurements were performed using the same potentiostat and a programmable temperature chamber (CTS GmbH) with temperature steps at 40 °C, 25 °C and 10 °C. Specific current pulses of 8.7 mA g−1 with various time periods were applied at 40 °C, followed by a relaxation time of 8 h at the same temperature. In the following, the temperature was changed within 15 min to 25 °C, where it was held for 105 min. Subsequently, the temperature was changed to 10 °C following the same procedure before another current pulse was applied at 40 °C. Equilibrium voltages were derived from the average voltage of the last thirty minutes at each temperature step. The sodium stoichiometry was calculated based on the measured charge of the current pulse and the electrode active material mass, assuming that side reactions were negligible. For every sodium stoichiometry, the entropy change was derived from the obtained slope of the cell voltage with temperature as described in the ESI.†\nOperando synchrotron XRD measurements were performed at PETRA III, beamline P02.1 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). 2D diffraction images were collected using a VATEX CT4343 area detector (2880 × 2880 pixels, 150 × 150 μm pixel size) for 60 seconds. The obtained data were integrated using the DAWN package. An eight-fold coin cell holder, connected to a Biologic Instruments potentiostat, was employed as described elsewhere. A wavelength of 0.20734(1) Å was determined by analysis of the positions of reflections of the LaB6 reference material (NIST 660C). Prior to recording the first diffraction pattern, the electrochemical cells were subject to a formation cycle at 8.65 mA g−1 (discharge to 1.5 V followed by charge to 4.2 V). Subsequently, diffraction patterns were collected with the pre-charged cell by first discharging to 1.5 V followed by charge to 4.3 V at a constant current of 8.65 mA g−1. All diffraction patterns were analysed by the Rietveld method with TOPAS V6 software where the reflections of the Al current collector served as the internal reference.\nThroughout this work, either cell voltages from two-electrode measurements with a sodium metal counter electrode or potentials against a sodium metal quasi-reference electrode (three-electrode setup) are reported.\n\nComputational methods\nPeriodic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to determine the convex hull for the Na intercalation for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. The projector augmented wave method (PAW) was used in conjunction with the PBE exchange and correlation functional. In addition, the Grimme D3 correction was employed as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to capture the influence of dispersion effects. The data-driven Hubbard-type U corrections of UNi = 6.2 eV and UMn = 3.9 eV (ref. and ) were used to treat the strongly correlated 3d-electrons of the Ni and Mn atoms. The plane wave cut-off was set to 520 eV and a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh was employed to sample the Brillouin zone. A large supercell containing 24 formula units and ferromagnetic ordering was chosen. The electronic convergence criterion was set to 1 × 10−6 eV and the structures were relaxed until all forces converged below 0.01 eV Å−1. The open circuit potential VOCV in a Na-ion battery is governed by the change in free enthalpy ΔG for the transfer of a Na atom. Thus, the open circuit voltage (OCV) is determined by the difference of the chemical potential μ of Na in the anode and cathode by taking into account the number of transferred electrons ne and the Faraday constant F:\nBy neglecting pV and the entropic contributions to ΔG, the difference in the chemical potential of the Na atom is approximated using the total energy of DFT calculations EDFT. The calculation of the VOCV for an exemplary layered oxide compound NaxMO2 follows:\nIn eqn (2), EDFT is stated in eV and sodium metal is chosen as the reference for the anode. Since the mode of intercalation in these materials deviates from a simple solid-solution behaviour and first order phase transformations at high potentials as well as Na+/vacancy ordering transitions occur, the convex hull for the Na intercalation compound is derived to identify thermodynamically stable configurations. The convex hull is constructed from the formation energy Efx with respect to the decomposition into the Na deficient O2-type structure (x = 0) and the P2-type structure at a Na content of x = 2/3:\nOnce the convex hull is constructed by calculating the formation energy per formula unit, the OCV for each stable configuration is obtained using eqn (1). The convex hull calculations for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 were employed following the previously described procedure for the sodium contents 0 < x < 1/3 (ref. and ) and by considering the row and large-zig-zag Na+/vacancy orderings at the Na contents x = 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 as identified by Lee et al. and the alternative Na+/vacancy ordering at x = 1/2 proposed by Huang et al. Additional Na configurations for the Na contents x = 1/3, 5/12, and 7/12 were selected by minimizing the classical Ewald energy assuming integer charges for redox inactive atoms (i.e., Na+, O2−) and variable charges for the TM atoms (i.e., Ni2+/3+/4+, and Mn3+/4+) for all possible configurations as implemented in pymatgen.

The dense, spherical Ni1/3Mn2/3(OH)2 and Mn3/4Ni1/4(OH)2 hydroxide precursors were prepared under vigorous stirring in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR, volume = 1 liter). The reactor was constantly fed with deaerated, aqueous solutions of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (Carl Roth) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Carl Roth), NH3 (Carl Roth) and NaOH (Carl Roth). The precipitate collected at the reactor outlet was filtered and washed to remove residual salt solutions and dried. Subsequently, these hydroxide precursors were mixed with respective amounts of aqueous NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich) solution and dried at 80 °C following a wet impregnation procedure. The dried mixture was then calcined in a box furnace (Carbolite Gero). Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 was calcined for 10 h at 900 °C in a pure oxygen atmosphere, Na2/3Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was calcined for 10 h at 900 °C in air as described elsewhere and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was calcined for 10 h at 1000 °C in pure oxygen. After passive cooling to 200 °C, the powders were directly transferred into a Büchi glass oven, where they were kept at 200 °C under dynamic vacuum overnight. Subsequently, the CAM powders were transferred without any further contact with ambient air into an Ar-filled glovebox (MBraun, H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). Consecutive powder handling, electrode preparation and cell assembly were conducted in the same glovebox.\nFor powder characterization with ND, a second batch of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was prepared based on the same hydroxide precursor and following the same synthesis procedure. A comparison of the characterization results for the two batches is presented in ESI Fig. S6 with ESI Tables S3 and S4 and ESI Fig. S7 with ESI Tables S5 and S6† for Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, respectively.\nAdditionally, P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, P2-Na3/4Ni1/4Li1/12Mn2/3O2, P2-Na2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2, P2-Na2/3Ni2/9Al1/9Mn2/3O2 and P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Al1/9Mn5/9O2 were synthesized. The respective synthesis route, main characterization results and electrochemical testing procedure are described in the ESI.†\n\nMaterial characterization\nInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Spectro Arcos SOP) with a diluted aqua regia solution was used for analysis of the chemical composition. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR) was performed using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer with an Alpha-P ATR unit placed in an Ar-filled glovebox. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the powder morphology using a Leo 1530VP (Zeiss) equipped with an Everhart–Thornley SE detector at 5 kV acceleration voltage. Powder XRD patterns were collected on a D8Advance (Bruker) in Bragg–Brentano geometry equipped with a Cu X-ray tube and a LynxEye XE-T detector. Neutron diffraction patterns were recorded at MEREDIT instrument at the Nuclear Physics Institute CAS located in Řež near Prague, Czech Republic. A joint refinement of XRD and ND patterns was performed to obtain lattice parameters, Wyckoff sites and site occupations using the FullProf Suite software. Lattice parameters were refined independently for XRD and ND patterns, due to potentially different measurement temperatures and the different sensitivities of X-ray and neutron radiation. Instrumental broadening was determined from SiO2 powder on a mosaic Cu(222) monocrystal for ND and NIST640c Si powder for XRD. Based on the results of the joint ND and XRD refinement, FAULTS software was deployed to obtain the stacking probability of P3-type stacking faults from the XRD patterns and to analyse the stacking probability of C1C1 stacking faults from ND patterns. The refinement procedure is described in more detail in the ESI.† Throughout the manuscript, depictions of the crystal structures were prepared using VESTA software.\nEx situ capillary transmission XRD measurements were performed on the same D8Advance (Bruker) instrument. For this purpose, CR2032 coin cells were galvanostatically (dis)charged to obtain the desired active material sodium content and subsequently opened inside an argon filled glovebox. After rinsing with dimethyl carbonate (DMC), the electrode composite was carefully scratched off the aluminium current collector foil and filled into glass capillaries (Ø 0.3 mm, Hilgenberg). The glass capillaries were sealed inside an argon filled glovebox to avoid any contact with the ambient environment.\n\nElectrochemical investigations\nSlurries were prepared by homogeneously dispersing a CAM powder, polyvinylidene difluoride binder (PVDF, Solvay Solef 5130) and conductive carbon (SuperP-Li, Imerys Graphite & Carbon) with an 8:1:1 weight ratio in an appropriate amount of anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich). These slurries were cast on aluminium current collector foils using the doctor blade technique. Electrodes with Ø12 mm and a typical active material mass loading of approximately 4 mg cm−2 were punched from the dried electrode sheets. The electrodes were further dried in a Büchi glass oven at 130 °C and dynamic vacuum (≈2 × 10−5 bar) overnight. Alumina coated CR2032 coin cells (Hohsen) were prepared using these electrodes, two layers of a glass fibre separator (GFA, Whatman, Ø16 mm), 150 μl of 1 M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) + 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as electrolyte and sodium metal foil as the counter electrode (Acros Organics, Ø16 mm). The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was performed on a VMP3 potentiostat (Biologic) using specific current pulses of 17.3 mA g−1 for 10 min within the voltage range of 1.5–4.3 V. Equilibrium was assumed when the absolute voltage change was <0.0001 V h−1. Entropymetry measurements were performed using the same potentiostat and a programmable temperature chamber (CTS GmbH) with temperature steps at 40 °C, 25 °C and 10 °C. Specific current pulses of 8.7 mA g−1 with various time periods were applied at 40 °C, followed by a relaxation time of 8 h at the same temperature. In the following, the temperature was changed within 15 min to 25 °C, where it was held for 105 min. Subsequently, the temperature was changed to 10 °C following the same procedure before another current pulse was applied at 40 °C. Equilibrium voltages were derived from the average voltage of the last thirty minutes at each temperature step. The sodium stoichiometry was calculated based on the measured charge of the current pulse and the electrode active material mass, assuming that side reactions were negligible. For every sodium stoichiometry, the entropy change was derived from the obtained slope of the cell voltage with temperature as described in the ESI.†\nOperando synchrotron XRD measurements were performed at PETRA III, beamline P02.1 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). 2D diffraction images were collected using a VATEX CT4343 area detector (2880 × 2880 pixels, 150 × 150 μm pixel size) for 60 seconds. The obtained data were integrated using the DAWN package. An eight-fold coin cell holder, connected to a Biologic Instruments potentiostat, was employed as described elsewhere. A wavelength of 0.20734(1) Å was determined by analysis of the positions of reflections of the LaB6 reference material (NIST 660C). Prior to recording the first diffraction pattern, the electrochemical cells were subject to a formation cycle at 8.65 mA g−1 (discharge to 1.5 V followed by charge to 4.2 V). Subsequently, diffraction patterns were collected with the pre-charged cell by first discharging to 1.5 V followed by charge to 4.3 V at a constant current of 8.65 mA g−1. All diffraction patterns were analysed by the Rietveld method with TOPAS V6 software where the reflections of the Al current collector served as the internal reference.\nThroughout this work, either cell voltages from two-electrode measurements with a sodium metal counter electrode or potentials against a sodium metal quasi-reference electrode (three-electrode setup) are reported.\n\nComputational methods\nPeriodic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to determine the convex hull for the Na intercalation for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. The projector augmented wave method (PAW) was used in conjunction with the PBE exchange and correlation functional. In addition, the Grimme D3 correction was employed as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to capture the influence of dispersion effects. The data-driven Hubbard-type U corrections of UNi = 6.2 eV and UMn = 3.9 eV (ref. and ) were used to treat the strongly correlated 3d-electrons of the Ni and Mn atoms. The plane wave cut-off was set to 520 eV and a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh was employed to sample the Brillouin zone. A large supercell containing 24 formula units and ferromagnetic ordering was chosen. The electronic convergence criterion was set to 1 × 10−6 eV and the structures were relaxed until all forces converged below 0.01 eV Å−1. The open circuit potential VOCV in a Na-ion battery is governed by the change in free enthalpy ΔG for the transfer of a Na atom. Thus, the open circuit voltage (OCV) is determined by the difference of the chemical potential μ of Na in the anode and cathode by taking into account the number of transferred electrons ne and the Faraday constant F:\nBy neglecting pV and the entropic contributions to ΔG, the difference in the chemical potential of the Na atom is approximated using the total energy of DFT calculations EDFT.

The dense, spherical Ni1/3Mn2/3(OH)2 and Mn3/4Ni1/4(OH)2 hydroxide precursors were prepared under vigorous stirring in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR, volume = 1 liter). The reactor was constantly fed with deaerated, aqueous solutions of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (Carl Roth) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Carl Roth), NH3 (Carl Roth) and NaOH (Carl Roth). The precipitate collected at the reactor outlet was filtered and washed to remove residual salt solutions and dried. Subsequently, these hydroxide precursors were mixed with respective amounts of aqueous NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich) solution and dried at 80 °C following a wet impregnation procedure. The dried mixture was then calcined in a box furnace (Carbolite Gero). Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 was calcined for 10 h at 900 °C in a pure oxygen atmosphere, Na2/3Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was calcined for 10 h at 900 °C in air as described elsewhere and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was calcined for 10 h at 1000 °C in pure oxygen. After passive cooling to 200 °C, the powders were directly transferred into a Büchi glass oven, where they were kept at 200 °C under dynamic vacuum overnight. Subsequently, the CAM powders were transferred without any further contact with ambient air into an Ar-filled glovebox (MBraun, H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). Consecutive powder handling, electrode preparation and cell assembly were conducted in the same glovebox.\nFor powder characterization with ND, a second batch of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 was prepared based on the same hydroxide precursor and following the same synthesis procedure. A comparison of the characterization results for the two batches is presented in ESI Fig. S6 with ESI Tables S3 and S4 and ESI Fig. S7 with ESI Tables S5 and S6† for Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 and Na0.60Mn3/4Ni1/4O2, respectively.\nAdditionally, P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, P2-Na3/4Ni1/4Li1/12Mn2/3O2, P2-Na2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2, P2-Na2/3Ni2/9Al1/9Mn2/3O2 and P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Al1/9Mn5/9O2 were synthesized. The respective synthesis route, main characterization results and electrochemical testing procedure are described in the ESI.†\n\nMaterial characterization\nInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Spectro Arcos SOP) with a diluted aqua regia solution was used for analysis of the chemical composition. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR) was performed using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer with an Alpha-P ATR unit placed in an Ar-filled glovebox. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the powder morphology using a Leo 1530VP (Zeiss) equipped with an Everhart–Thornley SE detector at 5 kV acceleration voltage. Powder XRD patterns were collected on a D8Advance (Bruker) in Bragg–Brentano geometry equipped with a Cu X-ray tube and a LynxEye XE-T detector. Neutron diffraction patterns were recorded at MEREDIT instrument at the Nuclear Physics Institute CAS located in Řež near Prague, Czech Republic. A joint refinement of XRD and ND patterns was performed to obtain lattice parameters, Wyckoff sites and site occupations using the FullProf Suite software. Lattice parameters were refined independently for XRD and ND patterns, due to potentially different measurement temperatures and the different sensitivities of X-ray and neutron radiation. Instrumental broadening was determined from SiO2 powder on a mosaic Cu(222) monocrystal for ND and NIST640c Si powder for XRD. Based on the results of the joint ND and XRD refinement, FAULTS software was deployed to obtain the stacking probability of P3-type stacking faults from the XRD patterns and to analyse the stacking probability of C1C1 stacking faults from ND patterns. The refinement procedure is described in more detail in the ESI.† Throughout the manuscript, depictions of the crystal structures were prepared using VESTA software.\nEx situ capillary transmission XRD measurements were performed on the same D8Advance (Bruker) instrument. For this purpose, CR2032 coin cells were galvanostatically (dis)charged to obtain the desired active material sodium content and subsequently opened inside an argon filled glovebox. After rinsing with dimethyl carbonate (DMC), the electrode composite was carefully scratched off the aluminium current collector foil and filled into glass capillaries (Ø 0.3 mm, Hilgenberg). The glass capillaries were sealed inside an argon filled glovebox to avoid any contact with the ambient environment.\n\nElectrochemical investigations\nSlurries were prepared by homogeneously dispersing a CAM powder, polyvinylidene difluoride binder (PVDF, Solvay Solef 5130) and conductive carbon (SuperP-Li, Imerys Graphite & Carbon) with an 8:1:1 weight ratio in an appropriate amount of anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich). These slurries were cast on aluminium current collector foils using the doctor blade technique. Electrodes with Ø12 mm and a typical active material mass loading of approximately 4 mg cm−2 were punched from the dried electrode sheets. The electrodes were further dried in a Büchi glass oven at 130 °C and dynamic vacuum (≈2 × 10−5 bar) overnight. Alumina coated CR2032 coin cells (Hohsen) were prepared using these electrodes, two layers of a glass fibre separator (GFA, Whatman, Ø16 mm), 150 μl of 1 M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) + 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as electrolyte and sodium metal foil as the counter electrode (Acros Organics, Ø16 mm). The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was performed on a VMP3 potentiostat (Biologic) using specific current pulses of 17.3 mA g−1 for 10 min within the voltage range of 1.5–4.3 V. Equilibrium was assumed when the absolute voltage change was <0.0001 V h−1. Entropymetry measurements were performed using the same potentiostat and a programmable temperature chamber (CTS GmbH) with temperature steps at 40 °C, 25 °C and 10 °C. Specific current pulses of 8.7 mA g−1 with various time periods were applied at 40 °C, followed by a relaxation time of 8 h at the same temperature. In the following, the temperature was changed within 15 min to 25 °C, where it was held for 105 min. Subsequently, the temperature was changed to 10 °C following the same procedure before another current pulse was applied at 40 °C. Equilibrium voltages were derived from the average voltage of the last thirty minutes at each temperature step. The sodium stoichiometry was calculated based on the measured charge of the current pulse and the electrode active material mass, assuming that side reactions were negligible. For every sodium stoichiometry, the entropy change was derived from the obtained slope of the cell voltage with temperature as described in the ESI.†\nOperando synchrotron XRD measurements were performed at PETRA III, beamline P02.1 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). 2D diffraction images were collected using a VATEX CT4343 area detector (2880 × 2880 pixels, 150 × 150 μm pixel size) for 60 seconds. The obtained data were integrated using the DAWN package. An eight-fold coin cell holder, connected to a Biologic Instruments potentiostat, was employed as described elsewhere. A wavelength of 0.20734(1) Å was determined by analysis of the positions of reflections of the LaB6 reference material (NIST 660C). Prior to recording the first diffraction pattern, the electrochemical cells were subject to a formation cycle at 8.65 mA g−1 (discharge to 1.5 V followed by charge to 4.2 V). Subsequently, diffraction patterns were collected with the pre-charged cell by first discharging to 1.5 V followed by charge to 4.3 V at a constant current of 8.65 mA g−1. All diffraction patterns were analysed by the Rietveld method with TOPAS V6 software where the reflections of the Al current collector served as the internal reference.\nThroughout this work, either cell voltages from two-electrode measurements with a sodium metal counter electrode or potentials against a sodium metal quasi-reference electrode (three-electrode setup) are reported.\n\nComputational methods\nPeriodic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to determine the convex hull for the Na intercalation for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2. The projector augmented wave method (PAW) was used in conjunction with the PBE exchange and correlation functional. In addition, the Grimme D3 correction was employed as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to capture the influence of dispersion effects. The data-driven Hubbard-type U corrections of UNi = 6.2 eV and UMn = 3.9 eV (ref. and ) were used to treat the strongly correlated 3d-electrons of the Ni and Mn atoms. The plane wave cut-off was set to 520 eV and a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh was employed to sample the Brillouin zone. A large supercell containing 24 formula units and ferromagnetic ordering was chosen. The electronic convergence criterion was set to 1 × 10−6 eV and the structures were relaxed until all forces converged below 0.01 eV Å−1. The open circuit potential VOCV in a Na-ion battery is governed by the change in free enthalpy ΔG for the transfer of a Na atom. Thus, the open circuit voltage (OCV) is determined by the difference of the chemical potential μ of Na in the anode and cathode by taking into account the number of transferred electrons ne and the Faraday constant F:\nBy neglecting pV and the entropic contributions to ΔG, the difference in the chemical potential of the Na atom is approximated using the total energy of DFT calculations EDFT. The calculation of the VOCV for an exemplary layered oxide compound NaxMO2 follows:\nIn eqn (2), EDFT is stated in eV and sodium metal is chosen as the reference for the anode. Since the mode of intercalation in these materials deviates from a simple solid-solution behaviour and first order phase transformations at high potentials as well as Na+/vacancy ordering transitions occur, the convex hull for the Na intercalation compound is derived to identify thermodynamically stable configurations. The convex hull is constructed from the formation energy Efx with respect to the decomposition into the Na deficient O2-type structure (x = 0) and the P2-type structure at a Na content of x = 2/3:\nOnce the convex hull is constructed by calculating the formation energy per formula unit, the OCV for each stable configuration is obtained using eqn (1). The convex hull calculations for P2-NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 and P2-NaxMn3/4Ni1/4O2 were employed following the previously described procedure for the sodium contents 0 < x < 1/3 (ref. and ) and by considering the row and large-zig-zag Na+/vacancy orderings at the Na contents x = 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 as identified by Lee et al. and the alternative Na+/vacancy ordering at x = 1/2 proposed by Huang et al. Additional Na configurations for the Na contents x = 1/3, 5/12, and 7/12 were selected by minimizing the classical Ewald energy assuming integer charges for redox inactive atoms (i.e., Na+, O2−) and variable charges for the TM atoms (i.e., Ni2+/3+/4+, and Mn3+/4+) for all possible configurations as implemented in pymatgen. Overall, a minimum of 10 configurations per Na content were obtained for the Na composition range 0 < x < 1/3 and 20 configurations for the Na composition range 1/3 ≤ x ≤ 2/3 in steps of x = 1/12 for each compound. Some of the configurations considered in the DFT calculations for NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2 are equivalent to the publication by Daubner et al.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

To assess its air stability and explore the initial deterioration mechanism, the original powder underwent air exposure at varying temperatures to accelerate the potential degradation process and simulate occasional exposure to ambient air above room temperature in the practical use of NFPP. NFPP was stored at temperatures of 25, 80, 160, and 240 °C in a muffle furnace for one hour each. Subsequently, the resulting samples were designated as NFPP-25, NFPP-80, NFPP-160, and NFPP-240, respectively. We also designed a supplementary experiment in which NFPP was exposed to air at 25 °C for one month to simulate long-term room temperature storage and observe changes in the material. The sample was named NFPP-one month. Phase composition and changes were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The pristine sample exhibited peaks consistent with the reported NFPP structure, with minor deviations observed near 10.7°, corresponding to the (011) crystal plane of the impure Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 phase (Fig. 1a). This impure phase often occurs during the synthesis of NFPP due to the same constituent elements and the close phase-forming temperature regions of the two phases. The peak shapes and intensities remained almost unchanged after brief exposure to air at different temperatures, suggesting that NFPP maintained its structural integrity under these conditions (Fig. 1a, S1a and S2a†). However, the air exposed samples (except NFPP-25) all showed a new diffraction peak near 33.1°, corresponding to the (400) crystal plane of Na3PO4, which represented the fact that air exposure caused the extraction of Na+ and PO43− ions from NFPP and the formation of Na3PO4. To obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio for Na3PO4, we tried to extend the time of NFPP storage at 80 °C to 5 and 10 h. The XRD results are shown in Fig. S3.† Compared to pristine NFPP, prolonged air exposure did not significantly increase the peak intensity of Na3PO4, while the XRD peaks of NFPP decreased notably with increasing exposure time. This suggested that the Na3PO4 formed on degraded NFPP likely had poor crystalline quality or existed as an amorphous phase. NFPP-one month also exhibited decreased diffraction peaks, while another sodium phosphate impurity phase appeared, suggesting substantial structural degradation upon long time storage of NFPP.\nTo gain deeper insights into the deterioration product of NFPP in air, 23Na solid-state NMR (ss-NMR) measurements were conducted under magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions (Fig. 1b). The 23Na ss-NMR spectra of the pristine sample revealed four distinct resonances corresponding to four different Na sites within the crystal structure. Remarkably, the 23Na ss-NMR MAS spectra of NFPP-240 remained almost consistent with those of the pristine sample, suggesting that the degradation products following a short period of air exposure were not significant, making minor deterioration difficult to discern. However, NFPP-one month exhibited a strong resonance near 0 ppm, indicative of sodium salts such as sodium carbonate or sodium phosphate. Combined with the XRD results, we identified the peaks near 0 ppm as being mainly attributed to Na3PO4. This provided solid evidence of NFPP degradation and the formation of harmful byproducts.\nUnderstanding the impact of air sensitivity on the electrochemical performance of NFPP is important for its practical application in batteries. A series of NFPP samples were prepared as electrodes for electrochemical performance testing in half-cells, the detailed information about the electrolyte and electrode can be found in Section 4.3, Electrochemical tests. Initially, NFPP exhibited commendable electrochemical properties, with a specific capacity of 107.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and a retention of 86.0 mA h g−1 even at a high rate of 20C, demonstrating excellent rate capability (Fig. 1c). One-hour exposure to room temperature air did not cause significant effects on the material, and the electrochemical performance of NFPP-25 was basically the same as that of the original sample (Fig. S2b–d†). However, exposing NFPP to higher temperature air for just one hour led to a notable decline in the rate performance. Specifically, the specific capacities decreased significantly to 101.4 mA h g−1, 102.0 mA h g−1 and 98.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 50.4 mA h g−1, 41.2 mA h g−1 and 26.4 mA h g−1 at 20C for NFPP-80, NFPP-160 and NFPP-240, respectively (Fig. 1c and S1b†). This decline was accompanied by a rapid increase in polarization observed in the charge–discharge curves at a current rate of 1C (Fig. 1d and S1c†), indicating a deterioration in kinetic properties post-air exposure. NFPP-one month showed a similar but more severe degradation trend in electrochemical performance.\nThe degradation in performance could be attributed to the hindrance of ion transport by low-conductivity impurities on the surface, which could be verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 1e and S1d† were analyzed using the equivalent circuit presented in Fig. S4.† Table S1† lists the fitted resistance values. The electrode resistance of the pristine sample was quite small (the inset in Fig. 1e). After air exposure, the rapid increase of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) indicated that the decomposition products blocked the diffusion of Na ions.\nAdditionally, the cycling performance of NFPP was adversely affected by air exposure, as evidenced by the capacity retention rates after 2000 cycles at 5C (Fig. 1f). NFPP demonstrated a retention rate of 88.73%, outperforming NFPP-80, NFPP-160 and NFPP-240, which exhibited retention rates of 84.95%, 83.07% and 84.29%, respectively. NFPP-one month had a very low reversible specific capacity of 50.2 mA h g−1 at 5C, with 90.60% capacity retention after 400 cycles (Fig. 1f).\nIn order to investigate the deterioration mechanism of the materials under air exposure, we selected two representative samples, NFPP-80 and NFPP-240, to further analyze their surface chemical and structural information. Further evidence was obtained through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for degradation product identification. As depicted in Fig. 2a, characteristic absorption peaks at 3610 cm−1 and 3710 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of O–H bonds in Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3, respectively. A weak Fe(OH)3 signal could be observed on the original sample surface, which might be due to the small amount of residual alkali produced during the sintering process of the material. However, the signals of Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 on the air-exposed samples' surface were significantly enhanced, suggesting that the air exposure leads to the extraction of Fe2+ in the material as well, which was bound to the water on the surface of the particles. The weakening of the absorbed-water peak at 3460 cm−1 after air exposure suggested the possibility of water involvement in the deterioration process. Additionally, the very weak absorption peak near 1458 cm−1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration mode of Na2CO3 (Fig. 2b). The strength of this weak signal did not appear regularly with the rise in air exposure temperature, further proving that Na2CO3 did not act as the main product of deterioration. It might originate from the Na2CO3 generated during the sintering process as well as from a further reaction between Na3PO4 and CO2 in air. However, due to the large overlap between the vibration and rotation modes of Na3PO4 and NFPP, the presence of Na3PO4 could not be conclusively determined from the FT-IR spectra.\nFig. 2c–e present the XPS results of NFPP materials before and after air exposure. The Fe 2p XPS spectrum of NFPP showed four main peaks at 709.7 eV and 711.3 eV (Fe 2p3/2), 723.3 eV and 724.9 eV (Fe 2p1/2), corresponding to Fe2+–O in iron oxides and Fe2+ in NFPP, respectively. The small amount of iron oxides might originate from incomplete reaction during the sintering process. With the increase of exposure temperature, the content of iron oxides on the surface of the particles gradually increased and the signal of Fe3+–O appeared, demonstrating that the iron in the bulk phase was gradually extracted and oxidized on the surface, which coincided with the results of the FT-IR spectra. Besides, the binding energy of Fe in the bulk phase of NFPP gradually shifted from 711.3 eV (NFPP) to 711.8 eV (NFPP-240), which revealed that the valence state of iron staying in the lattice also increased during the air exposure.\nThe O 1s XPS spectrum of the three samples exhibited a dominant peak at 531.5 eV and a minor peak at 533.2 eV, corresponding to P–O in PO43−/P2O74− and C–O bond, respectively. The O 1s peak at 529.8 eV could be attributed to the surface iron oxides on NFPP particles, and the peak intensity increased with increasing exposure temperature which was consistent with the Fe 2p results. The C 1s peak at 289.1 eV corresponding to Na2CO3 was essentially unchanged before and after air exposure, again suggesting that Na2CO3 was not the main product of air oxidation.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization (Fig. 3a–d) offered morphological insights, revealing a uniform distribution of poorly conductive impurities on the particle surface post-air exposure, with accumulation becoming more pronounced at higher temperatures. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed more structural changes on the surface. As shown in Fig. 3f, the original NFPP showed well-arranged crystal strips along (410) planes, and the surface was coated with a carbon layer about 2 nm thick. After air exposure, amorphous regions appeared on the surface of the particles (yellow region in Fig. 3g) and gradually transitioned to a small Na3PO4 cluster. The amorphous regions expanded as the exposure temperature increased, which was favorable evidence that the structure of the material was gradually destroyed under air exposure (Fig. 3h). The EDS mapping results (Fig. 3i) indicated that the surface of the sample still maintained a uniform elemental distribution after structural damage. Combined with the analysis of IR and XPS, amorphous Na3PO4, FeO and Fe2O3 mixtures might exist in the amorphous region.\nFig. 3e briefly summarizes the air deterioration of NFPP. Upon exposure to air, elements like Na, P and Fe were extracted from NFPP's bulk phase, facilitated by absorbed water and O2 in the air. This results in the formation of an amorphous layer comprising sodium phosphate and iron (hydr)oxide with some small Na3PO4 grain clusters coating the particle surface. This degradation would pose potential issues for NFPP's applications if without appropriate processes. For example, irreversible loss and oxidation of Fe2+ in NFPP directly reduce cell capacity and the emergence of the non-conductive amorphous region not only reduces ionic and electronic conductance but also impedes full electrolyte–electrode contact, increasing charge and discharge polarization.\nIn the previous discussion, we assumed that moisture in the air induced the deterioration of NFPP. To further verify this hypothesis, an immersion acceleration experiment was conducted (Fig. 4a). Specifically, 150 mg of NFPP was mixed with 5 mL of deionized water and stirred vigorously at 25 °C and 80 °C for one hour, respectively. The suspension was then filtered, and the residue was washed and dried at 40 °C for 12 hours in a vacuum oven to obtain the water-treated NFPP samples. Samples obtained from this process were labeled NFPP-25 °C water and NFPP-80 °C water.\nThe water-immersed samples exhibited poorer crystallinity relative to the pristine samples (Fig. 4b), demonstrating that the crystal structure of the samples might transition to an amorphous state more rapidly under water immersion. No significant Na3PO4 phase peak was observed, which should be due to the solubility of Na3PO4 in water. As depicted in Fig. 4c and S5,† the water-immersed samples showed porous surfaces after ion release. ICP analysis (summarized in Table S2, S3† and Fig. 4d) revealed a significant extraction of Na and P elements from NFPP, surpassing Fe element. The molar ratio of extracted Na:P:Fe was 12:6.5:1 (NFPP-25 °C water) and 5.4:3.2:1 (NFPP-80 °C water), which significantly deviated from the elemental composition ratio of NFPP (Na:P:Fe = 4:4:3), indicating that this was not a straightforward dissolution process. Na was more susceptible to loss in air compared to P and Fe.\nThe element extraction aligned with electrochemical performance, illustrated in Fig. 4e, where NFPP-25 °C water and NFPP-80 °C water exhibited notably lower initial charge capacity and higher initial coulombic efficiency than pristine NFPP. The original NFPP material exhibited a significant irreversible capacity, which greatly compromised its subsequent cycling capacity. This might be related to the distorted local coordination environment of Na+, leading to irreversible capacity loss during the first discharge cycle, a phenomenon that had been reported in the literature. The reduction in initial charge capacity reflects Na+ extraction during water exposure. The water-treated NFPP lost some Na content, which might have alleviated the distortion in the local coordination environment of Na+ to some extent, resulting in a more reversible charge–discharge process during the first cycle. Additionally, significant P element release was observed, confirming the predominant release of sodium phosphate, which was consistent with the results obtained under air exposure. Just like the air-exposed samples, the water-soaked samples also exhibited significantly decreased rate performance (Fig. 4f). The specific capacities decreased to 103.8 mA h g−1, 100.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, and 54.5 mA h g−1, 50.9 mA h g−1 at 20C for NFPP-25 °C water and NFPP-80 °C water, respectively.\nBased on the understanding of the air stability of the NFPP, we hope to find a way to restore the electrochemical properties of the degraded sample. Re-calcination under suitable conditions could be a simple and effective method to recover electrode materials' performance. We tried to conduct re-sintering on air-exposed samples for one hour under Ar protection. Under the protection of an inert atmosphere, the carbon coated on the surface of the material can play the role of reducing traces of Fe3+ on the surface. After the re-sintering process, the crystal structure of NFPP-80 (re-sintering) was well maintained, and the characteristic peak of Na3PO4 at 33.1° almost vanished, indicating that the re-sintering process was beneficial to the structure restoration (Fig. 5a). The SEM images of the NFPP-80 (re-sintering) sample (Fig. S6a and b†) showed that impurities on the surface of NFPP-80 basically returned to the bulk phase, and the particle surface became smooth again. As demonstrated in Fig. 5b, the lattice stripes on the surface became clear again, but a small amount of amorphous regions (yellow region in Fig. 5b) could still be observed, which proved that the structural reversibility was limited. It is difficult to completely restore the degraded material to the original state. Fortunately, the rate capability of NFPP-80 (re-sintering) could be recovered to initial levels, with reduced charge and discharge polarization (Fig. 5c and d); the cycling stability was slightly inferior to that of the original sample due to the irreversible damage to the structure (Fig. 5e). NFPP-160 (re-sintering) and NFPP-240 (re-sintering) exhibited similar trends but more irreversibility in structural and electrochemical performance (Fig. S6c, d and S7–S8†), while XRD results indicated that the re-sintering process led to further reduction in the crystallinity for more deteriorated samples. This highlighted re-sintering's effectiveness in recovering mildly deteriorated NFPP, emphasizing the need for tailored re-sintering conditions based on the extent of degradation.\nAfter comprehensively understanding NFPP's air sensitivity and deterioration mechanism, we recommend storing and transporting NFPP under an inert gas or, at least, under low-humidity conditions to prevent degradation. Additionally, long-term storage of NFPP materials before use should be avoided.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

In a typical process, 5 mmol Na4P2O7 (Macklin, 99%), 10 mmol NH4H2PO4 (SCR Hushi, AR), 15 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Energy Chemicals, 99%), and 33 mmol H2C2O4 (Shanghai Yuanye, 98%) were added to 60 mL 2 M acetate solution with magnetic stirring at room temperature until a transparent green solution was obtained. After that, the solution was spray-dried at 130 °C to get a yellow powder precursor. The precursor was pre-treated at 300 °C for 1.5 h in an Ar atmosphere. The sintered powder and oleic acid (Aladdin, AR) were mixed in acetone (SCR Hushi, AR) and stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture was dried at 60 °C and sintered at 500 °C for 10 h in a flow of Ar–H2 (95/5 vol%) to obtain the Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 materials.\nThe air-treated samples were obtained by storing the original powder at temperatures of 25, 80, 160, and 240 °C in a muffle furnace for one hour (air humidity was about 30%). Subsequently, the resulting samples were named NFPP-25, NFPP-80, NFP-160 and NFPP-240, respectively. In addition, the NFPP powder was exposed to air at 25 °C for one month (air humidity was about 30%) to simulate the conditions of long-term storage, which was named NFPP-one month.\n\n4.2 Characterization\nSolid-state NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance III HD 400 MHz spectrometers using 3.2 mm magic-angle spinning probes at a spinning rate of 15 kHz. 23Na magic angle spin (MAS) NMR spectra were acquired using pj-MATPASS (pj = projection, MAT: magic-angle turning, PASS: phase-adjusted sideband separation) pulse sequence with a π/2 pulse length of 1.7 μs. Recycle delays between 100 ms and 200 ms were employed. The 23Na spectra were referenced to 1 M NaCl solution at 0 ppm.\nThe phase purity was assessed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Ultima IV, Rigaku) with a Cu Kᾳ X-ray source. In order to prevent errors caused by air contact during testing, we prepared samples with sealed sample stages and in a glove box. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using an FT-IR spectrometer (IS50, Nicolet iS10, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The elemental composition and valence state of the material were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Supra+, Shimadzu). The morphologies were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, HITACHI). The detailed structural information of the sample surface was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM 2100F, 200 kV). The measurement of different elemental contents in the filtrate was conducted by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, NexION 300XX, PerkinElmer).\n\n4.3 Electrochemical tests\nAll electrodes were prepared in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.01 ppm, O2 < 0.01 ppm) to prevent further air-induced deterioration of the material. The NFPP electrode was prepared by mixing the active materials, acetylene black and PVDF (dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone) at a weight ratio of 7:2:1 on the current collector of carbon-coated aluminium foil and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 10 hours. Then the NFPP electrodes were cut into 12 mm disks and the active mass loading of NFPP was about 2 mg cm−2. CR 2032-coin cells were used for Na‖NFPP cells using the glass microfiber film (Whatman, F-type) as the separator and 15 mm diameter sodium metal disk as the anode. The electrolyte employed in this work is 1 mol L−1 NaPF6 dissolved in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME). The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.01 ppm, O2 < 0.01 ppm). The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were conducted on a Neware test system (Neware Technology Limited), with a voltage range of 1.7–3.9 V and a temperature of 25 °C. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (VSP300, BioLogic) at the cell voltage of 1.7 V and with the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

To classify the different intercalation sites of the PBA lattice we refer to the regiotype Fmm structure. The fundamental units of the AxMFe(CN)6 PBA structure, suitable for describing intercalation, are the M4Fe4(CN)12 “sub-cubes” formed by alternate HS-M and LS-Fe sites at the corners, with CN− ligands along the sides. One such sub-cube is shaded in Fig. 1. Each sub-cube encompasses one intercalation site A.\nAdjacent sub-cubes along the 〈100〉, 〈010〉 and 〈001〉 directions are separated by “windows” formed by four Fe–C–N–M sides, as shown in Fig. 1. Migration of the intercalant A between adjacent sub-cubes occurs through one of these windows. Within each sub-cube, the actual location of the intercalant A can vary and occurs either at the centre or displaced along high symmetry directions; these are denoted using the Wyckoff notation of the different sites in the Fmm cell. The centre of the sub-cube is surrounded by 12 equidistant CN ligands and is denoted as the 8c site. If the A ions displace from 8c sites along the 〈111〉 direction towards either the C-coordinated LS-Fe or the N-coordinated HS-TM they occupy 32f and 32f′ sites, respectively. The centre of the windows is indicated as 24d, while the sites between the centre of the sub-cube (8c) and the centre of the windows (24d) are labelled as 48g.\nTwo main types of structural distortions may occur in PBAs: one driven by the electronic configuration of the TM ions that may undergo Jahn–Teller (J–T) like distortions as discussed in the framework of ligand field theory, and another associated with tilting of the octahedra associated with steric and Coulomb interactions of the intercalated A ions – mostly with the cyano ligands of the PBA framework. Their relative importance, and hence the equilibrium structure of the PBA material overall, depends on the type of TM ions (M and Fe here) and the type and concentration of intercalated species (A, x).\nWe start our discussion of DFT results with two model systems: the intercalant-free material with x = 0, which is subject to only J–T like distortions, and the A2MnFe(CN)6 compound where neither the HS-MnII nor the LS-FeII ions are J–T distorted; hence distortions are only due to the presence of the A ions.\n\n3.1 Fully deintercalated MFe(CN)6\nIn the optimised structure, the fully deintercalated PBAs FeFe(CN)6 and MnFe(CN)6 have straight Fe–C–N–Mn linkages. This geometry maximises orbital overlap in the hexacyanoferrate ion [FeII(CN)6]4− and enhances the Coulomb interaction between the N end of the hexacyanoferrate ions and the second TM site. No tilting of FeC6 or MN6 octahedra occurs, corresponding to Glazer notation a0a0a0. No alkali metal ions are present to interact with the cyano ligands and disturb this high-symmetry arrangement. The equilibrium geometry of FeFe(CN)6 is Fmm, corresponding to a cubic crystal system (Fig. 2a). However, MnFe(CN)6 exhibits a tetragonal I4/mmm space group as shown in Fig. 2b. The d4 high-spin electronic configuration of trivalent Mn causes an elongation of the axial bonds in MnN6 octahedra due to a pronounced J–T distortion, which results in different Mn–N bond lengths (2.21 Å and 1.96 Å, respectively) and lattice parameters (c = 10.60 Å and a = b = 10.06 Å) along the z-axis compared to the xy-plane. Although low-spin trivalent Fe exhibits a small J–T effect arising from the t2g states, it is not strong enough to induce appreciable distortions and FeFe(CN)6 retains its cubic symmetry. The lattice parameters and bond lengths of FeFe(CN)6 and MnFe(CN)6 are compared in Table 1. The square window of FeFe(CN)6 is bigger than the windows in the xy plane and smaller than those in the xz and yz planes of MnFe(CN)6. The size of the window surrounded by four octahedra is critical in determining ion mobility during charge/discharge and the stable position of alkali metal ions at low concentrations.\n\n3.2 Fully intercalated A2MFe(CN)6\nWe first consider the Mn compounds A2MnFe(CN)6, where neither N-coordinated divalent Mn (d5, HS) nor C-coordinated divalent Fe (d6, LS) is expected to incur J–T distortion. Indeed, all our geometry optimisations result in octahedra with six identical Fe–C or Mn–N bond distances. A summary of the calculated equilibrium structural parameters for the fully intercalated compounds is reported in Table 2.\nWhen all the sub-cubes are occupied by K, corresponding to the composition K2MnFe(CN)6, a combination of octahedral tilting and alkali metal displacements results in a phase transition from cubic to monoclinic, with the space group P21/c. The tilting of the octahedra can be described by Glazer notation a−a−c+, which means that the octahedra rotate along all three x, y, and z axes, with two out-of-phase and one in-phase tilting, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. The Fe–C–N–Mn framework bends almost exclusively at the N atom position; the Fe–C–N angles show small changes (within 3° variation from 180°), while all the Mn–N–C angles decrease from 180° to ∼146°. The K ions displace from the centre of the sub-cubes (position 8c) along the 〈111〉 direction towards Mn, into positions 32f′. When Na is intercalated, no significant differences in Fe–C and M–N bond lengths are observed compared to the K-intercalated PBA as both TM sites have the same d orbital electron configuration. However, tilting becomes more obvious with Mn–N–C angles of ∼133°, which results in smaller lattice parameters and volume compared to the K-intercalated PBAs. This is consistent with the tilting angle prediction based on the Goldschmidt tolerance.\nIn K2FeFe(CN)6, the Fe–C–N–Fe framework distortion is similar to that discussed for K2MnFe(CN)6, with Mn–N–C angles of 149° and only minor deviations in the Fe–C–N angle. A small J–T distortion in N-coordinated divalent Fe (d6, HS) causes a very small difference in Fe–N bond lengths (2.17 Å in the xy plane and 2.18 Å along the z axis, respectively). Similar to the Mn PBA, upon replacing K with Na there are no significant differences in Fe–C and Fe–N bond lengths but tilting becomes more pronounced, resulting in Fe–N–C angles of ∼134°.\nIn brief, the Fe–C and M–N bond lengths are affected by the transition metal valence and d orbital electron configurations, while the size of the interstitial ions leads to significant volumetric changes due to different degrees of octahedral tilting, occurring almost exclusively at the N angles.\nSince both the tilting of octahedra and the displacement of the intercalated ions have components in all three x, y, z directions, we identify the distortion in fully intercalated PBAs as three-dimensional (3-D).\n\n3.3 Partially intercalated AxMFe(CN)6 (50%, 25% and 12.5% occupation)\nDespite the FeFe(CN)6 and MnFe(CN)6 host compounds exhibiting similar geometry in their fully (de-)intercalated states, the sequence of redox processes accompanying intercalation occurs differently in the two materials. Two redox couples are available: Fe2+/Fe3+ at the C-coordinated LS-Fe site that is common to both compounds, and M2+/M3+ at the N-coordinated HS site that is different in the Fe and Mn compounds examined. The order in which the two metal sites are oxidised upon removal of Na and K intercalants can be determined by examining the local density of states (LDOS) at the two transition metal sites in the fully intercalated state. The examples of K2MFe(CN)6 are shown in Fig. 4. The first metal ion to be oxidised is the one whose occupied d levels are closest to the Fermi level. In K2FeFe(CN)6 these correspond to the minority spin t2g states of the HS-FeII (N-coordinated) ion, while in K2MnFe(CN)6, electrons at the top of the valence band reside in the fully occupied t2g states of LS-FeII (C-coordinated). These electrons are the first to be extracted during depotassiation; hence oxidation occurs first at HS-Fe in K2FeFe(CN)6 and at LS-Fe in K2MnFe(CN)6. In the half-intercalated state, corresponding to x = 1, the 3+ TM site is therefore N-coordinated in A1FeFe(CN)6 and C-coordinated in A1MnFe(CN)6. This will likely affect the stable intercalation sites and lattice distortions, as the cationic intercalants Na+ and K+ have different Coulomb interactions with the 2+ and 3+ TM sites, which are located on opposite sides in the two frameworks.\nLet us consider the stable structure of the two PBA frameworks at the 50% intercalation level, corresponding to the composition A1MFe(CN)6. With only 4 of the 8 available sub-cubes in the crystallographic PBA cell being occupied, several different configurations are possible. These have all been considered for each combination of A (Na and K) and M (Mn and Fe) ions, and in the following we examine those with lowest calculated energy.\nIn all the stable structures, the position of the intercalated A+ ions is displaced from the 8c centre of the sub-cubes towards the 24d sites (centre of the windows), i.e. in positions 48g, as shown in Fig. 5a, d, g and j. How close the A+ ions are to the plane of the window depends on the actual size of the intercalant and of the two TM ions (which in turn determines the size of the window). The smaller Na is located much closer to the window plane, with distances of ∼0 Å and 0.49 Å in the Na1MnFe(CN)6 and Na1FeFe(CN)6 frameworks, compared to the larger K, whose respective distances are of 1.6 Å and 2.0 Å. The difference between the Mn- and Fe-containing PBAs is due to the longer Fe–Mn distances (∼5.28 Å) compared to Fe–Fe (∼5.08 Å). Therefore, at a 50% intercalation level, the intercalants displace towards the windows and the distance of the alkali metal ions from the window plane is determined by the relative sizes of the alkali metal ions and window.\nOnce in proximity of the window, the alkali metal ions induce Fe–CN–M framework distortions, due to the strong Coulomb interaction between the positive metal ions and the N atoms that represent the negative pole of the cyano ligands. This interaction rotates the four octahedra that define the window in such a way that the four nearest N atoms displace towards the alkali metal ions in the 24d/48g sites. The distortion occurs exclusively within the plane of the window that hosts the intercalated ion, without significantly affecting the cyano ligands along the perpendicular axis. Since both alkali metal displacement and octahedral tilting occur along the same direction, we refer to this perturbation of the PB framework as a two-dimensional (2-D) distortion.\nA closer inspection of the in-plane octahedral tilting, shown in Fig. S1,† indicates that the tilting around one A+ intercalant, causes the adjacent windows to become unstable for intercalation. Each cyano ligand represents the edge between two adjacent windows in the 〈001〉 plane; displacement of the N-end of the ligand in one direction to maximise the interaction with the A+ ion in position 24d/48g automatically prevents displacement in the opposite direction. Half intercalation (x = 1) is therefore the highest concentration at which alkali metals occupy 24d/48g sites and form a 2D distorted structure, in a chessboard-like arrangement. In addition to occupying only alternate 24d/48g sites, in the lowest energy structure, the intercalated alkali metal ions are distributed on alternate sides of the window-plane, in such a way as to reduce the mutual Coulomb repulsion.\nReducing the intercalant content further to 25% occupation, corresponding to the composition A0.5MFe(CN)6, stable superstructural arrangements in the distribution of the occupied sub-cubes become even more apparent. While in A1MFe(CN)6 all sites of each TM sublattice have the same oxidation state, in A0.5MFe(CN)6 only half the metal sites of one sublattice (LS-Fe for M = Fe; HS-Mn for M = Mn) are oxidised to the 3+ state, the other half retaining in the 2+ oxidation state. These structures retain the 2D intercalation and distortion pattern discussed above for the materials with 50% occupation, but they contain alternate layers with LS-Fe or HS-Mn ions in 2+ and 3+ oxidation states, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5b. HS-MnIII is strongly J–T distorted, and windows containing MnIII at one of the vertices can be built on the long or short Mn–N bonds. Intercalation of both Na and K occurs in the larger windows that contain the long Mn–N bonds, oriented in the 〈100〉 or 〈010〉 directions (the 〈010〉 direction is illustrated in Fig. 5 and referred to in the following discussion). The alkali metal ions move closer to the square window plane of the reduced layer due to the balance of Coulomb interactions. Therefore, we observe a close association between the positions of the intercalated ions and the reduced TM sites.\nThe Fe–C and Fe–N bond distances show limited variation between 2+ and 3+ oxidation states, which induces little structural strain at 25% concentration of the intercalants when alternating planes with 2+ and 3+ Fe are present. For Mn-HS instead, the Mn–N bond distances from the metal in 2+ and 3+ oxidation states are significantly different. In Na0.5MnFe(CN)6, MnII has nearly identical Mn–N bond distances of ∼2.2 Å in all three directions; J–T distorted MnIII, instead, has long Mn–N bonds of 2.2 Å along the z direction and short bonds of ∼2.0 Å in the xy-plane. The alternation of planes with 2+ and 3+ Mn ions in the stable configuration of the intercalated Na and K ions, therefore, creates a structural strain in the 〈100〉 direction connected by alternate long and short Mn–N bonds. This strain is accommodated through a rotation of the Mn6 octahedra around the z axis as shown in Fig. 5h and k. This new tilting distortion in materials with mixed-valence Mn ions is not due to the size mismatch between the intercalant radius and size of the interstices available, but rather due to the size mismatch between the different octahedral sites in the same TM sublattice. Such a distortion mode is expected to occur in AxMnFe(CN)6 in the entire range of 0 < x < 1, where mixed-valence Mn ions are present. At x = 0.25, the tilting of MnN6 octahedra produces a wave-like distortion of the (larger) Mn-reduced layer and forms deeper pockets around the windows where the intercalated Na and K ions are located. The intrinsic structural strain discussed above is expected to destabilise AxMnFe(CN)6 PBA phases with mixed-valent Mn, i.e., in the composition range of 0 < x < 1.\nIn the phase with a 25% intercalation level, each window occupied by one of the intercalated ions has a centre of inversion: the two ions of each sublattice located at opposite corners have the same oxidation state. This symmetrical arrangement leads to intercalated ions being located at or directly above the centre of the window. When the intercalant concentration is below 25%, however, this symmetry constraint stops existing, which leads to a new change in the equilibrium structure. We exemplify this situation using PBAs with a 12.5% intercalation level, of composition A0.25MFe(CN)6, obtained when only one intercalated ion (hence only one reduced TM ion) is present in each crystallographic PBA unit cell. Let us consider what happens if the intercalated A ion is located at or above the centre of one of the square windows. Because only one of the 4 corner TM sites of the window is reduced at this intercalation level, the window is no longer centrosymmetric; two TM ions of the same sublattice at opposite corners will have different oxidation states. Due to electrostatic reasons, the positively charged A+ ion displaces off-centre and towards the reduced TM site. This displacement affects the strength of the A–N interactions in opposite ways, depending on whether the reduced TM site is Fe-LS (i.e., in A0.25FeFe(CN)6 – Fig. 6a) or Mn-HS (i.e., in A0.25MnFe(CN)6 – Fig. 6b). In the case illustrated in Fig. 6a, the attraction of the A+ intercalant to the negative poles of the cyano ligands and to the reduced TM site acts in opposite directions, resulting in small off-centre displacements of the intercalant; instead, in the case of Fig. 6b, the two electrostatic forces on A+ act in the same direction, yielding more pronounced off-centering. The off-centre movement is larger for K+ than for Na+ since K+ resides further above the window plane and is less constrained by a 2D distortion. The net result is a displacement of K from the 8c centre of its sub-cube that has components both in the direction of the square window and perpendicular to it, resulting in an equilibrium position close to the 32f′ site along the 〈111〉 diagonal of the sub-cube in K0.25MnFe(CN)6; K in K0.25FeFe(CN)6 and Na in both Mn and Fe PBAs, instead, has a prevalent 2D-like equilibrium position, although displaced off-centre from the high symmetry 8c/48g/24d line. At concentrations of x ≤ 0.25, each intercalated ion is separated from the next intercalant by at least one empty interstice in each direction; tilting of octahedra to accommodate size mismatches at the TM sites are observed, but they are localised around the reduced TM site and do not cause collective phase transitions in the overall PBA lattice.\nIn summary, calculations considering different types and concentrations of intercalated ions in PBAs reveal a complex sequence of local and long-ranged structural distortions and the occurrence of stable superlattices that are much richer than those available for the isoreticular perovskites. This behaviour will clearly affect both energetics and dynamics of intercalation processes, as well as the stability of PBA cathodes under operational conditions, and will need to be considered in the design of optimal PBA-based materials for energy storage.\n\n3.4 Energy considerations\nHaving investigated how the PBA structure reacts to the concentration of intercalated Na+ and K+ ions, we now discuss the effect that the induced phase transitions have on the intercalation energy and mechanistic details. To this goal, we calculate the relative energies ΔEAxMFe(CN)6 of intermediate phases and plot the “convex hull” diagrams of energies as a function of intercalant content x.\nThe results for each combination of Na, K, Fe and Mn are shown in Fig. 7. The calculated energy of different configurations of the intercalants at the same concentration x are illustrated by separate points in the diagrams. These diagrams illustrate whether superstructures of intermediate compositions are stable and expected to occur during (dis-)charge processes.\nWe note in Fig. 7 that, irrespective of the type of intercalant or high-spin TM site, the structure with 50% intercalation is always the most stable, by up to 0.2 eV per formula unit (i.e. ∼0.8 eV per crystallographic unit cell). As discussed earlier, this is the highest concentration that allows for the 2-D intercalation geometry and 2-D distortion pattern of the PBA lattice. This is therefore the most stable local arrangement. Deviations from this structure incur lattice frustration and are unstable.\nRelative to the stable superstructure with x = 1, intercalation of K (Fig. 7b and d) yields unstable PBA compounds in both the low (0 < x < 1) and high level of intercalation (1 < x < 2); these materials may be expected to decompose into a K-rich or a K-poor phase during (dis-)charge. If the intercalation is controlled by thermodynamic factors, this two phase behaviour is expected to yield flat intercalation voltage plateaus over the 0 < x < 1 and 1 < x < 2 composition ranges, during which a K-rich phase grows at the expense of a K-poor phase during intercalation. This voltage profile corresponds to experimental observations, e.g., ref. and . Such two-phase behaviour may be detrimental to the dynamics of ion transport, and thermodynamic control may not be achieved upon fast charge/discharge. Intercalation of Na, instead, shows nearly a linear variation of energy as a function of Na content for the Fe-based PBA NaxFeFe(CN)6, as shown in Fig. 7c. Upon thermodynamic control of Na intercalation in FeFe(CN)6, we would expect single phase behaviour and a disordered distribution of Na in the host lattice; this process may show a sloping voltage with increasing Na intercalation, but suffers less from kinetic limitations. The smooth slope voltage profile corresponding to the single-phase reaction is observed for NaxFeFe(CN)6 and at high intercalation levels in NaxMnFe(CN)6. However, NaxMnFe(CN)6 shown in Fig. 7a,, shows two phase behaviour in the low intercalation region (0 < x < 1), where our results indicate structural frustration due to size mismatch between reduced and oxidised HS-Mn ions in the same TM sublattice.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) reveal huge promise for large-scale storage and conversion of those renewable energies, owing to the advantages of earth-abundant raw materials and reversible Na-insertion electrochemistry. In order to well meet practical requirements and cost effectiveness of SIBs, electrode materials with good high-rate capability and long-lifespan cycling performance are highly desired. To date, reported available SIBs cathode materials mainly consist of transition-metal oxides, polyanionic compounds and Prussian-blue analogues. Among those materials, vanadium-based polyanionic compounds obtain special interests for designing high-rate, long-lifetime SIBs as they have robust structural framework, high electrochemical activity and favourable Na-transport channel. Previous studies have suggested that structural and electrochemical properties of the vanadium-based compounds highly depend on their compositions. For instance, the Na3V2(PO4)3 composition shows a rhombohedral structure with Rc space group, and has a theoretical capacity of 117 mA h g−1 at a low potential plateau of 3.45 V (vs. Na+/Na). Spherical Na3V2(PO4)3/C delivered a reversible capacity of 115.5 mA h g−1 and retained a remarkable capacity of 71.1 mA h g−1 at 50C. Its practical capacity could be increased by activating the redox reactions of the V4+/V5+ couple around 4.0 V. The Na7V3(P2O7)4 composition presents a monoclinic structure with a C2/c space group and has a theoretical capacity of 80 mA h g−1 at a high potential plateau of 4.13 V(vs. Na+/Na). Hierarchical Na7V3(P2O7)4/C nanosheets provided a reversible capacity of 75 mA h g−1 and a 93% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 20C. The Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 composition exhibits a tetragonal structure with P21c space group, and employs a theoretical capacity of 96 mA h g−1 at a high potential plateau of 3.85 V (vs. Na+/Na). Carbon-coated Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4/C delivered a practical capacity of 86.4 mA h g−1 and retained a capacity retention of 73% after 550 cycles at 10C. On the other hand, composition regulation is generally demonstrated to be effective in exploring new electrode materials. Park et al. found a high-energy Na3(VO0.8)(PO4)2F1.4 cathode with multi-electron reaction by regulating Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) compositions. Wang et al. developed a highly stable NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 cathode material by regulating NaNi0.5Mn0.5−xTixO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) compositions. Ghosh et al. discovered that Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3 has superior electrochemical performance than traditional Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na4VMn(PO4)3 compounds via regulating Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3 (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) compositions. Hence, regulating practical compositions would be a feasible pathway for creating novel high-performance vanadium-based polyanionic cathode materials.\nInspired by previous studies, a new series of Na3+2xV2+x(PO4)3−x(P2O7)2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) compositions with tunable PO4 and P2O7 polyanions were designed in this work according to the electric neutrality principle. Furthermore, influence of the composition on structure and electrochemistry of the material was carefully investigated by coupling X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic measurements. The target compositions were synthesized with a sol–gel approach, and the synthesis details have been given in ESI.† X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1a) indicate that the composition (x = 0) crystalizes into a rhombohedral structure with Rc space group, consistent with the rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 compound. The characteristic peaks at 20.2°, 23.6°, 32.2°, and 35.7° correspond to crystallographic planes (104), (113), (116), and (300), respectively. With increasing the x value, there gradually appear some of new diffraction peaks at 22.7°, 26.7°, 28.1° and 29.6°, which are identical to those of tetragonal Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 compound. The lattice parameters of Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase are a = 14.2234 Å, b = 14.2234 Å and c = 6.3674 Å, consistent with those values reported in previous work. When the x value reaches 2, the peaks assigned to Na3V2(PO4)3 phase disappear. The Rietveld refinement results (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†) reveal the XRD patterns of those compositions (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) can be well fitted based on the biphasic structure consisting of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 phase and tetragonal Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase. The fraction of Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase increases monotonically as a function of the x value. The biphasic structure can be also identified by using FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 1c). The absorption signals in the range of 400–680 cm−1 and 990–1200 cm−1 are respectively attributed to stretching vibrations of O–P–O and P–O bonds in PO4 units, while those in the range 680–990 cm−1 are assigned to symmetric and antisymmetric vibrations of P–O–P bonds in P2O7 units. It is clear that with increasing the x value, the signals belonging to P2O7 units (such as at 705 cm−1 and 941 cm−1) gradually increase, and those signals from PO4 units decrease. This is consistent with the XRD results. The XPS spectrum (Fig. 1d) display significant signals of Na, V, P, O, and C elements. The peaks at binding energies at 516.0 eV and 523.3 eV are ascribed to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 spin–orbit states of V3+ ions (Fig. 1e). The signals at binding energies of 132.9 eV and 133.8 eV are attributed to P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 orbitals of P5+ ions (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, morphology of the materials was observed by using scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope (Fig. 2). It is shown that the sample (x = 1) is composed of carbon-coated crystal particles embedded into carbon matrix. The crystal particle size is 200–400 nm and the carbon-coating layer thickness is 5–10 nm. The spacings of 0.248 nm and 0.373 nm in HRTEM images are attributed to crystallographic planes (322) of Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase and (113) of Na3V2(PO4)3 phase, respectively. The particles and carbon matrix can be clearly distinguished in EDS mapping. Na, V, P, and O elements are highly confined in the particles, while the carbon element distributes in the entire image. The overall molar ratio of Na, V and P elements in the sample is estimated to be 5.11:2.92:6.08, close to the designed value. It is concluded that composition regulation on Na3+2xV2+x(PO4)3−x(P2O7)2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) system would lead to a biphasic structure composed of carbon-coated particles embedded in carbon matrix. As previously reported, the biphasic structure generally boosted the reaction kinetics and cycling performance of electrode materials owing to the facilitation of ion diffusion in heterointerfaces and the alleviation of internal stress during Na extraction and insertion.\nInfluence of the composition on electrochemistry of the material was investigated with galvanostatic measurements. As shown in Fig. 3a, the composition (x = 0) exhibits charge/discharge profiles consisting of one long potential plateau centered at 3.45 V in the potential range of 2.0–4.2 V, corresponding to the redox reaction of V3+/V4+ couple in rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 phase. It renders a reversible capacity of 108.3 mA h g−1 and an initial coulombic efficiency of 95.8%. The composition (x = 2) shows a reversible capacity of 86.5 mA h g−1 and a working potential of 3.85 V owing to the redox reaction of V3+/V4+ couple in tetragonal Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase. Regulating the composition in the range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 leads to the materials having two potential plateaus at 3.45 V and 3.85 V in charge/discharge profiles owing to formation of the biphasic structure consisting of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 phase and tetragonal Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase. With increasing the x value, the low potential plateau is shortened owing to the decreased content of Na3V2(PO4)3 phase, while the higher potential plateau is extended due to the increased content of Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase. As a result, the composition regulation alters the reversible capacity and average working potential of the material. The Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2 composition delivers a reversible capacity of 90.6 mA h g−1 and an average working potential of 3.6 V at the current of 10 mA g−1.\nThe composition-induced changes in electrochemical behaviour can be intuitively observed from the dQ/dV curves (Fig. 3b). As increases the x value, redox currents at the lower potential are weakened and those at the higher potential are strengthened. The apparent Na diffusion coefficients of Na3V2(PO4)3, Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2, and Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 at plateaus were estimated from GITT curves to be 2.16 × 10−11, 2.42 × 10−11 and 2.21 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 on average (Fig. 3c and Fig. S2, ESI†). The improved Na-diffusion kinetics of the biphasic material is attributed to the combination of three-dimensional Na-transport channel, high-voltage driving force and favourable biphasic heterointerfaces. In order to further confirm the fact, cyclic voltammetry tests at different scanning rates were performed to identify the charge-storage mechanism. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), those samples mainly undergo a diffusion-controlled process during Na extraction and insertion. The larger pseudocapacitive contribution suggests the Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2 sample has faster reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the phase-evolution mechanism of the biphasic material was understood by using ex situ X-ray diffraction technique (Fig. 3d). With extracting sodium from the material lattice to 3.64 V, the intensity of peaks assigned to the Na3V2(PO4)3 phase (such as 20.1°, 28.7°, etc.) gradually decreases, and some additional peaks corresponding to Na-deficient NaV2(PO4)3 phase (24.2°, 36.7°, etc.) appear, suggesting the two-phase reaction mechanism of Na3V2(PO4)3 at the lower potential plateau. Further Na extraction from 3.64 to 4.2 V leads to splitting of peaks belonging to the Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 phase owing to formation of intermediate Na5V4(PO4)(P2O7)4, indicative of the two-phase reaction mechanism at the higher potential plateau.\nInfluence of the composition on charge/discharge performance of the materials was investigated by galvanostatic technique. As exhibited in Fig. 4a, the Na3V2(PO4)3 composition discharges capacities of 108.3 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1, 103.2 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 97.8 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1, and 92.5 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1. The Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4 composition renders capacities of 86.5 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1, 35.6 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 9.9 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1, and 1.7 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1. The capacity fading as the current increases is attributed to the severer electrochemical polarization at larger current densities. When the current is reset to a small value (10 mA g−1), the capacity recovers. In contrast, reversible capacities of the Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2 composition are 86.1 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1, 83.1 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 80.2 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1, and 76.0 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1. In order to exclude the influence of practical capacity, Fig. 4b provides the capacity retention versus the current density of those compositions. The highest capacity retention of 88% at 1000 mA g−1 suggests the Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2 composition has the best high-rate capability. Fig. 3c comparatively presents the cycling performance of those compositions within 150 cycles at 100 mA g−1.\nThe capacity retention is 47% for Na7V4(PO4)(P2O7)4, 94% for Na6V3.5(PO4)1.5(P2O7)3, 96% for Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2, 95% for Na4V2.5(PO4)2.5(P2O7), and 93% for Na3V2(PO4)3, respectively. According to the high-rate capability and cycling performance, the Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2 composition is considered as the optimized cathode material in this work. In order to sufficiently highlight the superior electrochemical performance, Fig. 3d provides the long-term cycling performance at the large current of 1000 mA g−1. The Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2 composition achieves a remarkable capacity retention of 88% after 1500 cycles, much higher than that of the Na3V2(PO4)3 composition (52%). Compared with other materials reported in previous work (Table S2, ESI†), it also exhibits superior high-rate capability and better long-term cycling performance, owing to the vital roles of biphasic structure in accelerating the ion diffusion and alleviating the internal stress during Na extraction and insertion.\nIn summary, a new series of Na3+2xV2+x(PO4)3−x(P2O7)2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) compositions are designed with aims to explore high-performance vanadium-based polyanionic cathode materials for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. Through systematically investigating the influence of composition regulation on structure and electrochemistry of the material, a biphasic Na5V3(PO4)2(P2O7)2/C composite is developed as a new cathode material, which exhibits ultrafast sodium storage capability and good long-term cycling performance.\nThis work is financially supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572023CT10-05).

Currently, among the typical anode candidate materials, embedded anode materials, such as commercial graphite, have a low theoretical capacity (35 mA h g−1) due to the large radius of sodium ions (1.02 Å), while materials based on the conversion-reaction mechanism (transition metal oxides/sulfides/selenides etc.) have a high capacity but poor cycling stability.\nAlloy-based materials (such as Bi, Sb, Sn, P etc.), which have been extensively researched due to their excellent physical and chemical properties, offer a larger lattice spacing and facilitate Na+ transfer through alloying/de-alloying reactions with sodium. Bismuth (Bi), as a typical representative example, can provide a high theoretical capacity of 385 mA h g−1. However, Bi also suffers from issues like significant volume expansion (≈ 244%) during the charge–discharge processes, leading to serious pulverization and poor stability. Currently, novel micro-nano structure design, combined with conductive carbon and electrolyte optimization, is considered an effective strategy to improve its electrochemical performance. For instance, Zhong et al. prepared honeycomb-like nanostructured Bi/N-doped carbon composites, which exhibited a stable reversible capacity of 285 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 20000 cycles. Additionally, the Guo group synthesized a microscale carbon-coated bismuth particles (P–Bi/C) porous composite as an anode material, demonstrating an excellent rate capability (153.2 mA h g−1 at 150C).\nConversely, biomass, a green raw material, has the characteristics of abundant resources, renewability, low cost and environmental friendliness. Transforming biomass into functional carbon materials is paving a new way to convert biomass into high-value-added products. Biomass-based carbon materials have the advantage of the unique layered porous structures of genetic biomass. These characteristics can provide abundant active sites and improve electrical conductivity, making biomass carbon-based materials one of the most promising functional materials in the field of energy conversion and storage. Tannic acid, a biomass material, can either self-polymerize or spontaneously form a coating on almost any surface, allowing for the formation of diverse carbon material structures, which has attracted increasing research interest. For example, Huang used tannic acid as a precursor to synthesize a rod-like carbon material with abundant pore structure and defects, which retained a specific capacity of 114.0 mA h g−1 after 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Besides, Zheng et al. synthesized a N/S double-doped porous spherical carbon material using tannic acid as a precursor, which achieved a capacity of 327.04 mA h g−1 when the current density was 0.05 A g−1.\nTherefore, a simple method was designed to synthesize a composite based on tannic acid-derived carbon (TAC) encapsulating Bi nanodiscs (Bi@TAC). This involved a one-step solvent-thermal method to synthesize the nanodiscs Bi2O3 precursors, followed by a simple tannic acid treatment to form the coated composite (Bi2O3@TA). After high-temperature calcination, it was found that the Bi@TAC composite showed a rod-like morphology, in which the Bi nanodiscs were embedded into the carbon substrate. The conductive carbon layer and Bi nanodiscs can shorten the diffusion distance of Na-ion/electron, ensuring fast kinetics and inhibiting the volume expansion during the charge–discharge process. As an anode, the Bi@TAC electrode demonstrated a superior specific capacity of 462.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and impressive long-term cycling stability (414.8 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1).\nThe preparation process of the Bi@TAC composite is displayed in Fig. 1a. Firstly, the Bi2O3 precursors were prepared through a simple solvothermal route and combined with tannic acid (TA) to form the Bi2O3@TA composite. The morphologies of Bi2O3 and Bi2O3@TA are displayed in Fig. S1(a–c) (ESI†), where Bi2O3 precursors maintain uniform nanodiscs while Bi2O3@TA polymerizes into microrods due to the action of the tannic acid. As depicted in Fig. S1d (ESI†), the XRD patterns show clear diffraction peaks with high crystallinity, which match the standard peaks of Bi2O3 (JCPDS no. 71-0465). Then, after 700 °C calcination, Bi2O3@TA was converted into the tannic acid-derived carbon-coated Bi composite (Bi@TAC). The IR spectra (Fig. S1e, ESI†) results indicated that after high-temperature treatment of Bi2O3@TA, its abundant organic group peaks disappear and transform into a carbon layer.\nThe crystal structures of the Bi@TAC composite and pure Bi are characterized in Fig. 1b. It can be seen that all the diffraction peaks match well with the standard diffraction of the rhombohedral Bi (JCPDS number 85-1329), and no impurity peaks are detected, which strongly proves that the Bi2O3 precursors have been successfully converted. The Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 1c, the peak at 308 cm−1 is the standard of bismuth and the peaks located at 1328 and 1582 cm−1 correspond to the D and G bands of the carbon material, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1d, the Bi@TAC composite exhibits a typical type IV isotherm feature, the specific surface area is calculated to be about 201.91 m2 g−1, and the pore size distribution curve shows a mesoporous structure, with the pore size mainly distributed around 4 nm. Additionally, the thermogravimetric test was used to analyze the content of the Bi@TAC composite (Fig. 1e), the weight change process can be attributed to the loss of adsorbed water, the oxidation of Bi to Bi2O3, and the loss of combustion weight of carbon. According to the residual product Bi2O3 accounting for 66.4%, the Bi content in the Bi@TAC composite is about 59.5%. XPS measurements were conducted to analyse the surface composition and chemical state of the Bi@TAC composite. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 1(f)–(g), the full measurement spectrum indicates the presence of Bi, O, and C elements. The two peaks located at 159.2 and 164.5 eV in the high-resolution spectrum of Bi 4f correspond to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively. In the C 1s core-level spectrum, three binding energies at 284.7, 286.2, and 288.9 eV can be observed, which can be assigned to the C–C, C–O, and CO bonds, respectively.\nThe morphology information of the Bi@TAC composite and pure Bi were studied by SEM and TEM measurements. Fig. 2(a) and (b) exhibits that the Bi@TAC composite maintains a microrod-like structure with uniform size and inherits the morphology of the Bi2O3@TA precursor after calcination. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 2(c) and (d) show that the Bi nanodiscs are embedded into the carbon substrate. In the inset of Fig. 2d, a well-defined lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.32 nm can be detected, which can be ascribed to the interplanar of the (012) plane for Bi. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and corresponding elemental mappings are shown in Fig. 2(e)–(g), which indicate the uniform distribution of Bi, C elements in the Bi@TAC composite. By contrast, as shown in Fig. S1f (ESI†), the structure of pure Bi obtained via the NaBH4 reduction pathway displays no uniform morphology and severe agglomeration.\nThe sodium storage performances of Bi@TAC composite were studied using half-cells in a voltage range of 0.01–1.5V (vs. Na+/Na). As detected in Fig. 3a, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at 0.2 mV s−1 of the Bi@TAC composite show that in the first cycle, the wide cathodic peak between 0.6–0.65 V is attributed to the formation of SEI film and the conversion of Bi to NaBi, furthermore, the peak at 0.47 V can be corresponded to the formation Na3Bi phase by NaBi. In the anodic reaction, it is a process of sodium removal, and the two peaks at 0.61 and 0.76 V correspond to Na3Bi → NaBi and NaBi → Bi, respectively. In addition, a pair of peaks at around 0.05 and 0.08 V could be attributed to the allocation to the sodium ion insertion/extraction carbon layer. The peaks in the subsequent second and fifth cycles almost overlap, indicating that the Bi@TAC composite has a high electrochemical reversibility. As shown in Fig. 3b, at 0.5 A g−1, the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles have clear plateaus at different cycles, matching well with the redox peaks of the CV curves. The first charge and discharge capacities were 508.5 and 915.1 mA h g−1, respectively, leading to an initial Coulombic efficiency of 55.6%. The irreversibility of initial capacity loss could be attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte to generate the SEI layer and side reaction between the carbon substrate and the electrolyte. In the subsequent cycles, the Coulombic efficiency is rapidly increased to nearly 100%, and no significant changes in the voltage curve are detected, indicating that the irreversible reactions only occur in the initial stage. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Bi@TAC composite delivers an excellent capacity of 462.3 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, while pure Bi has a capacity of 314.1 mA h g−1 at the same current density (Fig. S3, ESI†). Additionally, after removing Bi from Bi@TAC through hydrochloric acid etching, the TAC delivers a capacity of 179.9 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 (Fig. S4, ESI†).\nThe rate performances of the Bi@TAC composite and pure Bi were tested at different current densities (0.2 to 10 A g−1), the results are shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The average capacity of the Bi@TAC composite at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1 can be maintained at 487.3, 478.4, 476.9, 475 and 472.1 mA h g−1, and even at 10 A g−1, respectively, there is still an excellent capacity of 465.3 mA h g−1 (95% retention of the capacity compared with 0.2 A g−1), while pure Bi material is only 297.1 mA h g−1. When returned to 0.2 A g−1, it can still keep a specific capacity of 489.4 mA h g−1. These results indicate that the capacity of the Bi@TAC electrode hardly decreases with the increase of current density, demonstrating impressive rate capability. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3e and Fig. S6 (ESI†), the long cycling stability of the Bi@TAC composite was measured at 5 A g−1. The results show that the Bi@TAC composite maintains a high capacity of 414.8 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles, which is much better than that of pure Bi materials, indicating that the Bi@TAC composite has superior structural stability. Similar to the previously reported Bi@C composites, the carbon-coating structure in the Bi@TAC composite not only effectively suppresses the volume expansion of Bi but also enhances the electrical conductivity and shortens electron/ion diffusion pathways, thereby achieving superior sodium storage performance. Additionally, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), even when the mass loading reached 4.0 mg cm−2, the Bi@TAC composite was still able to deliver a high reversible capacity of 337.5 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. The XRD and SEM after cycling results demonstrated that the diffraction peaks remain consistent with those of pure Bi, while the rod-like morphology is well preserved without observable volume variation (Fig. S8, ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, as demonstrated in Table S1 (ESI†), such an impressive sodium storage performance is one of the best results achieved for Bi-based anodes.\nTo thoroughly analyse the sodium-ion storage mechanism of the Bi@TAC composite, the CV curves at different scan rates were executed from 0.2 to 4.0 mV s−1. As demonstrated in Fig. 4a, with the increase in scan rate, the CV curves of the Bi@TAC composite still maintain similar redox peaks, presenting superior reversibility.\nBased on the existing literature, the reaction mechanism of the Bi@TAC electrode is qualitatively analyzed:\nThe value of b can be obtained from the slope of the log i − logv diagram. A b value close to 0.5, indicates a diffusion-dominated process, while a b value approaching 1 signifies capacitive behavior. The calculated results are shown in Fig. 4b, where the slopes corresponding to peaks are 0.579, 0.568, 0.572 and 0.544, respectively. These values indicate that there are two modes of diffuse-dominant process and capacitive behavior, which contribute to improving electrochemical performance.\nThe kinetic process was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Fig. 4c, both Bi@TAC and pure Bi electrodes exhibit similar Nyquist diagram shapes, including semicircles in the high-frequency region and straight lines in the low-frequency region. The results show that the Bi@TAC electrode has a significantly lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) value than pure Bi, indicating that the carbon substrate-coated structure is conducive to improving the rapid electron transfer. The relationship between in the low-frequency region of Bi@TAC electrode is linearly fitted according to the EIS data (Fig. 4d) and its slope can represent the ion diffusion coefficient. It can be clearly found that the slope value of the Bi@TAC electrode is smaller than that of pure Bi, indicating that the Bi@TAC composite has a high sodium-ion diffusion coefficient.\nThe sodiation/desodiation mechanism in the reaction process of the Bi@TAC composite was investigated by ex situ XRD measurements. Fig. 4f shows the four characteristic stages (I–IV) of the charge discharge profiles, corresponding to the reaction process of the Bi@TAC electrode (Fig. 4e). When the discharge reaches about 0.5V (stage I), the Bi characteristic peak at 27.0° disappears, while a new characteristic peak at 31.7° is formed, which is attributed to the generation of NaBi. In stage II, when the discharge reaches 0.01V, the peak of NaBi disappears and the peaks of Na3Bi appear at 32.7° and 33.6°, indicating that the NaBi phase was transformed into the Na3Bi phase. During the charging process, Na3Bi is decomposed in two steps. In stage III, with the removal of sodium ions, the characteristic peaks of Na3Bi disappear, and NaBi regenerates. During charging up to 1.5 V (stage IV), the peak of NaBi disappears, and the peak of Bi reappears. The above results show that Bi@TAC electrode is a reversible alloying process of Bi ↔ NaBi ↔ Na3Bi.\nIn summary, the Bi@TAC composite, consisting of Bi nanodiscs embedded in a carbon substrate was synthesized successfully using Bi2O3@TA as a precursor. The Bi@TAC composite exhibited an excellent sodium-ion storage performance with a 95% capacity retention when the current density was increased from 0.2 to 10 A g−1, as well as impressive long cycling stability with a capacity of 414.8 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The superior performance is due to the synergistic action of the Bi nanodiscs and carbon substrate, and the smaller ion/electron diffusion pathway guarantees fast kinetics while effectively alleviating the volume expansion problem during the reaction process. In addition, the phase change of the Bi@TAC composite reaction process has been analyzed by ex situ XRD. These excellent properties provide valuable insights for the development of alloy anode materials.\nThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32271528) and the Scientific Research Foundation of Zhejiang A&F University (2022LFR026).\n\n\nData availability\nThe data supporting this article have been included as part of the ESI.†\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the initial sample, and its calcined sample. As can be seen from the figure, the XRD diffraction pattern of the initial sample only has a wide dispersion peak at about 25°, which is an amorphous structure, and its phase composition (including the phase of carbon) cannot be determined. To further determine the composition of the initial sample, the sample was calcined at 600 °C, and its diffraction pattern had strong diffraction peaks at 20.3°, 25.8°, 37.9°, etc., which were found to be consistent with quartz-type iron phosphate (COD number: 96-901-2513) standard card has a high degree of coincidence, indicating that the main phase of the initial sample prepared by ultrasonic assisted precipitation is iron phosphate. Meanwhile, thermal analysis was performed on the initial sample to further determine the crystal water content of the synthesized iron phosphate by precipitation.\nFig. 3 shows the thermal analysis curves of the initial sample at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. It can be seen from the TGA curve (Fig. 3a) that the quality of the sample begins to decline at about 40 °C until 500 °C, the weight of the sample is reduced by 23.95%. Combined with the analysis of the DTG curve, it can be found that the weight loss rate of the sample is the highest at 125 °C, followed by 255 °C, corresponding to the wide endothermic peak of the DTA curve (Fig. 3b) around 125 °C, it is speculated that the decomposition of crystal water and adsorbed water occurs in this temperature range. And after 500 °C, the TGA/DTG curves remain level, and the DTA curve is smooth and no difference. No significant mass loss or other physical/chemical reactions occurred in the sample, indicating that the crystal water and adsorbed water were completely removed. According to thermal analysis, the weight percentage of the dehydrated sample is 76.05%, and the sample contains 5% carbon. By calculating the actual weight percentage of the dehydrated sample is 74.79%, and according to formula (1), the number of crystal water is 2.83. Since the sample contains part of adsorbed water, there should be two crystal water. Therefore, it can be concluded that the initial sample prepared in this experiment is amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C cathode material.\nwhere M1 is the molar mass of FePO4 (151 g mol−1), M2 is the molar mass of H2O (18 g mol−1), X is the number of crystal water, ω is the percentage of the weight of the sample after dehydration.\nIn addition to determining the amount of crystal water in the sample, it can also be found through the thermal analysis that there are exothermic peaks in the DTA curve at about 520 °C and 556.6 °C, while the corresponding TGA/DTG curve does not change significantly. It is inferred that the crystal transformation of iron phosphate from amorphous to quartz type occurs at this time.\nTo get different phase structures FePO4·2H2O/C, the amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C was aged at different temperature in the closed reactor for different time. Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of aged samples. First of all, we know that the FePO4·2H2O/C without aging is an amorphous structure, and with the increase of aging temperature, the amorphous structure gradually transforms into a crystal structure. Further analysis find that the samples aged at 50 °C are amorphous structures. When the aging temperature is 70 °C and the time is 2 h, some weaker diffraction peaks appear at around 19°, 20.5°, 24.5° and 32°, which belong to monoclinic structure (COD no. 96-431-8789), and the aging time is extended to 4 h, these diffraction peaks gradually increase. When the aging temperature is 90 °C and the time is 2 h or 4 h, the phase structure of samples still remains in monoclinic structure. When the temperature rises further, some new diffraction peaks appear at around 16°, 22° and 29° which belong to orthogonal structure (COD no. 96-901-0008), but the diffraction peaks of monoclinic structure do not diminish, it indicates that the orthogonal structure transforms from amorphous structure, not monoclinic structure, and the transform process is slower and more difficult than monoclinic structure. All of the samples, including amorphous, monoclinic and monoclinic/orthogonal structures contain crystal water.\nIn order to study the phase transform process of the FePO4·2H2O/C, amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C was aged at 90 °C for different time. From Fig. 4b, it can be found that the orthogonal diffraction peaks of FePO4·2H2O (COD no. 96-901-0008) increase gradually with aging time, and the monoclinic diffraction peaks did not diminish, the orthogonal and monoclinic structure coexist.\nTo obtain different phase structures of FePO4/C without crystal water, the amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C was calcined at 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. Fig. 4c is the XRD patterns of FePO4/C prepared at different calcination temperature, it can be found that the calcination temperature has a major impact on the phase structure of FePO4, when the calcination temperature is 400 °C, the phase structure of FePO4 is amorphous structure, which indicates that when FePO4·2H2O/C is calcined below 400 °C, the phase structure is amorphous structure. With the calcination temperature rising, a rise of only 50 °C, the amorphous structure transforms into hexagonal structure, it has a high matching degree with the diffraction peaks of hexagonal FePO4 indexed in the standard card (COD no. 96-901-2513), and there are no other peaks, indicating that the FePO4 crystal can be synthesized at 450 °C. As temperature calcination continues to rise, the phase structure does not change. When the temperature rises to 600 °C, the anorthic Fe2P2O7 phase (COD no. 96-810-3722) appears at nearly 30°, which indicates that Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by carbon black, the reaction mechanism could be: 2FePO4 + C = Fe2P2O7 + CO↑, 2FePO4 + CO = Fe2P2O7 + CO2↑. The above analysis indicates that the amorphous and hexagonal FePO4/C without crystal water can be only obtained by calcining amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C, and other phase structure FePO4/C without crystal water cannot be obtained.\nTo obtain monoclinic or orthogonal FePO4/C without crystal water, the monoclinic/orthogonal FePO4·2H2O/C were calcined at 300 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C for 8 h, the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4d. When the calcination temperature is 300 °C and 500 °C, the main phase is the orthorhombic Fe3P4O14 (COD no. 96-403-0357) and little anorthic Fe2P2O7 (COD no. 96-810-3722), it indicates that some of Fe3+ are reduced. When the calcination temperature is 600 °C, the main phase is the anorthic Fe2P2O7 indicating that most of Fe3+ are reduced, this can be attributed to the fact that Fe3+ is reduced by carbon black. These experiments indicate that the monoclinic or orthogonal FePO4/C without crystal water cannot be synthesized by calcination due to the presence of carbon black.\nBased on the above analysis, the samples of the initial amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C without aging and calcining (a-FPH/C), monoclinic FePO4·2H2O/C (m-FPH/C) and orthogonal/monoclinic FePO4·2H2O/C (om-FPH/C) prepared by aging a-FPH/C at 90 °C for 2 h and 8 h, and amorphous FePO4/C (a-FP/C) and hexagonal FePO4/C (h-FP/C) prepared by calcining a-FPH/C at 400 °C for 2 h and at 600 °C for 2 h are used as research objects.\nFig. 5 is the Raman spectrum of the samples, and the characteristic Raman peaks belonging to carbon can be detected. The G band corresponds to the E2g phonon at the Brillouin zone center, which indicates sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a graphitic structure, the D band arises from defects and disorder within this structure. By comparing the peak areas of the G band and D band, the large ratio of peak area (Table 1) of the G band relative to the D band exhibits a high degree of graphitization, and highly graphitized carbon materials are known to possess enhanced electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, all of the ratios of IG/ID are basically equal, which indicates that the oxidizing, calcining and aging processes do no effect carbon black. Furthermore, it can be observed that a broad band centered at 1064 cm−1 is present in the Raman spectrum of m-FPH/C, om-FPH/C and h-FP/C, it is the characteristic of iron being tetrahedrally coordinated attributed to the formation of tetrahedrally-coordinated iron atoms to the enhanced surface energy kinetics at lower crystallite sizes, whereas this band is not present in a-FPH/C and a-FP/C, further demonstrating their amorphous structure.\nFig. 6 is the SEM and TEM of the samples. In the figures, the amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C (a-FPH/C) particles are globular and uniform in size, about 50 nm (Fig. 6b). The monoclinic m-FPH/C and orthogonal/monoclinic om-FPH/C are flake (Fig. 6c–f), and there are some small flocculent particles in these samples, they should be carbon black, and the flake of m-FPH/C is bigger than om-FPH/C, the thickness of flakes is about 20 nm. Both amorphous a-FP/C and hexagonal h-FP/C have near-spherical shapes (Fig. 6g–j), the particle dispersion is more uniform, and the particle size is about 50 nm (Fig. 6h and j), and in contrast to the a-FPH/C, the calcination temperature and phase changing are almost no effects on particles size. At the same time, because the samples of a-FPH/C, a-FP/C and h-FP/C are spherical and the particle size is small, carbon black is not easy to identify.\nIn order to further prove the existence of carbon and the distribution of each element, elemental analysis of amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C (a-FPH/C) is carried out by energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), and the results are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in the figures, all elements are evenly distributed, the molar ratio of Fe/P is close to 1:1, and the content of carbon black is 5 wt%. In summary, the nano-size FePO4·2H2O/C cathode materials with uniform particle distribution were successfully prepared by ultrasonic-assisted preparation, and carbon black to form a conducting network structure in samples.\nFig. 8 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of the samples. The adsorption–desorption curves of the five samples display IV-type isotherms with H1 hysteresis loop, H3 hysteresis loop, and H4 hysteresis loop, H1 hysteresis loop, H3 hysteresis loop, respectively. The type of hysteresis loop corresponds to the specific pore structure information. Among them, H1 is a uniform pore model, which can be considered as a cylindrical pore, while H3 and H4 have a large adsorption amount under high pressure, which can be considered as a narrow pore formed by the accumulation of flake particles or a large pore formed by the accumulation of big particles. At the same time, the pore size distribution also further verifies that the pore of samples is mainly mesoporous. Table 2 shows the specific surface area and pore size of the samples. It can be seen that the amorphous structure a-FPH/C and a-FP/C have a larger specific surface area of 85.021 m2 g−1 and 70.289 m2 g−1. This is because the calcining changes particle size and porosity, and heating and aging change particle size and shape.\n\n3.2 Electrochemical performance analysis\nFig. 9 shows the electrochemical properties of samples prepared by ultrasonic-assisted preparation. Fig. 9a illustrates the Nyquist plot of samples, all of the curves comprise a straight line at low frequencies and a semicircle at high to medium frequencies, where the linear portion signifies sodium ion diffusion within the electrode, while the semicircular part denotes charge transfer occurring on the cathode surface. The corresponding equivalent circuit model is presented in Fig. 9a, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) values of a-FPH/C, m-FPH/C, om-FPH/C, a-FP/C and h-FP/C after fitting are 205, 833, 618, 139, 1020 Ω, respectively. It can be found that the Rct of a-FP/C is much lower than that of other phase structures, indicating that the amorphous FePO4/C materials have better electronic conductivity. The reason is that a larger specific surface area of a-FP/C improves the point contact between the active particles and the carbon black, which is conducive to bipolar diffusion, and the isotropic and defectless properties of amorphous FePO4 provides a large number of continuous channels for Na+.\nSince there is a good linear relationship between the resistance (Z′) and the angular velocity (ω−1/2) (Fig. 9b), the specific Na+ diffusion rate (DNa+) can be calculated according to this relationship. The sodium diffusion coefficient in Fig. 9c is calculated using formula (2).\nwhere σ is the Warburg factor, C is the concentration of Na+ in the cathode, F is the Faraday constant, n is the number of electrons transferred by each molecule of redox reaction, A is the surface area of the electrode, T is the corresponding absolute temperature, and R is the universal gas constant.\nThe calculated results (Fig. 9c) show that the diffusion coefficients of Na+ are 2.34 × 10−16, 2.24 × 10−16, 2.40 × 10−16, 2.71 × 10−16 cm2 s−1 and 1.81 × 10−17 cm2 s−1 for a-FPH/C, m-FPH/C, om-FPH/C, a-FP/C, and h-FP/C, respectively. The maximum Na+ diffusion coefficient of a-FP/C further proves that the amorphous structure without crystal water is favorable to the electrochemical performance. Fig. 9d is the cyclic voltammetry of samples at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V at room temperature, one pair of oxidation–reduction current peaks of Fe3+/Fe2+ can be seen located near 3.1 V, the wide oxidation–reduction peak proves that the sodiation/desodiation process is a continuous one-phase oxidation–reduction reaction. Meanwhile, a-FP/C has the smallest potential difference, indicating the lowest degree of electrode polarization, which also shows that the amorphous structure, nano-sized spherical particles, large specific surface area, spatial network structure of carbon black enhance the sodiation/desodiation kinetics of cathode material.\nFig. 10a is the initial charge–discharge curves of samples at 0.1C at room temperature. The discharge specific capacity of a-FPH/C, m-FPH/C, om-FPH/C, a-FP/C and h-FP/C is 124.1, 94.9, 114.6, 149.8, 68.1 mA h g−1, respectively. From the comparison, whether or not containing crystal water, the amorphous structure materials have higher discharge specific capacity, the reason is the amorphous structure can provide more Na+ transport channels, meanwhile, the amorphous structure has a larger specific surface area, which means that there are more contact surfaces with conductive carbon black and electrolytes. Moreover, the amorphous a-FP/C without crystal water has the maximum discharge specific capacity, this may be the crystal water may hinder Na+ transport channel and may react with electrolyte, reducing the reversibility of sodiation/desodiation during charge and discharge. In the calcining amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C process, with the increase of calcination temperature, the amorphous structure is transformed into hexagonal structure which has high stability, but the more stable structure usually has lower electrochemical activity, so it has the minimum discharge specific capacity. Comparing m-FPH/C and om-FPH/C, the discharge specific capacity of om-FPH/C containing partially orthogonal structure is higher than m-FPH/C, it shows that orthogonal structure has better electrochemical performance than monoclinic structure. Fig. 10b is the cycling performance of samples at 0.1C at room temperature, the cycling performance of a-FP/C is excellent, and with the increase in the number of cycles, the capacity retention rate is 94.06%. It also has been found that the discharge specific capacity of the samples with crystal water (a-FPH/C, m-FPH/C and om-FPH/C) decreases seriously with the increase of the number of cycles, it further shows that the crystal water will be detrimental to charge and discharge process. Based on the above experimental results, compared with the existing literature, this work adopts a relatively simple experimental process to synthesize amorphous structural FePO4/C cathode materials, and obtains similar or better experimental results.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nFig. 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of the controllable synthesis process for hollow nanocubes of SnSe2@NC. Firstly, uniform ZnSn(OH)6 nanocubes, approximately 100 nm in size, it were synthesized using the coprecipitation method (as the SEM picture shown in Fig. 2a). Then polydopamine (PDA) was in situ coated onto the ZnSn(OH)6 nanocubes, constructing core–shell structured ZnSn(OH)6@PDA nanocubes (as shown in Fig. 2b). Subsequently, ZnSn(OH)6@PDA were calcined at 600 °C in an Ar atmosphere, which was then etched with HCl dissolution to remove impurities and produce SnO2@NC hollow nanocubes (as shown in Fig. S1a†). Finally, SnO2@NC hollow nanocubes and Se powders were thoroughly mixed and calcined to obtain SnSe2@NC hollow microcubes (as shown in Fig. 2c). As a control sample, ZnSn(OH)6 nanocubes without PDA coating were subjected to the same preparation process as the SnSe2@NC to obtain pure SnSe2 (as shown in Fig. S1b and c†). Due to the robust shell of the pyrolytic carbon from PDA, the nanocube structure remained intact even after the selenization process (Fig. 2c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) unveiled the inner architecture of the yolk–shell nanocubes (as depicted in Fig. 1d), showcasing a densely packed core encircled by a substantial void within the carbon shell, which measures approximately 10.9 nm in thickness. This observation is likely due to the fact that, during selenization under an Ar/H2 atmosphere, SnO2 is concurrently reduced to Sn, a metal with a melting point as low as 232 °C, leading to its evaporation and subsequent bead formation. In the high-resolution TEM images presented in Fig. 2e and f, the SnSe2 core exhibits distinct lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.191 nm, which matches the (110) plane of the hexagonal SnSe2 crystal structure. The SAED patterns (Fig. 2g) clearly show diffraction rings of the (100) and (001) planes of hexagonal SnSe2. Concurrently, elemental mapping (as shown in Fig. 2h–k) was utilized to examine the distribution of C, N, Sn, and Se within an individual yolk–shell nanocube. It is evident that the majority of Sn and Se elements are concentrated within the dense core of the hollow carbon shell, whereas C and N elements are predominantly found at the periphery. The N element is derived from the carbon residue resulting from the pyrolysis of PDA. Generally, the structure of large void space inside the N-rich carbon shell for SnSe2-based anodes would be expected to have superior performance for sodium storage.\nThe composition and crystal structure information of precursors, SnSe2 and SnSe2@NC were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 3a shows the XRD patterns of SnSe2 and SnSe2@NC. Both the diffraction peaks display the characteristic hexagonal SnSe2 diffraction peaks (JCPDS No. 89-2939), indicating the successful synthesis of SnSe2@NC. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the precursor of ZnSn(OH)6 and intermediate product of SnO2@NC are shown in Fig. S2.† In the Raman spectra (Fig. 3b), the SnSe2@NC sample exhibits a pronounced peak at 1360 cm−1, attributed to the D-band, and a significant peak at 1570 cm−1, corresponding to the G-band of carbon. The D-band typically originates from the carbon's defective and disordered structures, whereas the G-band is indicative of the sp2-hybridized, graphitic carbon framework. The intensity ratio of these peaks (ID/IG) serves as an indicator of defect concentration. Based on the area fitting analysis, SnSe2@NC has an ID/IG ratio of 2.3, which suggests a substantial presence of defects. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra are also collected to further determine the bonding states and valence states of SnSe2@NC (shown in Fig. S3†), presenting the signal at high resolution from C 1s, N 1s, Sn 3d, and Se 3d (Fig. 3c–f). As depicted in Fig. 3c, the high-resolution C 1s spectrum is primarily resolved into three distinct peaks. The peaks located at approximately 284.8 eV and 286.3 eV are attributed to C–C and CO bonds, respectively. In the N 1s spectrum presented in Fig. 2d, the peaks at 398.4 eV, 399.8 eV, and 400.7 eV correspond to pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic nitrogen. The existence of pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen serves to create active sites that facilitate Na+ intercalation and deintercalation, which in turn enhances the reaction kinetics and subsequently improves the rate performance of the battery. Fig. 3e displays the high-resolution energy spectrum of Sn 3d, with characteristic peaks at 486.9 eV and 495.4 eV, which correspond to the binding energies of Sn4+ 3d5/2 and Sn4+ 3d3/2, respectively. From the Se 3d high-resolution spectrum (Fig. 2f), four distinct peaks can be clearly identified, with two at 53.9 eV and 55.3 eV, which can be assigned to the Se2− 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 of Se2−, respectively. The peak at 59.1 eV is associated with Se–O bonds, resulting from surface oxidation due to prolonged exposure to air. Meanwhile, the peak at 56.2 eV represents the binding energy of the Se–C bond. It has been discussed that the Se–C bond plays a crucial role in battery performance, primarily by bolstering the structural stability of the electrode materials.\nThe electrochemical performance of SnSe2@NC as an anode for SIBs was elucidated using a half cell configuration with sodium metal foil as the counter electrode. For comparative analysis, SnSe2 was also evaluated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to elucidate the various electrochemical reactions occurring throughout the charge/discharge cycles recorded at the rate of 0.1 mV s−1 over a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V. Drawing from prior research on SnSe2 anodes for sodium storage, the initial charging process is believed to involve both intercalation and conversion reactions:\nThe initial discharging process of the CV profile (Fig. 4a) exhibits a reduction peak near 1.65 V, which is associated with the intercalation of Na+ into the interlayer space of SnSe2 crystal structure with the formation of NaxSnSe2 (eqn (1)). The peak observed at 0.71 V (vs. Na/Na+) corresponds to the formation of SnSe2 to metallic Sn and Na2Se, and the formation of irreversible solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (eqn (2)). During the initial anodic sweep, the broad peaks at near 0.20 can be attributed to the conversion process from metallic Sn to Na3.75Sn (eqn (3)), while the peaks at 1.35 V and 1.55 V are indicative of the desodiation process, and the minor peak at 2.16 V (vs. Na/Na+) is attributed to the reformation of SnSe2. It merits emphasis that the CV curve from the third cycle closely aligns with that of the second, signifying excellent reversibility in the sodium storage reaction of SnSe2@NC. By comparison, the bare SnSe2 shares a similar CV profile with the SnSe2@NC composite (referring to Fig. S4†) during first scan, but the peak currents in the CV curves of SnSe2 in the 2nd and 3rd cycles are considerably weaker compared to those of SnSe2@NC. This indicates a poorer reversibility for SnSe2, suggesting that the composite material outperforms the pure SnSe2 under the same experimental conditions.\nThe results of the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements are depicted in Fig. 4b and c. As shown in Fig. 4b, SnSe2@NC electrode demonstrates the superior electrochemical performance, achieving a high reversible capacity of 368.9 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, much higher than that of pure SnSe2 with a capacity of 159.0 mA h g−1 at the same current density. As shown in Fig. S5,† SnSe2@NC delivers a specific discharge capacity value of 686.6 and a specific charge capacity value of 515.5 mA h g−1, corresponding to a high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 75.08% during the first cycle. For comparison, pure SnSe2 delivers a specific discharge capacity value of 617.7 mA h g−1 and a specific charge capacity value of 391.9 mA h g−1 with an ICE of 63.44%. The observed capacity loss is attributed to the formation of an irreversible solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on the electrode surface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. Compared to pure SnSe2 shown in Fig. 4c, SnSe2@NC also exhibits better rate capability and higher average capacity at different current densities.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4c, we probed the rate performance of the SnSe2@NC electrode across a range of current densities from 0.2 to 5 A g−1. The electrode exhibited average discharge capacities of 395.0, 363.5, 356.7, 347.0 and 324.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. These values markedly surpass those of the pristine SnSe2 electrode, which delivered 138.9, 109.1, 92.3, 76.5 and 59.6 mA h g−1 under the same current densities. Notably, when the current density was reduced back to 0.2 A g−1, the SnSe2@NC electrode's discharge capacity swiftly rebounded to approximately 470.6 mA h g−1. EIS tests were measured to further investigate the reaction kinetics of SnSe2@NC and pure SnSe2 electrodes to investigate the reaction kinetics for SIBs. As shown in Fig. 4d, each Nyquist plot is composed of a semicircle and a straight line. The semicircle, evident in the high and medium frequency ranges, is typically associated with the charge transfer impedance (Rct) of the electrode. Conversely, the straight line observed in the low frequency range is ascribed to the Warburg impedance, which is indicative of mass transport limitations. The fitting results of equivalent circuits are shown in Table S1.† The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of SnSe2@NC is 28.7 Ω, much lower than that of SnSe2 (Rct = 127.8 Ω), indicating that existence of N doped carbon layer improves the electronic conductivity of SnSe2@NC. As detailed in the quantitative data of the low-frequency region (Table S1†), the SnSe2@NC electrode exhibits reduced charge transfer impedance and accelerated ion diffusion compared to the pure SnSe2, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. To delve deeper into the assessment of the sustainable stability, endurance, and structural integrity of SnSe2@NC and pristine SnSe2, high current density of 5 A g−1 was applied after the cells activated at 0.1 A g−1 for the starting 10 cycles (Fig. 4e). The discharge capacity of SnSe2@NC electrode sustains at 324.2 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1, much higher than that of SnSe2 with a discharge capacity of 52.7 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. The yolk–shell-structured SnSe2@NC exhibited enhanced structural integrity following electrochemical reactions, which was instrumental in its exceptional stable cycling performance. Conversely, the electrochemical behavior of pure SnSe2 underscored its structural fragility, leading to a precipitous decline in capacities over cycling and diminished reversible capacities in subsequent cycles.\nTo elucidate the exceptional electrochemical performance of SnSe2@NC electrode, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted at various scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1, as depicted in Fig. 5a. The CV curves are fundamentally aligned with the expected profiles, indicating a swift charge transfer within SnSe2@NC during the alloying and dealloying processes. The electrode's reaction kinetics and sodium storage mechanism can be explored by using the relationship between the measured current (i) and the related scanning rate (v):\nin which a is a constant, and b is a constant for the same reaction and has to do with the energy storage reaction's starting components. When the value of b is 1, the reaction has surface-controlled capacitive behavior, when the value is 0.5, the reaction is wholly a diffusion-controlled Faraday process. As shown in Fig. 5b, the b values corresponding to different peaks in SnSe2@NC are 0.89, 1.08, 1.00, 1.09, 0.99, 0.76 and 1.01, respectively. The overall value of b is close to 1 indicating the dominant contribution of the pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, the contribution ratio of pseudocapacitance can be calculated based on the response current composed (i(V)) of pseudocapacitance contribution (k1v) and diffusion-controlled insertion process (k2v1/2), which can be expressed by their relationship as follows:\nBy fitting calculations, k1 can be calculated, and based on it, the proportion of pseudocapacitance at each scanning speed can be calculated. As shown in Fig. 5c, the red shaded area of the CV is the pseudocapacitive contribution area (92.94%), which is mainly the pseudocapacitive contribution at 0.6 mV s−1. As indicated in Fig. 5d, the capacitance contributions at scanning speeds of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mV s−1 are 89.30%, 89.94%, 90.66%, 92.94%, 94.79%, and 96.35%, respectively. The significantly higher contribution of pseudocapacitance in SnSe2@NC suggests that the dominant energy storage behavior is governed by pseudocapacitive effects, thereby endowing SnSe2@NC with the capability to facilitate rapid Na+ transmission and exhibit excellent high-speed cycling stability. In order to further illustrate the superior ions diffusion process, the diffusion coefficients of Na+ (DNa+) were evaluated by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test (Fig. S6†), the detailed calculation process is based on eqn (6).\nHere, DNa+ denotes the Na+ diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), VM is the molar volume, τ signifies the pulse duration, mb indicates the active mass of the electrode, Mb is the molar mass of the electrode material, s is the total surface area of the electrodes, ΔEs represents the steady-state voltage variation attributed to the pulse (V) and ΔEτ corresponds to total cell voltage change during constant pulse time. Fig. S6a† presents the potential response curves for both the charging and discharging processes of SnSe2@NC and pure SnSe2 in the initial cycle. Fig. S6b† illustrates the sodium diffusion behaviors of SnSe2@NC and pure SnSe2 during the Na+ insertion and extraction processes. In summary, yolk–shell SnSe2@NC nanocubes distinctly showed a higher average diffusion coefficient than pure SnSe2. This highlights the superior electrochemical performance of SnSe2@NC, where SnSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated within an inner void space are enveloped by a nitrogen-doped carbon shell, conferring high electrical conductivity. The improved Na-ion diffusion kinetics of the SnSe2@NC nanocubes results in a superior rate performance as anode for SIBs.\nThe solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for maintaining both the performance and stability of anode materials for SIBs. It serves as a protective barrier that insulates the electrolyte from the electrode, thereby preventing undesired reactions and the subsequent degradation during electrochemical reaction process. A robust and well-formed SEI film is indispensable for sustaining the energy density, extending the lifespan, and ensuring the overall safety of the battery. To further gain a better understanding the origin of the excellent electrochemical performances of SnSe2@NC and pure SnSe2, XPS characterizations of electrodes after cycling was carried out (Fig. 6). As depicted in Fig. 6a and b, the distinct C 1s spectrum peaks for SnSe2@NC and pure SnSe2 were resolved into three peaks at approximately 288.6, 285.8, and 284.8 eV, corresponding to CO32−, C–O–C, and C–C, respectively. In the O 1s XPS spectrum as shown in Fig. 6c and d, the peaks at 531.7, 532.5, 532.9, and 536.9 eV correspond to CO32−, RSO3Na, C–O, and NaKLL, respectively. The detection of RSO3Na and Na2CO3 in both the O 1s and C 1s XPS spectra is indicative of the reduction derived from NaCF3SO3 electrolyte within diethylene glycol dimethyl ether. However, it is important to highlight that these compounds are thermodynamically unstable. As an adverse outcome of this side reaction, RSO3Na and Na2CO3, which possess inferior electronic and ionic conductivities, lead to heightened electrode polarization. This, in turn, exacerbates the kinetics of Na+ diffusion, ultimately degrading the system's overall performance. In comparison to pristine SnSe2 electrodes, SnSe2@NC exhibits significantly lower levels of RSO3Na and Na2CO3, indicating that the SnSe2 nanoparticles confined within nitrogen-doped carbon nanocubes featuring inner void spaces could effectively minimize side reactions and facilitate the formation of a more stable SEI layer. Consequently, this configuration helps prevent the growth of sodium dendrites and enhances the overall lifespan of the electrodes.\nThe F 1s spectra depicted in Fig. 6e and f reveal two distinct peaks corresponding to C–F and Na–F bonds, which serve as evidence for the presence of NaF and C–F species within the SEI film on the electrodes. The formation of these NaF and C–F species is believed to stem from the decomposition of NaCF3SO3. It is evident that the modified SnSe2@NC has a reduced content of Na–F bonds compared to the pristine SnSe2 electrode. This indicates that the N-doped carbon layer can effectively inhibit the decomposition of NaCF3SO3 during the sodiation/de-sodiation process. In summary, the SEI layer of the SnSe2@NC electrode is significantly more stable than that of the pristine SnSe2 electrode throughout the entire sodiation/desodiation process. This enhanced stability suggests that the SnSe2@NC yolk–shell nanocubes has improved Na+ diffusion kinetics, likely owing to its structural robustness and excellent conductivity. Consequently, the SnSe2@NC electrode shows superior capacity retention, particularly at high current densities.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The synthetic process of NFM@DHP is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The DHP molecules with phosphonic acid headgroup, which is highly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran (THF), can spontaneously anchor on NFM by forming P–O–M bonds (M denotes Na, Ni, Fe, Mn) through a dehydration process between the phosphonic acid and hydroxyl group. Additionally, owing to the robust intermolecular interactions and enhanced rigidity, the two-chain alkane tail groups of DHP, with compressed free space, promote a compact molecular arrangement, resulting in a thin, dense, and hydrophobic protective layer on the NFM surface.\nThe crystal structure of NFM and NFM@DHP were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As presented in Fig. 2a, NFM shows a pure O3 phase with the hexagonal α-NaFeO2 layered structure for the space group of Rm, consistent with previous reports. NFM@DHP maintained similar peak positions and intensities, implying no structural alteration by the DHP layer. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that NFM showed a single crystal morphology with a clean and smooth surface (Fig. 2b), which remained unchanged after DHP coating (Fig. 2c). Notably, elemental mapping of NFM@DHP shows a homogeneous distribution of phosphorus (Fig. 2c and S1b†), which should be attributed to DHP. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) further confirmed a uniform, dense ∼6 nm film on NFM@DHP surface (Fig. 2d and e).\nFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to elucidate the structure of the observed film (Fig. 2f). The FT-IR spectrum of NFM@DHP exhibited two peaks at 2916 and 2849 cm−1, which can be attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of C–H in the functional groups (–CH2– and –(CH2)n–) of DHP molecules. Meanwhile, the absence of PO stretching vibrations (1213 and 1110 cm−1) and the presence of O–P–O signals (1022 and 962 cm−1) suggest the formation of P–O–M bonds between the phosphonic acid groups of DHP and the surface hydroxyl groups of NFM. Similar result was achieved by XPS measurement (Fig. 2g). Compared to NFM, NFM@DHP exhibited two extra peaks at 132.7 eV and 133.6 eV for P–C and P–O–M bonds, respectively. The increased C–C bond intensity in NFM@DHP further supported the adhesion of DHP (Fig. S2†).\nTo assess the ability of the DHP coating to protect NFM from humid air corrosion, an aging experiment was conducted in an environment with RH 45–50% and 30 °C. SEM imaging was performed on both NFM and NFM@DHP after 7 days of exposure (denoted as NFM-7D and NFM@DHP-7D, respectively). Compared to pristine NFM (Fig. 3a), significant impurity accumulation (Fig. 3b) and a crack (Fig. S3†) can be observed on the surface of NFM-7D, which can be attributed to the corrosion caused by water vapor and CO2. In contrast, with the shielding effect of the dense DHP layer, the NFM@DHP-7D exhibits a smooth surface without observable impurities (Fig. 3c and d). XRD analysis corroborates this result (Fig. 3e), showing a significant deterioration in NFM crystallinity after air exposure in the sealed container, with impurities like Na2CO3 and NiO, indicative of Na+/H+ exchange and oxidization of transition metal ions. Notably, in NFM-7D, the (003) peak shifts to a lower angle, while the (110) peak shifts to a higher angle, suggesting c-axis expansion and a-axis contraction due to Na+ extraction during the humid air corrosion. Conversely, NFM@DHP-7D exhibits no significant structural changes or residues, clearly implying the effectiveness of the DHP layer in improving the air-stability of NFM. This is supported by FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S4†), which detects minimal adsorbed H2O molecules on NFM@DHP-7D, suggesting that the hydrophobic DHP layer can effectively prevent H2O accumulation.\nThe variations of surface compositions on NFM and NFM@DHP upon air exposure were investigated by XPS measurements. The O 1s spectrum of NFM can be deconvoluted into four components (Fig. 3f), including M–O (representing bulk lattice oxygen, 528.9 eV), absorbed OH− (535.4 eV), C–O (532.8 eV), and CO (531 eV). Among them, both samples showed C–O and CO signals, attributed to Na2CO3 formed during sintering. After 7 days exposure, NFM-7D exhibited a 17.9% decrease in M–O in the O 1s spectrum and a 6.7% increase in CO in the C 1s spectrum, implying the formation of extra Na2CO3 (Fig. S5a†). In contrast, the surface composition of NFM@DHP-7D remains stable (Fig. 3g and S5b†). These results prove that the DHP coating can effectively alleviate air corrosion of NFM.\nTo reveal the impact of the DHP layer on interfacial properties, the surface wettability of water on NFM and NFM@DHP was evaluated by contact angle test. As depicted in Fig. 3h and i, NFM@DHP exhibits an increased water contact angle (40.3°) compared to NFM (14.1°), indicating superior hydrophobicity. This enhancement should be attributed to the hydrophobic alkyl chain of DHP molecules. The dense and hydrophobic DHP layer is expected to effectively block humid air, thus preventing Na+/H+ exchange and suppressing residuals formation and structural degradation of NFM (Fig. 3j).\nThe function of DHP layer on the sodium storage performance of NFM was evaluated in CR2032 coin cells with a sodium foil as the anode in a voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. The DHP-coated sample exhibited similar charge/discharge plateaus and polarization to the NFM cathode, despite a slight capacity reduction from 137 to 132 mA h g−1 due to the additional weight of the DHP coating. This means that the thin DHP layer does not affect the charge transfer process in NFM (Fig. 4a). However, after 7 days of exposure, the NFM-7D cathode only delivered an initial capacity of 49 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4b), which should be ascribed to air corrosion. Comparatively, NFM@DHP-7D delivered a reversible capacity of 118 mA h g−1, corresponding to 89.4% of the pristine NFM@DHP capacity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DHP coating in inhibiting air corrosion.\nFig. 4c shows the rate performance of NFM and NFM@DHP. Although the presence of the DHP layer contributed to a slight reduction in capacity, NFM@DHP showed a comparable rate capability to NFM. However, the rate performance of NFM-7D, which had been exposed to air for seven days, significantly declined (Fig. 4d). This decrement can be ascribed to the accumulation of sodium carbonate and NiO resulting from air corrosion. Specifically, the specific capacity of NFM-7D dropped to 10 mA h g−1 at 5C (1C = 240 mA g−1), whereas NFM@DHP-7D maintained a capacity of 85 mA h g−1 at the same rate, comparable to that of NFM@DHP (90 mA h g−1). This observation is corroborated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results (Fig. S6†), which showed that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of NFM increased from 407 Ω to 1280 Ω after air exposure, while those of NFM@DHP remained almost unchanged (660 Ω to 690 Ω), confirming the DHP layer's role in inhibiting the formation of ion-insulated species.\nThe cycle stability of NFM was also largely improved after DHP coating. After 330 cycles at 1C rate, the specific capacity of NFM fell from 119 mA h g−1 to 63 mA h g−1, yielding a capacity retention of 52.9% (Fig. 4e and S7†). This value increased to 87.3% for NFM@DHP, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DHP layer in stabilizing NFM. After air exposure (Fig. 4f), the initial capacity of NFM-7D sharply decreased to 28 mA h g−1 at 1C, while NFM@DHP-7D retained a significantly higher initial capacity of 98 mA h g−1, with a capacity retention of 85% after 200 cycles. This result suggests that the DHP layer can successfully prevent capacity loss caused by active Na+ loss during cycling.\nTo further demonstrate the superiority of the DHP layer in improving air stability, NFM@DHP was exposed for 21 days (denoted as NFM@DHP-21D). As depicted in Fig. S8a,† the XRD pattern of NFM@DHP-21D exhibited no extra impurities or peak shifts. In addition, both its specific capacity at 0.1C (114 mA h g−1) and cycle ability at 1C surpassed that of NFM-7D (Fig. S8b and c†). Even when extended to 28 days, robust performance was consistently maintained (Fig. S9†). Besides, the processability of NFM@DHP has been improved. Generally, alkaline residues on NFM surface can react with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), diminishing its binding properties. For this reason, the slurries of NFM can only be smoothly coated on aluminum foil under a dry environment (35% RH) and tended to gel in humid air (80% RH). In contrast, slurries of NFM@DHP showed smooth coating on aluminum foil under all conditions (Fig. S10†).\nTo better understand how the DHP layer improves the stability of NFM, ex situ XRD was conducted to characterize the charge–discharge mechanism of NFM and NFM@DHP. As shown in Fig. 5a, during the initial charging process, the (003), (006), (107), and (018) peaks of NFM@DHP gradually shifted to lower angles, and the peak intensity of (104) dramatically decreased, indicating a typical desodiation-induced O3 to P3 phase transformation. After fully discharging, the pristine O3 phase emerged again, indicating a reversible sodiation-desodiation mechanism. This observation aligns well with the NFM electrode (Fig. S9†), suggesting that the DHP layer does not affect the phase transition of NFM. However, after 200 cycles, the typical P3 phase persisted in the fully discharged NFM cathode, and the (110) peak of O3 phase shifted toward a higher angle (Fig. 5b), suggesting an irreversible phase transition in NFM over time. In contrast, no obvious structural changes were observed in the NFM@DHP cathode.\nFurthermore, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) revealed significantly lower transition metal ion (Ni, Fe, Mn) concentrations in the electrolyte of the cycled Na//NFM@DHP cells compared to the cycled Na//NFM cells (Fig. 5c). Accordingly, obvious dark deposits were observed on the sodium anode collected from the cycled Na//NFM cells (Fig. 5d), which was absent in Na//NFM@DHP cell. Additionally, the morphology of NFM electrode showed severe cracks after 200 cycles (Fig. 5e and S11†), while NFM@DHP particles retained an intact surface (Fig. 5f). These findings clearly imply that the DHP layer can effectively block the dissolution of transition metal ions of NFM, thus contributing to enhanced electrochemical stability.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}
