The critical point for realizing high Ca is to fabricate the electrode with superior specific capacity with the condition of high loading mass. Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted much attention as a promising next-generation energy storage system owing to the abundance and economy of sodium sources and their similar electrochemical behavior to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the larger radius of Na+ compared to Li+ leads to much more sluggish reaction kinetics and severe structural pulverization of the electrode during cycling, which are harmful for cell capacity and cycle stability.\nIn order to achieve high Ca in SIBs, it is urgently required to explore advanced electrode materials, especially anode ones with high reversible capacity and low cost. Among various candidates, transition metal sulfides have recently attracted much attention because they can furnish high specific capacity (Cs) and widespread availability as well as small stress change during cycling. Selenium is located in the same group as sulfur in the Periodic table of elements; moreover, it possesses higher conductivity than sulfur. Therefore, metal selenides can serve as potential anodes for SIBs. There are a few reports on metal selenides, such as MoSe2, FeSe2, SnSe, or CoSe2, which exhibit a favorable electrochemical performance. Recently, Mai's group has reported novel NiSe2 nano-octahedra as promising anodes showing excellent cycle stability and rate capacities.\nDespite the breakthrough in metal selenides, the fraction and loading of active material on the electrodes are still too low. A routine slurry-coating procedure, in which a nonconductive binder of ∼10 wt% is usually used to maintain the electrode integrity, is commonly adopted for the preparation of electrodes. This seriously hinders the electron transfer and decreases the capacity of the electrode. In addition, conductive carbon is always adopted to increase electron/ion transfer and relieve volume changes. However, the low tap density of carbonaceous material limits the overall tap density of the electrodes. As a result, it is difficult to achieve high active material loading. To say the least, the thicker the electrode film, the harder the charge transfer. Therefore, there is a trade-off between specific capacity and active material loading. Directly growing pure active material onto the current collector will avoid the cumbersome additives of carbon and a binder. Moreover, if the active material is vertically grown on a three-dimensional (3D) current collector to form a hierarchical array structure, the charge transfer channel will be available despite the high active material loading. Therefore, the direct growth method is an effective approach to obtain high Ca for metal selenides. Recently, there have been some reports about metal selenides grown on foam Ni (F–Ni) for various applications, such as electrocatalysis for water splitting and H2/O2 generation.\nHerein, a new anode material of Ni3Se2 with a 3D hierarchical nanorod array (NA) structure (denoted 3DHNA) was successfully explored as an anode for high-areal-capacity SIBs. The NiSe NAs were first grown in situ on a 3D F–Ni current collector to form an integrated 3D microstructure (denoted 3D NA), which was favorable for quick ion transfer even at high electrode loading. Because F–Ni simultaneously serves as an Ni source of NiSe, the adherence of NA on F–Ni is tight, promising abundant electron transfer. In order to further acquire a secondary 3D structure for enhanced electrochemical reaction, the intermediate of the NiSe 3D NA electrode was post-treated through a decomposition followed by a fusion (decomposition–fusion) process. After this special process, a nanorod composed of a consecutive core and a rough surface with many protuberances attached was acquired, which was favorable for both quick charge transfer and structural stability. Moreover, along with this process, the composition of NA was transformed from NiSe to Ni3Se2. Compared with NiSe and NiSe2, the intrinsic low volume change of Ni3Se2 also decreased the risk of structural fracture. It is well known that the volume expansion of these materials is derived from insertion of Na through a conversion reaction to form amorphous Na2Se. By comparison with the reaction process described in eqn (S2)–(4),† Ni3Se2 experiences minimum volume stress. As a result, the electrode delivered a stable reversible capacity of 1.55 mA h cm−2 at 0.2 mA cm−2 after 100 cycles, with a capacity retention of 95%. Even at a high current density of 4 mA cm−2, the cell still retained a good Ca of 0.87 mA h cm−2. The Ca values are obviously superior to those of other metal selenides reported previously.\nThe preparation of Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA is exhibited in Scheme 1. Both the composition and the morphology of the NA experience a gradual evolution by regulating the temperature in order to realize an optimal electrochemical reaction. The bushy NA with a smooth surface are vertically grown on F–Ni to form an orderly 3D NA electrode after a one-step solvothermal reaction, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. S1a and b.† From the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. S2,† the diffraction peaks of 3D NA are indexed as two kinds of hexagonal NiSe phases with different space groups (PDF#08-1887 and 02-0892) (denoted R/P-NiSe). In order to roughen the nanorod to obtain a secondary 3D structure and to modulate the composition for a better electrochemical reaction, the 3D NA electrode is post-treated at high temperature under the protection of an inert gas. After treatment at different temperatures, the macroscopic 3D NA are well maintained for all samples, as indicated by the low-resolution SEM images in Fig. 1a, S1c and S1e.† While the single nanorod undergoes an obvious morphological evolution along with the increased temperature, as can be seen from the high-resolution SEM images. Moreover, as displayed by the XRD patterns, the composition of the samples experiences a corresponding transformation. Actually, as shown in Fig. S1d,† the smooth nanorods are broken into loose and separate nanoparticles and the diameter of the nanorod becomes larger at 500 °C. In addition, along with the high-temperature treatment, a pure phase of hexagonal NiSe (PDF#02-0892) is retained, as exhibited in Fig. S3.† Slight peaks attributed to hexagonal Ni3Se2 (PDF#19-0841) are also discovered, indicating that a transformation from NiSe to Ni3Se2 occurs. As mentioned above, Ni3Se2 suffers from a lower volume change compared with NiSe during the electrochemical reaction. With a further increase in temperature to 600 °C, the diffraction peaks are almost completely consistent with hexagonal Ni3Se2, demonstrating the formation of pure Ni3Se2. In addition, the nanorod in Fig. 1b becomes compact and the diameter decreases again compared with that at 500 °C. There are still many protuberances attached to the surface of the nanorod. Therefore, the NA experiences a decomposition–fusion process at 600 °C. The potential evolution process for different morphologies is explained as follows: the low melting point of Se (221 °C) results in it easily dissolving out from R/P-NiSe during heating. When the temperature is 500 °C, the dissolution of Se may be uneven; therefore, the NiSe nanoparticles are formed on the nanorod during cooling down. When the temperature is further increased to 600 °C, the dissolved Se is more evenly dispersed; therefore, the Ni3Se2 nanorods become smoother and more compact and the diameters decrease again. With a further increase in temperature to 700 °C, even if a stable Ni3Se2 phase is maintained, the NiSe phase clearly appears again. As displayed in Fig. S1f,† the nanorods are fractured into a lotus root shaped structure. Some bulky particles even scatter to cause the collapse of the NA. This is described as a further condensation process. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement is carried out to explore the mass change of the electrode during the heating process, as shown in Fig. S4.† The mass of the 3D NA electrode is stable up to 450 °C. After that, the mass shows a very slight increase with increased temperature. Since there is no impurity seen in the XRD results, the slight mass increase should result from the increased mass of F–Ni at a high treatment temperature. In order to confirm this, the TGA of pure F–Ni, which is treated in N2H4·H2O solvent without the addition of Se, is tested in Fig. S4.† As expected, the pure F–Ni exhibits a very consistent mass change process with a 3D NA electrode. The very slight mass increase happens after 450 °C, which may be ascribed to the slight side reaction of F–Ni at a high treatment temperature. The XRD result of F–Ni after treatment at 600 °C is collected, as shown in Fig. S5.† Actually, apart from the diffraction peaks of F–Ni, there are two very small peaks which are ascribed to NiOOH (PDF#06-0075), resulting in the slight mass increase of F–Ni. The electrochemical performance of pure F–Ni after treatment at 600 °C is tested, as displayed in Fig. S6.† The areal capacity is very low, demonstrating the negligible capacity contribution of F–Ni. Therefore, the loading of active material on the electrode can be calculated by the mass difference between the electrode with and without addition of Se, as illustrated by eqn (S1).† The active material loading of the Ni3Se2 electrode at 600 °C is about 4 mg cm−2. In order to evaluate the optimal cycle stability for SIBs, the capacity retention of the three electrodes are compared in Fig. S7.† It is obvious that the electrode obtained at 600 °C has the best cycle stability. It is not appropriate to directly compare the specific capacity of the electrodes because of the different theoretical capacities of the active materials (the theoretical capacity of NiSe is 388 mA h g−1 while it is 320 mA h g−1 for Ni3Se2). For the electrode at 500 °C, the cycle capacities are stable in the initial cycles. However, after 35 cycles, the capacity declines sharply, indicating full destruction of the electrode structure. This should be ascribed to the unstable electrode surface due to an excessive side reaction between the electrolyte and the electrode. As proved by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm in Fig. S8,† it is clear that the electrode at 500 °C possesses a higher BET surface area (22.7 m2 g−1) than that at 600 °C (14.9 m2 g−1). It is well known that the irreversible formation of a solid electrolyte interface film (SEI) happens on the interface of the electrode and the electrolyte. In addition, the NiSe phase is also not very suitable for a stable electrode structure compared with Ni3Se2. The SEM images of the electrode at 500 °C after cycling have been obtained, as shown in Fig. S9.† Obviously, the nanorod arrays are almost destroyed after cycling and the nanoparticles are agglomerative, which largely decreases the ion and electron transfer of the electrode. The performance of the electrode at 700 °C is very inferior, mainly because of the destruction of the nanorod structure. Therefore, the 3DHNA acquired at 600 °C is the best choice as the anode for SIBs because of its optimal composition and morphology.\nIn order to explore the morphology of optimal 3DHNA in-depth, transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are recorded in Fig. 1c. Obviously, the nanorods are monolithic but not compact. Moreover, the surface of the nanorod is lumpy with many nano-protuberances attached. The special morphology balances the charge transfer and irreversible side reaction derived from SEI formation, contributing to an excellent electrochemical performance. Because of the fusion of the nanorods, the contact between the electrode and the electrolyte decreases, which largely suppresses the side reaction on the electrode surface, as proved by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm in Fig. S8.† On the other hand, because of the special evolution process described above, the nanorods should not be too compact to infiltrate the electrolyte. In addition, many protuberances on the surface are still preserved to provide a channel for charge transfer. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern in the insert in Fig. 1d (corresponding to the red box in Fig. 1c), a distinct crystal lattice with a spacing of 0.22 nm is observed in these protuberances, which are ascribed to the (202) crystal plane of Ni3Se2. In addition, the (202) crystal lattice is also discovered in the body of the nanorod. An X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) spectrum is employed to further evaluate the surface composition. As shown in Table S1,† the elements of Ni and Se are detected with an atom ratio of more than the 3:2 of Ni3Se2, resulting from the F–Ni substrate. In addition, the O element exists, which is due to the surface oxidation of the 3DHNA electrode and an oxide layer on the F–Ni. From the Ni 2p XPS result in Fig. 1e, Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 appearing at 860.4 and 879.8 eV are matched well with Ni3Se2, whereas the peaks at lower binding energies of 854.5 and 872.3 eV are attributed to metal Ni 2p in F–Ni. As for the Se spectrum in Fig. 1f, only peaks corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 in Ni3Se2 are discovered. Ni3Se2 undergoes a lower volume change during cycling compared with NiSe. Therefore, the structural stress is largely decreased, contributing to excellent cycle stability.\nTo test the storage performance for SIBs, Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA serves as the electrode to assemble the coin cell. The electrochemical process is first investigated by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.001–3 V, as shown in Fig. 2a. Clearly, only a pair of redox peaks occur in the first cycle, demonstrating a simple one-step reversible reaction process. The obvious cathodic peak at 0.6 V is attributed to the conversion reaction occurring between metal selenide and Na+ by analogy with metal sulfide. As a result, ultrafine Ni nanoparticles are uniformly distributed into the Na2Se matrix. In the anodic scan, the sharp peak located at 1.69 V corresponds to reversible recovery of Ni3Se2. Obviously, the charge capacity undergoes some loss because of the formation of irreversible SEI film. For the second cycle, the pair of redox peaks still exist but with some shift. The reduction peak obviously shifts onwards to 1.1 V while the oxidation peak shows an inappreciable change, indicating decreased electrochemical polarization. This is consistent with the reaction process in which Ni3Se2 is turned into ultrafine nanocrystals after the first activation process. The CV profiles for the following four cycles overlap well with each other, suggesting suppressed polarization and excellent reversibility for sodium storage after the initial cycle. Fig. S10† exhibits the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at different cycles. The electrochemical plateaus are completely consistent with the CV results. Moreover, the charge–discharge plateaus are coincident with each other. Even after 100 cycles, the plateaus are still well maintained, further demonstrating superior reversibility.\nIn order to explore the reaction mechanism in depth, ex situ HRTEM images of the electrode in different charge–discharge states are investigated in Fig. 3. After the first full sodiation reaction, Ni3Se2 is fully reduced into Ni nanoparticles (marked by the circles in Fig. 3a) embedded into the Na2Se matrix. The large magnification of the circle inserted in Fig. 3a clearly exhibits the (111) crystal plane of metal Ni. When the cell finishes the charge process, the interplanar spacing of 0.24 nm corresponding to the (003) plane of Ni3Se2 can be discovered in Fig. 3b, suggesting the recovery of the Ni3Se2 phase. In order to illustrate the same reaction process as the first cycle in subsequent cycles, the conversion product and local structure after the second cycle are detected in Fig. 3c and d. As a result, the conversion reaction is also reversible between Ni nanoparticles and Ni3Se2. The one-step reversible conversion reaction promises excellent stability for sodium storage in the overall electrochemical reaction process. The reversible redox reaction process is expressed by eqn (1) and (2):\nThe rate performance is evaluated, with current densities increasing stepwise from 50 to 1000 mA g−1. As displayed in Fig. S11a,† the new material provides excellent charge capacities of 456.6, 368.6, 332.7, 289.7, 266.1, 237.2, and 218.0 mA h g−1 at current densities of 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 800, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Moreover, the Cs recovers to 304.1 mA h g−1 when the current density returns to 200 mA g−1, indicating a stable electrode structure and reversibility. It is worth mentioning that the loading of active material on the current collector is 4 mg cm−2, much higher than those of previously reported metal selenides. The outstanding rate capacities on the condition of high active material loading are attributed to the special 3DHNA structure. The primary 3D NA structure avoids a thick film on the electrode impeding electrolyte immersion. Moreover, the secondary 3D nanorod morphology further increases the contact area of the electrode and electrolyte. As exhibited in Fig. 2b, the rate performance based on Ca is evaluated. A high reversible capacity of 1.83 mA h cm−2 is obtained at 0.2 mA cm−2. Even increasing the current density to 4 mA cm−2, the electrode still delivers a capacity of 0.87 mA h cm−2. By connecting the Ni3Se2 cell, a small LED panel with the word “SIB” is lit. The charge–discharge curves at different current densities are displayed in Fig. S12a.† The plateaus are apparent and consistent with the CV results even when the current density is increased to 4 mA cm−2, explaining the excellent rate capacities. The rate performance outdistances other metal selenides reported in the literature, as shown in Fig. S13.† In most reports, Ca is lower than 0.5 mA h cm−2 because of a low active material fraction and loading. The cycle performance is also measured to illustrate the structural stability of the electrode. As displayed in Fig. S11b,† the first reversible capacity reaches 409.4 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 65% at 50 mA g−1. After 100 cycles, a steady capacity of 388.06 mA h g−1 is still retained, ensuring excellent capacity retention of up to 95% (Fig. S11c†). The capacity is slightly higher than the theoretical capacity of Ni3Se2 (320 mA h g−1), which may stem from slight electric double layer capacitive interface storage and the reversible growth of a polymeric/gel-like film derived from catalytically enhanced electrolyte reduction. At a high current density of 200 mA g−1, the cell still delivers a reversible capacity of 237.9 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. S11d†). The corresponding Ca for different cycles are exhibited in Fig. 2c. Even after 100 cycles, a superior Ca of 1.55 mA h cm−2 is still maintained. The desirable electrochemical performance accounts for the special structural design of the electrode, as graphically illustrated by Fig. 2d. First, in a macro context, 3D NA directly grown on F–Ni provide abundant channels for electron/ion transfer. In addition, the 3D nanorod secondary structure obtained by the decomposition–fusion process further offers enriched channels for Na+ migration, not only between the protuberances but also in the inside of the nanorod. This guarantees a full electrochemical reaction for excellent cycle and rate capacities. Thirdly, the fusion of nanorods reduces the contact of the electrode with the electrolyte to some extent and lessens the SEI formation on the electrode surface, guaranteeing a stable electrode structure and excellent reversibility. Finally, the intrinsically low volume change of Ni3Se2 prevents electrode fracture during cycling. The SEM image of the electrode after cycling is tested to further explain the structural stability, as displayed in Fig. S14.† Obviously, the NA structure is still well retained even though the nanorod becomes tougher and the diameter is larger. Therefore, this new-type material of Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA has great potential for SIBs due to the achievement of a high Ca. To gain an insight into the electrochemical kinetics of the electrode for sodium storage, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the cell before and after cycling are conducted in Fig. S12b.† The semicircle in the high-to-medium frequency region is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Obviously, Rct shows a significant decrease after cycling, in agreement with the CV and charge–discharge curves. This indicates a fruitful electrochemical reaction after the first cycle.\nDespite plentiful attempts and the successful achievement of excellent performance of SIBs in recent years, unfortunately, most of these attempts pay attention only to the high specific capacity and long cycle life based on the mass of active material. It is time to put a more concentrated focus on the requirements for practical battery application. Here, the important parameters of this work which are closely related to practical application are compared with other similar state-of-the-art work in the literature referring to metal selenides, as symbolically exhibited in Fig. 4. Obviously, for most work, the fraction of active material is not 100% because of conductive carbon and binder additive. The addition of conductive carbon is an important pathway to improve the capacity and cycle stability of the active material. Moreover, the electrode loading is always lower than 1.2 mg cm−2. It is acknowledged that the thinner the coating layer, the better the cell performance. However, the double low electrode parameters improve the capacity at the expense of the practical Ca. As a result, the Ca in these reports are lower than 0.8 mA h cm−2. On the contrary, the electrode in this work possesses 100% content of active material and a high loading of 4 mg cm−2. The high Ca of 1.55 mA h cm−2 is thus delivered. These results indicate the potential of an Ni3Se2 electrode with optimal 3DHNA for practical application of SIBs.\nIn summary, Ni3Se2 with optimal 3DHNA were directly grown on F–Ni to serve as the anodes for high-areal-capacity SIBs free of carbon or binder. By a simple solvothermal reaction, NiSe NA with a smooth nanorod surface were vertically attached on 3D F–Ni to form an integrated electrode. The 3D NA ensures quick electron/ion transfer even at high electrode loading. Then, the nanorod was further roughened by a decomposition–fusion process to obtain an optimal secondary 3D structure. Through this special process, a nanorod composed of consecutive core and rough surfaces with many protuberances attached was acquired. This design increases the electrochemical reaction sites of NA because Na+ can transfer not only between the protuberances but also in the inside of the nanorod. In addition, to some extent, the repeat fusion of the nanorod decreases the irreversible side reaction between the electrode and electrolyte, contributing to a stable electrode interface and electrochemical reversibility. Moreover, along with the process, NiSe was transformed into Ni3Se2. The intrinsic low volume change in Ni3Se2 compared with NiSe favors the structural stability of the electrode during cycling. The systematic investigation of the mechanism showed an effective one-step reversible conversion reaction, guaranteeing stable electrochemical properties. As a result, the high reversible capacity of 1.55 mA h cm−2 was retained after 100 cycles at 0.2 mA cm−2 with excellent capacity retention of up to 95%. Even at a high current density of 4 mA cm−2, the cell still delivered a capacity of 0.87 mA h cm−2. This result is the most outstanding among the relevant reports about metal selenides. From a practical consideration, the electrode shows the most balanced performance with respect to various important parameters compared with other metal selenides. Therefore, this work proposes an effective design pathway for a 3DHNA Ni3Se2 electrode free of carbon or binder for high-areal-capacity SIBs.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The development of large-scale energy storage technologies is one of the critical factors for the widespread application of renewable energies due to their intermittency in time and space. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as ideal technologies for large-scale energy storage because of the abundant and inexpensive sodium resources. The exploration of suitable electrode materials, especially the anode materials, is a critical issue for the application of SIBs. Extensive investigations into anode materials have focused on carbonaceous materials and alloy materials, such as hard carbon, graphene sheets, hard–soft composite carbon, and Si–Sb alloy. Among them, hard carbon is the most promising candidate, since it was first reported by Dahn's group in 2000. In the early times, hard carbon showed a low reversible capacity with low initial coulombic efficiency. Recent efforts have greatly enhanced its reversible capacity and cycling stability. Nevertheless, challenges, such as high-cost and poor rate capability, still exist and hinder its practical application in SIBs. Nano-sized hard carbons are reported to possess excellent electrochemical performance, owing to the sufficient contact between the electrolyte and electrode and short Na+ ion diffusion path. However, the large surface area causes serious side reactions with the electrolyte, which leads to a low Coulombic efficiency and capacity decay. On the other hand, micro hard carbon materials with lower surface areas often show high initial Coulombic efficiency, but the long Na+ ion diffusion path results in a low rate performance. To incorporate the advantages of both nano- and micro-size materials, a micro-nano structure was proposed as an effective strategy.\nThree different sodium storage processes in hard carbon have been proposed: adsorption on the surface-active sites, intercalation into graphitic layers, and filling into nanopores. However, there is still a lack of consensus on the assignment of each voltage region to the corresponding sodium storage modes and the unclear mechanism results in difficultly in tuning the electrochemical behavior of hard carbon. Dahn et al. proposed a two-step mechanism. The slope region was ascribed to interlayer intercalation, while the plateau below 0.1 V was due to Na+ filling into nanopores. Ji and Cao et al. proposed an adsorption–insertion mechanism, in which the sloping part in the voltage profile was ascribed to sodium adsorption on the defect sites and the low-voltage plateau was attributed to sodium intercalation into the graphitic layers. Recently, Grey et al. found that the sodium inserted in the slope range is ionic in nature, which corresponds to ions adsorbing onto near defects, and at the plateau voltage, the ions gradually become more metallic and form quasi-metallic sodium clusters in an angstrom level, which is different from the bulk metallic sodium. It can be clearly seen that the main disagreement of the sodium storage mechanism is whether the low-voltage plateau belongs to metallic sodium formation or sodium intercalation into the graphitic layers.\nHerein, the biomass of kapok fibers with natural hollow tube structures was selected as a precursor to prepare hard carbon with a micro-nano structure through a two-step pyrolysis method at 1200 °C (1200HCMNT) or 1400 °C (1400HCMNT), which have been suggested as the most suitable carbonizing temperatures. As expected, the carbonized products exhibited an excellent sodium storage performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency, high reversible capacity, and excellent rate capability. To further understand the sodium storage mechanisms in the hard carbon materials, multiple characterization tools, such as galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and the thermal analysis technique, were applied to investigate the sodium insertion/extraction process.\nThe kapok fibers show a hollow type structure with a diameter of 15–20 μm and a wall thickness of 0.8–1 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†). During the carbonization, the kapok fibers underwent aromatization, polycondensation, and the formation of short graphite layers. The morphology remains well with merely a shrink in the diameter of 5–10 μm and wall thickness of about 200 nm (Fig. 1a). Compared to bulk hard carbon, the micron tube structure is considered to facilitate liquid electrolyte diffusion and give little contribution to total special surface area. Moreover, nano-sized wall thickness can reduce the solid-state diffusion length for Na+. Fig. 1b shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms for the HCMNTs. With increasing carbonization temperature, the specific surface area of the HCMNTs decreases gradually, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The small specific surface area is expected to reduce the SEI formation and improve the initial Coulombic efficiency. The element species and distribution of 1400HCMNT obtained from the XPS and EDS results are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Compared to other biomass-derived carbons, the HCMNTs show high purity of carbon with only traces of Si and Al. The C1s peak of 1400HCMNT (Fig. S2, ESI†) is deconvoluted into a major peak of C–C (sp2) at 284.8 eV and three weak peaks of C–C (sp) at 285.2 eV, C–O at 286.2 eV, and CO at 288.3 eV, which indicates the high carbon-content. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1c) of both samples present a highly disordered nature. Two broad diffraction peaks of the (002) and (100) planes can be attributed to the presence of small graphene-like layers. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the interlayer spacing (d002) of HCMNTs is in the range of 0.38–0.39 nm, which is larger than that of graphite (0.335 nm). The Lc values, calculated via the Scherrer equation using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) information of the (002) plane, decrease with the increase of carbonization temperature. The Raman spectra (Fig. 1d) of both the carbonized samples exhibit two peaks of the D band (the defect-induced band) at 1327 cm−1 and G band (the crystalline graphite band) at 1587 cm−1. Along with the increase of the carbonization temperature, the relative integrated intensity ID/IG ratios increase, and the crystallite size La values decrease (Table S1, ESI†), indicating the transformation of interior defect concentration and the crystals shrink for the (100) direction at higher carbonization temperatures. The microstructure analysis is further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1e and f, both samples display non-graphitized structure. A gradual development of local graphitic structure and diffraction rings are observed in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns with increasing treatment temperatures.\nGalvanostatic discharge–charge experiments were carried out to evaluate the sodium storage behavior of the HCMNT samples. Electrolyte of NaClO4 or NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 w/w) is assessed, as shown in Fig. S3 and Note S1 (ESI†). Finally, 1 M NaClO4 in EC/DMC was used in further research, for higher coulombic efficiency and better cycling performance. As shown in Fig. 2a, the two HCMNT samples show similar sodium storage behaviors with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of ∼80%, attributed to the low specific surface areas. The charge–discharge profiles exhibit two distinct parts: slope areas above 0.1 V and a plateau region around 0–0.1 V, indicating two different sodium storage mechanisms, which is also verified by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results (Fig. S4, ESI†). The reversible capacity of 1400HCMNT is 292.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, much higher than that of the 1200HCMNT (228 mA h g−1). The higher capacity of 1400HCMNT may benefit from the lower specific surface area and more closing pores, resulting from the higher treatment temperature. The HCMNTs possess excellent rate capability, because of the uniform hollow micro-nano structure with shorter diffusion distance of the Na-ion and better infiltration of electrolyte (Fig. 2b). 1400HCMNT shows better rate performance with a reversible specific capacity of 250, 224, and 167 mA h g−1 at the current rate of 0.5, 1, and 2C, respectively. To understand the capacity decline at high rates, discharge curves and the slope/plateau region contribution of 1400HCMNT at different current densities are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). With increasing charge–discharge rates, the plateau capacity declines rapidly and the slope capacity is well preserved. Compared with the previously reported hard carbon materials, 1400HCMNT exhibits a comparable rate performance with nanostructure materials, such as hollow carbon nanowires synthesized by hollow polyaniline nanowires (Fig. S7, ESI†). 1400HCMNT reveals a superior capacity retention ratio, among the biomass-based hard carbon materials. Fig. 2c shows the cycling performance of HCMNTs. After 200 cycles, the capacity retentions are higher than 93%, which is attributed to the stable micro-nano structure. The electrochemical properties in a full cell were also tested with Na2MnFe(CN)6 as the cathode. However, the performance still needs to be further improved (Fig. S8, and Note S2, ESI†).\nTo understand the sodium storage behavior in HCMNTs, especially the contribution at the low-voltage plateau, XPS, EPR, Raman, HR-TEM, and DSC measurements were applied for the samples at different states. Fig. 3a shows the quasi-open circuit voltage (Q-OCV) plots of the 1200HCMNT and 1400HCMNT. There is no noticeable difference for the low-voltage plateau region, indicating that the sodium storage mechanism at the low-voltage plateau is independent of the treatment temperature.\nFig. 3b shows the Na 1s XPS spectra for the 1400HCMNT at different states. A small broad peak in the Na 1s spectrum of the pristine electrode is contributed by the CMC binder (Na+ at 1071.2 eV). When the electrode was discharged to 0.1 V, a strong peak ascribed to the ionic sodium ions (1071.2 eV) can be observed, which is suggestive of the solid electrode interface (SEI) components (such as Na2CO3, NaC2H3O2, NaClO3 and NaCl, with the significant Na and Cl signals in the EDS mapping, Fig. S10 and Note S3, ESI†) and adsorbed sodium ions. When discharged to 0 V, the Na 1s peak shifts to a higher binding energy (1071.8 eV) and approaches the bond energy of sodium metal, suggesting the formation of metallic sodium. To further confirm the formation of metallic sodium, EPR, a powerful technique to detect unpaired electrons, was applied. For comparison, the EPR spectra of the 1400HCMNT electrode after plating sodium metal (Fig. S11, ESI†) were also collected (Fig. 3c), which contain two parts: a symmetrical broad line and an asymmetrical narrow peak. The broad line, which fits the Lorentz line shape and follows Curie magnetism, belongs to the Carbon center free radicals and delocalized electrons, which can be ascribed to the complex components of the SEI films. The narrow peak centred at the g-value of 2.002, conforms to the Dysonian asymmetry shape in the small line asymmetry parameter A/|B| (the absolute ratio of the maximum to the minimum signal). It suggested the existence of a metallic bond, as observed in lithium-ion batteries, demonstrating the formation of metallic sodium. The pristine 1400HCMNT electrode has no obvious signal in the EPR spectra except a little structural defect signal, since the highly pure carbon shows no carbon-center free radical and delocalized electron. After being discharged to 0.1 V, the EPR spectra are dominated by a symmetrical broad peak. However, when discharged to 0 V, an obvious narrow peak centred at g = 2.002 can be observed, demonstrating the formation of metallic sodium. Compared to the spectra of bulk sodium metal, the sharp peak belonging to the electrochemically formed metallic sodium shows a higher g-value, which could be attributed to the small size of metallic sodium, like metallic sodium clusters reported by K. Gotoh and C. Grey et al. Further TEM and Raman characterizations also verify that no prominent insertion into the graphitic layers was observed, as discussed in detail in the ESI† (Fig. S12, S13 and Table S3, ESI†). The 1200HCMNT shows a similar sodium storage mechanism to 1400HCMNT, so only the mechanism studies on 1400HCMNT are shown in the manuscript. More results of 1200HCMNT are shown in Note S4 in the ESI.†\nThese results and analyses demonstrate that the sodiation process can be divided into ionic state and metallic state storage (Fig. 4). Above 0.1 V (slope region), sodium is stored in the hard carbon in the ionic state, such as adsorbing on the defects or surface of the graphene sheets. At the low voltage range plateau, metallic sodium clusters or domains form in the nanopores of hard carbon. The aforementioned EPR results and previously reported NMR results confirmed the formation of metallic sodium in hard carbon after being discharged to 0 V. However, metallic sodium was barely detected by other characterization techniques, such as XRD or Raman. This may result from the small size of metallic sodium. The DSC measurements in the temperature range of −20 to 200 °C under Argon flow with samples at different sodium storage voltages were employed. As shown in Fig. 3d, only a small exothermic peak for PTFE binder at 23 °C can be seen in the DSC profile of the pristine electrode, indicating the thermal stability of the carbon material and binder. The melting phenomena can be easily detected in the hard carbon with plating sodium at 98 °C. For the samples discharged to 0.1 and 0 V, no peak at ∼98 °C can be observed. However, the two samples experienced a low voltage plateau (the sample discharged to 0 V and the hard carbon with plating sodium) exhibiting an endothermic peak at around 2 °C, which could be ascribed to the melting of metallic sodium clusters. The Kelvin equation suggested that the melting point of a metal would greatly decrease with the reduction in particle size. Therefore, the electrochemically formed metallic sodium clusters or domains in the hard carbon may be in a quasi-liquid state at room-temperature. It can be well explained that the electrochemically formed metallic sodium is hardly detected by crystallographic characterization techniques.\nIn summary, HCMNTs with a micro-nano structure were synthesized from hollow Kapok fibers. The 1400HCMNT sample delivers high reversible capacity, high initial coulombic efficiency, and excellent rate performance. The nano-sized tube walls bring good infiltration of electrolyte, shorten the diffusion distance of sodium-ions, and enhance the rate capacity of the HCMNTs. Combining EPR with thermal analysis, the sodium storage mechanisms in the HCMNT were also investigated. Sodium is stored in the hard carbon in the ionic state in the slope region and metallic sodium state in the low-voltage plateau. Moreover, the physical state of metallic sodium in the hard carbon could be quasi-liquid at room temperature.

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 XRD analysis\nSamples of pure copper oxide and composites of copper and gallium oxides containing 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% of gallium precursor (i.e., Ga(NO3)3·xH2O), calculated with respect to copper precursor (i.e., CuSO4·5H2O) weight, were structurally analysed by XRD. The obtained patterns of CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 are shown in Fig. 1. The phases of the synthesized samples matched well with the standards in the ICSD database. Through phase confirmation, it has been ascertained that there are four oxide phases of Cu and Ga found in the synthesized composites. They are CuO (copper oxide), copper gallium oxide (CuGa2O4), paramelaconite (Cu4O3) and gallium oxide (β-Ga2O3), which matched well with the ICSD standard patterns with reference numbers 01-080-1268, 00-044-0183, 01-083-1665 and 01-087-1901, and have monoclinic (space group: C2/c), cubic (space group: Fd3m), tetragonal (space group: I41/amd) and monoclinic (space group: C2/m) structures, respectively. CGO-0 showed diffraction peaks corresponding to CuO alone, whereas when the gallium precursor was introduced at 5 wt%, CGO-5 showed peaks for CuO and CuGa2O4. In addition to these two phases, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 also showed peaks for the Cu4O3 phase, and CGO-20 exhibited peaks corresponding to Ga2O3 in addition to the prior mentioned oxide phases. The XRD patterns of all samples showed no traces of additional phases to the prior mentioned ones. The content of each phase was calculated as a percentage in terms of the ratio of the integral intensity of each phase over the sum of the integral intensities of all phases present in the sample, as reported in Table 1. The percentage of CuO phase was found to be 100%, 83.90%, 73.08%, 49.18% and 38.58% in CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. CGO-5 contained 16.10% CuGa2O4, whereas the CuGa2O4 content was found to be 22.90%, 27.25% and 6.59% in CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The Cu4O3 content was estimated to be 4.02%, 23.57% and 39.25% in CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The Ga2O3 phase has been found only in CGO-20, and its content has been found to be 15.59%. The presence of CuO decreased gradually with increasing Ga content from CGO-0 to CGO-20. Ga precipitated in the form of CuGa2O4 in CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, whereas in CGO-20, there is formation of Ga2O3 in addition to the CuGa2O4 phase, which shows that the abundance of Ga content in CGO-20 perturbed the equilibrium of CuGa2O4 phase formation which led to a favourable phase equilibrium for Ga2O3 and so lower probability for the formation of CuGa2O4. With an increase in Ga loading from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, Cu4O3 formation became more prominent. Cu4O3 started appearing in CGO-10 and the amount increased with Ga loading until CGO-20. As β-Ga2O3 is known to be a relatively electrochemically inactive phase, CGO-20 is speculated to show poor electrochemical anodic performance among all the samples owing to its relatively greater content of Ga2O3. It has been proved that both CuO and Cu4O3 are electrochemically active materials, and thus the presence of both of these phases may enhance the storage capability of the prepared composites. Thus, the presence of the novel phase CuGa2O4 plays a vital role in controlling the anodic activity of the material. It is expected that the CuGa2O4 phase is responsible for enhancing the anode material stability by means of buffering the structural collapse of the material that happens during electrochemical cycling. Based on this assumption, it is expected that the sodium-ion storage capability of CGO-5, CGO-10 and CGO-15 may be better than that of CGO-0 and CGO-20, owing to the CuGa2O4 content in them. Further, Cu4O3 was investigated as an anode material for LIBs and was shown to exhibit superior rate performance and lower polarization owing to its lower impedance than CuO. Thus, the collective and optimized proportional presence of the CuO, CuGa2O4 and Cu4O3 phases in the composites is expected to affect the electrochemical performance of the composites. The contribution of instrumental error to the broadening of the peaks is corrected by following eqn (1), where the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak profile of a Si standard is used for calibration purposes. In eqn (1),Lobserved denotes the FWHM of the obtained XRD pattern, Linstrument is the FWHM of the standard reference peak profile, and Lhkl is the FWHM of the peak corresponding to the (hkl) crystalline plane after instrumental correction. The crystallite size and micro strain of each phase in each sample are found by following the Williamson–Hall (W–H) method (Fig. 2) in which line broadening in XRD is assumed to be the result of a cumulative effect of finite crystallite size and micro strain. Thus, in this analysis these two effects on peak broadening are de-convoluted and the final equation is given in eqn (2), where Lhkl represents the FWHM of the (hkl) plane, θhkl is the Bragg diffraction angle corresponding to the (hkl) peak orientation, k denotes the shape factor, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, ε is the strain and D denotes the crystallite size. The W–H analytical method is considered to be an improved technique relative to Scherrer’s method of analysis, as the strain contribution to peak broadening is neglected in Scherrer’s equation. The corresponding equation for the Scherrer method is given in eqn (3). In eqn (3), all variables have their usual meaning as described earlier. The crystallite sizes and micro strain values of the various chemical phases that are present in all samples under investigation are tabulated and shown in Table 1. Negative values of micro strain represent compressive strain whereas positive values indicate tensile strain.\nThe lattice parameters of the unit cells corresponding to different phases were obtained by refining and fitting the XRD peaks of the corresponding phases, and the obtained values are shown in Table 1. It can be found from Table 1 that the CuO phase in CGO-0 showed a crystallite size of 15.69 nm, which is its lowest size among all the other samples and is accompanied by a compressive micro strain of 2.14 × 10−3. The CuO phase showed crystallite sizes of 16.89, 81.62, 42.32 and 40.93 nm in CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The crystallite sizes of CuGa2O4 in CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 are found to be 7.04, 50.41, 13.43 and 5.50 nm, respectively. The crystallite sizes of Cu4O3 are found to be 2.60, 18.04 and 11.77 nm in CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. Ga2O3, which existed only in CGO-20, was found to exhibit a crystallite size of 58.85 nm.\nNaing et al. and Liao et al. showed that grain size enormously affects the electrochemical behavior of metal alloys. It has been proved that the coarser the crystallite, the better the rate performance, owing to larger grain boundary areas that allow diffusion of electrolyte ions through them, and finer crystallites in anode materials increase the cycle life, as they resist flow of electrolyte ions due to their narrower grain boundaries. As mentioned earlier, CuO and Cu4O3 are electrochemically active materials, whereas the presence of Ga either in the form of a ternary oxide, CuGa2O4, or as a binary oxide, Ga2O3, worsens the electrochemical performance due to the redox inactive behavior of Ga. However, the presence of Ga with Cu, i.e. CuGa2O4, in the anode material may increase the cycle life by providing a buffering effect against structural collapse or volume expansions that take place in the active matrix during charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, Cu4O3 has been proved to exhibit superior rate performance and capacity retention over CuO and Cu2O. Thus, considering the above factors and the crystallite sizes obtained from XRD, it can be assumed that the large crystallite size of CuO in CGO-10 can lead to an improvement in rate performance, but may reduce the cycle life due to the formation of a greater quantity of residual phases. But, the presence of an inactive phase, i.e. CuGa2O4, with relatively larger crystallite size, and the presence of Cu4O3 with relatively finer crystallite size may increase the cycle life of the CGO-10 anode material among all the samples. Although CGO-10 is expected to show superior rate performance and cycle stability, CGO-5, CGO-10 and CGO-15 are also expected to show enhanced anodic performance compared to CGO-0. CGO-20, owing to the presence of inactive Ga2O3, may exhibit relatively lower electrochemical performance.\n\n3.2 Morphological studies\nMorphological observations are carried out through SEM micrographs as shown in Fig. 3. It has been observed that CGO-0 showed a beach stone-like morphology with irregular particle shapes. It is clear from Fig. 3 that introduction of gallium into the system promoted the precipitation of Ga phases on top of the CuO particles observed in Fig. 3a. This accumulation of secondary phases is clearly visible in the figure as tiny particles covering the CuO particles, and the coverage of the beach stone-like particles by powder-like particles increased from CGO-5 to CGO-20. In CGO-15 and CGO-20, the Ga phases became dominant and covered almost all of the CuO particles, and the CuO particles became almost invisible under microscopic scanning. The aspect ratios of the CuO particles in all samples are calculated as the ratio between the length of the longest dimension (along the length) of the particle to the diameter along the shortest dimension (along the breadth), as the particles are irregular in shape. The calculated average aspect ratios for all samples are given in Table 2. The aspect ratios of the particles varied irregularly from sample-to-sample and can be correlated with the formation of different binary and ternary oxides of Cu and Ga (CuGa2O4, Cu4O3) and the strain associated with their formation. It is evident that particles with lower dimensions can show relatively enhanced electrochemical performance, and thus it can be presumed that CGO-10, owing to its lower aspect ratio, may exhibit better rate performance.\nFig. 4 shows elemental analyses of the samples carried out through EDAX incorporated in the SEM. The atomic% and weight% of Cu, Ga and O are in accordance with the proportions of Cu and Ga precursors added. The Ga content increased with increasing Ga precursor wt%. Ga wt% in CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20 are found to be 0 wt%, 7.2 wt%, 15.2 wt%, 22.7 wt% and 31.9 wt%, respectively. It can be said from these results that Ga incorporation into the base material was successfully carried out, and the deviation of these values from the added wt% of Ga is owing to the fact that the added wt% is based on the amounts of precursor salts used, not on the actual Ga content.\nTEM micrographs of CGO-10 are shown in Fig. 5. These micrographs are consistent with those from SEM analysis. Fig. 5a clearly depicts small particles of Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 on top of bigger particles of CuO. Fig. 5b is a magnified portion of the smaller particle aggregates, and their particle sizes varied in the range of 30–85 nm. An HRTEM image and the SAED pattern of CGO-10 are shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. Lattice fringes are clearly observed in CGO-10, in which the (220) diffraction planes corresponding to Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 have d-spacings of 0.206 and 0.293 nm, respectively. Well defined bright spots formed into rings are observed in the SAED pattern, which shows that these samples are polycrystalline and the grains are monocrystalline. In the SAED pattern of CGO-10, the spots designated as a, b and c correspond to the CuO, CuGa2O4 and Cu4O3 phases and were assigned to the (12), (220) and (200) planes with d-spacings of 0.196, 0.293 and 0.290 nm, respectively. All the d-spacing values found from the SAED pattern of CGO-10 are in good agreement with those found from the corresponding XRD pattern.\n\n3.3 BET analysis\nThe surface area of CGO-10 was obtained from BET N2 adsorption–desorption studies. The N2 adsorption–desorption profiles of CGO-10 are shown in Fig. 6a, and the corresponding pore size distribution is shown in Fig. 6b. As shown in Fig. 6a, CGO-10 showed a type-III isotherm for both the adsorption and desorption processes with an H3 type hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification. H3 type hysteresis is a characteristic of meso sized pores, and the narrow loop appeared with a lower limit of p/p0 = 0.16 up to p/p0 = 0.94, exhibiting the dominance of mesoporosity in the sample. Also, a short and narrow loop appeared at high relative pressures between p/p0 = 0.94 and p/p0 = 0.99, which corresponds to a small amount of nearly macro sized pores. Fig. 6b shows the pore volume distribution as a function of pore width. The surface area of CGO-10 has been obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption profile by following the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) method, and the value was found to be 11.5171 m2 g−1. The average pore diameter was obtained by employing the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) analytical method on the desorption branch, and the pore diameter was found to be 5.2015 nm. The formation of pores on the particle surface may be due to the liberation of water and hydroxyl ions during calcination.\n\n3.4 XPS analysis\nInvestigations of the chemical bonding states of different elements in the CGO-10 sample are carried out through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectrum showed the presence of Cu, Ga and O in the sample (Fig. 7a). The XPS peaks of the elements mentioned above were de-convoluted using the Gaussian fitting function. The Cu-2p (Fig. 7b) scan exhibited four peaks among which two are satellite peaks and designated as S-1 and S-2 centred at 943.6 eV and 963.7 eV, respectively. The Cu-2p scan also showed two strong photoelectron emissions de-convoluted at 935.4 eV and 955.3 eV, corresponding to the Cu-2p3/2 and Cu-2p1/2 electronic levels, respectively. These are the characteristic peaks of Cu(II), and the Cu2+ oxidized charge state in CuGa2O4 exhibited a spin–orbit splitting energy separation of 19.9 eV which matched the previously reported values well. The Ga-2p scan showed two peaks centred at 1118.18 eV and 1145.08 eV corresponding to Ga-2p3/2 and Ga-2p1/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7c, with an energy separation of 26.9 eV which matched the previously reported value well. The Ga-3d scan shown in Fig. 7d exhibits a peak at around 20.08 eV corresponding to Ga-3d5/2. The O-1s XPS scan is shown in Fig. 7e and has two de-convoluted peaks, one centered at 530.2 eV that corresponds to metal–oxygen bonding, and the other one at 531.6 eV, corresponding to surface absorbed O2. The slight shift of the O-1s peak towards higher binding energy than the reported values may be due to an interaction between the binary and ternary oxide phases present in the sample. The observation of all the above described peaks in the sample gives evidence for the presence of CuO and CuGa2O4 in CGO-10.\n\n3.5 Charge/discharge studies\nIn order to investigate the sodium storage behaviour of the CGO composites we examined the galvanostatic charge/discharge behaviour at 0.07 A g−1 between the potential limits 0.01 and 3 V. Fig. 8a presents the first charge/discharge curves of the CGO composites in which the composites delivered charge capacities of 624, 640, 661, 647 and 618 mA h g−1 for CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively. The charge/discharge profiles of the composites vary from that of pristine CuO which indicates that Cu4O3 also participated in the electrochemical reaction of CuO for sodium-ion storage. It is interesting to note that though the charge/discharge profiles of CGO-10 and CGO-15 are identical, likewise the profiles of CGO-5 and CGO-20, all deviate from that of pristine CuO. The deviation is due to the formation of Cu4O3, CuGa2O4 and Ga2O3 phases in the composites. However, the content of the phases varied when the amount of Ga in the composites was increased from 5 to 20 wt%. Pristine CuO exhibited broad plateaus at around 0.82–0.5 V and 1.7–2.1 V in the discharge and charge curves, respectively. The broad plateau in the discharge curve represents the multiple reduction processes involved in solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the electrode surface: intermediate CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2 phase formation, generation of the Cu2O phase and the decomposition of Cu2O to Cu and Na2O. Similarly, the broad plateau in the charge profile indicates the reverse reaction of the discharge process. The composites exhibit three plateaus, viz. 0.3–0.14, 0.8–0.4 and 1.4–0.9 V in the discharge curve and three plateaus, viz. 0.4–0.78, 0.9–1.6 and 1.7–2.7 V in the charge curve. The three reduction plateaus of the composites are due to the intermediate phase formation of CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2 and SEI film formation, reduction of CuO to Cu2O and further conversion of Cu2O to Cu. The oxidation peaks correspond to the decomposition of the SEI film, the oxidation process of Cu to Cu2O and further oxidation of Cu2O to CuO. The three plateaus in the charge and discharge profiles are obtained at slightly different potentials for all the composites, which can be attributed to the variation in content of the Cu4O3, CuGa2O4 and Ga2O3 phases in different composites. The contents of the electrochemically active Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 phases are higher in CGO-10 and CGO-15 but they are lower in CGO-5 and CGO-20. In CGO-5 and CGO-20, the electrochemically inactive β-Ga2O3 phase dominates the electrochemical process during cycling. The high capacities of CGO-10 and CGO-15 may be ascribed to the fact that the electrochemically active Cu4O3 phase together with the CuGa2O4 phase enhances the capacity of the CuO phase. The Cu4O3 phase is also present in the case of CGO-5 and CGO-20, however, the content of CuGa2O4 is very low and there is more Ga2O3 in CGO-20 (β-Ga2O3 is known to be redox inactive ). Here, the CuGa2O4 phase may act as a matrix to enhance the capacity of CuO during electrochemical reactions.\nFig. 8b depicts the cycling performance of the CGO composites at a current density of 0.07 A g−1 over 500 cycles. The first cycle charge capacities are 624, 640, 661, 647 and 618 mA h g−1 for CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, whereas at the 500th cycle the obtained charge capacities are 183, 319, 481, 415 and 183 mA h g−1, respectively. The corresponding capacity retentions are 29.3, 49.8, 73.1, 64.1 and 29.6%, respectively. The obtained cycling performance clearly indicates that the cycling stability of CuO is greatly enhanced by the electrochemically active Cu4O3 phase together with the CuGa2O4 matrix. The inferior performance of CGO-0, CGO-5 and CGO-20 is attributed to large volume expansion during the electrochemical reaction which resulted in loss of contact between the current collector and the electrode material. In order to investigate the stability of the electrode material after 500 cycles, we carried out ex situ XRD (Fig. 8c), TEM (Fig. 8d), ex situ SEM (Fig. 9a) and HRTEM (Fig. 9b and c) on the CGO-10 electrode. Interestingly, the structure and morphology of CGO-10 are well maintained even after 500 cycles. The ex situ XRD pattern of CGO-10 after cycling showed the characteristic peaks of CGO-10 with minor impurity peaks which may be due to the conductive carbon and binder used for the electrode coating. TEM and SEM images of CGO-10 after cycling are shown in Fig. 8d and 9a, respectively. There is no noticeable change in particle morphology and size even after prolonged cycling of the material. An HRTEM image of CGO-10 after cycling and the corresponding SAED pattern are shown in Fig. 9b and c, respectively. Lattice fringes are clearly observed in CGO-10 after cycling, and the (020) plane of CuO with a d-spacing of 0.171 nm is clearly observed in the HRTEM image of CGO-10 after cycling (from Fig. 9b). The well defined bright spots formed into rings in the diffraction pattern are attributed to the polycrystalline sample and the monocrystalline grains. The spots labelled a, b and c in the SAED pattern of CGO-10 after cycling are assigned to the (11), (400) and (220) diffraction planes corresponding to the CuO, CuGa2O4 and Cu4O3 phases with d-spacing values of 0.253, 0.207 and 0.206 nm, respectively. All the d-spacing values found from the SAED pattern of CGO-10 after cycling are in good agreement with those found from the corresponding XRD pattern. The above obtained results confirmed that the charge/discharge behaviour and cycling stability of the CuO material are greatly enhanced by the Cu4O3 phase and the CuGa2O4 matrix. The rate capability of the CuO/Ga2O3 composites was investigated between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 10a. Compared to the other composites, the CGO-10 composite exhibits better rate capability, with charge capacities of 661, 519, 447, 401, 281, 187 and 96 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.07, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.3, 3.3 and 6.6 A g−1, respectively. It is interesting to note that the cell exhibited a charge capacity of 647 mA h g−1 when the cell is cycled back from high current density to low current density (0.07 A g−1). The rate capability results confirmed that CGO-10 exhibits good rate performance and structural stability at high current densities. Aside from CGO-10, the other composites exhibited poor rate performance at high current densities. The obtained capacities and cycling stability are superior compared to previous literature. In order to further understand the electrochemical reactions of the CGO composites, we carried out cyclic voltammetry studies (Fig. 10b) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V. The cyclic voltammograms are quite consistent with the charge/discharge behaviour of the CGO composites. The cathodic peak was observed at 0.57 V and the anodic peak was observed at 1.95 V for the pristine CuO material. The broad cathodic peak corresponds to multiple reduction processes involved in the decomposition of the electrolyte solvents, i.e. EC and DEC, to form a SEI film on the electrode surface, the formation of an intermediate CuO phase, i.e. CuII1−xCuIxO1−x/2, the generation of the Cu2O phase and the decomposition of Cu2O to Cu and Na2O. During the charge process, a broad oxidation peak is observed at around 1.82 V, which corresponds to the oxidation process involved in the formation of the CuO phase from the Cu2O phase. The obtained CV curve of CuO is quite consistent with the previously reported literature. All the composites exhibited three reduction peaks, viz. 1.23, 0.7 and 0.28 V, during discharge and three oxidation peaks at 0.78, 1.28 and 1.98 V during charge. Like the charge/discharge profiles, the CV curves of CGO-10 and CGO-15 are quite similar, while those of CGO-5 and CGO-20 appear to be similar except for the redox peak intensities. The obtained CV profiles of the CGO composites are in accordance with the previously reported literature. The highest capacities of the CGO composites are attributed to the combined redox reactions of CuO and Cu4O3, as we couldn’t identify the peak signatures separately since Cu4O3 also forms a 2CuO + Cu2O composite which itself exhibits several redox peaks according to L. Zhao et al., and the mechanism of storing lithium ions is still not clear. From the CV profiles we clearly confirmed that only the CuO and Cu4O3 phases are involved in the redox reactions, however the CuGa2O4 phase acts as an inactive matrix to stabilize the CuO phase during cycling.\nIn order to gain further insight into the charge/discharge profiles and CV curves of pristine CuO and CGO composites, we carried out EIS analysis and obtained Nyquist plots which are shown in Fig. 10c. The EIS parameters are listed in Table 3. All Nyquist plots show one semicircle in the high frequency region and a line inclined at 45° in the low frequency region, which is called the Warburg region. This Warburg region is a signature of the Na+ ion diffusion process occurring in the electrode material during cycling. Depressed semicircles are observed in the case of CGO-10 and CGO-15, whereas the other CGO composites exhibit semicircles with high Rct (Table 3). This indicates that CGO-10 and CGO-15 exhibit lower impedance as compared to the other CGO composites. From the electrochemical studies we clearly confirmed that the enhanced electrochemical performances of the CGO composites are mainly attributed to the presence of Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 phases, in which the Cu4O3 phase is actively involved in the redox reactions and the CuGa2O4 phase stabilizes the CuO phase by buffering the volume expansion of CuO during cycling.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of pristine CuO and its gallium composites\nA copper precursor solution was prepared by adding 2.815558 g of copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5 H2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) to 120 mL of double distilled water under magnetic stirring. Once a homogeneous solution was obtained, 0.225 M concentrated NaOH solution was mixed into the copper sulphate solution at room temperature. After obtaining a homogeneous solution upon magnetic stirring, the final pH of the solution was found to be 5, and the solution mixture was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave which was then heat treated at 100 °C for 5 h in a muffle furnace. After cooling the solution down naturally to room temperature, the ensuing blue coloured precipitate was filtered and washed with double distilled water and ethanol several times. The obtained precipitate was then dispersed in double distilled water and dried in a hot air oven at 75 °C overnight. The obtained powder sample was then calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to get black coloured copper oxide (CuO) powders whose chemical phase was confirmed through XRD analysis. To prepare the gallium copper oxide composites, gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) was added at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%, whereas CuSO4·5H2O was added at 95, 90, 85 and 80 wt%. Both the gallium and copper precursors were added in the appropriate weight percentages to double distilled water, and 0.225 M NaOH solution was added to this homogeneous precursor solution in all cases. The same synthesis procedure was followed for all weight ratios as described for pristine CuO synthesis. Post-calcination, the powder samples with Ga loaded at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% were named as CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, and these codes are used to refer to them throughout this paper. Scheme 1 shows a schematic illustration containing the synthesis and cell design.\n\n2.2 Physical characterization\nAll the synthesized materials were structurally characterized using a Rigaku Ultima-III X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Morphological and elemental analyses were carried out using a Carl Zeiss-Sigma Scanning Electron Microscope with EDAX provision. HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscope) images and SAED (selected area electron diffraction) patterns of CGO-10, before and after cycling, were obtained using a Jeol/JEM 2100 HRTEM. The composition and the oxidation states of different elements in CGO-10 were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a scan range of 1200 eV. Surface area and pore size analyses of CGO-10 were carried out using N2 adsorption–desorption curves obtained by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, and the data were obtained on a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 Physisorption & Porosimetry system.

The as-obtained homogeneous slurry was coated onto copper foil using an electrode coater and dried under ambient conditions. Circular discs of 18 mm diameter were punched out and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 hours. 2032 type coin cells were finally assembled in an argon filled glove box in which the as-obtained disk was used as the working electrode and a sodium ingot was used as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in 1:1 ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) (1:1 v/v), and Celgard 2400 was used as a separator. The galvanostatic charge/discharge studies were carried out on a programmable battery tester (NEWARE battery analyzer) at various current densities within the potential window between 0.01 and 3 V. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (SP-150, Biologic SAS, France). The CV studies were carried out between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The EIS studies were carried out with an AC voltage signal of 5 mV and a frequency range between 100 kHz and 5 mHz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of pristine CuO and its gallium composites\nA copper precursor solution was prepared by adding 2.815558 g of copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5 H2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) to 120 mL of double distilled water under magnetic stirring. Once a homogeneous solution was obtained, 0.225 M concentrated NaOH solution was mixed into the copper sulphate solution at room temperature. After obtaining a homogeneous solution upon magnetic stirring, the final pH of the solution was found to be 5, and the solution mixture was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave which was then heat treated at 100 °C for 5 h in a muffle furnace. After cooling the solution down naturally to room temperature, the ensuing blue coloured precipitate was filtered and washed with double distilled water and ethanol several times. The obtained precipitate was then dispersed in double distilled water and dried in a hot air oven at 75 °C overnight. The obtained powder sample was then calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to get black coloured copper oxide (CuO) powders whose chemical phase was confirmed through XRD analysis. To prepare the gallium copper oxide composites, gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) was added at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%, whereas CuSO4·5H2O was added at 95, 90, 85 and 80 wt%. Both the gallium and copper precursors were added in the appropriate weight percentages to double distilled water, and 0.225 M NaOH solution was added to this homogeneous precursor solution in all cases. The same synthesis procedure was followed for all weight ratios as described for pristine CuO synthesis. Post-calcination, the powder samples with Ga loaded at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% were named as CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, and these codes are used to refer to them throughout this paper. Scheme 1 shows a schematic illustration containing the synthesis and cell design.\n\n2.2 Physical characterization\nAll the synthesized materials were structurally characterized using a Rigaku Ultima-III X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Synthesis of pristine CuO and its gallium composites\nA copper precursor solution was prepared by adding 2.815558 g of copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5 H2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) to 120 mL of double distilled water under magnetic stirring. Once a homogeneous solution was obtained, 0.225 M concentrated NaOH solution was mixed into the copper sulphate solution at room temperature. After obtaining a homogeneous solution upon magnetic stirring, the final pH of the solution was found to be 5, and the solution mixture was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave which was then heat treated at 100 °C for 5 h in a muffle furnace. After cooling the solution down naturally to room temperature, the ensuing blue coloured precipitate was filtered and washed with double distilled water and ethanol several times. The obtained precipitate was then dispersed in double distilled water and dried in a hot air oven at 75 °C overnight. The obtained powder sample was then calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to get black coloured copper oxide (CuO) powders whose chemical phase was confirmed through XRD analysis. To prepare the gallium copper oxide composites, gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) (purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.9% pure) was added at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%, whereas CuSO4·5H2O was added at 95, 90, 85 and 80 wt%. Both the gallium and copper precursors were added in the appropriate weight percentages to double distilled water, and 0.225 M NaOH solution was added to this homogeneous precursor solution in all cases. The same synthesis procedure was followed for all weight ratios as described for pristine CuO synthesis. Post-calcination, the powder samples with Ga loaded at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% were named as CGO-0, CGO-5, CGO-10, CGO-15 and CGO-20, respectively, and these codes are used to refer to them throughout this paper. Scheme 1 shows a schematic illustration containing the synthesis and cell design.\n\n2.2 Physical characterization\nAll the synthesized materials were structurally characterized using a Rigaku Ultima-III X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Morphological and elemental analyses were carried out using a Carl Zeiss-Sigma Scanning Electron Microscope with EDAX provision. HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscope) images and SAED (selected area electron diffraction) patterns of CGO-10, before and after cycling, were obtained using a Jeol/JEM 2100 HRTEM. The composition and the oxidation states of different elements in CGO-10 were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a scan range of 1200 eV. Surface area and pore size analyses of CGO-10 were carried out using N2 adsorption–desorption curves obtained by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, and the data were obtained on a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 Physisorption & Porosimetry system. Pore size distributions were obtained by employing BJH analysis on the desorption branch.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical characterization\nThe working electrode was prepared by using the traditional slurry coating method in which 80% synthesized active material was mixed with 10% super-P carbon and 10% PVDF binder. Here, super-P carbon acts as a conductive additive. N-methylpyrrolidone was used as a solvent to prepare the slurry homogeneously. The as-obtained homogeneous slurry was coated onto copper foil using an electrode coater and dried under ambient conditions. Circular discs of 18 mm diameter were punched out and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 hours. 2032 type coin cells were finally assembled in an argon filled glove box in which the as-obtained disk was used as the working electrode and a sodium ingot was used as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in 1:1 ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) (1:1 v/v), and Celgard 2400 was used as a separator. The galvanostatic charge/discharge studies were carried out on a programmable battery tester (NEWARE battery analyzer) at various current densities within the potential window between 0.01 and 3 V. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (SP-150, Biologic SAS, France). The CV studies were carried out between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.

Particularly, rechargeable SIBs have been regarded as an emerging generation of low-cost and high-performance energy storage systems, owing to the abundant sodium resources, suitable redox potentials and similar intercalation chemistry compared with LIBs. Nevertheless, suffering from the larger cation radius of Na+ (0.102 nm) than that of Li+ (0.076 nm), SIBs usually deliver low capacities, inferior rate capabilities and poor cycling stability. This has sparked great interest in the design of novel high performance anode materials for LIBs and SIBs simultaneously.\nTransition metal chalcogenides, especially transition metal selenides (MSex, M = Mo, W, Zn, Ni, Fe, Co, Sb; x = 1, 2…n), have been widely explored as potential anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, because of their environmentally benign nature, high theoretical capacities (500–1000 mA h g−1), vivid electrochemical activity, rich redox chemistry, and excellent mechanical and thermal endurance. Among them, zinc selenide has been investigated as a promising anode material due to the abundant resources of zinc, a smaller band gap (2.67 eV), and high theoretical Li-storage capacities. However, ZnSe has low electronic conductivity and undergoes enormous volume changes during the charge–discharge process. This makes it a challenge for the utilization of ZnSe as LIB/SIB electrode materials with high performance. To circumvent these drawbacks, several strategies have been undertaken to enhance the electrochemical performance of ZnSe, including designing nanostructured materials and hybrids with nanocarbon and fabricating porous structures. For instance, Park et al. have reported the solid-state synthesis of a hybrid ZnSe/C nanocomposite that delivered a high specific capacity of 705 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 for LIBs. Mai et al. have synthesized a ZnSe microsphere/MWCNT composite via a hydrothermal reaction route, which displayed a high capacity of 382 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 for SIBs. On the other hand, recently, MoSe2 as a typical layered metal chalcogenide has exhibited favorable performance for energy storage devices because of its large interlayer spacing (0.65 nm) and higher electrical conductivity arising from the small bandgap, which accelerates charge transfer during charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the porous carbon and few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure show enhanced capacitance-type contribution, which results in better cycling stability than that of a battery-type electrode. Therefore, it encourages us to extend our studies to fabricate few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–porous carbon composite. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a facile and controllable method to load few-layer MoSe2 and ZnSe nanoparticles simultaneously onto the porous carbon matrix in the form of uniform dispersion and firm adhesion, which are conducive to the insertion/extraction of lithium/sodium ions in a long cycle.\nIn this regard, the utilization of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites as well as derivatives as controllable and flexible precursors or templates for energy storage has emerged as a fascinating approach. Specifically, the MOF-derived nanostructures possess unique characters of porous structures, tunable compositions and well-connected carbon matrices, which displayed fascinating performance when used as anode materials for both LIBs and SIBs. However, it is notable that the Mo-based MOFs are hard to synthesize. The main challenge is that Mox+ with low valence states of x = 2, 3, 4 and 5 is usually unstable, while the most stable form of Mo6+ is generally the molybdate form. As a result, although the Mo-based MOF derivatives are considered to be desired for LIB/SIB applications, their reports are scanty.\nHerein, polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs), H3PMo12O40, in customized cavities of ZIF-8 were fabricated by a simple self-assembly strategy. Then, a facile selenization procedure was adopted to form few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite, as illustrated in Scheme 1. When acting as an anode material for LIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C delivers a high capacity of 1051 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and robust stability by maintaining a superior capacity of 524 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g−1. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a high initial coulombic efficiency of 89% at 0.2 A g−1 and delivers a large capacity of 468 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles for SIBs. Moreover, it achieves high rate capability and excellent long-term cycling performance at a high current density, which shows the admirable electrochemical performance of SIBs.\n\n\nExperimental section\n\nPreparation of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\n0.2195 g (1 mmol) of zinc acetate and 0.3 g of phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (PMA) were dissolved in 40 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution to form a homogeneous gamboge solution under ultrasonication and stirring for 20 min under ambient conditions. The solution was poured into 40 mL of DMF solution containing 0.3284 g (4 mmol) of 2-methylimidazole, subsequently. After stirring for 24 h, the precipitates were washed several times with ethanol solution and deionized water.\nFor the conversion of MOFs to the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite, a certain amount of a precursor (PMA/ZIF-8) was uniformly mixed with selenium powder, and the sample was annealed at 600 °C for 6 h under a 5% H2/95% Ar flow at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. For comparison, the ZnSe@C nanocomposite was prepared by a similar approach without adding the phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (see Scheme 1).\n\nCharacterization\nThe crystal phases of the samples were observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using filtered Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV. The samples were placed in a glass table and the data were analyzed in the range of 10–80°. The morphology characterization of the samples was conducted using SEM (Hitachi 8100) and TEM (FEI F20 S-TWIN). Raman (DXR2xi) were performed with a laser at wavelength of 532 nm and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were tested on a BELSORP-mini type BET analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an ESCALAB MARK II spherical analyzer with Kα radiation as the X-ray source. A CHNSO elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nFor the LIB test, 80 wt% active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), 10 wt% conductive agent (acetylene black) and 10 wt% binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed to obtain uniform slurries, followed by coating on copper foil. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 composed of EC, EMC and DMC with a ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v/v) and the metallic lithium foil served as the electrolyte and reference electrodes, respectively. For SIB test systems, the working electrode consists of active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), super-P and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in deionized water. Na foil and Whatman glass fiber were used as the reference electrode and the separator, respectively. 1 M NaPF6 in DIGYME = 100 vol% was used as the electrolyte. The test cells (CR2025) were kept in an argon-filled glovebox. The amount of the active material in test cells was ca. 1–2 mg. The area of the work electrode was about 1.1 cm2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and electrochemical performance were tested with a LAND CT2001A workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on an Ivium electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the same voltage window in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.\n\nCharacterization of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\nThe XRD patterns of two samples are shown in Fig. 1. The clear diffraction peaks located at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.5°, 65.8° and 72.6° can be indexed well to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) crystal planes of standard cubic ZnSe (JCPDS no. 65-9603). For ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the additional primary diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.4°, 37.9° and 55.9° can be indexed to the (100), (103) and (110) planes of MoSe2 (JCPDS no. 17-0887), respectively. The absence of the (002) plane of MoSe2 is probably due to the formation of a few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure, indicating the greatly suppressed stacking of layered MoS2. In addition, no impurity diffraction peak is observed, implying that the coexistence of ZnSe and MoSe2 was achieved by the transformation of polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs) in the customized cavities of ZIF-8 as a precursor.\nThe morphologies of the ZnSe@C and ZnSe/MoSe2@C samples are characterized by a series of characterization methods. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the ZnSe@C sample. It is composed of a well-defined polyhedral structure with an approximate size of 400 nm. In the case of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the structure of ZIF-8 is greatly changed with the addition of Mo-based POMs as a special stimulus guest. ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a uniform porous nanostructure with a relatively homogeneous distribution, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The SEM results provided valid evidence that a carbon-encapsulated hierarchical hollow porous structure was masterly fabricated by introducing PMA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3a and b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite shows an interior hollow architecture due to the utilization of Mo-based POMs as the guest and removal of excess organic solvent molecules during the selenization process. In this step, Zn2+ clusters react with Se to convert ZnSe nanoparticles and the Mo species in the precursor is reduced in situ from +6 to +4 to form a laminar MoSe2 phase synchronously. Moreover, ZnSe possesses the cubic crystal structure refined to the F3m space group. Besides, MoSe2, as a typical 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenide, exhibits an evident sandwich-like layered structure. Thus, we can clearly observe that few layered molybdenum selenide is uniformly embedded around small zinc selenide nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix (Fig. 3c). As depicted in Fig. 3d, the lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.17 nm match well with the (220) and (331) planes of ZnSe, respectively. Besides, the lattice fringe of MoSe2 is estimated to be 0.64 nm which is consistent with the (002) interlayer spacing. In addition, the particle size of ZnSe in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is ca. 10 nm. Meanwhile, it can also be noticed that the thickness of MoSe2 is about 1–4 layers, which is in accordance with the XRD result for the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite. Therefore, the absence of the (002) crystal plane of MoSe2 in Fig. 1 is due to well encapsulated MoSe2 in the carbon matrix and the few layer structure of MoSe2. Functional POMs are well suited to act as the flexible and tunable guest. Thus, Mo-based POMs play a special responsive role linked to ZIF-8, and employing polymetallic MOF co-precursors provides the extra space to finely harmonize the nanostructures. Besides, the SEM and TEM images of the precursor of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are shown in Fig. S1.† It is found that the hollow porous structure existed before the selenization process and was well maintained after the calcining process. Thereby, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C structure is obtained via continuous growth of PMA/ZIF-8 to derive few-layer MoSe2 around a ZnSe nanoparticle in the carbon matrix, as revealed by the SEM and TEM results, and is beneficial for the increase of surface chemical reactions, enlargement of ion storage sites and shortening of the diffusion paths. Moreover, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) image further provides evidence of the homogeneous distribution of Zn, Mo, Se and C elements (Fig. 4). These results reveal that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is composed of few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nanoparticles and is homogeneously confined in the porous carbon matrix. Meanwhile, EDS analysis demonstrates that the atomic ratio between Zn and Mo is around 1.42:1 (Fig. S2†).\nIn Raman spectra (Fig. S3†), two broad peaks of D and G bands at 1330 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are observed, which are generally assigned to a substantial defect or disordered site and the graphitic structure, respectively. The intensity ratios of the D and G peaks (ID/IG ratios) indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials. The ID/IG ratio of ZnSe/MoSe2@C of 0.94 implies amorphous and disordered structures in the carbon matrix. Similarly, ZnSe@C (ID/IG = 0.96) shows a character of amorphous carbon. In Fig. S4,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a larger BET specific surface area and pore volume (70.1 m2 g−1 and 0.46 cm3 g−1) than those of ZnSe@C (47.7 m2 g−1 and 0.32 cm3 g−1). The large specific surface area and hollow porous structure can increase the electrochemically active sites and the accessibility of the electrolyte for lithium and sodium storage and facilitate Li+/Na+ diffusion.\nThe XPS spectra can reveal useful details on the composition evolution on the surfaces of ZnSe/MoSe2@C (Fig. 5). Two typical peaks at around 1021.55 and 1044.7 eV are observed in Fig. 5a, representing Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and exhibiting characteristics of the Zn2+ selenidation state. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the signals of Mo 3d are resolved into three components at 228.7, 231.8 and 235.4 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 Mo 3d3/2 and Mo–O–C, respectively. Among them, the presence of the primary doublet peaks is trapped at around 228.7 and 231.8 eV, which confirms the existence of Mo4+ in MoSe2. Moreover, two peaks located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV are assigned, which are characteristic of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c. The signal areas were also investigated in the spectra of Se 3d by a deconvolution analysis. The result reveals that the area ratio of Se 3d5/2:Se 3d3/2 is 3:2, and the distance between two separated tracks is 0.9 eV. It can also be ascribed to the typical feature of Se2−, which corresponds to metal–selenium bonds of ZnSe and MoSe2. Three peaks at 284.5, 285.2, and 288.3 eV are recorded from the asymmetric C 1s peak, corresponding to C–C, C–OH/C–O–Mo, and CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 5d). Besides, the atomic content ratio of Zn and Mo in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is estimated to be ca. 1.5:1 through XPS measurements, and corresponds well to the result of EDS analysis. In addition, the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C was carried out on an elemental analyser (Elementar vario EL cube). According to the results of elemental analysis, the carbon contents are ca. 11.5 and 15.6 wt% for ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C, respectively (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S5,† the high-resolution spectra of N 1s showed that the N atom contained the forms of pyridinic N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 eV), and graphitic N (401.2 eV), indicating the existence of the N element in ZnSe/MoSe2@C. Based on the results of the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the N element content on the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite is ca. 6.76 wt%. The introduction of N doping can improve the surface wettability of the carbon composite with the electrolyte, and create more defects and active sites for lithium/sodium storage. The N species mainly derived from the ligand (2-methylimidazole).\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Li-ion batteries\nThe electrochemical properties of the anode were evaluated using half cells in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li+/Li (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the initial three CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. ZnSe/MoSe2@C reveals two obvious irreversible peaks at approximately 1.54 V and near 1.62 V, which belong to the transformation of lithium into interstitials in ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively, in the initial cathodic cycle. Two peaks at 0.87 and 0.59 V are attributed to the formation of Li2Se/Zn and the formation of Li2Se/Mo through further conversion of ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively. In the meantime, the growth of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) causes an initial irreversible capacity loss. The occurrence of the multi-step alloy reaction between Li and Zn is observed below 0.5 V. The slope shape is centered below 0.2 V, which is attributed to sectional Li+ insertion into the porous carbon. Several small oxidation peaks at 0.31 and 0.68 V are recorded, corresponding to the multi-step de-alloying reaction of LiZn alloys in the anodic process. Distinct peaks at 1.35 and 2.51 V can be attributed to the oxidation of Zn and Li2Se into ZnSe and the probable oxidation of Li2Se into selenium (from ZnSe). Meanwhile, the oxidation peak at 2.21 V represents the oxidation of Mo into MoSe2, accompanied by the conversion of LiSe into selenium (from MoSe2) at 1.85 V. The main cathodic peaks are obviously shifted to high potentials and become slightly wider during following cycles, probably because of architecture variation from the conversion reaction and the existence of pseudocapacitive behavior. The intensities and integral areas of peaks are much the same in subsequent laps, suggesting the good reversibility of lithium insertion/extraction reactions in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. The redox process of ZnSe/MoSe2@C can be formulated using multiple steps as in the following equations:\nZnSe:\nMoSe 2 :\nThe typical charge/discharge curves of ZnSe/MoSe2@C at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Li/Li+) are shown in Fig. 6b. The first discharge curve exhibits several small voltage plateaus. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode shows an initial discharge capacity of about 1031 mA h g−1. The capacity irreversibility within the first cycle is caused by the formation of the SEI layer and an irreversible reaction. In the subsequent cycles, the discharge slopes of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode are stable at around 0.5–0.01 V. Compared to that in the first cycle, the discharge capacity still reaches 1051 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, indicating the good reversibility of ZnSe/MoSe2@C during the charge and discharge process. It can be deduced that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C material is suitable to function as a negative electrode material for LIBs. It agrees well with the results of the CV curves, implying the exultant reversible performance.\nThe cycling performances at current densities of 0.2 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 7a and b. They reveal the superior cycling performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode compared to that of the ZnSe@C electrode for LIBs. Obviously, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers high capacities of 1051 mA h g−1 and 874 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 for 150 cycles and 200 cycles, respectively. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode shows relatively poor cycling performance. The discharge capacities are 361 and 490 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. As revealed, the superiority of ZnSe/MoSe2@C in terms of the rate capability is very apparent. Fig. 7c demonstrates that the reversible capacities of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are 701, 660, 538, 460 and 363 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. More strikingly, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode even maintains an increasing capacity of 859 mA h g−1 when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, implying its outstanding reversibility and cycling stability. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode delivered much lower capacities of 441, 297, 237, 202, 165 and 201 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The ZnSe@C electrode also displays a lower capacity of 333 mA h g−1 when the current density is further reduced stepwise to 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a superior stable capacity of 524 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 even after 600 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7d. Impressively, the initial coulombic efficiency of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode reaches 70% and nearly 92% in the 2nd cycle. With cycling, the CEs of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C anode are endearingly increased up to approximately 100% just after following several charge–discharge cycles. This should be beneficial for efficient permeation of the electrolyte and a fast multi-electron transfer process owing to the confinement of few layer MoSe2 cleverly around ZnSe nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix. These features underline the great potential of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as a promising anode for advanced LIBs with long-term cycling properties, especially at high rates.\nTo gain further insight into the reason for the high capacity, the CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 are recorded (Fig. 8a). The correlation of the storage system obeys the following two equations:\nwhere i is the peak current, v stands for the scan rate, and both a and b are regulable constant parameters. According to the relationship between logi and logv of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 8c), the adjustable b values were 0.71 (peak-1), 0.72 (peak-2), and 0.74 (peak-3), respectively, indicating the fast kinetics of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode, which results from the synergistic effects of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive behaviors. In contrast, Fig. 8b and d show lower calculated b values of 0.63 (peak-1), 0.31 (peak-2) and 0.52 (peak-3) for ZnSe@C electrodes. Therefore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode is allocated to the diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitance response, which gives rise to the increased capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C. The above results prove that gradual rising cycle curve of ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 7d) is ascribed to the partial pseudocapacitive contribution.\nIn general, to evaluate the deeper total contribution of the composite, the ratio of the capacitor capacity and diffusion-controlled capacity can be quantitatively calculated based on the following equation:\nwhere k1ν stands for the capacitance-controlled effects and k2ν1/2 corresponds to the diffusion-controlled insertion processes, respectively (Fig. 8e and f). As the scan rate of ν increased (from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1), the capacitive contribution of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode increased from 29%, 37%, 50%, 74% to 82% gradually. In comparison, the ZnSe@C electrode capacitive contributions are 4%, 12%, 18%, 30% and 36%, respectively. The results faithfully prove that few layered MoSe2 and the in situ generated porous carbon network effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode.\nTo analyze the underlying mechanism, EIS measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 9a, the EIS plots of two electrodes are constituted by the internal resistance (Rs), the impedance (Rf) of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge-transfer impedance (Rct).Table 1 shows that the charge transfer resistance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (32.5 Ω) is smaller than that of ZnSe@C (35.2 Ω) due to few layer MoSe2 being confined within the ZnSe–C hollow microsphere and the coated in situ generated carbon matrix, which could accelerate the electrolytic infiltration and diffusion of Li+. Then, for the skew line at the low frequency region, ZnSe/MoSe2@C displays the highest slope angle of the linear Warburg parts, indicating the enhanced ion/electrolyte reaction kinetic diffusion. The special structure could also prevent the volume expansion of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite during Li+ insertion/extraction, which aggressively improves the cycling stabilization of the electrode. The structural and mechanical stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite was confirmed by the SEM analysis of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode after a 50 cycle test at 0.2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 9b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite mainly retains its original morphology and microstructure. The result also reflects that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C sample possesses high reversible structure stability during the lithium storage processes.\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Na-ion batteries\nIn addition to the measurements in LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite also displays good cycling and rate performance for SIBs. The electrochemical properties of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite and the corresponding SIB test results are shown in Fig. 10.\nThe electrochemical reaction mechanism was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 10a). In the first cathodic cycle, the two weak peaks located at ca. 1.23 and 1.62 V can be attributed to the Na+ ion conversion from trigonal prismatic (2H) 2H-MoSe2 interlayers to an octahedral (1T) structure of NaxMoSe2. The formation of Mo/Na2Se results in the appearance of a peak at ca. 0.7 V, while Na+ ions further intercalate into MoSe2 layers. One irreversible peak at around 0.5 V is associated with the formation of the SEI because of the decomposition of the electrolyte. Another strong cathodic peak at ca. 0.28 V is recorded, corresponding to the conversion reaction of ZnSe into Zn/Na2Se, accompanied by the formation of a Na–Zn alloy. In the subsequent anodic scan, the two peaks are attributed to the de-alloying reaction of NaZn alloys (0.28 V) and regeneration of ZnSe (0.98 V). The broad peaks at 1.65 V accompanied by a shoulder at 2.06 V can be assigned to the existence of intermediates and oxidation of Mo into MoSe2. It is worth noting that partial anodic peaks shift to a high potential in the 2nd and 3rd CV cycles, implying that there is an activation process for the electroactive materials in the initial cycle. These CV curves except for the first cycle almost overlap with other, indicating the excellent reversibility. The peak shift in the CV curves matches well with voltage plateaus in the corresponding galvanostatic discharge and charge processes (Fig. 10b). As shown in Fig. 10(b and c), ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows similar low discharge plateaus at about 0.3 V, which corresponds well to the cathode curve in CV graphs. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 532 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Na/Na+). After 50 cycles, ZnSe/MoSe2@C maintains a large reversible capacity of 468 mA h g−1, which is one of the highest values for ZnSe-based anode materials for SIB applications reported so far.\nRate capability is another important aspect in anode materials for SIBs. The rate performances of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C are evaluated at different current densities from 0.1 to 4 A g−1 (Fig. 10d). The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits decent reversible capacities of 456, 389, 400, 376, 352, and 328 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1, respectively. These values are higher than the values of 439, 387, 343, 296, 248, and 196 mA h g−1 for the ZnSe@C electrode at the same current densities. Moreover, ZnSe/MoSe2@C even maintains an increasing capacity when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, revealing great reversibility and cycling stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. To examine the high-rate cycling stability, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode was further cycled at a high current density of 4 A g−1. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode retains an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency, corresponding to negligible capacity loss. The above results verify that ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibits better cycling and rate performance than the ZnSe@C electrode. The stability of the charge transfer process is well studied by EIS analysis within the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential (Fig. 10f), and is helpful in disclosing the reasons why the ZnSe/MoSe2@C Na-ion half-cell can maintain remarkable rate performance based on the electrochemistry. Impedance parameters from an equivalent circuit model are calculated, and they are similar to those of LIBs (Table 2). The Rct and Rf values of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are smaller than those of ZnSe@C before cycling. Moreover, the slant line of the relationship between Zw (real part of the impedance spectra) and ω−1/2 (angular frequency = 2πf) is closely related to the ion diffusion within the anode material. The Warburg coefficients σ are determined from Zwvs. ω−1/2 in the low frequency region. As shown in Fig. S6,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibited a lower slope than ZnSe@C, indicating the facilitation of ion transportation of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Thus, the existence of the hollow porous carbon matrix can improve the structural stability and electronic conductivity of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Such facile migration of Na+ in MOF-derived few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow sphere structure is decent. It demonstrates that a unique multi-component coordination can promote fast ion diffusion kinetics and increase the electrochemical conductivity.\nAs graphically illustrated in the schematic diagram (Scheme 2), lithium/sodium ions are partially stored on the surface of few-layer MoSe2 and the porous carbon matrix in a pseudocapacitive pattern. The rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere exhibits the distinctive high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. On one hand, the unique design theoretically ensures that the architecture efficiently alleviates the volume expansion during the charge–discharge process and prevents aggregation of nanoparticles. On the other hand, owing to the synergistic effect of various components, more capacity storage sites from few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nano-crystals can supply pseudocapacitance-type active sites and shorten the electron transfer paths, thereby enhancing the rate capability. The N doped well-connected carbon matrix can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode, and meanwhile prevent the nano-components from aggregation and pulverization upon long-term cycling and the high-rate charge–discharge process. Notably, the electrochemical performance of the novel few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere electrode is comparable with those of other previously reported related electrodes for LIBs/SIBs (Table S2†).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated by a self-assembly reaction and a post-selenization process. This novel nano-architecture surmounts the sluggish reaction kinetics and relieves the huge volume changes of the anode for LIBs/SIBs. Moreover, few-layer MoSe2 and the carbon matrix obtained by in situ carbonization provide a buffering mechanism and partial pseudocapacitance capacity contribution. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite exhibits a remarkable reversible capacity (1051 mA h g−1 at the 150th cycle) and long-term cycling stability (524 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 600 cycles). Notably, when used as the anode in SIBs, the initial coulombic efficiency can reach a value as high as 89%. Moreover, it delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 4 A g−1 even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. Therefore, we believe that such a strategy of MOF-based host–guest chemistry will exploit an effective avenue to design an advanced few-layer nanostructure confined within an ultra-small nanoparticle–porous carbon matrix nanocomposite for versatile applications, not only in LIBs/SIBs, but also in other fields such as potassium-ion batteries, sensors, electrocatalysts, etc.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

A CHNSO elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nFor the LIB test, 80 wt% active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), 10 wt% conductive agent (acetylene black) and 10 wt% binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed to obtain uniform slurries, followed by coating on copper foil. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 composed of EC, EMC and DMC with a ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v/v) and the metallic lithium foil served as the electrolyte and reference electrodes, respectively. For SIB test systems, the working electrode consists of active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), super-P and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in deionized water. Na foil and Whatman glass fiber were used as the reference electrode and the separator, respectively. 1 M NaPF6 in DIGYME = 100 vol% was used as the electrolyte. The test cells (CR2025) were kept in an argon-filled glovebox. The amount of the active material in test cells was ca. 1–2 mg. The area of the work electrode was about 1.1 cm2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and electrochemical performance were tested with a LAND CT2001A workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on an Ivium electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the same voltage window in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.\n\nCharacterization of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\nThe XRD patterns of two samples are shown in Fig. 1. The clear diffraction peaks located at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.5°, 65.8° and 72.6° can be indexed well to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) crystal planes of standard cubic ZnSe (JCPDS no. 65-9603). For ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the additional primary diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.4°, 37.9° and 55.9° can be indexed to the (100), (103) and (110) planes of MoSe2 (JCPDS no. 17-0887), respectively. The absence of the (002) plane of MoSe2 is probably due to the formation of a few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure, indicating the greatly suppressed stacking of layered MoS2. In addition, no impurity diffraction peak is observed, implying that the coexistence of ZnSe and MoSe2 was achieved by the transformation of polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs) in the customized cavities of ZIF-8 as a precursor.\nThe morphologies of the ZnSe@C and ZnSe/MoSe2@C samples are characterized by a series of characterization methods. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the ZnSe@C sample. It is composed of a well-defined polyhedral structure with an approximate size of 400 nm. In the case of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the structure of ZIF-8 is greatly changed with the addition of Mo-based POMs as a special stimulus guest. ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a uniform porous nanostructure with a relatively homogeneous distribution, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The SEM results provided valid evidence that a carbon-encapsulated hierarchical hollow porous structure was masterly fabricated by introducing PMA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3a and b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite shows an interior hollow architecture due to the utilization of Mo-based POMs as the guest and removal of excess organic solvent molecules during the selenization process. In this step, Zn2+ clusters react with Se to convert ZnSe nanoparticles and the Mo species in the precursor is reduced in situ from +6 to +4 to form a laminar MoSe2 phase synchronously. Moreover, ZnSe possesses the cubic crystal structure refined to the F3m space group. Besides, MoSe2, as a typical 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenide, exhibits an evident sandwich-like layered structure. Thus, we can clearly observe that few layered molybdenum selenide is uniformly embedded around small zinc selenide nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix (Fig. 3c). As depicted in Fig. 3d, the lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.17 nm match well with the (220) and (331) planes of ZnSe, respectively. Besides, the lattice fringe of MoSe2 is estimated to be 0.64 nm which is consistent with the (002) interlayer spacing. In addition, the particle size of ZnSe in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is ca. 10 nm. Meanwhile, it can also be noticed that the thickness of MoSe2 is about 1–4 layers, which is in accordance with the XRD result for the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite. Therefore, the absence of the (002) crystal plane of MoSe2 in Fig. 1 is due to well encapsulated MoSe2 in the carbon matrix and the few layer structure of MoSe2. Functional POMs are well suited to act as the flexible and tunable guest. Thus, Mo-based POMs play a special responsive role linked to ZIF-8, and employing polymetallic MOF co-precursors provides the extra space to finely harmonize the nanostructures. Besides, the SEM and TEM images of the precursor of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are shown in Fig. S1.† It is found that the hollow porous structure existed before the selenization process and was well maintained after the calcining process. Thereby, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C structure is obtained via continuous growth of PMA/ZIF-8 to derive few-layer MoSe2 around a ZnSe nanoparticle in the carbon matrix, as revealed by the SEM and TEM results, and is beneficial for the increase of surface chemical reactions, enlargement of ion storage sites and shortening of the diffusion paths. Moreover, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) image further provides evidence of the homogeneous distribution of Zn, Mo, Se and C elements (Fig. 4). These results reveal that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is composed of few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nanoparticles and is homogeneously confined in the porous carbon matrix. Meanwhile, EDS analysis demonstrates that the atomic ratio between Zn and Mo is around 1.42:1 (Fig. S2†).\nIn Raman spectra (Fig. S3†), two broad peaks of D and G bands at 1330 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are observed, which are generally assigned to a substantial defect or disordered site and the graphitic structure, respectively. The intensity ratios of the D and G peaks (ID/IG ratios) indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials. The ID/IG ratio of ZnSe/MoSe2@C of 0.94 implies amorphous and disordered structures in the carbon matrix. Similarly, ZnSe@C (ID/IG = 0.96) shows a character of amorphous carbon. In Fig. S4,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a larger BET specific surface area and pore volume (70.1 m2 g−1 and 0.46 cm3 g−1) than those of ZnSe@C (47.7 m2 g−1 and 0.32 cm3 g−1). The large specific surface area and hollow porous structure can increase the electrochemically active sites and the accessibility of the electrolyte for lithium and sodium storage and facilitate Li+/Na+ diffusion.\nThe XPS spectra can reveal useful details on the composition evolution on the surfaces of ZnSe/MoSe2@C (Fig. 5). Two typical peaks at around 1021.55 and 1044.7 eV are observed in Fig. 5a, representing Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and exhibiting characteristics of the Zn2+ selenidation state. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the signals of Mo 3d are resolved into three components at 228.7, 231.8 and 235.4 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 Mo 3d3/2 and Mo–O–C, respectively. Among them, the presence of the primary doublet peaks is trapped at around 228.7 and 231.8 eV, which confirms the existence of Mo4+ in MoSe2. Moreover, two peaks located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV are assigned, which are characteristic of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c. The signal areas were also investigated in the spectra of Se 3d by a deconvolution analysis. The result reveals that the area ratio of Se 3d5/2:Se 3d3/2 is 3:2, and the distance between two separated tracks is 0.9 eV. It can also be ascribed to the typical feature of Se2−, which corresponds to metal–selenium bonds of ZnSe and MoSe2. Three peaks at 284.5, 285.2, and 288.3 eV are recorded from the asymmetric C 1s peak, corresponding to C–C, C–OH/C–O–Mo, and CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 5d). Besides, the atomic content ratio of Zn and Mo in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is estimated to be ca. 1.5:1 through XPS measurements, and corresponds well to the result of EDS analysis. In addition, the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C was carried out on an elemental analyser (Elementar vario EL cube). According to the results of elemental analysis, the carbon contents are ca. 11.5 and 15.6 wt% for ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C, respectively (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S5,† the high-resolution spectra of N 1s showed that the N atom contained the forms of pyridinic N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 eV), and graphitic N (401.2 eV), indicating the existence of the N element in ZnSe/MoSe2@C. Based on the results of the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the N element content on the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite is ca. 6.76 wt%. The introduction of N doping can improve the surface wettability of the carbon composite with the electrolyte, and create more defects and active sites for lithium/sodium storage. The N species mainly derived from the ligand (2-methylimidazole).\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Li-ion batteries\nThe electrochemical properties of the anode were evaluated using half cells in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li+/Li (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the initial three CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. ZnSe/MoSe2@C reveals two obvious irreversible peaks at approximately 1.54 V and near 1.62 V, which belong to the transformation of lithium into interstitials in ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively, in the initial cathodic cycle. Two peaks at 0.87 and 0.59 V are attributed to the formation of Li2Se/Zn and the formation of Li2Se/Mo through further conversion of ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively. In the meantime, the growth of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) causes an initial irreversible capacity loss. The occurrence of the multi-step alloy reaction between Li and Zn is observed below 0.5 V. The slope shape is centered below 0.2 V, which is attributed to sectional Li+ insertion into the porous carbon. Several small oxidation peaks at 0.31 and 0.68 V are recorded, corresponding to the multi-step de-alloying reaction of LiZn alloys in the anodic process. Distinct peaks at 1.35 and 2.51 V can be attributed to the oxidation of Zn and Li2Se into ZnSe and the probable oxidation of Li2Se into selenium (from ZnSe). Meanwhile, the oxidation peak at 2.21 V represents the oxidation of Mo into MoSe2, accompanied by the conversion of LiSe into selenium (from MoSe2) at 1.85 V. The main cathodic peaks are obviously shifted to high potentials and become slightly wider during following cycles, probably because of architecture variation from the conversion reaction and the existence of pseudocapacitive behavior. The intensities and integral areas of peaks are much the same in subsequent laps, suggesting the good reversibility of lithium insertion/extraction reactions in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. The redox process of ZnSe/MoSe2@C can be formulated using multiple steps as in the following equations:\nZnSe:\nMoSe 2 :\nThe typical charge/discharge curves of ZnSe/MoSe2@C at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Li/Li+) are shown in Fig. 6b. The first discharge curve exhibits several small voltage plateaus. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode shows an initial discharge capacity of about 1031 mA h g−1. The capacity irreversibility within the first cycle is caused by the formation of the SEI layer and an irreversible reaction. In the subsequent cycles, the discharge slopes of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode are stable at around 0.5–0.01 V. Compared to that in the first cycle, the discharge capacity still reaches 1051 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, indicating the good reversibility of ZnSe/MoSe2@C during the charge and discharge process. It can be deduced that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C material is suitable to function as a negative electrode material for LIBs. It agrees well with the results of the CV curves, implying the exultant reversible performance.\nThe cycling performances at current densities of 0.2 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 7a and b. They reveal the superior cycling performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode compared to that of the ZnSe@C electrode for LIBs. Obviously, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers high capacities of 1051 mA h g−1 and 874 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 for 150 cycles and 200 cycles, respectively. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode shows relatively poor cycling performance. The discharge capacities are 361 and 490 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. As revealed, the superiority of ZnSe/MoSe2@C in terms of the rate capability is very apparent. Fig. 7c demonstrates that the reversible capacities of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are 701, 660, 538, 460 and 363 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. More strikingly, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode even maintains an increasing capacity of 859 mA h g−1 when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, implying its outstanding reversibility and cycling stability. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode delivered much lower capacities of 441, 297, 237, 202, 165 and 201 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The ZnSe@C electrode also displays a lower capacity of 333 mA h g−1 when the current density is further reduced stepwise to 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a superior stable capacity of 524 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 even after 600 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7d. Impressively, the initial coulombic efficiency of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode reaches 70% and nearly 92% in the 2nd cycle. With cycling, the CEs of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C anode are endearingly increased up to approximately 100% just after following several charge–discharge cycles. This should be beneficial for efficient permeation of the electrolyte and a fast multi-electron transfer process owing to the confinement of few layer MoSe2 cleverly around ZnSe nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix. These features underline the great potential of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as a promising anode for advanced LIBs with long-term cycling properties, especially at high rates.\nTo gain further insight into the reason for the high capacity, the CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 are recorded (Fig. 8a). The correlation of the storage system obeys the following two equations:\nwhere i is the peak current, v stands for the scan rate, and both a and b are regulable constant parameters. According to the relationship between logi and logv of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 8c), the adjustable b values were 0.71 (peak-1), 0.72 (peak-2), and 0.74 (peak-3), respectively, indicating the fast kinetics of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode, which results from the synergistic effects of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive behaviors. In contrast, Fig. 8b and d show lower calculated b values of 0.63 (peak-1), 0.31 (peak-2) and 0.52 (peak-3) for ZnSe@C electrodes. Therefore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode is allocated to the diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitance response, which gives rise to the increased capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C. The above results prove that gradual rising cycle curve of ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 7d) is ascribed to the partial pseudocapacitive contribution.\nIn general, to evaluate the deeper total contribution of the composite, the ratio of the capacitor capacity and diffusion-controlled capacity can be quantitatively calculated based on the following equation:\nwhere k1ν stands for the capacitance-controlled effects and k2ν1/2 corresponds to the diffusion-controlled insertion processes, respectively (Fig. 8e and f). As the scan rate of ν increased (from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1), the capacitive contribution of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode increased from 29%, 37%, 50%, 74% to 82% gradually. In comparison, the ZnSe@C electrode capacitive contributions are 4%, 12%, 18%, 30% and 36%, respectively. The results faithfully prove that few layered MoSe2 and the in situ generated porous carbon network effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode.\nTo analyze the underlying mechanism, EIS measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 9a, the EIS plots of two electrodes are constituted by the internal resistance (Rs), the impedance (Rf) of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge-transfer impedance (Rct).Table 1 shows that the charge transfer resistance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (32.5 Ω) is smaller than that of ZnSe@C (35.2 Ω) due to few layer MoSe2 being confined within the ZnSe–C hollow microsphere and the coated in situ generated carbon matrix, which could accelerate the electrolytic infiltration and diffusion of Li+. Then, for the skew line at the low frequency region, ZnSe/MoSe2@C displays the highest slope angle of the linear Warburg parts, indicating the enhanced ion/electrolyte reaction kinetic diffusion. The special structure could also prevent the volume expansion of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite during Li+ insertion/extraction, which aggressively improves the cycling stabilization of the electrode. The structural and mechanical stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite was confirmed by the SEM analysis of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode after a 50 cycle test at 0.2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 9b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite mainly retains its original morphology and microstructure. The result also reflects that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C sample possesses high reversible structure stability during the lithium storage processes.\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Na-ion batteries\nIn addition to the measurements in LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite also displays good cycling and rate performance for SIBs. The electrochemical properties of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite and the corresponding SIB test results are shown in Fig. 10.\nThe electrochemical reaction mechanism was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 10a). In the first cathodic cycle, the two weak peaks located at ca. 1.23 and 1.62 V can be attributed to the Na+ ion conversion from trigonal prismatic (2H) 2H-MoSe2 interlayers to an octahedral (1T) structure of NaxMoSe2. The formation of Mo/Na2Se results in the appearance of a peak at ca. 0.7 V, while Na+ ions further intercalate into MoSe2 layers. One irreversible peak at around 0.5 V is associated with the formation of the SEI because of the decomposition of the electrolyte. Another strong cathodic peak at ca. 0.28 V is recorded, corresponding to the conversion reaction of ZnSe into Zn/Na2Se, accompanied by the formation of a Na–Zn alloy. In the subsequent anodic scan, the two peaks are attributed to the de-alloying reaction of NaZn alloys (0.28 V) and regeneration of ZnSe (0.98 V). The broad peaks at 1.65 V accompanied by a shoulder at 2.06 V can be assigned to the existence of intermediates and oxidation of Mo into MoSe2. It is worth noting that partial anodic peaks shift to a high potential in the 2nd and 3rd CV cycles, implying that there is an activation process for the electroactive materials in the initial cycle. These CV curves except for the first cycle almost overlap with other, indicating the excellent reversibility. The peak shift in the CV curves matches well with voltage plateaus in the corresponding galvanostatic discharge and charge processes (Fig. 10b). As shown in Fig. 10(b and c), ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows similar low discharge plateaus at about 0.3 V, which corresponds well to the cathode curve in CV graphs. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 532 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Na/Na+). After 50 cycles, ZnSe/MoSe2@C maintains a large reversible capacity of 468 mA h g−1, which is one of the highest values for ZnSe-based anode materials for SIB applications reported so far.\nRate capability is another important aspect in anode materials for SIBs. The rate performances of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C are evaluated at different current densities from 0.1 to 4 A g−1 (Fig. 10d). The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits decent reversible capacities of 456, 389, 400, 376, 352, and 328 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1, respectively. These values are higher than the values of 439, 387, 343, 296, 248, and 196 mA h g−1 for the ZnSe@C electrode at the same current densities. Moreover, ZnSe/MoSe2@C even maintains an increasing capacity when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, revealing great reversibility and cycling stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. To examine the high-rate cycling stability, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode was further cycled at a high current density of 4 A g−1. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode retains an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency, corresponding to negligible capacity loss. The above results verify that ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibits better cycling and rate performance than the ZnSe@C electrode. The stability of the charge transfer process is well studied by EIS analysis within the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential (Fig. 10f), and is helpful in disclosing the reasons why the ZnSe/MoSe2@C Na-ion half-cell can maintain remarkable rate performance based on the electrochemistry. Impedance parameters from an equivalent circuit model are calculated, and they are similar to those of LIBs (Table 2). The Rct and Rf values of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are smaller than those of ZnSe@C before cycling. Moreover, the slant line of the relationship between Zw (real part of the impedance spectra) and ω−1/2 (angular frequency = 2πf) is closely related to the ion diffusion within the anode material. The Warburg coefficients σ are determined from Zwvs. ω−1/2 in the low frequency region. As shown in Fig. S6,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibited a lower slope than ZnSe@C, indicating the facilitation of ion transportation of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Thus, the existence of the hollow porous carbon matrix can improve the structural stability and electronic conductivity of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Such facile migration of Na+ in MOF-derived few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow sphere structure is decent. It demonstrates that a unique multi-component coordination can promote fast ion diffusion kinetics and increase the electrochemical conductivity.\nAs graphically illustrated in the schematic diagram (Scheme 2), lithium/sodium ions are partially stored on the surface of few-layer MoSe2 and the porous carbon matrix in a pseudocapacitive pattern. The rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere exhibits the distinctive high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. On one hand, the unique design theoretically ensures that the architecture efficiently alleviates the volume expansion during the charge–discharge process and prevents aggregation of nanoparticles. On the other hand, owing to the synergistic effect of various components, more capacity storage sites from few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nano-crystals can supply pseudocapacitance-type active sites and shorten the electron transfer paths, thereby enhancing the rate capability. The N doped well-connected carbon matrix can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode, and meanwhile prevent the nano-components from aggregation and pulverization upon long-term cycling and the high-rate charge–discharge process. Notably, the electrochemical performance of the novel few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere electrode is comparable with those of other previously reported related electrodes for LIBs/SIBs (Table S2†).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The solution was poured into 40 mL of DMF solution containing 0.3284 g (4 mmol) of 2-methylimidazole, subsequently. After stirring for 24 h, the precipitates were washed several times with ethanol solution and deionized water.\nFor the conversion of MOFs to the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite, a certain amount of a precursor (PMA/ZIF-8) was uniformly mixed with selenium powder, and the sample was annealed at 600 °C for 6 h under a 5% H2/95% Ar flow at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. For comparison, the ZnSe@C nanocomposite was prepared by a similar approach without adding the phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (see Scheme 1).\n\nCharacterization\nThe crystal phases of the samples were observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using filtered Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV. The samples were placed in a glass table and the data were analyzed in the range of 10–80°. The morphology characterization of the samples was conducted using SEM (Hitachi 8100) and TEM (FEI F20 S-TWIN). Raman (DXR2xi) were performed with a laser at wavelength of 532 nm and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were tested on a BELSORP-mini type BET analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an ESCALAB MARK II spherical analyzer with Kα radiation as the X-ray source. A CHNSO elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Elementar vario EL cube).\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nFor the LIB test, 80 wt% active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), 10 wt% conductive agent (acetylene black) and 10 wt% binder (polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed to obtain uniform slurries, followed by coating on copper foil. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 composed of EC, EMC and DMC with a ratio of 1:1:1 (v/v/v) and the metallic lithium foil served as the electrolyte and reference electrodes, respectively. For SIB test systems, the working electrode consists of active materials (ZnSe/MoSe2@C or ZnSe@C), super-P and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in deionized water. Na foil and Whatman glass fiber were used as the reference electrode and the separator, respectively. 1 M NaPF6 in DIGYME = 100 vol% was used as the electrolyte. The test cells (CR2025) were kept in an argon-filled glovebox. The amount of the active material in test cells was ca. 1–2 mg. The area of the work electrode was about 1.1 cm2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and electrochemical performance were tested with a LAND CT2001A workstation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on an Ivium electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the same voltage window in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.\n\nCharacterization of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C\nThe XRD patterns of two samples are shown in Fig. 1. The clear diffraction peaks located at 27.2°, 45.2°, 53.5°, 65.8° and 72.6° can be indexed well to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) crystal planes of standard cubic ZnSe (JCPDS no. 65-9603). For ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the additional primary diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.4°, 37.9° and 55.9° can be indexed to the (100), (103) and (110) planes of MoSe2 (JCPDS no. 17-0887), respectively. The absence of the (002) plane of MoSe2 is probably due to the formation of a few-layer MoSe2 nanostructure, indicating the greatly suppressed stacking of layered MoS2. In addition, no impurity diffraction peak is observed, implying that the coexistence of ZnSe and MoSe2 was achieved by the transformation of polymetallic MOFs composed of Keggin-type heteropolyanions (POMs) in the customized cavities of ZIF-8 as a precursor.\nThe morphologies of the ZnSe@C and ZnSe/MoSe2@C samples are characterized by a series of characterization methods. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the ZnSe@C sample. It is composed of a well-defined polyhedral structure with an approximate size of 400 nm. In the case of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the structure of ZIF-8 is greatly changed with the addition of Mo-based POMs as a special stimulus guest. ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a uniform porous nanostructure with a relatively homogeneous distribution, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The SEM results provided valid evidence that a carbon-encapsulated hierarchical hollow porous structure was masterly fabricated by introducing PMA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3a and b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite shows an interior hollow architecture due to the utilization of Mo-based POMs as the guest and removal of excess organic solvent molecules during the selenization process. In this step, Zn2+ clusters react with Se to convert ZnSe nanoparticles and the Mo species in the precursor is reduced in situ from +6 to +4 to form a laminar MoSe2 phase synchronously. Moreover, ZnSe possesses the cubic crystal structure refined to the F3m space group. Besides, MoSe2, as a typical 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenide, exhibits an evident sandwich-like layered structure. Thus, we can clearly observe that few layered molybdenum selenide is uniformly embedded around small zinc selenide nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix (Fig. 3c). As depicted in Fig. 3d, the lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.17 nm match well with the (220) and (331) planes of ZnSe, respectively. Besides, the lattice fringe of MoSe2 is estimated to be 0.64 nm which is consistent with the (002) interlayer spacing. In addition, the particle size of ZnSe in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is ca. 10 nm. Meanwhile, it can also be noticed that the thickness of MoSe2 is about 1–4 layers, which is in accordance with the XRD result for the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite. Therefore, the absence of the (002) crystal plane of MoSe2 in Fig. 1 is due to well encapsulated MoSe2 in the carbon matrix and the few layer structure of MoSe2. Functional POMs are well suited to act as the flexible and tunable guest. Thus, Mo-based POMs play a special responsive role linked to ZIF-8, and employing polymetallic MOF co-precursors provides the extra space to finely harmonize the nanostructures. Besides, the SEM and TEM images of the precursor of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are shown in Fig. S1.† It is found that the hollow porous structure existed before the selenization process and was well maintained after the calcining process. Thereby, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C structure is obtained via continuous growth of PMA/ZIF-8 to derive few-layer MoSe2 around a ZnSe nanoparticle in the carbon matrix, as revealed by the SEM and TEM results, and is beneficial for the increase of surface chemical reactions, enlargement of ion storage sites and shortening of the diffusion paths. Moreover, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) image further provides evidence of the homogeneous distribution of Zn, Mo, Se and C elements (Fig. 4). These results reveal that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is composed of few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nanoparticles and is homogeneously confined in the porous carbon matrix. Meanwhile, EDS analysis demonstrates that the atomic ratio between Zn and Mo is around 1.42:1 (Fig. S2†).\nIn Raman spectra (Fig. S3†), two broad peaks of D and G bands at 1330 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are observed, which are generally assigned to a substantial defect or disordered site and the graphitic structure, respectively. The intensity ratios of the D and G peaks (ID/IG ratios) indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials. The ID/IG ratio of ZnSe/MoSe2@C of 0.94 implies amorphous and disordered structures in the carbon matrix. Similarly, ZnSe@C (ID/IG = 0.96) shows a character of amorphous carbon. In Fig. S4,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows a larger BET specific surface area and pore volume (70.1 m2 g−1 and 0.46 cm3 g−1) than those of ZnSe@C (47.7 m2 g−1 and 0.32 cm3 g−1). The large specific surface area and hollow porous structure can increase the electrochemically active sites and the accessibility of the electrolyte for lithium and sodium storage and facilitate Li+/Na+ diffusion.\nThe XPS spectra can reveal useful details on the composition evolution on the surfaces of ZnSe/MoSe2@C (Fig. 5). Two typical peaks at around 1021.55 and 1044.7 eV are observed in Fig. 5a, representing Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and exhibiting characteristics of the Zn2+ selenidation state. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the signals of Mo 3d are resolved into three components at 228.7, 231.8 and 235.4 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 Mo 3d3/2 and Mo–O–C, respectively. Among them, the presence of the primary doublet peaks is trapped at around 228.7 and 231.8 eV, which confirms the existence of Mo4+ in MoSe2. Moreover, two peaks located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV are assigned, which are characteristic of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c. The signal areas were also investigated in the spectra of Se 3d by a deconvolution analysis. The result reveals that the area ratio of Se 3d5/2:Se 3d3/2 is 3:2, and the distance between two separated tracks is 0.9 eV. It can also be ascribed to the typical feature of Se2−, which corresponds to metal–selenium bonds of ZnSe and MoSe2. Three peaks at 284.5, 285.2, and 288.3 eV are recorded from the asymmetric C 1s peak, corresponding to C–C, C–OH/C–O–Mo, and CO bonds, respectively (Fig. 5d). Besides, the atomic content ratio of Zn and Mo in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite is estimated to be ca. 1.5:1 through XPS measurements, and corresponds well to the result of EDS analysis. In addition, the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C was carried out on an elemental analyser (Elementar vario EL cube). According to the results of elemental analysis, the carbon contents are ca. 11.5 and 15.6 wt% for ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C, respectively (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S5,† the high-resolution spectra of N 1s showed that the N atom contained the forms of pyridinic N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.3 eV), and graphitic N (401.2 eV), indicating the existence of the N element in ZnSe/MoSe2@C. Based on the results of the elemental analysis of ZnSe/MoSe2@C, the N element content on the ZnSe/MoSe2@C composite is ca. 6.76 wt%. The introduction of N doping can improve the surface wettability of the carbon composite with the electrolyte, and create more defects and active sites for lithium/sodium storage. The N species mainly derived from the ligand (2-methylimidazole).\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Li-ion batteries\nThe electrochemical properties of the anode were evaluated using half cells in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li+/Li (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the initial three CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. ZnSe/MoSe2@C reveals two obvious irreversible peaks at approximately 1.54 V and near 1.62 V, which belong to the transformation of lithium into interstitials in ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively, in the initial cathodic cycle. Two peaks at 0.87 and 0.59 V are attributed to the formation of Li2Se/Zn and the formation of Li2Se/Mo through further conversion of ZnSe and MoSe2, respectively. In the meantime, the growth of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) causes an initial irreversible capacity loss. The occurrence of the multi-step alloy reaction between Li and Zn is observed below 0.5 V. The slope shape is centered below 0.2 V, which is attributed to sectional Li+ insertion into the porous carbon. Several small oxidation peaks at 0.31 and 0.68 V are recorded, corresponding to the multi-step de-alloying reaction of LiZn alloys in the anodic process. Distinct peaks at 1.35 and 2.51 V can be attributed to the oxidation of Zn and Li2Se into ZnSe and the probable oxidation of Li2Se into selenium (from ZnSe). Meanwhile, the oxidation peak at 2.21 V represents the oxidation of Mo into MoSe2, accompanied by the conversion of LiSe into selenium (from MoSe2) at 1.85 V. The main cathodic peaks are obviously shifted to high potentials and become slightly wider during following cycles, probably because of architecture variation from the conversion reaction and the existence of pseudocapacitive behavior. The intensities and integral areas of peaks are much the same in subsequent laps, suggesting the good reversibility of lithium insertion/extraction reactions in the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. The redox process of ZnSe/MoSe2@C can be formulated using multiple steps as in the following equations:\nZnSe:\nMoSe 2 :\nThe typical charge/discharge curves of ZnSe/MoSe2@C at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Li/Li+) are shown in Fig. 6b. The first discharge curve exhibits several small voltage plateaus. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode shows an initial discharge capacity of about 1031 mA h g−1. The capacity irreversibility within the first cycle is caused by the formation of the SEI layer and an irreversible reaction. In the subsequent cycles, the discharge slopes of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode are stable at around 0.5–0.01 V. Compared to that in the first cycle, the discharge capacity still reaches 1051 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, indicating the good reversibility of ZnSe/MoSe2@C during the charge and discharge process. It can be deduced that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C material is suitable to function as a negative electrode material for LIBs. It agrees well with the results of the CV curves, implying the exultant reversible performance.\nThe cycling performances at current densities of 0.2 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 7a and b. They reveal the superior cycling performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode compared to that of the ZnSe@C electrode for LIBs. Obviously, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers high capacities of 1051 mA h g−1 and 874 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 for 150 cycles and 200 cycles, respectively. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode shows relatively poor cycling performance. The discharge capacities are 361 and 490 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. As revealed, the superiority of ZnSe/MoSe2@C in terms of the rate capability is very apparent. Fig. 7c demonstrates that the reversible capacities of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are 701, 660, 538, 460 and 363 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. More strikingly, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode even maintains an increasing capacity of 859 mA h g−1 when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, implying its outstanding reversibility and cycling stability. In contrast, the ZnSe@C electrode delivered much lower capacities of 441, 297, 237, 202, 165 and 201 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The ZnSe@C electrode also displays a lower capacity of 333 mA h g−1 when the current density is further reduced stepwise to 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits a superior stable capacity of 524 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 even after 600 cycles, as shown in Fig. 7d. Impressively, the initial coulombic efficiency of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode reaches 70% and nearly 92% in the 2nd cycle. With cycling, the CEs of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C anode are endearingly increased up to approximately 100% just after following several charge–discharge cycles. This should be beneficial for efficient permeation of the electrolyte and a fast multi-electron transfer process owing to the confinement of few layer MoSe2 cleverly around ZnSe nanoparticles within the porous carbon matrix. These features underline the great potential of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as a promising anode for advanced LIBs with long-term cycling properties, especially at high rates.\nTo gain further insight into the reason for the high capacity, the CV curves of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 are recorded (Fig. 8a). The correlation of the storage system obeys the following two equations:\nwhere i is the peak current, v stands for the scan rate, and both a and b are regulable constant parameters. According to the relationship between logi and logv of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 8c), the adjustable b values were 0.71 (peak-1), 0.72 (peak-2), and 0.74 (peak-3), respectively, indicating the fast kinetics of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode, which results from the synergistic effects of diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive behaviors. In contrast, Fig. 8b and d show lower calculated b values of 0.63 (peak-1), 0.31 (peak-2) and 0.52 (peak-3) for ZnSe@C electrodes. Therefore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode is allocated to the diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitance response, which gives rise to the increased capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C. The above results prove that gradual rising cycle curve of ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (Fig. 7d) is ascribed to the partial pseudocapacitive contribution.\nIn general, to evaluate the deeper total contribution of the composite, the ratio of the capacitor capacity and diffusion-controlled capacity can be quantitatively calculated based on the following equation:\nwhere k1ν stands for the capacitance-controlled effects and k2ν1/2 corresponds to the diffusion-controlled insertion processes, respectively (Fig. 8e and f). As the scan rate of ν increased (from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1), the capacitive contribution of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode increased from 29%, 37%, 50%, 74% to 82% gradually. In comparison, the ZnSe@C electrode capacitive contributions are 4%, 12%, 18%, 30% and 36%, respectively. The results faithfully prove that few layered MoSe2 and the in situ generated porous carbon network effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode.\nTo analyze the underlying mechanism, EIS measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 9a, the EIS plots of two electrodes are constituted by the internal resistance (Rs), the impedance (Rf) of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge-transfer impedance (Rct).Table 1 shows that the charge transfer resistance of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode (32.5 Ω) is smaller than that of ZnSe@C (35.2 Ω) due to few layer MoSe2 being confined within the ZnSe–C hollow microsphere and the coated in situ generated carbon matrix, which could accelerate the electrolytic infiltration and diffusion of Li+. Then, for the skew line at the low frequency region, ZnSe/MoSe2@C displays the highest slope angle of the linear Warburg parts, indicating the enhanced ion/electrolyte reaction kinetic diffusion. The special structure could also prevent the volume expansion of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite during Li+ insertion/extraction, which aggressively improves the cycling stabilization of the electrode. The structural and mechanical stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite was confirmed by the SEM analysis of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode after a 50 cycle test at 0.2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 9b, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite mainly retains its original morphology and microstructure. The result also reflects that the ZnSe/MoSe2@C sample possesses high reversible structure stability during the lithium storage processes.\n\nElectrochemical performance of ZnSe/MoSe2@C as the anode of Na-ion batteries\nIn addition to the measurements in LIBs, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite also displays good cycling and rate performance for SIBs. The electrochemical properties of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C nanocomposite and the corresponding SIB test results are shown in Fig. 10.\nThe electrochemical reaction mechanism was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 10a). In the first cathodic cycle, the two weak peaks located at ca. 1.23 and 1.62 V can be attributed to the Na+ ion conversion from trigonal prismatic (2H) 2H-MoSe2 interlayers to an octahedral (1T) structure of NaxMoSe2. The formation of Mo/Na2Se results in the appearance of a peak at ca. 0.7 V, while Na+ ions further intercalate into MoSe2 layers. One irreversible peak at around 0.5 V is associated with the formation of the SEI because of the decomposition of the electrolyte. Another strong cathodic peak at ca. 0.28 V is recorded, corresponding to the conversion reaction of ZnSe into Zn/Na2Se, accompanied by the formation of a Na–Zn alloy. In the subsequent anodic scan, the two peaks are attributed to the de-alloying reaction of NaZn alloys (0.28 V) and regeneration of ZnSe (0.98 V). The broad peaks at 1.65 V accompanied by a shoulder at 2.06 V can be assigned to the existence of intermediates and oxidation of Mo into MoSe2. It is worth noting that partial anodic peaks shift to a high potential in the 2nd and 3rd CV cycles, implying that there is an activation process for the electroactive materials in the initial cycle. These CV curves except for the first cycle almost overlap with other, indicating the excellent reversibility. The peak shift in the CV curves matches well with voltage plateaus in the corresponding galvanostatic discharge and charge processes (Fig. 10b). As shown in Fig. 10(b and c), ZnSe/MoSe2@C shows similar low discharge plateaus at about 0.3 V, which corresponds well to the cathode curve in CV graphs. Furthermore, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 532 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 within a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (versus Na/Na+). After 50 cycles, ZnSe/MoSe2@C maintains a large reversible capacity of 468 mA h g−1, which is one of the highest values for ZnSe-based anode materials for SIB applications reported so far.\nRate capability is another important aspect in anode materials for SIBs. The rate performances of ZnSe/MoSe2@C and ZnSe@C are evaluated at different current densities from 0.1 to 4 A g−1 (Fig. 10d). The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode exhibits decent reversible capacities of 456, 389, 400, 376, 352, and 328 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1, respectively. These values are higher than the values of 439, 387, 343, 296, 248, and 196 mA h g−1 for the ZnSe@C electrode at the same current densities. Moreover, ZnSe/MoSe2@C even maintains an increasing capacity when the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, revealing great reversibility and cycling stability of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. To examine the high-rate cycling stability, the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode was further cycled at a high current density of 4 A g−1. The ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode retains an excellent reversible capacity of 381 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency, corresponding to negligible capacity loss. The above results verify that ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibits better cycling and rate performance than the ZnSe@C electrode. The stability of the charge transfer process is well studied by EIS analysis within the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential (Fig. 10f), and is helpful in disclosing the reasons why the ZnSe/MoSe2@C Na-ion half-cell can maintain remarkable rate performance based on the electrochemistry. Impedance parameters from an equivalent circuit model are calculated, and they are similar to those of LIBs (Table 2). The Rct and Rf values of ZnSe/MoSe2@C are smaller than those of ZnSe@C before cycling. Moreover, the slant line of the relationship between Zw (real part of the impedance spectra) and ω−1/2 (angular frequency = 2πf) is closely related to the ion diffusion within the anode material. The Warburg coefficients σ are determined from Zwvs. ω−1/2 in the low frequency region. As shown in Fig. S6,† ZnSe/MoSe2@C exhibited a lower slope than ZnSe@C, indicating the facilitation of ion transportation of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Thus, the existence of the hollow porous carbon matrix can improve the structural stability and electronic conductivity of the ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode. Such facile migration of Na+ in MOF-derived few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow sphere structure is decent. It demonstrates that a unique multi-component coordination can promote fast ion diffusion kinetics and increase the electrochemical conductivity.\nAs graphically illustrated in the schematic diagram (Scheme 2), lithium/sodium ions are partially stored on the surface of few-layer MoSe2 and the porous carbon matrix in a pseudocapacitive pattern. The rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere exhibits the distinctive high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. On one hand, the unique design theoretically ensures that the architecture efficiently alleviates the volume expansion during the charge–discharge process and prevents aggregation of nanoparticles. On the other hand, owing to the synergistic effect of various components, more capacity storage sites from few-layer MoSe2 and ultra-small ZnSe nano-crystals can supply pseudocapacitance-type active sites and shorten the electron transfer paths, thereby enhancing the rate capability. The N doped well-connected carbon matrix can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode, and meanwhile prevent the nano-components from aggregation and pulverization upon long-term cycling and the high-rate charge–discharge process. Notably, the electrochemical performance of the novel few-layer MoSe2 confined within the ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere electrode is comparable with those of other previously reported related electrodes for LIBs/SIBs (Table S2†).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

It is obvious that the rGO agglomerates together and large-sized SnO2/rGO blocks can be observed in the H-SnO2/rGO composite. After the addition of the ionic liquid [BMIM]N(CN)2, a more uniform 2D flake-like morphology was obtained due to the stabilization effect of [Bmim]N(CN)2 for rGO during the hydrothermal process (Fig. 1a and b). On the one hand, the [Bmim] cation can be attracted by the anion groups of the GO layers. The electrostatic interaction between positive [Bmim] and negative GO facilitates the insertion of [Bmim]N(CN)2 between GO layers, leading to the better dispersion of GO. On the other hand, [Bmim]N(CN)2 plays a great role as a surfactant, which helps to inhibit the aggregation of the SnO2 nanoparticles during the hydrothermal process, leading to an ultrafine morphology of the obtained IL-SnO2/N-rGO as shown in Fig. 1d. The particle size distribution is shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. S2† with H-SnO2/rGO (Fig. 1f) as a comparison. It is obvious that the average particle size of IL-SnO2/N-rGO is 3–7 nm, while that of the SnO2 nanoparticles in H-SnO2/rGO mainly ranges between 5 and 9 nm. The smaller-sized structure might be more favorable for the high rate capability due to its ultrafine particle sizes with a shorter transport distance for e− and Na+ transport as well as a larger electrode/electrolyte area. Moreover, the smaller particle size will benefit the kinetics of the electrode by increasing the faradaic reactions occurring at the surface of the material. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 1c also shows the detailed morphology of SnO2 nanoparticles on the rGO sheets. It can be observed that SnO2 nanoparticles uniformly anchored on the N-rGO sheets. Notably, the tightly wrapped rGO on SnO2 can act as a buffer layer to alleviate the volume expansion during the charge/discharge process, leading to an impressive cycling stability. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO were investigated as shown in Fig. 1h and Fig. S1c,† respectively. The interplanar spacings of 0.335 nm and 0.264 nm are attributed to the (110) and (101) planes of SnO2. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1g) further demonstrates the polycrystalline structure of SnO2 and all diffraction rings are indexed to the diffraction peaks of the (110), (101), (211) and (301) planes in the rutile SnO2 phase. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 1i) confirm the uniform distribution of C, N, O, and Sn elements in the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite.\nThe composition and crystal structure of the prepared IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO composites were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 2a. It is clear that all the diffraction peaks of both IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO are well-indexed to the rutile structure of SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445). For the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite, broader and lower intensity peaks can be observed than those of the H-SnO2/rGO composite, indicating the smaller size of SnO2 particles in the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite. Although diffraction peaks for N-rGO were not observed obviously in XRD, the existence of N-rGO could be verified using the Raman spectra in Fig. 2b. Two peaks located at 1345 and 1585 cm−1 are attributed to the disorder-induced D and graphitic G bands of reduced graphene oxide. The intensity ratios of the D band and G band (ID/IG) for IL-SnO2/N-rGO (1.30) and H-SnO2/rGO (1.45) are both higher than that of GO (0.85), indicating the successful reduction of GO. Notably, the ID/IG reflects the crystallinity of carbon materials. The lower ID/IG ratio (1.30) of IL-SnO2/N-rGO indicates the higher crystallinity of rGO than that of H-SnO2/rGO (1.45), which can effectively enhance the kinetics of the electrode.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to further clarify the chemical structure and the chemical bonding configuration of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO (Fig. S3†), with IL-N-rGO (Fig. S4†) as the control material synthesized by the same ionic liquid assisted process but without SnO2. As shown in Fig. 2c, the survey spectrum of IL-SnO2/N-rGO demonstrates the presence of Sn, O, C and N elements. Two peaks located at 495.2 eV and 486.7 eV in Fig. 2d are ascribed to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 for SnO2 in the composite, which is also observed in H-SnO2/rGO (Fig. S3b†). Fig. 2e shows the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s, in which five peaks at 284.3 eV, 284.9 eV, 285.8 eV, 287.6 eV and 288.5 eV can be assigned to C–C, CN, C–N, CO and O–CO, respectively. The existence of CN and C–N indicates the polymerization of N(CN)2 anions during the hydrothermal and calcination processes. Furthermore, the high-resolution spectrum of N 1s in Fig. 2f displays four peaks, which correspond to NC (398.5 eV) in the cyclic structure, pyridinic N (399.6 eV), pyrrolic N (400.2 eV) and quaternary structure N (400.8 eV), respectively. It is notable that the N of CN in the cyclic structure/–CN and pyridinic N are primary types in the composite, also indicating its polymerization under high temperature conditions. The similar high-resolution spectra of C and N in IL-N-rGO (Fig. S4†) also demonstrate the great role of the N(CN)2 anions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were adopted to further study the structural configuration of IL-SnO2/N-rGO. As shown in Fig. 2g, the characteristic peaks of –CH3 (2926 cm−1), –CH2– (2853 cm−1), CC (1633 cm−1), C–N (1568 and 1465 cm−1) and CN (1314 cm−1) can be observed in IL-SnO2/N-rGO, which can be assigned to N-rGO. It is worth mentioning that the content of N in the composite is evaluated to be 12.6 at% from the XPS data. The high content of N doping will enable a surface-controlled process, which will ensure the pseudocapacitive Na+ storage contribution. Then, the total contents of SnO2 in IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shown in Fig. 2i. The TGA curve of H-SnO2/rGO displays two stages of weight loss. The weight loss of 1.1% below 100 °C is due to the removal of absorbed water, and the subsequent loss of 18.4% can be assigned to the combustion of rGO in the composite. Correspondingly, IL-SnO2/N-rGO shows a different TGA curve. The weight of absorbed water is about 1.3% and the weight of N-rGO is about 34.6%, which is higher than that of H-SnO2/rGO. The increased weight of rGO and the different loss curve both demonstrate the introduction of the N element and the polymerization of the N(CN)2 anions. Nitrogen isothermal adsorption/desorption measurements (Fig. S5†) were performed to further study the porous structure of IL-SnO2/N-rGO, H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO. It can be observed that H-SnO2/rGO exhibits a different isothermal curve from IL-SnO2/N-rGO and IL-N-rGO. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller calculation shows that the specific surface areas of IL-SnO2/N-rGO, H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO are 43.2 m2 g−1, 31.1 m2 g−1, and 40.9 m2 g−1, respectively. The higher surface area indicates the introduction of polymerized N(CN)2 anions. Pore size distributions were further analyzed by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT). Both IL-SnO2/N-rGO and IL-N-rGO possess a broad distribution in the mesopore range. Correspondingly, H-SnO2/rGO displays a narrow pore size centered at 5 nm. The higher surface area and wide distribution of mesopores are also desired for a fast kinetics of Na+ storage.\nThe electrochemical properties of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anode electrode in sodium ion batteries were first evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharge/charge tests in the voltage range of 0.005–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). In the first cathodic scanning, the reduction peaks ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 V can be attributed to the formation of an irreversible solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) and the irreversible conversion reaction of SnO2 to Sn. The reduction peaks between 0.5 V and 0.005 V are assigned to the alloying reaction of Na+ and Sn to NaxSn. Subsequently, wider peaks can be observed from 1.0 to 0.2 V, which could be attributed to the multi-step alloying reaction between Na and Sn. In addition, we noted that H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO did not exhibit obvious peaks between 1.0 and 0.2 V, indicating their poor electrochemical performances (Fig. S6 and S7†). In the anodic scanning, two obvious peaks located at 0.6 V and 1.2 V can be observed which are assigned to the reversible oxidation of Sn. The galvanostatic discharge/charge test displays a similar electrochemical process as CV curves. As displayed in Fig. S8,† IL-SnO2/N-rGO exhibits a high irreversible capacity in the initial cycle which can be attributed to the formation of the SEI and the irreversible conversion reaction of SnO2 to Sn. The low coulombic efficiency might be reduced by designing heterostructures, modifying the electrode, or adding electrolyte additives to suppress the formation of the SEI. From the second cycle, the charge and discharge capacities decrease to 449 mA h g−1 and 541.5 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.92%. The almost overlapped profiles in the following two cycles demonstrate its impressive reversibility (Fig. 3b).\nThe rate capability of SnO2/N-rGO for SIBs is then evaluated from 0.05 A g−1 to 2 A g−1 with H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO as a comparison as shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. S9.† It is apparent that the capacities of H-SnO2/rGO and IL-N-rGO decline rapidly as the current density increases (only 34.5 mA h g−1 80 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, respectively). By contrast, IL-SnO2/N-rGO exhibits much higher specific capacities of 494.6 mA h g−1, 427.8 mA h g−1, 377 mA h g−1, and 310 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 A g−1, respectively. Even at a high current density of 2 A g−1, SnO2/N-rGO still delivers a high capacity of 261.8 mA h g−1. It is noteworthy that when the current density returns to 50 mA g−1, a discharge capacity recovers to as high as 535.3 mA h g−1, indicating the good stability of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anode. The cycling stability of the electrode material is another significant parameter for performance judgment and it was evaluated at 500 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 3d. It can be observed that even at a rate of 500 mA g−1, a reversible capacity close to 189 mA h g−1 (ca. a decay of 0.264 mA h g−1 per cycle) was still obtained after 500 cycles, indicating the impressive cycling stabilities of IL-SnO2/rGO.\nThe structure stabilities were examined by ex SEM for the IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO electrodes after 30 cycles, respectively. As shown in Fig. S12 (a) and (b),† the cycled IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite retained its pristine morphology and no obvious cracks and agglomeration were observed on the surface of the material. However, the SEM image of H-SnO2/rGO shows that the electrode structure was severely damaged and the material aggregates together during cycling. The above analysis results further demonstrated the good connections between SnO2 particles and rGO in the IL-SnO2/N-rGO composite. The uniform distribution of SnO2 on N-rGO could maintain the structure stabilities and the existence of the N-graphene layer can act as the buffer layer to accommodate the volume change of SnO2, resulting in excellent cycling and rate performance in sodium ion batteries.\nIn order to figure out its high-rate and long-life performance, we studied the redox pseudocapacitance contribution in both IL-SnO2/N-rGO and H-SnO2/rGO electrodes by investigating the kinetics of the electrode based on CV tests. As shown in Fig. 4a, the CV curves of IL-SnO2/N-rGO exhibit a uniform shape for Na+ insertion/extraction processes from 0.1 mV s−1 to 1 mV s−1, indicating the same electrochemical reactions. The pseudocapacitive effect brought by the N-doped graphene and ultrafine nanoparticles was revealed by analyzing the b value using the i = avb formula. The b value can be obtained from the slope of the logi − logv plots. Typically, b = 0.5 indicates a diffusion-controlled process, while b = 1.0 represents a capacitive process. As shown in Fig. 4b, the b value of IL-SnO2/N-rGO is as high as 0.91 and 0.87 for peak 1 and peak 2, respectively, suggesting the high ratio of the contribution of capacitive processes. Moreover, we studied other b values at different potentials as shown in Fig. S11.† It is obvious that IL-SnO2/N-rGO shows higher b values than that of H-SnO2/rGO, revealing the more rapid reaction rate of IL-SnO2/N-rGO. The capacitive contributions at different scan rates were further quantified by using the formula i = k1v + k2v1/2. Based on the quantification, the capacitive contribution of 74% at 0.1 mV s−1 can be obtained and the percentage enlarges with the increased scan rate as shown in Fig. 4c. When the scan rate increases to 1 mV s−1, the contribution increased to 89% as revealed from the red region in Fig. 4d. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further employed to demonstrate the fast kinetics of IL-SnO2/N-rGO. Fig. S12† shows the Nyquist plots at open circuit voltages in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 mHz. Both plots are made up of a semicircle and a straight line. The diameter of the semicircle in the high-frequency region reveals the charge transfer resistance, of which we can see a lower value in IL-SnO2/N-rGO compared to that in H-SnO2/N-rGO. Moreover, the straight line in the low-frequency region can be attributed to the Warburg impedance. The steeper slope presents a nearly ideal capacitive behavior in IL-SnO2/N-rGO, indicating a characteristic of superior Na+ diffusion.\nIn consideration of the impressive performance of IL-SnO2/N-rGO in half batteries, a full SIB cell was assembled using IL-SnO2/N-rGO as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF, a theoretical capacity of 130 mA h g−1) as the cathode. Fig. 5a shows the galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles of IL-SnO2/N-rGO and NVPOF electrodes in half cells and the assembled full cell. The full cell was cycled in the range of 1.0–4.2 V and shows an average output voltage of around 2.5 V. The rate performance shown in Fig. 5b reveals that capacities of 270 mA h g−1 at 0.12 A g−1, 210 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1, 183 mA h g−1 at 0.6 A g−1, 159 mA h g−1 at 1.2 A g−1 and 133 mA h g−1 at 2.4 A g−1 are obtained. The cycling performance of the full cell at 0.3 A g−1 was evaluated as shown in Fig. 5c. It can be seen that the full cell keeps a specific capacity of 156.8 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, with a capacity retention of 74.3%. The above results proved the feasibility of the practical use of the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anode.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The prepared graphene oxide was dispersed in moderate deionized water to form a graphene oxide suspension (15 mg mL−1). Then, 6 ml ionic liquid ([BMIM]N(CN)2) was added into the above GO suspension to form a homogeneous solution mixture (IL-GO suspension) under ultrasonication. At the same time, 0.225 g SnCl2·2H2O was dissolved in 3 ml deionized water by agitating. Then, SnCl2 solution was dropped into the IL-GO suspension slowly and after that, the resulting solution mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature on a magnetic stirrer. The final solution was poured into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept for 12 h at 180 °C. A black solid product was collected by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water several times. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum conditions, the precursor was calcined at 500 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere in a tube furnace. H-SnO2/rGO was prepared without an ionic liquid for comparison. IL-N-rGO was prepared without adding SnCl2·2H2O.\n\nMaterial characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared materials. The surface morphology and structure of the prepared material were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on a Nova Nano SEM 450 and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on a Tecnai G2 F30. Raman spectra were obtained using a Raman spectrometer (a Digilab FTS3500). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed on an ESCALAB250 electron spectrometer under the measurement conditions of Al Kα radiation (15 kV, 150 W, 500 μm). Thermogravimetric (TG) data were obtained using the DSC1 instrument under air from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nThe electrode was obtained by mixing 70% active material, 20% Super P as a conducting agent and 10% polyvinylidene fluoride as a binder in moderate N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP). The obtained slurry was coated on a copper foil and then the electrode was dried at 80 °C and kept for 16 h under vacuum. The loading mass of active materials in each electrode is around 2.0–2.5 mg cm−2. And the specific capacity in our work was calculated based on the mass of the SnO2/rGO composite. The half cells were assembled with the as-prepared electrode as the working electrode, glass fiber as the separator, sodium as the counter/reference electrode and 1 M NaClO4 in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte in an argon-filled glove box (O2 ≦ 0.1 ppm, H2O ≦ 0.1 ppm). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out between 0.005 and 3 V on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at different scan rates. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument in the potential window of 0.005–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). The electrochemical impedance was tested on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at an amplitude voltage of 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\nFor the Na-ion full cell tests, Na3V2(PO4)2O2F was used as the cathode material. The cathode was prepared by mixing 70% Na3V2(PO4)2O2F material, 20 wt% acetylene black, and 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) dissolved in deionized water. Then, the slurry was pasted on aluminum foil. The preparation process of the anode for the full cell is the same as the electrode for the half cell while the binder was replaced by 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The mass ratio of the cathode to anode was 3:1. Before full-cell fabrication, all anodes should be pre-sodiated chemically. The pre-sodiation for the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anodes can stabilize the electrode surface and activate the materials. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument between 1.0 and 4.2 V.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The obtained slurry was coated on a copper foil and then the electrode was dried at 80 °C and kept for 16 h under vacuum. The loading mass of active materials in each electrode is around 2.0–2.5 mg cm−2. And the specific capacity in our work was calculated based on the mass of the SnO2/rGO composite. The half cells were assembled with the as-prepared electrode as the working electrode, glass fiber as the separator, sodium as the counter/reference electrode and 1 M NaClO4 in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte in an argon-filled glove box (O2 ≦ 0.1 ppm, H2O ≦ 0.1 ppm). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out between 0.005 and 3 V on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at different scan rates. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument in the potential window of 0.005–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). The electrochemical impedance was tested on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation at an amplitude voltage of 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\nFor the Na-ion full cell tests, Na3V2(PO4)2O2F was used as the cathode material. The cathode was prepared by mixing 70% Na3V2(PO4)2O2F material, 20 wt% acetylene black, and 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) dissolved in deionized water. Then, the slurry was pasted on aluminum foil. The preparation process of the anode for the full cell is the same as the electrode for the half cell while the binder was replaced by 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The mass ratio of the cathode to anode was 3:1. Before full-cell fabrication, all anodes should be pre-sodiated chemically. The pre-sodiation for the IL-SnO2/N-rGO anodes can stabilize the electrode surface and activate the materials. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a Land CT2001A battery instrument between 1.0 and 4.2 V.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The prepared graphene oxide was dispersed in moderate deionized water to form a graphene oxide suspension (15 mg mL−1). Then, 6 ml ionic liquid ([BMIM]N(CN)2) was added into the above GO suspension to form a homogeneous solution mixture (IL-GO suspension) under ultrasonication. At the same time, 0.225 g SnCl2·2H2O was dissolved in 3 ml deionized water by agitating. Then, SnCl2 solution was dropped into the IL-GO suspension slowly and after that, the resulting solution mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature on a magnetic stirrer. The final solution was poured into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept for 12 h at 180 °C. A black solid product was collected by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water several times. After drying at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum conditions, the precursor was calcined at 500 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere in a tube furnace. H-SnO2/rGO was prepared without an ionic liquid for comparison. IL-N-rGO was prepared without adding SnCl2·2H2O.\n\nMaterial characterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared materials. The surface morphology and structure of the prepared material were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on a Nova Nano SEM 450 and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on a Tecnai G2 F30.

In the first step, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, glucose, and melamine were annealed at 800 °C to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. The XRD pattern is displayed in Fig. 1a, in which the diffraction peaks are in good accordance with metallic Co. Then, CoS2@GC@B-CNT was acquired after thermal treatment via a sulfidation process. From the XRD pattern of CoS2@GC@B-CNT (Fig. 2a), the major peaks of CoS2@GC@B-CNT corresponded to CoS2. The wide diffraction peak at 26.1° is observed and corresponds to the (002) plane of graphite. The morphology of the carbon nanotubes is unchanged before and after the sulfidation process (Fig. 1b and 2b). The TEM images confirm that CoS2 nanoparticles are completely encapsulated in B-CNT (Fig. 2c and d) and the void in the B-CNT could buffer the volume change of CoS2 in the course of the conversion reaction. Furthermore, B-CNT could provide facile electronic and ionic transport, improving the conductivity of the material. Fig. 2e shows that the CoS2 nanoparticles are surrounded by GC, and the lattice spacing of 0.247 and 0.226 nm associate with the interplanar distance of the (210) and (211) planes, respectively. In the meantime, the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm ascribes to the interplanar distance of the (002) plane of carbon. The GC originating from the catalysis of Co nanocrystals during the thermal treatment can improve the electrical conductivity and prevent the agglomeration of CoS2 nanoparticles. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 2f) further demonstrate that the CoS2 nanoparticles were encapsulated in B-CNT. The carbon content in CoS2@GC@B-CNT is confirmed to be 41.9% (Fig. 3). For comparison, bare CoS2 particles and CoS2 composite mixed with commercial CNT (CoS2/CNT) were prepared and the XRD patterns are displayed in Fig. S1.† To characterize the porous structure in detail, N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out (Fig. 4). The Co@GC@B-CNT possesses a mesoporous structure and the size of the majority of pores is about 2.0 nm (Fig. 4a). After the sulfidation process, the pore size distribution curve of the CoS2@GC@B-CNT displays that the pore size of samples is about 3.5 nm (Fig. 4b). The increased pore volume is due to the etching effect of H2S derived from thiourea decomposition during the sulfidation process, which can expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, contributing to the sodiation/desodiation process.\nThe surface chemistry of CoS2@GC@B-CNT was analysed by XPS (Fig. S2†). The Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 5a) is divided into two groups of peaks. The first group of peaks at 779.2, 780.0, and 781.4 eV is associated with the spin–orbit peaks of Co 2p3/2. The peak at 779.2 eV is assigned to Co2+ and 781.4 eV is put down to the satellite peak of Co 2p3/2. Additionally, the peak at 780.0 eV is attributed to the existence of Co–NH bonds. Another group of peaks at 795.0 is assigned to the Co 2p1/2 level and 799.0 eV corresponds to its satellite peak. The S 2p spectrum is made up of two peaks (Fig. 5b), the peak at 163.6 eV is assigned to S 2p3/2, while the peak at 164.8 eV is contributed by S 2p1/2. The C 1s spectrum includes two fitting peaks (Fig. 5c); they are C–C (284.8 eV) and C–N (285.8 eV). On the basis of XPS analysis, it can be confirmed that CoS2 nanoparticles have been favorably prepared, which is unanimous in the previous XRD and TEM analyses. Fig. 5d shows that the N 1s spectrum evinces the attendance of pyridinic (399.3 eV), pyrrolic (400.0 eV) and graphitic (401.9 eV) types of N. N doping could introduce more defective sites, which boost the sodium storage performance.\nThe CV test of CoS2@GC@B-CNT was conducted at 0.2 mV s−1 (Fig. S3†). The oxidation and reduction peaks are presented in the first cycle. The oxidation peaks are put down to the production of NaxCoS2 and CoS2. Moreover, the reduction peaks in the first cycle are different from those in the later cycles, which mainly ascribes to the activation process. In the second and third cycles, the peaks (0.89 and 1.36 V) stem from the conversion reaction (CoS2 + 4Na → Co + 2Na2S) and the peak at 0.52 V implies that Na+ intercalates into the GC. Fig. 6a displays first three charge and discharge curves. CoS2@GC@B-CNT delivers a reversible capacity of about 550 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. To clarify the capacity contribution of B-CNT, CoS2@GC@B-CNT was treated by an acid to remove CoS2. The XRD pattern (Fig. S4a†) shows that most of the CoS2 particles were removed by HCl and the morphology of the carbon nanotubes is not varied (Fig. S4b†). The electrochemical performance of individual B-CNT was measured at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S4c and d†); the capacity was approximately 150 mA h g−1 during 100 cycles. The carbon content of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is 41.9% (Fig. 3). Through calculation, the capacity contribution of carbon is about 62 mA h g−1, which indicates that the main capacity of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is contributed to CoS2. In Fig. 6b and S5,† the cycling performances of CoS2@GC@B-CNT, CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 are measured at 0.1 A g−1. It is obvious that the cycling stability of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is the best among them. The CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 present significant capacity fading during cycling, which indicates that CoS2 is the main capacity source of CoS2@GC@B-CNT.\nFig. 6c shows the rate performance of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. CoS2@GC@B-CNT shows the discharge capacities of 564.3, 518.5, 486.5, 471.0, 455.9, 438.0, 419.6 mA h g−1 at the rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The CoS2@GC@B-CNT electrode can hold 512.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Fig. 6d displays the relevant charge and discharge curves of CoS2@GC@B-CNT, which suggests its superior rate capability. In contrast, CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 electrodes show much lower capacities (Fig. S6†). The CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 samples retained capacities of 58.9 and 36.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. Fig. 6e exhibits a long-term cycling property of CoS2@GC@B-CNT, which demonstrates a capacity of 432.6 mA h g−1 after 900 cycles at 5 A g−1 and the capacity retention of 95.9%. In particular, the electrochemical property of CoS2@GC@B-CNT is eminent among other cobalt sulfide-based electrodes in the carbonate ester-based electrolyte for SIBs (Table S1†). The outstanding electrochemical performance is ascribed to the novel structure design of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. The synergetic actions of GC and B-CNT can improve the electrical conductivity, prevent the particle agglomeration and maintain structural stability of CoS2@GC@B-CNT during the sodiation/desodiation process. The EIS tests were investigated before and after different numbers of cycles. The Nyquist plots of the CoS2@GC@B-CNT electrode exhibit a semicircle and a following linear slope (Fig. 7). The semicircle region ascribes to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The Rct decreases after 50 cycles. Furthermore, after 100 cycles, the Rct displays just a small increase, suggesting a stable structure and good conductivity of the electrode. The reason can be ascribed to the composite electrode decorated with GC and B-CNT.\nTo investigate the cause of the good cycling stability of CoS2@GC@B-CNT electrode, the cells were disassembled at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. The CoS2@GC@B-CNT sustains structural integrity (Fig. 8a), further confirming the outstanding cycling performance of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. The detailed inner structure is shown in Fig. 8b where the CoS2 nanoparticles are encapsulated in B-CNT. Fig. 8c displays that the CoS2 nanoparticles are still surrounded by GC, which confirms that GC is stable during the charge/discharge process. Therefore, high stability is observed due to the double protection of GC and B-CNT. The elemental mapping images give the elemental distribution of Co, S, and C, which indicates that the CoS2 particles are still encapsulated in B-CNT (Fig. 8d). In contrast, CoS2/CNT and bare CoS2 present large volume expansion during the sodiation/desodiation process (Fig. S7†), which results in poor electrochemical properties.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.8 g), glucose (0.1 g) and melamine (8.0 g) were blended together in 50 mL deionized water under stirring for 1 h. The solution was dried at 80 °C for 1 h and annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in Ar gas to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. Then, 0.1 g of Co@GC@B-CNT and an appropriate amount of thiourea were placed in two separate crucible boats and treated at 450 °C for 4 h with thiourea at the upstream side in the pipe furnace under Ar atmosphere. In order to prepare B-CNT, the CoS2@GC@B-CNT samples were treated in 6.0 M HCl solution for 8 h under stirring, washed by deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To gain bare CoS2, 1.0 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and an appropriate amount of thiourea powder were annealed by the same protocol as for the synthesis of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. For the CoS2/CNT composite, 0.0581 g CoS2 was mixed with 0.0419 g commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe structures were detected through an XRD (Bruker D8 Advanced) operated within the 2θ range of 10–70°. The percentage of carbon in CoS2@GC@B-CNT was measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis. The samples were oxidized and annealed from 30 to 850 °C in air by a TG equipment (NETZSCH STA44C). The morphology was studied by SEM (HITACHI-SU8220) and TEM (JEM-2100F) with an EDS elemental mapping. XPS was tested by an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Analyzer ASAP 2460 equipment.\n\nElectrochemical tests\nThe anode electrodes were obtained by mixing the active material, Super-P and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 by weight). The slurry was coated on a Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of active materials based on the total weight of CoS2 and carbon was about 1.0–1.5 mg cm−2. The separator was a Whatman (GF/B) glass fiber. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (v/v = 1:1) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate. Sodium discs were the opposite electrode. Coin cells (CR 2032) were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox. Constant current charge/discharge measurements were checked on a battery test station (Neware Electronic Co.) from 0.01 to 3.00 V. CV was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760D) between 0.01 and 3.00 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1.

First, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.8 g), glucose (0.1 g) and melamine (8.0 g) were blended together in 50 mL deionized water under stirring for 1 h. The solution was dried at 80 °C for 1 h and annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in Ar gas to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. Then, 0.1 g of Co@GC@B-CNT and an appropriate amount of thiourea were placed in two separate crucible boats and treated at 450 °C for 4 h with thiourea at the upstream side in the pipe furnace under Ar atmosphere. In order to prepare B-CNT, the CoS2@GC@B-CNT samples were treated in 6.0 M HCl solution for 8 h under stirring, washed by deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To gain bare CoS2, 1.0 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and an appropriate amount of thiourea powder were annealed by the same protocol as for the synthesis of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. For the CoS2/CNT composite, 0.0581 g CoS2 was mixed with 0.0419 g commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe structures were detected through an XRD (Bruker D8 Advanced) operated within the 2θ range of 10–70°. The percentage of carbon in CoS2@GC@B-CNT was measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis. The samples were oxidized and annealed from 30 to 850 °C in air by a TG equipment (NETZSCH STA44C). The morphology was studied by SEM (HITACHI-SU8220) and TEM (JEM-2100F) with an EDS elemental mapping. XPS was tested by an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Analyzer ASAP 2460 equipment.\n\nElectrochemical tests\nThe anode electrodes were obtained by mixing the active material, Super-P and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 by weight). The slurry was coated on a Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of active materials based on the total weight of CoS2 and carbon was about 1.0–1.5 mg cm−2. The separator was a Whatman (GF/B) glass fiber. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (v/v = 1:1) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate. Sodium discs were the opposite electrode. Coin cells (CR 2032) were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox. Constant current charge/discharge measurements were checked on a battery test station (Neware Electronic Co.) from 0.01 to 3.00 V. CV was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760D) between 0.01 and 3.00 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1.

First, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.8 g), glucose (0.1 g) and melamine (8.0 g) were blended together in 50 mL deionized water under stirring for 1 h. The solution was dried at 80 °C for 1 h and annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in Ar gas to produce Co@GC@B-CNT. Then, 0.1 g of Co@GC@B-CNT and an appropriate amount of thiourea were placed in two separate crucible boats and treated at 450 °C for 4 h with thiourea at the upstream side in the pipe furnace under Ar atmosphere. In order to prepare B-CNT, the CoS2@GC@B-CNT samples were treated in 6.0 M HCl solution for 8 h under stirring, washed by deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. To gain bare CoS2, 1.0 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and an appropriate amount of thiourea powder were annealed by the same protocol as for the synthesis of CoS2@GC@B-CNT. For the CoS2/CNT composite, 0.0581 g CoS2 was mixed with 0.0419 g commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube.\n\nMaterial characterization\nThe structures were detected through an XRD (Bruker D8 Advanced) operated within the 2θ range of 10–70°. The percentage of carbon in CoS2@GC@B-CNT was measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis. The samples were oxidized and annealed from 30 to 850 °C in air by a TG equipment (NETZSCH STA44C). The morphology was studied by SEM (HITACHI-SU8220) and TEM (JEM-2100F) with an EDS elemental mapping. XPS was tested by an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Analyzer ASAP 2460 equipment.\n\nElectrochemical tests\nThe anode electrodes were obtained by mixing the active material, Super-P and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 by weight). The slurry was coated on a Cu foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of active materials based on the total weight of CoS2 and carbon was about 1.0–1.5 mg cm−2. The separator was a Whatman (GF/B) glass fiber. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (v/v = 1:1) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate. Sodium discs were the opposite electrode. Coin cells (CR 2032) were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox. Constant current charge/discharge measurements were checked on a battery test station (Neware Electronic Co.) from 0.01 to 3.00 V. CV was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760D) between 0.01 and 3.00 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. EIS was performed at frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 MHz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Hard carbon is widely recognized as one of the most attractive and ideal anode materials for SIBs. However, the potential required for sodium ions to insert into hard carbon is very close to that for sodium plating, resulting in sodium dendrites, which raise safety concerns. Moreover, the reaction of electrode materials with sodium through alloying or conversion mechanisms always results in serious volume changes in the process of sodium insertion and extraction. Therefore, insertion-type transition-metal oxides as anodes have attracted much attention owing to their suitable operating potentials and minor volume expansion. Recently, embedded titanium/vanadium/molybdenum based oxides with layered structures have been studied as anode materials for SIBs, such as layered Na2Ti3O7, tunnel Na2Ti6O13 ( ) and spinel Li4Ti5O12. In addition, post-spinel structured materials have been proposed, which show ultra-stable cycle performances via highly reversible sodium-ion insertion/desertion through large-size tunnels. Recently, in Zhou's group, NaVSnO4 ( ) and NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 ( ) have been prepared and they have been shown to possess robust cycle lifetimes (more than 10000 cycles) and discharge plateaus of 0.84 V and 0.7 V, respectively. Meanwhile, in our group, Na0.76Mn0.48Ti0.44O2 has been developed, which holds an initial discharge capacity of 103.4 mAh g−1, shows a superb rate capability and retains 74.9% capacity after 600 cycles. The large radius of the redox active metal center could optimize the tunnel size and thus boosting the electrochemical performance. It is also a big challenge to find further suitable active centers for insertion-type transition metal oxides as anodes of SIBs. Besides, a host of published reports have said that germanium-based materials can be used as alloy anodes for SIBs with highly reversible sodium storage properties and satisfactory ionic/electronic conductivity. However, it is unclear to us whether Ge could act as an active center in a transition-metal oxide anodes.\nIn this work, we fabricated a tunnel-type NaGe3/2Mn1/2O4 (NGMO) material. When used as the anode of SIBs, it delivers a sustained discharge capacity of 200.32 mAh g−1. Compared with NaVSnO4 ( ) and NaV1.25Ti0.75O4, NGMO delivers a lower safety voltage of 0.36 V. Pure Na4Ge9O20 (NGO) as a comparative sample, only exhibits a capacity of 24.8 mAh g−1, which is far inferior to that of NGMO. During discharge and charge process, reversible redox reactions around Ge center occur, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The introduction of Mn in the NGMO improves the reversibility of the Ge redox performance.\nThe structure of NGMO was carefully characterized by XRD, and Rietveld refinement was performed as depicted in Fig. 1. The main Bragg peaks of NGMO could be assigned to space groups of P1(2) and I41/a(88), which were fitted to give lattice parameters of a = 10.56/15.04 Å, b = 11.18/15.04 Å, and c = 9.22/7.39 Å, and a volume of 811.2/1672.2 Å3, respectively. Na4Ge9O20 has a typical tunnel structure, which consists of polymerized Ge/MnO4 tetrahedra connected with Ge/MnO6 octahedra. Four Ge/MnO6 octahedra are connected together by sharing edges to form a tetrameric (Ge/Mn)4O16 cluster. Each cluster is connected to six GeO4 tetrahedra, and adjacent clusters are connected by GeO4 tetrahedra. Na atoms are located in the channels and have elongated Na–O bonds. This highly stable crystal structure can effectively accelerate the migration of sodium ions. Fig. 2 shows the low and high magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of NGMO, which is composed of particles of different sizes from 1 to 3 μm; the larger particles are the result of sintering at high temperature. SEM images of NGO with different magnifications are given in Fig. S1,† and show that the average particle size of NGO is 1 μm.\nThe morphology and fine structure were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3a and b show the low magnification TEM images. It can be seen from the images that NGMO has an irregular sheet-like morphology with particle sizes from 250 nm to 2 μm. As shown in Fig. 3c, the lattice spacing of the (200) plane is 4.55 Å. In the SAED pattern of Fig. 3d, the red line corresponds to the (020) plane in NGMO, and the lattice spacing is 13.100 Å. These results clearly demonstrate that NGMO exhibits good crystallinity. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results, and Raman and infrared spectra (IR) are provided in Table S1 and Fig. S2.† The results indicate that the atomic ratio of Na:Ge:Mn is close to 1:1.5:0.5 and that there is little sodium loss. The Raman and IR peaks in the high frequency region are attributed to stretching vibrations of Ge–O–Ge and the peaks between 600 and 400 cm−1 are attributed to the bending vibrations of Ge–O–Ge in NGMO.\nGalvanostatic electrochemical measurements were evaluated in a voltage range of 0.05–2.0 V, with the current density of 20 mA g−1. Fig. 4a and b show the discharge and charge profiles of NGMO and NGO, respectively. Because of the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in the initial cycle, the electrochemical behaviour tends stabilize in the second cycle, so voltage profiles are given from the second cycle; the first cycles of the discharge–charge curves of NGMO and NGO materials are given in Fig. S3.† It can be seen intuitively that both NGMO and NGO have low voltage platforms, while NGMO has the smaller polarization. In Fig. 4a, we notice a reversible voltage profile in the second cycle with discharge capacity of 200.32 mAh g−1 for NGMO. Only NGMO has a flat potential platform and delivers an ultra-low plateau potential. It can be seen from Fig. 4b that NGO shows a capacity of 24.8 mAh g−1, obvious polarization at the 20th cycle and increased capacity due to the surface side-effect. Fig. 4c indicates that the capacity retention of the NGMO electrode after 50 cycles is 86.2%, which is superior to that of NGO; the coulombic efficiency of NGMO is also provided in Fig. S4.† To further understand the redox reactions along with the discharge/charge process in NGMO, Fig. 4d displays the differential capacity versus voltage (dQ/dV) curve. The clear anodic peak at 0.33 V and cathodic peak at 0.81 V correspond well with the redox reactions of NGMO.\nThe electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of fresh and cycled electrodes of NGMO and NGO, with a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz, are shown in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5a, it is obvious that the charge-transfer resistance of the fresh NGMO electrode is lower than that of NGO. This indicates that the migration of charges in the NGMO material occurs more easily than in NGO, which also facilitates the shifting of ions on the surface and inside of the electrodes of NGMO. In Fig. 5b, NGMO electrode in its 10th cycle exhibits a smaller charge-transfer resistance than both NGO and the NGMO fresh electrode, indicating that the surface of NGMO more readily forms a stable SEI film. The EIS results were fitted by the model shown in Fig. S5.† The fitting results are provided in Table S2.† The resistances of the fresh and cycled electrodes of NGMO and NGO are composed of an internal resistance (Rs), the resistance of the surface film (SEI) (Rf; a small semicircle in the high frequency region), the resistance of the charge transfer (Rct; another opposite semicircle in the middle frequency region), and the Warburg resistance (W; an oblique line in the low frequency region). Both the fresh and cycled electrodes of NGMO deliver lower charge transfer resistance than NGO. Meanwhile, the transfer resistance of the cycled NGMO electrode is lower than that of the fresh electrode and its slope at low frequency is higher than that of the fresh one (Table S2†). All these results show that NGMO has lower resistance and better electronic/ionic conductivity than NGO.\nThe evolution of the chemical valence states of the 150-times discharged electrodes were observed by XPS and SEM as provided in Fig. S6.† It is generally clear that the electrode surface was covered with a thick SEI layer after discharging. Ar plasma etching was used to obtain the internal information. The Ge 3d core-level of the discharged NGMO electrode with and without etching is shown in Fig. S7.† Before etching, the peaks of the Ge 3d core-level could be fitted to Ge1+ and Ge2+. After etching, (Fig. S7c†), the peaks at 30.8 eV and 30.2 eV were also associated with Ge1+ and Ge2+, respectively. This result indicates that the valence of Ge decreases as a whole and that there is no obvious difference between the etched and non-etched samples. The reversible redox reactions of Ge remain stable even after cycling. Meanwhile, the Mn 2p core-level spectra are shown in Fig. S7d–f.† For the Mn 2p core level, owing to the spin orbit coupling, the valence states of Mn comprise two couples including Mn3+ and Mn2+ (Fig. S7e and f†). The binding energies of Mn3+ are 642.37 eV and 654.04 eV, and the binding energies of Mn2+ are 640.71 eV and 652.18 eV. Similarly, after discharging, the binding energies of Mn3+ are 642.40 eV and 654.06 eV, and those for Mn2+ are 640.69 eV and 652.20 eV, indicating that there are no changes in Mn binding energies before and after etching. This is in good agreement with results in previous reports. All results also show that a thin SEI layer has been formed, favoring ions transfer on the repeatedly cycled electrode. It can be seen from the refined XRD results that NGMO consists of Ge4+, Mn2+ and Mn3+, and combined with XPS analysis, the results show that the valence states of Mn does not change for the discharged NGMO electrode. Ge displays electrochemical activity in NGMO, and Mn exhibits good chemical stability in the framework.\n\n\nConclusions\nTunnel-type NGMO has been prepared and investigated as an anode for SIBs for the first time. The discharge/charge curve shows an ultra-low operating potential and high capacity. The second discharge capacity of NGMO reaches 200.32 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, while pure NGO only delivers a capacity of 24.8 mAh g−1. Ge is involved in redox reactions in NGMO upon Na insertion/extraction, and the valence state of the Mn element experiences no change during discharging and charging. The Mn serves as a stabilizer in the framework during cycling; the introduction of Mn can significantly boost the reversible Na-storage capability of NGMO. This work indicates that Mn can participate in the Na-storage mechanism in inserted materials, and it provides a guideline for designing stable tunnel-structure Ge-based insertion-type anodes for SIBs.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Microstructure\nAs displayed in Fig. 1, the integrated preparation process is schematically described. Specifically, the Zn–G microspheres were obtained via the coordination reaction between zinc ions and glycerol. After the reflux condensation of the Zn–G precursor as a template with ammonium metavanadate, Zn–V–OH could be prepared and it inherited the spherical nanostructure. Finally, with the calcination of Zn–V–OH in air and subsequent carbon coating, the as-produced Zn3V3O8/NC microspheres assembled by nanosheets were successfully fabricated.\nTo verify the structural features during the whole synthetic process, powder XRD measurements of the products were conducted. As displayed in Fig. 2a, the hierarchical Zn–G precursor prepared by the hydrothermal method was validated to be glycerin zinc, in which all the peaks were in good agreement with C3H6O3Zn (JCPDS card no. 23-1975), different from some other amorphous metal–glycerin salts, such as Co–G, Mn–EG, and Mo–G. Similar to the above metal–glycerin salts, the proportion of organic components in Zn–G was approximately 50%, which could be proved by the TGA curve displayed in Fig. 2b. A good complexation reaction may occur between zinc ion and glycerol, followed by forming crystallographic C3H6O3Zn. With a self-assembly mechanism, the Zn–G nanosheets and microplates were first obtained, accompanied with the formation from nanoplates to microspheres. The specific process can be expressed by the following eqn (1):\nSubsequently, the XRD pattern of Zn–V–OH is displayed in Fig. 2c, from which we can conclude that the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O microspheres were successfully synthesized due to all the diffraction peaks corresponding to the JCPDS card no. 50-0570. In addition, the weight loss of about 11.6% of Zn–V–OH after annealing in air (Fig. 2d) might be assigned to the removal of absorbed and crystal water. The mechanism for the formation of Zn–V–OH can be described as the following eqn (2):\nAfter annealing the Zn–V–OH in air, the ZnVO mixed metallic oxide was obtained. As shown in Fig. S1,† all the main diffraction peaks at 16.7°, 25.8°, 28.6°, 28.7° and 29.5°, 34.9°, 36.0°, 43.1° can be indexed to the (11), (02), (002), (13) planes of Zn2V2O7 (JCPDS card no. 29-1396) and (131), (122), (320), (042) planes of Zn3(VO4)2 (JCPDS card no. 34-0378), respectively. There was no detection of residues, which validated that the hydroxide component had completely reacted with oxygen gas during the high-heat treatment. Finally, the PPY-decorated ZnVO composite was treated in argon gas under high temperature, and the two-phase ZnVO was transformed to single-phase Zn3V3O8. As shown in Fig. 2e, the five dominant peaks appearing at 30.1°, 35.5°, 43.1°, 56.9°, and 62.5° were completely consistent with the (220), (311), (400), (511), (440) planes of Zn3V3O8 (JCPDS card no. 31-1477). To further determine the loading amount of nitrogen-doped carbon in Zn3V3O8/NC, the TGA curve was obtained and is displayed in Fig. 2f, demonstrating an obvious two-step weight loss. Specifically, the decrease of 3.8 wt% below 200 °C may be due to the dissipation of absorbed water, while the other 19.3 wt% loss could be attributed to the oxidation of carbonaceous species. It is worth noting that the valence state of vanadium in ZnVO was +5, higher than that in Zn3V3O8/NC (+3 and +4 for vanadium), which could be ascribed to the reduction reaction originating from carbon at high temperature.\nThe specific chemical bonds and characteristic groups were explored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Fig. S2a† displays the absorption spectrum of Zn–G self-assembled microspheres. The peaks below 1000 cm−1 were considered the fingerprint area, representing the out-of-plane flexural vibration of the C–H bond. The existence of primary and secondary hydroxyls could be verified by the peaks at 1064 and 1124 cm−1, respectively. Furthermore, the two absorption peaks located at 1323 and 1353 cm−1 could be assigned to a nitro group (–O–NO2) due to the side reactions between the nitric acid by-product from zinc nitrate and excessive glycerol, which will form a variety of nitroglycerides, followed by their complete disappearance after the final oxidation reactions. Also, the peak at 1380 cm−1 was due to the in-plane bending vibration of C–H bond in methyl (–CH3). Notably, the peaks appearing from 2700 to 3000 cm−1 could be ascribed to the stretching vibration of C–H bond, among which the two peaks at 2845 and 2936 cm−1 indicated the presence of methylene (–CH2–). Then, the wide and large absorption band at approximately 3388 cm−1 demonstrated a multi-molecular association because of the hydrogen bonds formed between the hydroxyl groups (–OH). At the same time, the strong board peak appearing at about 3440 cm−1 in the FTIR curve of Zn–V–OH (Fig. S2b†) indicated the presence of –OH and absorbed water, corresponding to the XRD analysis shown in Fig. 2c. Furthermore, the fitted FTIR curve of the ZnVO/PPY composite suggested the formation of a successful hybrid of polypyrrole (Fig. S2c†). To be specific, the stretching vibration of –NH– could be reflected by the broad absorption peak at about 3450 cm−1, while the C–N and vibration of pyrrole ring may be verified by the peaks located at 1622 and 1037 cm−1. The out-of-plane deformation vibrations of C–H in the pyrrole ring could be represented by the two peaks at 938 and 1386 cm−1.\nAdditionally, laser Raman spectroscopy was performed to characterize the key features of the components for Zn3V3O8/NC. As displayed in Fig. S3b,† two obvious sharp peaks were located at 1355 and 1572 cm−1, which could be ascribed to the D band and G band of carbon, respectively. Generally, the D band reflects sp3 hybridized carbon atoms and the defects content, while the G band is generated from the in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms. The intensity ratio of the D band and G band (ID/IG) represents the defect density. To be specific, the ID/IG value of 1.06 here suggested some degree of disorder and defects for N-doped carbon. What is more, the wide peak between 2690–2910 cm−1 was consistent with the 2D band of carbon species, which was the second-order Raman peak of double phonon resonance, indicating the multi-layer feature.\nFESEM measurements were introduced to further explore the morphology and structural characteristics of the materials during the whole process. Fig. 3a–c display the SEM images of the compact self-assembled Zn–G microspheres with the diameter of 10–20 μm, assembled by Zn–G microplates with the thickness of about 1 μm. As observed from the magnified image (Fig. 3c), the secondary microplates originated from the stacking of subordinate fluffy multi-layer nanosheets, demonstrating the hierarchical system of Zn–G microspheres, and further confirming the above-mentioned self-assembly reaction mechanism. Then, as illustrated in Fig. S4,† the Zn–V–OH intermediate obtained by a reflux process of Zn–G microspheres displayed a similar structure as Zn–G, except that the size and thickness of the secondary microplates were denser and thinner, which may be due to the successful vanadization of Zn–G. As displayed in Fig. 3d–f, after severe heat treatment in air, the ZnVO mixed oxides inherited the basic morphology of Zn–V–OH microspheres. Interestingly, the ZnVO microspheres possessed a smaller diameter than Zn–V–OH microspheres, which may be ascribed to the close stacking of nanosheets further converted from nanoplates. Finally, the Zn3V3O8/NC microsphere composite maintained a hierarchical structure, as can be seen in Fig. 3g–i, with some N-doped carbon particles in the cross-section and on the edge of the nanosheets. Additionally, the as-conducted EDS mappings of Zn3V3O8/NC for the different elements verified the even distribution of Zn, V, O, and N (Fig. S6†), illustrating the uniform hybridization of N-doped carbon.\nTEM measurements were performed to further study the internal structure and lattice of the material. The related images of Zn3V3O8/NC after serious ultrasonic treatment are displayed in Fig. 4. Stacked nanosheets with plenty of nanopores and mesopores can be distinctly observed in Fig. 4a and b, exhibiting a narrow pore width distribution in the range of 2–20 nm. The formation of abundant pores mainly occurred during the oxidation of Zn–V–OH. The vast H2O and –OH existing in the Zn–V–OH crystals could be converted into gases and released under heat treatment. As shown in Fig. 4c, when higher magnification was applied, the clear boundary between the crystal and non-crystal could be distinguished, indicating the interface of the Zn3V3O8 and amorphous N-doped carbon. Furthermore, the lattice fringe spacings (Fig. 4d) could be obviously measured as 0.253, 0.210, and 0.149 nm, which were ascribed to the (311), (400), and (440) lattice planes of Zn3V3O8, respectively. In addition, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 4d) displayed distinct and regular diffraction spots, thus also revealing that Zn3V3O8 was well crystallized and its nature was single crystals.\nMoreover, BET-based N2 absorption–desorption measurements were carried out for the Zn3V3O8/NC composite. As noted in Fig. S7a,† a typical type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop of the H4 type could be obtained, demonstrating a meso/microporous texture in the Zn3V3O8/NC hybrid. As a result, a large specific surface area of 53.2 m2 g−1 and a pore width distribution between 3 nm and 37 nm (Fig. S7b†) could be obtained, which corresponded well with the TEM analysis results (Fig. 4a and b). The porous structure facilitates the transport of Li+ and Na+ as well as shortens the path for the ions and electrons.\nThe concrete chemical composition of the Zn3V3O8/NC composite could be further demonstrated with the assistance of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum of the product, as illustrated in Fig. 5a, confirmed the presence of Zn, V, O, C, and N with no other impurities. As displayed in the Zn 2p spectrum (Fig. 5b), two distinct peaks located at the binding energies of 1021.5 and 1044.3 eV were observed, which could be indexed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively. The curve-fitting of the V 2p spectrum (Fig. 5c) showed that each peak could be divided into two parts. To be specific, the binding energies of 516.1 and 522.9 eV belong to V3+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, while the peaks located at 517.2 and 524.5 eV validated the presence of V4+. Meanwhile, the atomic ratio of V3+ to V4+ was nearly 2 according to the XPS quantitative analysis, which was consistent with the theoretical components in the Zn3V3O8 compound, in which the molar ratio of V3+ to V4+ was 2:1. The presence of the N element could be illustrated by the high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s in Fig. 5d. The pyridinic N (398.6 eV) and pyrrolic N (400.1 eV) were revealed to be present in the carbon layer, which endows vast defects for fast ion diffusion. As shown in Fig. 5e, three peaks could be distinctly seen after the refined fitting of the C 1s spectrum. Specifically, the peaks at 284.5 and 285.4 eV could be ascribed to sp2-bonded CC and C–O (C–O–C), respectively, which originated from the carbonization of PPY in the argon atmosphere. The remaining fitted peak located at 288.5 eV was assigned to the CO (CN). Moreover, the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 5f) could be fitted into two peaks located at 530.1 and 531.5 eV, representing the lattice O and absorbed O on the surface of the materials, respectively.\n\n3.2. Zn3V3O8/NC as anode materials for LIBs\nDiverse electrochemical tests were conducted to estimate the performance of Zn3V3O8/NC as an anode material for LIBs. As displayed in Fig. 6a, several oxidation and reduction peaks could be distinctly observed from the initial three cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, which were measured between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. During the first cathodic scan, a broad and strong peak between 0.02 and 0.54 V as well as a weak peak from 0.61 to 1.05 V could be obviously identified, which were ascribed to the transformation from Zn3V3O8 to LiyVOx and ZnO, accompanied with the reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn and then the formation of Li–Zn alloy. Furthermore, an irreversible generation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) membrane and decomposition of the electrolyte occurred simultaneously in this process, which resulted in an irreversible specific capacity and lower Coulomb efficiency in the first cycle. Subsequently, the following anodic charging process proceeded with some oxidation peaks. To be specific, the wide peak at around 1.30 V may be assigned to the oxidation of Zn0 to Zn2+ and V2+ to V3+, respectively. In addition, the peak located at ∼0.32 V corresponded to the delithiation of Li–Zn alloy to Zn. Then, the further oxidation of V3+ into V4+ could be verified from the peak appearing at ∼2.5 V. Notably, the mixed mechanisms of the prepared anode were confirmed once again. During the second and third cycles, the good coincidence of CV curves confirmed the superior reversibility of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode after the formation of the SEI membrane.\nThe current density dependent on the specific capacity of the Zn3V3O8/NC and ZnVO anodes for LIBs are displayed in Fig. 6b, which reflects the rate performance of the anodes. As shown in Fig. 6b, the Zn3V3O8/NC anode delivered capacities of 875, 766, 689, 643, and 597 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. Especially, when an abrupt current density of 5000 mA g−1 was applied, a relatively high Li-ion insertion capacity of 489 mA h g−1 could still be maintained. By contrast, the ZnVO anode showed an inferior rate behavior with only a capacity of 64 mA h g−1 at the current density of 5000 mA g−1. Importantly, when the rate current was decreased from 5000 to 100 mA g−1 again, a capacity of 1030 mA h g−1 was available on the Zn3V3O8/NC anode, larger than the initial 875 mA h g−1, which could be attributed to the activation of the anode material during the incipient several cycles, corresponding to the increase in specific capacitance in the stability cycling test shown in Fig. 6g. The outstanding rate performance of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode might be related to the unique hierarchical nanostructure, nano/mesoporous feature and hybridization of N-doped carbon, which helped alleviate the agglomeration of the Zn3V3O8 active material and facilitated the charge transport.\nTo illustrate the underlying mechanisms of Zn3V3O8/NC for its superior electrochemical properties, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted. The Nyquist plots with the range from 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz consisted of a slanted line in the low-frequency region, which is considered as a linear Warburg part, and a depressed semicircle in the high/medium-frequency region, respectively. Moreover, the EIS curves could be well fitted by the simplified equivalent circuit model exhibited in Fig. 6c. The whole circuit consisted of the electrolyte resistance (RS), the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and the Warburg impedance controlled by lithium-ion diffusion (ZW). To be specific, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) changed from 272.7 Ohm to 108.1 Ohm after 50 cycles, which showed the gradual activation, small volume expansion, and promoted conductivity during the charge–discharge process. Notably, the results verified that the N-doped carbon and porous Zn3V3O8 composites effectively were beneficial to the cycling stability and rate performance.\nTo further estimate the mechanism of lithium-ion storage, CV curves at diverse sweep rates between 0.1 and 1.0 mV s−1 were plotted and are displayed in Fig. 6d. Two redox peaks were found, centered at about 1.2 and 0.8 V in accordance with peak 1 and peak 2, respectively. To qualitatively describe the relationship between the increasing peak current i and the scan rate ν, the formula i = aνb is introduced in to the evaluation, which can be transformed into log|i| = loga + blog|ν|, where a and b are constants. When the b value is equal to 0.5 or 1.0, a completely diffusion-controlled faradaic kinetics or a pseudocapacitive charge-storage mechanism can be confirmed, respectively. In Fig. 6e, the b values for peak 1 and peak 2 were calculated to be 0.75 and 0.79, which reflected that the charge-storage behavior comprised the above two mechanisms and was affected by a pseudocapacitive process. Subsequently, to further analyze the dominant role of the pseudocapacitive charge-storage mechanism quantitatively, another formula described as i/ν1/2 = κ1ν1/2 + κ2 (or i = κ1ν + κ2ν1/2) can be utilized to display the ratio of the capacitive contribution (κ1ν) to the total current. As shown in Fig. 6f and S8,† there was an upward trend for the proportion of capacitive contribution, which gradually reached 79.8% at the scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1, thus indicating the origination of the excellent rate performance.\nThe cycling stability (Fig. 6g and Fig. S9†) and galvanostatic discharge–charge (GCD) properties (Fig. 6h and Fig. S10b†) of the Zn3V3O8/NC and ZnVO anode for LIBs were also explored by galvanostatic tests. At a current density of 200 mA g−1, the initial specific discharge and charge capacity of Zn3V3O8/NC anode were 1103 and 993 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 6g). The smaller initial coulombic efficiency of ∼90% (61% for the ZnVO anode) suggested the formation of the SEI membrane in Zn3V3O8/NC consumed less electrolyte. Meanwhile, the Zn3V3O8/NC anode delivered a capacity of 1434 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles, much higher than that of the ZnVO anode (730 mA h g−1). Interestingly, during the initial 15 cycles, an attenuation of the capacity appeared, followed by a continuous increase until ∼130 cycles. This phenomenon has also been observed in other reported vanadium oxides anode for LIBs. Remarkably, the persistent increase could be interpreted as indicating the activation of the anode materials and the promotion of Li-ion accessibility. Also, the N-doped carbon may generate more defects, thereby increasing the active sites and further improving the Li-ion storage. In contrast, the ZnVO anode suffered a 10% capacity loss from 170 to 200 cycles due to the degradation of the bare ZnVO oxide during the conversion reaction.\n\n3.3. Zn3V3O8/NC as anode materials for SIBs\nIn addition to the application of lithium-ion batteries, the as-prepared Zn3V3O8/NC showed superior electrochemical properties as an anode for SIBs, which could be verified by diverse tests in half-cell configurations against sodium tablets. Fig. 7a exhibits the initial three CV curves in the range of 0.01 and 3.0 V versus Na/Na+ at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. For the first discharging process, a wide reduction peak was observed located between 0.85 and 1.28 V, which might well be attributed to the formation of the SEI layer and the reversible phase transformation between the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases, in accordance with the insertion and extraction of Na+. The sharp and intense peak occurring at ∼0.05 V could be ascribed to the insertion of Na+ into carbon materials. On the contrary, the obvious peak at ∼0.07 V in the oxidation process was due to the extraction of Na+ from the above N-doped carbon materials. In addition, a distinct hump-like peak between 0.5 and 1.75 V depicted the oxidation in the charging process. During the subsequent two cycles, the curves almost overlapped, manifesting the electrochemical stability of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode.\nAdditionally, the rate performance of the Zn3V3O8/NC composite for sodium storage was analyzed in Fig. 7b. Reversible specific capacities of 345, 312, 263, 207, and 140 mA h g−1 were delivered at 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. Furthermore, although after suffering an abrupt ultrahigh current switching from 2000 mA g−1 to 100 mA g−1, the capacity of 351 mA h g−1 could be regained, which was even slightly higher than the initial value. From the above analysis, the superior rate performance could be assigned to the hierarchical porous structure of Zn3V3O8 and the decoration of N-doped carbon, which facilitated the fast diffusion of Na+ from the materials.\nSimilar to the Li-ion half-cell, the mechanism of sodium-ion storage could also be explored by analyzing the composition of the CV current. As exhibited in Fig. 7c, the CV curves at the different scan rates between 0.1 and 1.0 mV s−1 maintained three redox peaks located at about 1.4, 0.4, and 0.6 V, which were denoted as peaks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In Fig. 7d, the b values of 0.967, 0.935, and 0.961 were in accordance with the as-mentioned three peaks, which demonstrated that the charge-storage mechanism of Zn3V3O8/NC composites in Na-ion half-cells tended to be due to the capacitance-controlled behaviors. A high proportion of 76.3% (Fig. 7e) could be achieved at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Subsequently, when the scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1 was implemented, as shown in Fig. 7f, the ratio even increased to 92.4%, verifying the source of the outstanding rate performance.\nTypical GCD profiles of the Zn3V3O8/NC anode for SIBs at the current density of 200 mA g−1 are exhibited in Fig. 7g. During the first cycle, Zn3V3O8/NC delivered 693 mA h g−1 and 302 mA h g−1 discharge capacity and charge capacity, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 43.6%. It is worth mentioning that the capacity loss could also be ascribed to the irreversible reactions, accompanied with the formation of the SEI membrane. During the next several hundred cycles, almost the same discharge capacity and charge capacity of approximately 320 mA h g−1 could be obtained stably, further revealing a high coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Specially, as distinguished from the GCD curves of Li-ion cells shown in Fig. 6h, the de-/sodiation processes of the N-doped carbon hybrids could be reflected by two plateaus (Fig. 7g), which could not be observed with the Li-ion cell. According to the group of pseudocapacitive materials, the Zn3V3O8/NC composite as an anode for SIBs shows both a pseudocapacitive behavior and the redox reactions of N-doped carbon. Taking advantage of this special mechanism, the conundrum of the tardy kinetics of Na+ transport and serious volume change could be alleviated to a great extent.\nAs for the cycling stability profiles shown in Fig. 7h, when at a low current density of 200 mA g−1, the Zn3V3O8/NC composite retained a specific capacity of 309 mA h g−1 with almost no decrease. Even after 1000 cycles at a large current density of 500 mA g−1, a capacity of 269 mA h g−1 was maintained, illustrating the structural stability and low pulverization of the materials (Fig. S11†). The long-term cycling performance further validated the superiority of the reversible pseudocapacitive behavior for charge storage.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Synthesis of zinc–glycerol (Zn–G) precursor. Typically, complexation between metal ions and glycerol was adopted to prepare the Zn–G precursor. Specifically, 0.5 mmol zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 8 ml glycerol were added into 40 ml isopropanol, followed by strong stirring, and then the mixed colorless transparent solution was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon autoclave, and maintained at 180 °C for 8 h. After centrifugation and vacuum drying, the Zn–G precursor was collected successfully.\n2.1.2. Preparation of zinc pyrovanadate (Zn–V–OH) and mixed zinc vanadate (ZnVO). To further obtain the zinc pyrovanadate (Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O, designated as Zn–V–OH), 60 mg as-synthesized Zn–G precursor was decanted to a flask, accompanied with adding 90 ml ethanol. Subsequently, 20 ml ammonium metavanadate aqueous solution (20 mM) was introduced drop by drop. Consequently, the zinc pyrovanadate could be derived through a condensing reflux reaction for 3 h at a specific temperature. After treatment at the high temperature of 400 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for 2 h in a muffle furnace, the as-prepared Zn–V–OH product was further oxidized to mixed zinc vanadate (ZnVO), which included the two crystal phases Zn2V2O7 and Zn3(VO4)2.\n2.1.3. Fabrication of ZnVO/polypyrrole (ZnVO/PPY) and Zn3V3O8/nitrogen-doped carbon (Zn3V3O8/NC) composites. In order to coat polypyrrole (PPY) on the surface of the ZnVO oxides, a chemical oxidation polymerization method was conducted to synthesize polypyrrole from the pyrrole monomer. In a typical synthesis process, 2.1 mg sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added into 20 ml distilled water, followed by dispersing the above ZnVO in it with ultrasonication. Then, 21 μl pyrrole was injected into the obtained suspension by pipette with magnetic stirring for 1 h. Next, 2 ml ammonium persulfate (0.1 M) was mixed to the solution little by little, both as an initiator and oxidant. After reacting for 3 h, a black precipitate could be harvested, which was labeled as ZnVO/PPY composite. The final Zn3V3O8/nitrogen-doped carbon (Zn3V3O8/NC) composites could be achieved by annealing ZnVO/PPY at 500 °C for 3 h in a N2 atmosphere.\n\n2.2. Microstructural characterization\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/Max2550) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) between 10° and 80° was used to probe the crystal structures. To subtly explore the morphologies and interior microstructures, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi, S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-2010) were employed. In addition, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system (ECSALAB 250) furnished with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) was used to verify the valence states of the specific elements. The Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw system at 514 nm in the range of 200–1800 cm−1. Also, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (NETZSCH STA409) curve was performed in the range of 25 °C to 750 °C. The pore-size distribution and nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves were acquired by BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) and BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) methods, with the data obtained from a surface area analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2460).\n\n2.3. Assembly of lithium-ion half-cells and sodium-ion half-cells\nThe electrochemical performances were assessed using CR2016-type coin cells, which were assembled in a glove box (MIKROUNA, Germany) filled with 99.999% Ar gas. Lithium tablets were treated as the counter electrode in the cells. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the Zn3V3O8/NC, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a proportion of 7:2:1 on the surface of Cu foil, which were considered as the active material, conductive agent, and polymer binder, respectively. N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) served as the solvent to form a paste. Then, the electrode was dried at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum. In addition, the separator was commercial Celgard 2300 and the electrolyte was 1.0 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC, 1:1 v/v).\nThe basic process and environment for assembly of the sodium-ion half-cells were similar to for the above lithium-ion half-cells, except that CR2032-type coin cells were used instead of CR2032-type cells, the counter electrode was sodium tablets, a specific glass fiber was introduced as the separator, and the electrolyte was 1.0 M NaClO4 dissolved in diethyl carbonate/ethylene carbonate/(DEC/EC, 1:1 v/v), with 10 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate.\n\n2.4. Electrochemical measurements\nA CHI760E electrochemical workstation was widely used to perform the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements, for which the conditions were in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V versus Li/Li+ and Na/Na+ with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and over the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz at an amplitude of 5 mV, respectively. Finally, the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cycling stability, and rate performance tests were conducted on a multichannel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 Structure characterization\nThe XRD patterns of pristine and Y-doped (different molar ratios) samples are shown in Fig. (1a), indicating that a single O3-phase was synthesized and Y3+ was doped into the crystal structure successfully. The corresponding diffraction peaks can be identified as an Rm (no 166) space-group, which is in accordance with the α-NaFeO2 structure. However, there is a minor amount of Y2O3 phase formed when the amount of doped Y3+ was increased to 0.03. As can be seen from Fig. 1(b), the (003) peak shifts left when the doped amount is 0.01 and 0.02 because of the larger radius of Y3+ (0.90 Å) than Mn4+ (0.53 Å), so we can conclude that the interplanar spacing can be enlarged, which can also be confirmed by the refined crystallographic data. Subsequently, there is a right shift when Y-doped content increases to 0.03 and 0.04, which may be attributed to partial Y3+ has not doped into the crystal structure completely (due to the formation of Y2O3). In addition, the XRD patterns of NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xAlxFe0.33O2 are shown in Fig. S1,† demonstrating that all cathode materials show high phase purity and good crystallinity. Fig. 1(c) shows the (003) peak of Al-0.04 doped sample only has a slight left shift due to the smaller radius of Al3+ (0.535 Å) than Y3+ (0.90 Å).\nThe Rietveld refinement profiles and crystal structures of all samples are established in Fig. 2. The calculated crystallographic parameters of the pristine, Y0.02-doped, and Al0.04-doped samples are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the lattice parameters a, c, and cell volume all increase with the introduction of Y and Al, which may be attributed to the larger size of Y3+ and Al3+ ions compared to Mn4+ ions. However, the spacing of the transition metal layer for NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 and NaNi0.33Mn0.29Al0.04Fe0.33O2 is slightly smaller than that of the pristine material, which can be attributed to the more dominant role of stronger Y–O and Al–O bond than ion radius. Furthermore, the d-spacing of the Na layer has increased, which not only can enhance Na+ diffusion coefficient but also mitigate lattice strain during the process of Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. Simultaneously, the strength of Y–O and Al–O is stronger than Mn–O according to bond energy values at 298 K, therefore, the total transition metal–oxygen bonding of both doped materials are much stronger than that of the undoped one. For this reason, the stability of the layered structure was greatly enhanced for the Y and Al-doped samples. Moreover, the transition metal–oxygen bond of the Y-doped sample is stronger than the Al-doped sample, resulting in a more stable crystal structure for the Y-doped material.\nFig. 3 shows the elemental mapping images of the Y0.02-doped sample for Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, and Y. These elements are all distributed uniformly throughout the material, and the signal of element Y is weak due to its relatively low content compared with that of Ni, Mn, and Fe. The homogeneous distribution of Y throughout the particles also indicates that Y3+ has been doped into the crystal structure successfully. In addition, the elements of the Al0.04-doped sample are also distributed uniformly in Fig. S2.†\n\n3.2. Electrochemical performance\nIn order to investigate the effects of Y/Al substitution on the specific discharge capacity and cycle stability, all the electrodes were cycled in the voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V. Fig. 4(a) demonstrates the cycling stability of the NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xYxFe0.33O2 cathode materials and the effects of different molar ratios of Y-dopant on the cycling performance at 2 C after 2 cycles of activity at 0.2 C (1 C = 125 mA g−1). Obviously, all samples exhibited approximately the same initial capacity, while the specific discharge capacity of the pristine cathode was only 28.6 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles and the specific capacities of Y0.01, 0.02, 0.03 0.04 doped electrodes were about 39.1, 98.3, 85.1, and 83.9 mA h g−1, respectively, which are greatly increased compared to the pristine electrode. Moreover, it can be seen that the capacity retention at 2 C for the NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xYxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) cathode materials after 200 cycles were 22.3, 27.8, 72.8, 61.2 and 62.9%, respectively, which indicate that Y-doping improves cycling stability greatly. In particular, the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 material showed the best discharge specific capacity and cycle stability, the inferior properties of the Y0.03, 0.04-doped materials can be attributed to the formation of Y2O3 phase impurities, the lower doping amount results in faster capacity attenuation for the Y0.01-doped sample. For this reason the Y0.02-doped sample was selected as the representative for further testing. Fig. 4(b) shows the cycling stabilities of the NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xAlxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) materials, the Al-doped electrodes all exhibited enhanced specific capacity and cycle stabilities, especially for the Al0.04-doped sample. The comparison of cycle performances for the Y0.02-doped and Al0.04-doped cathodes is shown in Fig. 4(c), it can be seen that both doped samples exhibited better performances and NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 had the best cycle stability, which can be attributed to stronger transition metal–oxygen bond strength that result in a more stable crystal structure.\nFor the purpose of investigating the role of Y and Al doping on rate performance, the pristine, Y0.02-doped, and Al0.04-doped cathodes were cycled at different current densities between 1.5 and 4.2 V (Fig. 4(d)). The discharge capacities of the pristine were 168.6, 143.5, 127.2, 102.6, 14.5, and 0.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. In contrast, for the Y0.02-doped cathode material, the corresponding discharge capacities were 151.6, 147.3, 136.7, 124.9, 107.1, and 65.6 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. It is obvious that the Y0.02-doped cathode exhibited superior rate capability than the pristine, particularly under larger current densities. In addition, we can also see that the rate performance of the Al0.04-doped cathode had improved compared to the pristine, but was not as excellent as the Y0.02-doped cathode that possessed larger interplanar spacing. The superior rate capability of NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 may be largely due to increased interlayer spacing d, so that the sodium ion diffusion resistance is reduced which in turn improves the rate capability. This is consistent with the larger Na+ diffusion coefficients calculated by the subsequent PITT measurements.\nFig. 5(a) and (b) display the voltage vs. specific capacity plots for the pristine and Y0.02-doped cathodes at 50th and 150th cycles, respectively. We can clearly see that the gaps between the plateau regions of charge and discharge for Y0.02-doped NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 are much smaller compared with the pristine material. This result indicates that the Y0.02-doped cathode has lower polarization, and the process of charge and discharge is nearly reversible. In addition, as is shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), compared with the pristine cathode, the Y0.02-doped NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 shows higher discharge capacity and the plateau of discharge voltage decreased slower throughout the whole cycling process. Furthermore, the discharge voltage of the Y0.02-doped electrode decreased by 13.5%, while for the pristine electrode decreased by 35.8%. According to the results, it can be concluded that the problem of voltage reduction for NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 has been alleviated effectively by a small amount Y3+ substitution.\n\n3.3 Mechanism analysis\nIn order to study the reaction mechanism and the role of Y-doping on electrochemical kinetic properties, the cyclic voltammograms of the pristine and Y0.02-doped electrodes in the potential range of 1.5–4.2 V versus Na+/Na at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 were measured. The CV profiles shown in Fig. 6 represent two pairs of reversible redox couples, corresponding to the two-stage reaction of Na ion extraction/insertion. As for the pristine, an obvious oxidation peak can be located at 3.080 V along with a reduction hump at 2.814 V, which are associated with the electrochemical redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+. The other oxidation peak located at 4.150 V along with the reduction hump at 3.769 V, which can be attributed to the redox processes of Fe3+/Fe4+. Moreover, the gap between both redox couples for the pristine (0.266 V) is wider than the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 (0.220 V), indicating a lower polarization, better redox reversibility, and enhanced Na+ diffusion behavior with the introduction of Y3+.\nTo investigate the influence of Y3+ substitution on the kinetics of sodium ion intercalation/deintercalation into cathodes, EIS tests were used to study the interface stability between electrolyte and cathode. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the Nyquist plots of the pristine and Y0.02-doped cathodes before and after 200 cycles, which each is composed of a single semicircle at high-frequency associated with the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a quasistraight line at low frequency ascribed to the Warburg impedance (Zw). It is clearly seen that Rct of the Y0.02-doped electrode (300.63 Ω) was significantly decreased compared with the pristine electrode (653.33 Ω) before cycling (Table S1†). This result is consistent with the post-cycling sample, the Rct of the Y0.02-doped sample was 342.89 Ω, while the pristine material was 975.07 Ω (Table S2†). The above phenomenon is because of enhanced reaction kinetics and rapid charge transfer at the interface between electrode/electrolyte. Simultaneously, the degree of increase in resistance of the Y0.02-doped electrode (42.26 Ω) is much smaller than the pristine (321.74 Ω) after 200 cycles, which can be attributed to enhanced layered structure stability. Based on these, it can be concluded that excellent rate performance and cycling stability were achieved in the doped material.\nThe PITT measurements were carried out on the electrodes to determine the sodium ions diffusion coefficient (DNa+) in the voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V. The Na+ diffusion coefficients can be calculated by the following equation on the basis of Fick's second law: DNa+ = −[dln(I)/dt] [4L2/π2 ], where I is the titration current, t is the step time, and L is the characteristic diffusion (the thickness of the cathode active material).Fig. 7(c) and (d) demonstrate the PITT curves of the pristine and Y0.02-doped samples during Na+ insertion/deinsertion between 1.5 and 4.2 V. It is worth mentioning that the calculated sodium ions diffusion coefficients of the Y0.02-doped cathode were close to 10−9 cm2 s−1, which are much higher than the pristine during the discharge process. The functional introduction of Y3+ into the crystal structure plays an important role in increasing the layer spacing (d) and reducing the sodium ion migration barrier, so the Na-ion diffusion coefficients have been improved. This result is in accordance with the remarkably enhanced rate property exhibited by the doped material.\nFig. 8(a) and (b) show the size and morphologies of the as-synthesized pristine and Y0.02-doped particles, respectively. It is observed that the sizes of all particles are in the range of 0.2–1 μm. Simultaneously, almost all particles are plate-like and polyhedral for both samples, and the surface of the Y0.02-doped material looks smoother than those of the pristine particles. To further confirm the effectiveness of the substitution of Y on particle integrity and mechanical stability, SEM images of the pristine and Y0.02-doped samples were collected after 200 cycles and are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). It is apparent that the phenomenon of particle exfoliation can be observed in the pristine, this is because of the larger strain between domains induced by structural expansions with Na+ intercalation in the crystal structure. However, the particles of the Y0.02-doped sample still maintain excellent integrity after experiencing long-term sodiation and desodiation, which can be attributed to superior layered structure stability that possesses higher transition metal–oxygen bond energy, so the cycling stability was improved significantly.\nIn order to investigate the stability of the oxygen and the thermal stability, XPS O 1s spectra and DSC results were collected for the samples (the pristine and Y0.02-doped). As shown in Fig. 9(a), the O 1s peaks represent the fact that there are lattice and surface oxygen existing in the electrode materials. Table S1† summarizes the relative contents of lattice and surface oxygen for both samples. Compared with pristine, the ratio of lattice oxygen/surface oxygen in NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 was improved greatly, which demonstrates that the substitution of Mn4+ with Y3+ plays a crucial role in stabilizing oxygen anions in the crystal structure. Due to the introduction of Y3+, the transition metal–oxygen bond becomes stronger, which improves the stability of layered structure. Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry curves of both cathode materials charged to 4.2 V are shown in Fig. 9(b). The thermal decomposition temperature (the exothermic peak) of NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 has increased by 25.08 °C, which proves that cation substitution has a great effect on mitigating lattice oxygen release and inhibiting the irreversible loss of oxygen. In addition, the heat generation of the Y0.02-doped sample was 81.8 J g−1, much lower than the 102.9 J g−1 of the pristine material. We can draw the conclusion that the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 material possesses better thermal stability.\nTo further demonstrate the role of Y element on the ability of the cathode material's resistance to electrolyte corrosion, the cathodes were stored in fresh electrolyte for 15 days after being charged to 4.2 V, and then inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used to measure the contents of dissolved transition metal ions in the electrolyte. As shown in Table 3, the leached metal ions for the pristine material were 0.0139, 0.0820, and 0.1085 mg kg−1 for respective ions, this is much higher than those for the Y0.02-doped sample (0.0094, 0.0674, and 0.0928 mg kg−1). Therefore, the NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 material can protect transition metal ions from leaching, and thereby improve the cycling stability and rate performance.\nTo investigate the relationship of the excellent electrochemical performance and the Na deintercalation/intercalation reaction mechanism, ex situ XRD were collected to examine the crystal structure at various charge and discharge states during the first cycle. Fig. 10(a) and (b) show the ex situ XRD patterns of NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 and NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 along with the first charge and discharge curves, respectively. As sodium ions were extracted from the O3-NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2, the diffraction peak of the (003) peak moves to a lower angle and splits into two at 3.4 V, indicating the formation of a new hexagonal P3 phase induced by the gliding of the [Ni0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33]O2 slab (Fig. 10(a)). Simultaneously, the (101), (102) peaks shift right and the (104) peak disappears gradually, which also demonstrated the coexistence of hexagonal O3 and P3 phases. Upon further sodium removal from the lattice (until charged to 4.2 V), only the P3 single phase is observed along with constantly increasing d-spacing. During the discharge process, there is a reversible phase transformation process, the (003) peak moves to a higher angle and also split into two peaks when discharging to 3.4 V. In particular compared to the uncycled state, the (003) peak has a slight left shift upon discharged to 1.5 V. Overall, the pristine NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 material experienced sequential phase transitions of O3–O3 + P3–P3–O3. By contrast, as shown in Fig. 10(b), the (003) peak of NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 still maintained intact shape, showing that the new P3 phase is less developed (when charged to 3.4 V). It should be noted that a much larger fraction of the O3 phase was observed in the Y-doped sample than in Y-free sample when the cathode was discharged to 3.4 V, which can also be ascribed to the splitting of the (003) peak. Furthermore, the phase transitions of the Y-doped NaNi0.33Mn0.31Y0.02Fe0.33O2 are much more reversible than the pristine according to the coincidence degree of the (003) peak between the uncycled state and when discharged to 1.5 V (the pristine shift left 0.12°, while the Y0.02-doped shift left 0.06°). These results indicate that Y-doping can facilitate reversible phase transition, which is consistent with improved cycle performance and layered structure stability.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Preparation of materials\nNaNi0.33Mn0.33−xYxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) and NaNi0.33Mn0.33−xAlxFe0.33O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) cathode materials were synthesized by a simple sol–gel method. Polyethylene glycol and citric acid were dissolved in deionized water, and then stoichiometric amounts of nickel acetate, manganese acetate, iron nitrate, and yttrium nitrate (aluminum nitrate) were added into the above solution under constant stirring. The resultant mixed solution was aged at 80 °C for 5 h and then dried at 120 °C overnight to obtain the porous gel. Finally, the dried gel was grinded adequately and calcined at 900 °C for 12 h subsequently to obtain the final materials.\n\n2.2 Sample characterizations\nThe crystal structures and material compositions were determined by a Persee XD2 equipment using Cu Kα radiation in the range of 10°–70° (a step width of 0.01°). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi to characterize the valence states of Ni, Fe, Mn, Y and Al ions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a Hitachi SU8010 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 F20) was used to collect the elementary mapping images.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nA uniform slurry was formed by combining the active materials, conductive additive, poly (vinylidene fluoride) in a ratio of 75:15:10. Then the slurry was uniformly coated onto Al foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h. CR2025 coin cells were assembled in an atmosphere of high-purity argon, using Na disks as the counter electrode, glass fiber (Whatman) 1.0 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) as separator and the electrolyte, respectively. An automatic galvanostat (NEWARE) was used to measure the property of galvanostatic charge–discharge at various current densities (1 C = 125 mA g−1) in a voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V at room temperature. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) tests were carried out on a Metrohm Autolab instrument.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}
