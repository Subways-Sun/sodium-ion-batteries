After 88 h of alkalization process, the 2D layered Ti3C2 with micrometer size (Figure , Supporting Information) transformed into the intermediate product a‐Ti3C2 formed by stacking nanoparticle units. The nanoparticles on the surface of a‐Ti3C2 self‐assembled into fibers (Figure , Supporting Information). As reaction time is prolonged to 156 h, all nanoparticle units of a‐Ti3C2 have completed self‐assembly to form 1D fibrous and hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2), as shown in Figure . Its tube diameter is 30–40\xa0nm, and the internal lattice spacing is further increased (Figure\xa0). The solutions with weight mass ratio of h‐Ti3C2 to CNTs (Figure\xa0) of 0:1, 0.3:1, and 1.0:1, are prepared through ultrasonic mixing, and abbreviated as CNTs, 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (or h‐Ti3C2/CNTs) and 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (Figure , Supporting Information) and 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs solution (Figure\xa0) indicated that the h‐Ti3C2 closely intertwined with CNTs, which would contribute to well mechanical property and tenacity of h‐M‐SSG resulting in a benign 3D conductive network. The h‐M‐SSG scaffold is prepared by vacuum filtration in the order of 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, and CNTs solutions, as shown in Figure\xa0. The sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 content of h‐M‐SSG gradually increased from top to bottom.\nAs we can see from TEM–energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (TEM–EDX) elemental mappings (Figure 2f; Figure , Supporting Information), O and F elements are uniformly distributed throughout h‐Ti3C2, which play a key role in inducing Na homogeneous deposition. Meanwhile, the increasement of lattice spacing of h‐Ti3C2 conduces to the adsorption of K+ during the alkalization process, and resulted in the increasing of K element content. It is worth noting that the high sodiophilic peculiarity of h‐M‐SSG stems from the rich content of O, F, and K function groups of h‐Ti3C2, as shown in Figure\xa0, Figures\xa0 and  in the Supporting Information. Among them, the O and F functional groups possess relatively large binding energies with Na atom, which can effectively reduce nucleation energy, and form the sodiophilic sites. The corresponding high X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of O1s and F1s are shown in Figure\xa0, respectively. From these XPS spectra, we can know that most of O and F functional groups are bonded with Ti of h‐Ti3C2. As for the K functional group, it could be alloyed with Na, which further improves the sodiophilic property of h‐Ti3C2.\nThe different thicknesses of the h‐M‐SSG scaffolds from 80 to 250\xa0µm are easily prepared by adjusting the volume of various h‐Ti3C2/CNTs solutions during the preparation, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The various thickness scaffolds can be applied to meet the requirements of different application scenarios. To get more clearly gradient structure in the characterization of SEM–EDX, we choose the thickness about 250\xa0µm as a research object. In addition, the thickness of h‐M‐SSG scaffold is in direct relation to the thickness of Na composite anode. Therefore, the thicker h‐M‐SSG/Na composite anode is more suitable for the following cycling experiment of ultrahigh charging/discharging areal capacity, such as 1–40 mAh cm−2. The prepared h‐M‐SSG keeps perfect without any cracks or deformation after several times repeated folding operation (Figure ), indicating that it possesses satisfied flexibility. This trait is inherited on h‐M‐SSG/Na composite anode. In Figure\xa0, the prepared h‐M‐SSG film with the thickness about 250 μm has a relatively loose porous structure (101.4 m2 g−1, shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information), which is conducive to increase sodium loading capacity and reduce the local current density during cycling to lengthen the Sand's time for inhibiting dendrites growth. In order to verify the stepped gradient structure of h‐M‐SSG, it is characterized by EDS‐mapping. It is worth noting that Ti element comes from h‐Ti3C2, while C element comes from h‐Ti3C2 and CNTs. As shown in Figure\xa0, the structure of h‐M‐SSG can clearly be divided into three layers based on Ti content, indicating that the sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 content stepped increases from top to bottom. This viewpoint is also further verified by the distribution graph of C content (Figure\xa0) and related element line scanning (Figure , Supporting Information). Among them, the presence of sporadic Ti element in the top layer of h‐M‐SSG may be caused by slight interference between different solution layers during the preparation process.\nThe different capacity‐limited protocols are conducted to plate Na on the h‐M‐SSG scaffolds to explore the deposition behavior. The corresponding schematic illustration about bottom‐up deposition and related optical photograph are shown in Figure\xa0. The optical photograph of the bottom of h‐M‐SSG exhibits obvious metallic luster (silvery white) after Na deposition with the capacity of 10 mAh cm−2, whereas the top surface does not, which obvious demonstrates that the sodiophilic gradient structure of h‐M‐SSG could induce Na deposition preferentially at the bottom of anode. This conclusion is further confirmed by the cross‐sectional SEM images of h‐M‐SSG after Na deposition, as shown in Figure\xa0. After 1 h of Na deposition at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, Na filled the whole of h‐M‐SSG, but it could be clearly divided into three layers based on the compactness of Na. The Na layer at the bottom of the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is the most compact and thickest layer, which almost forms a smooth plane without any voids (Figure\xa0).\xa0The\xa0Na layer at the middle of the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is relatively compact. Amounts of microsize sodium particles are stacked crossing each other, and exhibiting a rough granular surface (Figure\xa0). The Na layer at the top of h‐M‐SSG scaffold is relatively loose and porous, and still keeps bits of fibrous CNTs (Figure\xa0). Therefore, it can be inferred that the deposition behavior of Na on the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is preferentially deposition on the bottom, and then gradually deposit to the middle and top at the condition of the bottom is filled tightly. The cross‐sectional SEM of h‐M‐SSG with different Na deposition capacity‐limited of 20, 30, and 40 mAh cm−2, also verified above bottom‐up deposition behavior, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. This is caused by the fact that the rich content of sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 at the bottom.\nThe sodium deposition behaviors with the capacity of 10 mAh cm–2 on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs) and CNTs scaffolds, are also studied as a control group. As we can see from the cross‐sectional SEM images of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (Figure ) after Na deposition, Na filled the whole of scaffold. The obtained h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na could be clearly divided into two layers based on the compactness of Na. The upper of Na layer is compact and thick, and the bottom of Na layer is relatively loose. There is no similar bottom‐up deposition sequence as h‐M‐SSG for h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold. Therefore, the sodium deposition is uniform in the early middle stage, while it will be preferentially inducing Na deposition at the upper layer of scaffold in the latter stage. The metallic luster (silvery white) of top surface of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold after Na deposition, further verified this viewpoint (Figure\xa0). From the cross‐sectional SEM images of CNTs (Figure\xa0), we can see that Na will preferentially deposit at the surface layer of the scaffold resulting in amounts of bulges and dendrites. This is due to the poor sodiophilic property of CNTs. The metallic luster of surface of CNTs after Na deposition also verified this point (Figure\xa0). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the bottom‐up deposition sequence of h‐M‐SSG only stems from its stepped sodiophilic gradient structure.\nThe first Na plating behaviors on CNTs, h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, and h‐M‐SSG scaffolds at high current density of 10 mA cm−2, are investigated by in situ XRD. Their corresponding color plots of XRD patterns are shown in Figure\xa0, respectively. The characteristic peak of Na2CO3 appeared after the deposition time of 6 and 15\xa0min for Na–CNTs and Na–h‐Ti3C2/CNTs half batteries, respectively. However, Na2CO3 is one of typical by‐product resulting from decomposition of electrolyte or the side reaction between Na metal and electrolyte. Compared to Na–CNTs half‐batteries, the signal intensity and presentation time of characteristic peak of Na2CO3 for Na–h‐Ti3C2/CNTs is weaker and later, which means the relatively mild side reaction. This is largely due to the sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 component of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold. As for the XRD pattern of Na–h‐M‐SSG, there is still no signal peak of Na2CO3, which means that the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure could effectively inhibit side reaction. That is to say, the h‐M‐SSG scaffold with sodiophilic gradient structure possesses excellent affordability for high current density and capacity.\nThe sodium‐ion transfer resistances of Na, CNTs/Na, h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, and h‐M‐SSG/Na are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figures  and  in the Supporting Information. After 100 charge/discharge cycling times at 1.0 mA cm−2 and 1.0 mAh cm−2, the symmetric battery based on h‐M‐SSG/Na shows the smallest semicircle (3.18 Ω), which means that it possesses the most favorable Na+ transfer kinetics. This conclusion is further verified by Tafel plot, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. Compared with Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, the Tafel curve of the h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetric battery exhibited the maximum intersection with the y‐axis. It means the largest exchange current for Na plating/stripping in h‐M‐SSG/Na anode (I0\xa0= 11.88 mA cm–2) and fastest charge transfer kinetic.\nTo further investigate the inhibiting Na dendrites effect of sodiophilic gradient structure, the morphological change of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na are observed by an in situ optical microscopy during Na stripping and replating at 10 mA cm−2. The flat surface of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrode became uneven, and generated amounts of micrometer‐level protrudes and dendrites after Na stripping for 30\xa0min and replating for 30\xa0min, as shown in Figure\xa0. This is due to the preferential stripping and re‐plating behavior on top layer of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na at high current density, which would cause serious tip effect resulting in nonuniform deposition and intensifying the formation of dendrites. By comparison, the surface of h‐M‐SSG/Na remained flat and no trace of dendrite (Figure\xa0), which is due to the bottom‐up deposition sequence of h‐M‐SSG. In conclusion, the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure can effectively enhance the affordability of h‐M‐SSG for high current density and capacity. It is worth noting that the high sodiophilic peculiarity of h‐M‐SSG stems from the rich content of O and F function groups of h‐Ti3C2. It is further demonstrated by the first‐principles DFT calculations (Figure\xa0; Figure , Supporting Information). The most stable structures of a single Na atom absorbed on h‐Ti3C2 surface groups (h‐Ti3C2O, h‐Ti3C2F) and CNTs and corresponding binding energies are shown in Figure\xa0. The binding energies between Na atom with h‐Ti3C2O (−10.8\xa0eV) and h‐Ti3C2F (−2.0\xa0eV) are significantly larger than CNTs (−1.1\xa0eV). The stronger binding energy means effectively reduce nucleation energy and form the sodiophilic sites, which is conducive to the uniform Na plating/stripping and dendrite‐free anode.\nThe long‐term cycling stability of symmetrical batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na is assessed by galvanostatic tests. The symmetrical batteries based on Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na anodes are also studied as a control group. At the relatively moderate current densities (1, 5 mA cm−2) and capacities (1, 5 mAh cm−2), symmetrical batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na and h‐Ti3C2/Na anodes exhibit a low polarization voltage and excellent cycling stability, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. The charging–discharge curve of symmetrical batteries based on Na and CNTs/Na anodes, in contrast, show a huge fluctuation and large polarization voltage. For instance, symmetrical batteries based on h‐Ti3C2/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes, remain a low voltage of 0.113–0.050\xa0V, respectively, for more than 1200 h at 1.0 and 1.0 mAh cm−2. On the contrary, symmetrical batteries based on CNTs/Na and pure Na shown a huge polarization voltage fluctuation after cycling time of 300 h.\nWith the current density increased from 5 mA cm−2 to 10, 15, 20, 40 mA cm−2, the cycling stability of symmetrical batteries based on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na are beginning to show an enormous difference. The symmetric cell based on h‐M‐SSG/Na has a stable charge–discharge curve and a low polarization voltage of only 93\xa0mV for more than 100 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 10 mAh cm−2, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. However, the charge–discharge curve of symmetric battery based on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, shows a huge voltage fluctuation, and the polarization voltage began to increase sharply after 9 h operation, and exceeds 1.79\xa0V at 100 h. Impressively, the excellent cycling stability of h‐M‐SSG/Na also continues at high current density of 15, 20, 40 mA cm−2 and high areal capacity of 15, 20, 40 mAh cm−2, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. For example, symmetric battery based on h‐M‐SSG/Na exhibits the charge–discharge curves and a low polarization voltage of only 0.145\xa0V for more than 180 h at 40.0 mA cm−2 and 40.0 mAh cm−2. However, the charge–discharge cycle curves of symmetric batteries based on Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na anodes, show a huge fluctuation, and large polarization voltages more than 1.212, 0.584, and 0.547\xa0V, respectively. It further highlights the advantages of h‐M‐SSG framework. Therefore, we can know that the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure could effectively improve the affordability of the scaffold for high current density and capacity, and maintain a lower polarization voltage and longer cycling life in symmetrical batteries. In addition, the related plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies (CE) data of Na || Cu and Na || h‐M‐SSG half batteries are provided in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The first Coulombic CE of Na || h‐M‐SSG half battery is as high as 99.99%, and its cycle life is far superior to that of Na || Cu battery. The cycling performance of h‐M‐SSG/Na is well ahead of all the other previous reported scaffolds for Na composited anodes for cycling current density and areal capacity, as shown in Figure\xa0. Most of scaffold‐based Na anodes are limited by the high charging/discharging capacity (>5 mAh cm−2) at current density (>10 mA cm−2). In addition, the rate performance of h‐M‐SSG/Na is also studied by charge/discharge cycling at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mA cm−2 (Figure , Supporting Information). The voltage hysteresis of h‐M‐SSG/Na stepped increases with ampere density and maintains excellent steady even at 40 mA cm−2, which demonstrate the excellent rate performance. On the contrary, the symmetric batteries based on pure Na, CNTs/Na, and h‐Ti3C2/Na exhibit the huge voltage fluctuations with the increasing of current density.\nTo further verified the feasibility of h‐M‐SSG in practical battery, Na−O2 batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes, are assembled (Figure\xa0). The cycling lifetime and potential gap of batteries are tested at 1000 mA g−1 (0.14 mA cm−2, based on the practical loading of Super‐P on carbon paper is 0.14 mg cm−2) and a control capacity of 1000 mAh g−1 (0.14 mAh cm−2). The Na–O2 battery with h‐M‐SSG/Na anode keeps a stable charge–discharge curve with an average CE of 93.74%, and a low potential gap of 0.137\xa0mV for more than 45 cycles, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. However, the cycling life of Na–O2 batteries with pure Na metal, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrodes are 5, 15, and 24 cycles, respectively, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries with pure Na metal, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrodes decreased to 548 mAh g−1 (after 7 cycles), 682 mAh g−1 (after 17 cycles) and 151 mAh g−1 (after 24 cycles), respectively. Furthermore, the rate performance of Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes are investigated at the different current densities and a control capacity of 1000 mAh g−1. With the increasement of current density (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mA g−1), the low overpotential gap of batteries is 81, 87, 91, 95, 113, 220, and 425\xa0mV, respectively, which implying the satisfied rate performance (Figure\xa0). Therefore, the introduction of sodiophilic gradient structure in Na–O2 cell can effectively reduce overpotential, and improve the rate performance and cycle life at high current density.\nAs for Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na electrodes, its current density of 1000 mA g−1 is relatively higher than that of the common Na–O2 batteries with pure Na‐metal anodes of 200–500 mA g−1. Due to the open system of Na–O2 batteries, the discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na electrodes cut‐off with 1000 mAh g−1. The increase of discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries will increase the running time and aggravate the shuttle effect of O2 between Na‐metal anode and electrolyte resulting in terrible cycling performance. In our next research work, we plan to make use of the synergistic effect of h‐M‐SSG/Na and quasi‐solid electrolyte to resolve above problem and improve discharge capacity.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Among of them, the concentration of CNTs aqueous solution was about 2.0 mg L−1. The h‐M‐SSG scaffold was prepared by vacuum filtration in the order of 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), and CNTs solutions (10\xa0mL), and using two glass plates to keep smooth at 55\xa0°C for 16 h under vacuum condition.\n\nPreparation of the Cathode of Na–O2 Battery\nThe super‐P of 7.5\xa0mg and PVDF of 0.833\xa0mg were mixed in 75\xa0mL ethanol. After ultrasonic mixing for 2 h, this solution was spray coated onto the carbon paper with the size of 6\xa0cm × 7\xa0cm under 100\xa0°C.

The final practical loading of Super‐P on carbon paper was only 0.14 mg cm−2.\n\nCharacterization\nThe SEM (JSM‐7500F, JEOL) and HR‐TEM (FEI Talos F200x G2) were used to characterized the morphology and structure of samples. The surface properties of samples were tested by XPS (Perkin Elmer PHI). The electrolytes in symmetrical and Na–O2 batteries were 1 mol L−1 NaCF3SO3‐diglyme (NaOTF‐G2) solution. The diameter of electrodes in all batteries was 8.0\xa0mm. All batteries were assembled in glovebox under the condition Ar atmosphere. The cycling lifetime and potential gap of Na–O2 batteries were tested in pure O2 at cut‐off voltage of 1.8–2.0\xa0V. The current density of Na–O2 batteries was calculated from the loading of Super‐P on carbon paper.\n\nComputational Details\nThe solution environment does affect the deposition process of Na. However, considering the variability of electrolyte system and the complexity of SEI formation, the dynamic evolution of electrolyte near the surface of Na metal is much difficult to simulate based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Interestingly, the sample BT/C NFs showed a branched structure (Figure c,d) after the alkali hydrothermal treatment, where numerous short branches were well in situ grown with a remarkably high density covered the entire surface of the pristine T/C NFs. It is noted that the average diameter of BT/C NFs (≈800 nm) was larger than those of T/C NFs (≈500 nm), contributing to the stripping and regrowth of TiO2 during the alkali hydrothermal process. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) records the composition changes of samples during the alkali etching process. As presented in Figure S1a (Supporting Information), the energy dispersive X‐ray spectrometry (EDS) investigation verified that the sample T/C NFs only consisted of C, Ti, and O. After alkali hydrothermal treatment, additional Na+ ions appeared (Figure S1b, Supporting Information), and it could be completely removed by the ion‐exchange treatment (Figure S1c,d, Supporting Information).\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to further investigate the detail morphology of as‐prepared BT/C NFs (Figure ). From Figure a, it could be observed that the surface of BT/C NFs was rough, with many branches randomly growing to the trunk, which was in well consistent with scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. According to the high‐resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Figure b, the lattice fringes with spacing was measured to be 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (103) crystal plane of anatase TiO2. The detailed structure collected from the interface between the branch and the trunk is shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It could be seen clearly that the branch rooted into the trunk and a pore was left in the trunk due to the exfoliation of TiO2 on the surface (the yellow line marking area). The trunk remained a good crystallinity, and the branch also showed good crystallinity due to the second calcination after alkali hydrothermal treatment. The amorphous regions around the lattice fringes reflected the disordered carbon phase, and the lattice of graphitic carbon can also be observed clearly (Figure S2, Supporting Information). This feature can not only reinforce the connection between the branches and the trunk, but also provide smooth migration channels for electrons, and ions for the branches were in situ grown on the trunks. The elemental mapping analysis of a single BT/C NF in Figure c further certified the successful preparation of branched TiO2/C nanofibers. Element Ti and O were distributed in the whole nanofibers while element C was only located at the trunk region, illustrating that the branches were only composed with TiO2. This feature was in favor of the contact with electrolyte for TiO2 and guaranteed the well electrical conductivity of the BT/C NFs' electrode at the same time.\nThe crystal phases of the T/C NFs and BT/C NFs were defined by X‐ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure a, both samples exhibited the identical phase structure of anatase TiO2. The major diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 25.32°, 37.75°, 48.01°, 53.90°, 55.07°, 62.72°, 68.77°, 70.14°, and 75.05° belonged to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21‐1272), respectively. A broad peak at around 26° indicated the existence of amorphous carbon, as shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). There were no other diffraction peaks being detected, suggesting the high purity of the as‐synthesized TiO2 crystallites. Comparing with T/C NFs, the BT/C NFs sample showed better crystallization degree. This can be partly attributed to the re‐calcination process at high temperature and the extremely large surface area of BT/C NFs (Figure c) which could promote the process of crystallization. Moreover, the particle size of branched TiO2 became larger due to the exposure of them after the alkali hydrothermal treatment which is different from the sample T/C NFs with TiO2 nanoparticles being embedded in carbon matrix, which caused the sharpen peak. The high crystallinity of BT/C NFs was beneficial for the promotion of the sodium storage performance for anatase TiO2 that can supply effective paths and more accommodation sites for Na+.\nIn order to identify the carbon contents in the samples, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted. As shown in Figure b, there were two steps of weight loss in the TGA curve. The weight loss before 300 °C mainly belonged to the evaporation of adsorbed water. The sloping part between 300 and 550 °C was assigned to the combustion of carbon. The content of carbon in the BT/C NFs was estimated to be ≈48.8%, which was slightly smaller than that of T/C NFs (≈50.0%). This can be attributed to the little amount of carbon loss on the surface of nanofibers during the acid and alkali treatment process. Figure c,d demonstrates the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of the samples. As shown in Figure c, both samples showed type IV isotherm, and the hysteresis loop indicated typical characteristic of mesoporous structures. The pore size distribution plots obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm confirmed that BT/C NFs had well‐defined micropores while T/C NFs had micro‐ and mesopores. Therefore, the distribution of the pore size was much more centralized for BT/C NFs (Figure d). The unique porous features were conducive to fasting ionic diffusion and mass transport; thus, efficient electrochemical reactions were favored. The specific surface area was further calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. The specific surface area of BT/C NFs was 506.7 m2 g−1, which was ≈50 times larger than that of T/C NFs (10.7 m2 g−1). The specific surface area of BT/C NFs was also much larger than that of the similar TiO2 branched architecture (20.41 m2 g−1) obtained via epitaxy growth. Studies revealed that the increase of surface area could also facilitate fast electrons' acceptance and ions' diffusion through the branches and ensure sufficient contact between electrolyte and active materials. Thus, the high specific surface area of BT/C NFs would be beneficial for applications associated with surface structure by supplying more reaction sites, such as pseudocapacitive energy storage.\nTo provide further investigation, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) spectra and Raman spectra of the T/C NFs and BT/C NFs were conducted. From the FT‐IR spectra in Figure a, both samples showed C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO stretch. The C\uf8ffO vibrations were well retained while C\uf8feO vibration was a little shifted from 1588.4 to 1596 cm−1 after alkali hydrothermal treatment. In sample T/C NFs, Ti\uf8ffO vibration was located at 583 cm−1 while in sample BT/C NFs, it is shifted to 504.7 cm−1, indicating the longer bond lengths. This was due to the exposure of TiO2 nanoparticles of nanofibers during the acid and alkali hydrothermal treatment process, which will enhance the amount of the exposure atoms, therefore, large the distance between atoms on the surface. This could cause the small bond force constant and result in the longer bond lengths. A new shoulder peak at 741 cm−1 which was N\uf8ffH bending vibration appeared in sample BT/C NFs due to the concentrated HNO3 treatment before the alkali hydrothermal treatment. The broad band between 3300 and 3700 cm−1 might be mainly due to the adsorbed moisture, which confirmed TGA measurements in Figure b.\nFigure b shows the Raman spectra of the two samples. The Raman spectra of T/C NFs exhibited four Raman vibration characteristic peaks at ≈148, 397, 507, and 634 cm−1 corresponding to the lattice vibrational model of Eg(1), B1g(1), B1g(2) + A1g, and Eg(3) of the anatase TiO2 phase, respectively. A new peak at 205 cm−1 was observed in sample BT/C NFs due to the exposure of TiO2, which can be assigned to the Eg(1) vibration model. It was noted that the peak at 634 cm−1, which was assigned to O\uf8ffTi\uf8ffO bond vibration departing from the static Ti center shifted to left, suggesting longer O\uf8ffTi\uf8ffO bond lengths, which was in consistent with the FT‐IR results. The peak at 397 cm−1 which was O\uf8ffTi\uf8ffO bond stretch vibration toward static Ti center and 507 cm−1 which was assigned to Ti\uf8ffO\uf8ffTi bond bending vibration shifted to right, suggesting shorter Ti\uf8ffO\uf8ffTi bond lengths. These results were also in consistent with FT‐IR results. Likewise, there were two more peaks of both samples at 1354 and 1590 cm−1 which could be commonly assigned to the D and G bands, indicating the presence of amorphous carbon in the as‐prepared samples. The D/G band intensity ratio of BT/C NFs (≈0.95) decreased a little compared to T/C NFs (≈0.99), indicating less defects and higher graphitization degree after the second calcination treatment. In addition, the G band that contains sp2 hybridization was more beneficial for improving the electronic conductivity, compared with the sp3 hybridization attached to D band. The enhanced electronic conductivity was able to fast the ions' diffusion and electrons' transportation, which would enhance the electrochemical performance of the BT/C NFs.\nThe surface element composition and valence state of BT/C NFs were determined by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Figure ). The survey scan spectrum in Figure a attested that both of T/C NFs and BT/C NFs possessed Ti, O, and C, which were in consistent with the previous EDS outcomes. It could also be observed that the intensity of Ti 2p and O 1s in sample BT/C NFs was much stronger than that of T/C NFs, while the intensity of C 1s was the opposite. This was mainly due to the exposure of TiO2 on the surface of BT/C NFs, since the XPS spectra only revealed the properties of materials with the depth of nanometers from the surface. This result was in consistent with the element mapping. Figure b presents the high‐resolution Ti 2p spectra of both samples, and the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks for sample T/C NFs were 458.6 and 464.3 eV, respectively, indicating that the oxidation state of Ti was +4. It was observed that the peaks of BT/C NFs shifted to higher values by 0.1–0.2 eV; this cause was possibly that encapsulation of the TiO2 in the carbon matrix for T/C NFs influenced the binding energy of Ti 2p electrons while the surface was consisted with exposure TiO2 for BT/C NFs. The main portion of the response in Figure c could come from TiO2, as evidenced by the O 1s binding energy peak at ≈529.8 eV for BT/C NFs. The peak in the O 1s fitted spectra located at 531.1 eV for T/C NFs and 530.2 eV for BT/C NFs was assigned to the OH− radical, adsorbed oxygen, or carbonyl. As for the high binding energy peak at 532.3 eV for T/C NFs and 531.3 eV for BT/C NFs, it possibly originated from absorbed H2O. The three fitted O 1s peaks of the T/C NFs were smaller than that of BT/C NFs, due to the encapsulation of TiO2 in the carbon matrix, which was similar to that of Ti 2p and the influence of acid treatment process. The state of carbon in the samples was obtained by C 1s spectrum in Figure d. Deconvolution of the C 1s spectrum indicated the presence of three types of carbon bonds in both samples, namely, C\uf8ffC, C\uf8ffO, and C\uf8feO. The main portion located at ≈284.8 eV was attributed the unoxidized carbon. The peaks at 286.2 eV for T/C NFs and 286.6 eV for BT/C NFs were attributed to oxidant carbon, which were in accordance with the fitted O 1s peaks. The remained peaks at 288.2 eV for T/C NFs and 288.6 eV for BT/C NFs possibly came from a trace amount of carboxyl in the hybrid samples. It could be observed that the peaks of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO shifted to higher values. This was mainly due to that the acid treatment process may introduce an increase in fiber surface energy, and the exposure of TiO2 leading to the decrease of carbon on the surface for BT/C NFs, which was in accordance with O 1s spectrum.\nTo get insight into the structural evolution process from T/C NFs to BT/C NFs, a series of experiments were carried out. Figure S4 (Supporting Information) shows the morphology of BT/C NFs without being acid treatment before hydrothermal treatment. It could be observed that the fibers remained in their original morphologies with relatively smooth surface. This result indicated that the acid treatment process of T/C NFs was indispensable for the formation of the branched morphologies. Then the effect of acid treatment for T/C NFs was investigated by detecting the FT‐IR spectrum. As shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), all of the characteristic peaks in the FT‐IR spectrum were the same except for the peak located at 1715 cm−1 which was assigned to \uf8ffCOOH. This illustrated that acid treatment enhanced the hydrophilicity of the T/C NFs. The hydrophilicity was further confirmed by contact angle testing. As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), the contact angle between T/C NFs and water was 141°. However, after acid treatment, the contact angle reduced to nearly 0°, indicating that the fiber after acid treatment can be soaked by water completely. Moreover, acid treatment could partially etched the microstructure of the fiber surface, resulting in the exposure of TiO2 by spalling of some amorphous carbon particles, which was beneficial for the alkali hydrothermal treatment. Figure S7 (Supporting Information) shows the morphologies obtained at different hydrothermal treatment times at 120 °C. It could be seen that only a few short nanofibers dispersed on the surface of T/C NFs at 0.5 h. With the increase of time, more and more branches were formed and when the time was increased to 2 h, the branched morphologies were well obtained. But the branches collapsed gradually with the further increase of hydrothermal time. The same phenomenon was also observed in the different temperature experiments, as shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). These results indicated that the hydrothermal time and temperature were very important factors for the formation of well‐branched morphologies.\nAccording to the above experiments, a possible formation mechanism of the BT/C NFs could be proposed as follows: the acid treatment process enhanced the hydrophily and spalling of some carbon on the surface of the fibers which was in favor of the contact between T/C NFs and the alkali solution, and simultaneously lets TiO2 on the surface or near‐surface to expose to the alkali solution. Under the concentrated alkali conditions, the anatase crystallites would be exfoliated into layered sheets. These sheets remained unstable structure on the T/C NFs due to the increased dangling bonds on the edges and inclined to bend to reduce system energy. These processes accompanied with the regrowth of TiO2 from the dissolved sheets in the aqueous solution and the loss of another part of some carbon on the surface of T/C NFs. Finally, the branched morphologies were successfully in situ obtained (as shown in Scheme a).\nThe free‐standing membranes were directly used as anodes for SIBs (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Sodium insertion performance of the BT/C NFs anode was studied by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements in the range of 0.01–3 V (vs Na/Na+). As demonstrated in Figure a, two large and broad cathodic bands appeared at the potential region of 1.8–0.01 V in the first negative scan. During subsequent cycles, the intensity was considerably decreased, suggesting the formation of a solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) layer by the electrolyte decomposition. The cathodic and anodic current bands kept their shapes and intensities almost unchanged during the subsequent scans, implying the stable and reversible redox reactions of the material. Such results were already observed in the previous study reported by Xiong et al. The galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of BT/C NFs electrode cycled at 200 mA g−1 were shown in Figure b. Similar to the CV features, the charge/discharge profiles were sloping without distinct plateaus, suggesting homogeneous Na+ insertion into the TiO2 lattices. The initial charge/discharge capacities of the BT/C NFs electrode were 636/329 mA h g−1, corresponding to an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 51.7%. This low ICE was attributed to side reactions including electrolyte reduction, and the high surface area significantly increased the SEI formation in the first cycle. This phenomenon was also frequently encountered by the nongraphite Li+‐insertion anodes due to the formation of SEI layer, which was produced by the decomposition of electrolyte and can be well solved by a prelithiation technique for practical applications.\nThe cycle performance and the Coulombic efficiency of BT/C NFs electrode at a current density of 200 mA g−1 were investigated and presented in Figure c. Because of the SEI layer formation, the electrode showed capacity decays in the initial few cycles and then reach stable values. After a long time cycling of 1000 cycles, a high discharge capacity of 283.5 mA h g−1 can be still achieved. The reversible capacity retention was 86.1%, with a capacity fading of ≈0.014% per cycle. It is noteworthy that after the initial several cycles, the Coulombic efficiency increased to ≈100%, indicating a superior reversibility during charge/discharge process. In contrast, the T/C NFs' electrode delivered a relatively low discharge capacity of 147.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the discharge capacity of BT/C NFs was also much higher than that of pure branched TiO2 NFs without carbon and pure carbon derived from electrospinning of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; Figure S9, Supporting Information).\nThe rate performances of the BT/C NFs and T/C NFs were further evaluated at various charge/discharge rates from 50 to 2000 mA g−1 and then returned to 50 mA g−1. Figure d,e displayed charge/discharge profiles at different current densities. It highlighted the excellent rate capability of BT/C NFs. As shown in Figure d,e, the reversible capacity for ten cycles of BT/C NFs electrode was slightly decreased from 358.6 mA h g−1 to 323.9, 292.7, 261.0, and 236.1 mA h g−1 with increasing current densities from 50 mA g−1 to 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Even when the current density was raised up to a very high rate of 2000 mA g−1, this electrode can still obtain a capacity of 204.1 mA h g−1, indicating a rapid reaction process of sodium‐ion insertion. Remarkably, when returning the current density back to 50 mA g−1, the reversible capacity can be almost fully recovered, indicating the stability of the electrode under a wide range of current densities. This superior rate performance was apparently ascribed to the nanoarchitectural design of the branched TiO2/C composites, whose large surface area could provide abundant active sites for Na+ insertion. Meanwhile their surrounding carbon matrix could offer a high electric conduction and the in situ growth of branches could offer smooth paths for fast electron transport. However, the T/C NFs' electrode showed lower rate capacities than that of BT/C NFs at all the current densities.\nTo explain the high rate performance, we analyzed the pseudocapacitance contribution in the BT/C NFs by investigating the kinetics of electrode to separate the diffusion‐controlled capacity and capacitance‐controlled capacity. It was noted in Figure b that the charge/discharge curves were prone to be linear without an obvious plateau. This indicated that the energy storage process in the material was not a diffusion‐dominated behavior but a more capacitive one. To gain a better understanding of the remarkable cycling stability and high rate capacity of the BT/C NFs anode, CV curves at different scan rates were tested to evaluate the electrochemical kinetics toward Na+. As shown in Figure a, the CV curves at various scan rates from 0.1 to 0.7 mV s−1 displayed a similar shape. A couple of broad cathode/anode peaks were located at 0.81/0.66 V in the anodic and cathodic curves, corresponding to the reversible reaction of Ti3+/Ti4+ for the sodiation/desodiation process. According to the relationship between the scan rate (v) and peak current density (i)i\u2009=\u2009avborlogi\u2009=\u2009loga+blogvwhere a and b are adjustable parameters. The value of b was the slope of log(v)–log(i) plots. It was well known that b‐value represented the ratio of capacitive contribution, which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. The b‐value of 0.5 represented a diffusion‐controlled behavior and 1.0 corresponding to a capacitive‐controlled behavior. The fitted b‐values for the anodic and cathodic peaks were 0.93 and 0.88 at the sweep rates between 0.1 and 0.7 mV s−1, respectively, suggesting that the electrochemical reaction kinetics was mainly capacitive‐controlled instead of diffusion‐controlled (Figure b). The capacitive contribution ratio under different scan rates could be quantified by the Equation  or Equation  according to Dunni(V)\u2009=\u2009k1v+k2v1/2ori(V)/v1/2\u2009=\u2009k1v1/2+k2where k1 or k2 is a constant for a given potential V. k1v and k2v1/2 represent the capacitance‐controlled contribution and the diffusion‐controlled contribution, respectively. By plotting i(V)/v1/2 and v1/2 curves at different potentials, one can calculate the values of k1 and k2 from the straight lines. Then the fraction of the current at specific potentials to the capacitive‐ and diffusion‐controlled insertion one can be quantified. Figure c shows the contribution of the pseudocapacitive behavior at 0.5 mV s−1 and the cyan area calculated as 81.8% represented the contribution of pseudocapacitive behavior. Figure d shows that the proportion of the pseudocapacitive contribution gradually improved from 70.8% to 88.3% with the increase of scan rates. This result revealed that the majority of the capacity originated from surface pseudocapacitive behavior, which strengthened the Na+ insertion/extraction and guaranteed its excellent electrochemical performance.\nIn order to further confirm the charge transfer and Na+ diffusion kinetics in the electrode materials, the electrochemical impedance (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests were performed. Figure S10 (Supporting Information) shows the Nyquist plots of BT/C NFs' and T/C NFs' electrodes. In addition, the corresponding equivalent electrical circuit was also shown in the inset of Figure S10 (Supporting Information). Both samples showed a similar shape with a semicircle in the high frequency and a straight line in the low frequency, corresponding to the charge transfer and diffusion process, respectively. The diameter of the semicircle of BT/C NFs' electrode was smaller than that of T/C NFs, suggesting that the BT/C NFs' electrode possessed low contact and charge transfer impedances. A more detailed analysis of the impedance spectra was undertaken on the basis of the fitted equivalent electrical circuit, where Rs represented the Ohmic resistance (including resistance of electrolyte, separator, and electrical contacts) and Rct was the charge transfer resistance. The low Rct value represented the fast kinetic of the Faradic reactions. ZW was referred to as the ion diffusion resistance in the electrolyte, also known as Warburg impedance. CPE1 and CPE2 were the constant phase angle elements. CPE1 represented the capacitances of the interface layers on the electrode surfaces and double layer capacitance while CPE2 represented the intercalation capacitance. The values of these components were listed in Table S1 (Supporting information).The Rct values for the BT/C NFs and T/C NFs were 262 and 498 Ω, respectively. The smaller Rct value of the BT/C NFs indicated that BT/C NFs had a lower activation energy for the ion diffusion and undergone a fast Faradaic reaction. The superior kinetics characteristics of sample BT/C NFs were attributed to the rapid diffusion of electrolyte on the surface profiting from the large surface area and the narrow distributed mesopores obtained via in situ fabrication. This feature could increase active sites for electrochemical reactions and reduce diffusion pathway of Na+ simultaneously. Moreover, the continuous structure of BT/C NFs also provided smooth pathways for fast transmission of Na+ and electrons, and the carbon in the trunk improved the electronic conductivity (Scheme c). This result supported the increased electrochemical performance of BT/C NFs' electrode in comparison to the T/C NFs.\nThe GITT results are shown in Figure S11 (Supporting information). Figure S11a (Supporting information) shows the potential response of the electrodes during GITT measurement which were discharged for 10 min at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and followed with an open‐circuit relaxation for 2 h. In general, the BT/C NFs exhibited smaller overpotentials than that of T/C NFs. The difference was more obvious in the higher voltage range than in the lower range, which implied the better kinetic property of BT/C NFs. The calculated Na+ diffusion kinetics (DNa+) during the discharge process were clearly presented in Figure S11c (Supporting information), and the calculation could be found in Figure S11b (Supporting information). Both electrodes showed a progressively decreasing DNa+ with the sodiation proceeding, which was associated with the sloping characteristics of the discharge profiles. It was obviously that BT/C NFs exhibited much higher DNa+ than that of the T/C NFs' electrode, suggesting the much faster Na+ diffusion in BT/C NFs. This result was in accordance with EIS.\nThe SEM images of the free‐standing BT/C NFs' electrode after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge are displayed in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). The branched structure of BT/C NFs was maintained following the repeated Na‐cycling, although the branches on the surface of trunk became sparse, indicating the structural stability of the BT/C NFs. This result illustrated the advantage of the in situ fabrication, which leaved the materials with strong structural stability. It also maintained the preferred 1D continuous morphology, owing to the free‐standing feature, which leaved out the steps of preparing slurry and also ensured the mechanical stability and stability of the cycling performance of the electrodes. There are also a variety of advantages for the free‐standing branched structure of TiO2/carbon nanofibers when directly used as binder‐free anode materials for SIBs: i) the in situ growth of the branches with the free‐standing film feature can reduce ion transport resistance and endow the materials with strong structures stability; ii) the large surface area supplies abundant active sites; iii) the composition with carbon can enhance the electronic conductivity of the composite materials; and iv) the interconnected network structure also facilitates electron transfer.\nThe potential practical applications of BT/C NFs were further studied by assessing the assembled Na‐ion full cells with Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) as cathode materials (Figure S13a, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S13b,c (Supporting Information), the NVP/C cathode displayed a steady potential plateau at 3.4 V with a capacity of 85 mA h g−1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2 C. Furthermore, the BT/C NFs//NVP/C full cell afforded a reversible capacity of about 70 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 (Figure S13d, Supporting Information). This demonstrated the possible application of BT/C NFs' electrodes in practice.\nTo better understand the electrochemical performance of BT/C NFs in this work, recent investigations based on carbon and TiO2 composites for SIB anodes were compared, as shown in Figure S14 (Supporting Information). It was noticeable that the obtained BT/C NFs exhibited a higher rate performance than most of the other carbon and TiO2 composite anode materials, making it one of the promising candidates for SIBs.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'medium', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}
