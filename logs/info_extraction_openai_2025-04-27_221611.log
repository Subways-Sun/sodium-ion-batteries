After 88 h of alkalization process, the 2D layered Ti3C2 with micrometer size (Figure , Supporting Information) transformed into the intermediate product a‐Ti3C2 formed by stacking nanoparticle units. The nanoparticles on the surface of a‐Ti3C2 self‐assembled into fibers (Figure , Supporting Information). As reaction time is prolonged to 156 h, all nanoparticle units of a‐Ti3C2 have completed self‐assembly to form 1D fibrous and hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2), as shown in Figure . Its tube diameter is 30–40\xa0nm, and the internal lattice spacing is further increased (Figure\xa0). The solutions with weight mass ratio of h‐Ti3C2 to CNTs (Figure\xa0) of 0:1, 0.3:1, and 1.0:1, are prepared through ultrasonic mixing, and abbreviated as CNTs, 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (or h‐Ti3C2/CNTs) and 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (Figure , Supporting Information) and 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs solution (Figure\xa0) indicated that the h‐Ti3C2 closely intertwined with CNTs, which would contribute to well mechanical property and tenacity of h‐M‐SSG resulting in a benign 3D conductive network. The h‐M‐SSG scaffold is prepared by vacuum filtration in the order of 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, and CNTs solutions, as shown in Figure\xa0. The sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 content of h‐M‐SSG gradually increased from top to bottom.\nAs we can see from TEM–energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (TEM–EDX) elemental mappings (Figure 2f; Figure , Supporting Information), O and F elements are uniformly distributed throughout h‐Ti3C2, which play a key role in inducing Na homogeneous deposition. Meanwhile, the increasement of lattice spacing of h‐Ti3C2 conduces to the adsorption of K+ during the alkalization process, and resulted in the increasing of K element content. It is worth noting that the high sodiophilic peculiarity of h‐M‐SSG stems from the rich content of O, F, and K function groups of h‐Ti3C2, as shown in Figure\xa0, Figures\xa0 and  in the Supporting Information. Among them, the O and F functional groups possess relatively large binding energies with Na atom, which can effectively reduce nucleation energy, and form the sodiophilic sites. The corresponding high X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of O1s and F1s are shown in Figure\xa0, respectively. From these XPS spectra, we can know that most of O and F functional groups are bonded with Ti of h‐Ti3C2. As for the K functional group, it could be alloyed with Na, which further improves the sodiophilic property of h‐Ti3C2.\nThe different thicknesses of the h‐M‐SSG scaffolds from 80 to 250\xa0µm are easily prepared by adjusting the volume of various h‐Ti3C2/CNTs solutions during the preparation, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The various thickness scaffolds can be applied to meet the requirements of different application scenarios. To get more clearly gradient structure in the characterization of SEM–EDX, we choose the thickness about 250\xa0µm as a research object. In addition, the thickness of h‐M‐SSG scaffold is in direct relation to the thickness of Na composite anode. Therefore, the thicker h‐M‐SSG/Na composite anode is more suitable for the following cycling experiment of ultrahigh charging/discharging areal capacity, such as 1–40 mAh cm−2. The prepared h‐M‐SSG keeps perfect without any cracks or deformation after several times repeated folding operation (Figure ), indicating that it possesses satisfied flexibility. This trait is inherited on h‐M‐SSG/Na composite anode. In Figure\xa0, the prepared h‐M‐SSG film with the thickness about 250 μm has a relatively loose porous structure (101.4 m2 g−1, shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information), which is conducive to increase sodium loading capacity and reduce the local current density during cycling to lengthen the Sand's time for inhibiting dendrites growth. In order to verify the stepped gradient structure of h‐M‐SSG, it is characterized by EDS‐mapping. It is worth noting that Ti element comes from h‐Ti3C2, while C element comes from h‐Ti3C2 and CNTs. As shown in Figure\xa0, the structure of h‐M‐SSG can clearly be divided into three layers based on Ti content, indicating that the sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 content stepped increases from top to bottom. This viewpoint is also further verified by the distribution graph of C content (Figure\xa0) and related element line scanning (Figure , Supporting Information). Among them, the presence of sporadic Ti element in the top layer of h‐M‐SSG may be caused by slight interference between different solution layers during the preparation process.\nThe different capacity‐limited protocols are conducted to plate Na on the h‐M‐SSG scaffolds to explore the deposition behavior. The corresponding schematic illustration about bottom‐up deposition and related optical photograph are shown in Figure\xa0. The optical photograph of the bottom of h‐M‐SSG exhibits obvious metallic luster (silvery white) after Na deposition with the capacity of 10 mAh cm−2, whereas the top surface does not, which obvious demonstrates that the sodiophilic gradient structure of h‐M‐SSG could induce Na deposition preferentially at the bottom of anode. This conclusion is further confirmed by the cross‐sectional SEM images of h‐M‐SSG after Na deposition, as shown in Figure\xa0. After 1 h of Na deposition at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, Na filled the whole of h‐M‐SSG, but it could be clearly divided into three layers based on the compactness of Na. The Na layer at the bottom of the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is the most compact and thickest layer, which almost forms a smooth plane without any voids (Figure\xa0).\xa0The\xa0Na layer at the middle of the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is relatively compact. Amounts of microsize sodium particles are stacked crossing each other, and exhibiting a rough granular surface (Figure\xa0). The Na layer at the top of h‐M‐SSG scaffold is relatively loose and porous, and still keeps bits of fibrous CNTs (Figure\xa0). Therefore, it can be inferred that the deposition behavior of Na on the h‐M‐SSG scaffold is preferentially deposition on the bottom, and then gradually deposit to the middle and top at the condition of the bottom is filled tightly. The cross‐sectional SEM of h‐M‐SSG with different Na deposition capacity‐limited of 20, 30, and 40 mAh cm−2, also verified above bottom‐up deposition behavior, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. This is caused by the fact that the rich content of sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 at the bottom.\nThe sodium deposition behaviors with the capacity of 10 mAh cm–2 on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs) and CNTs scaffolds, are also studied as a control group. As we can see from the cross‐sectional SEM images of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (Figure ) after Na deposition, Na filled the whole of scaffold. The obtained h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na could be clearly divided into two layers based on the compactness of Na. The upper of Na layer is compact and thick, and the bottom of Na layer is relatively loose. There is no similar bottom‐up deposition sequence as h‐M‐SSG for h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold. Therefore, the sodium deposition is uniform in the early middle stage, while it will be preferentially inducing Na deposition at the upper layer of scaffold in the latter stage. The metallic luster (silvery white) of top surface of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold after Na deposition, further verified this viewpoint (Figure\xa0). From the cross‐sectional SEM images of CNTs (Figure\xa0), we can see that Na will preferentially deposit at the surface layer of the scaffold resulting in amounts of bulges and dendrites. This is due to the poor sodiophilic property of CNTs. The metallic luster of surface of CNTs after Na deposition also verified this point (Figure\xa0). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the bottom‐up deposition sequence of h‐M‐SSG only stems from its stepped sodiophilic gradient structure.\nThe first Na plating behaviors on CNTs, h‐Ti3C2/CNTs, and h‐M‐SSG scaffolds at high current density of 10 mA cm−2, are investigated by in situ XRD. Their corresponding color plots of XRD patterns are shown in Figure\xa0, respectively. The characteristic peak of Na2CO3 appeared after the deposition time of 6 and 15\xa0min for Na–CNTs and Na–h‐Ti3C2/CNTs half batteries, respectively. However, Na2CO3 is one of typical by‐product resulting from decomposition of electrolyte or the side reaction between Na metal and electrolyte. Compared to Na–CNTs half‐batteries, the signal intensity and presentation time of characteristic peak of Na2CO3 for Na–h‐Ti3C2/CNTs is weaker and later, which means the relatively mild side reaction. This is largely due to the sodiophilic h‐Ti3C2 component of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs scaffold. As for the XRD pattern of Na–h‐M‐SSG, there is still no signal peak of Na2CO3, which means that the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure could effectively inhibit side reaction. That is to say, the h‐M‐SSG scaffold with sodiophilic gradient structure possesses excellent affordability for high current density and capacity.\nThe sodium‐ion transfer resistances of Na, CNTs/Na, h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, and h‐M‐SSG/Na are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figures  and  in the Supporting Information. After 100 charge/discharge cycling times at 1.0 mA cm−2 and 1.0 mAh cm−2, the symmetric battery based on h‐M‐SSG/Na shows the smallest semicircle (3.18 Ω), which means that it possesses the most favorable Na+ transfer kinetics. This conclusion is further verified by Tafel plot, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. Compared with Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, the Tafel curve of the h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetric battery exhibited the maximum intersection with the y‐axis. It means the largest exchange current for Na plating/stripping in h‐M‐SSG/Na anode (I0\xa0= 11.88 mA cm–2) and fastest charge transfer kinetic.\nTo further investigate the inhibiting Na dendrites effect of sodiophilic gradient structure, the morphological change of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na are observed by an in situ optical microscopy during Na stripping and replating at 10 mA cm−2. The flat surface of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrode became uneven, and generated amounts of micrometer‐level protrudes and dendrites after Na stripping for 30\xa0min and replating for 30\xa0min, as shown in Figure\xa0. This is due to the preferential stripping and re‐plating behavior on top layer of h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na at high current density, which would cause serious tip effect resulting in nonuniform deposition and intensifying the formation of dendrites. By comparison, the surface of h‐M‐SSG/Na remained flat and no trace of dendrite (Figure\xa0), which is due to the bottom‐up deposition sequence of h‐M‐SSG. In conclusion, the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure can effectively enhance the affordability of h‐M‐SSG for high current density and capacity. It is worth noting that the high sodiophilic peculiarity of h‐M‐SSG stems from the rich content of O and F function groups of h‐Ti3C2. It is further demonstrated by the first‐principles DFT calculations (Figure\xa0; Figure , Supporting Information). The most stable structures of a single Na atom absorbed on h‐Ti3C2 surface groups (h‐Ti3C2O, h‐Ti3C2F) and CNTs and corresponding binding energies are shown in Figure\xa0. The binding energies between Na atom with h‐Ti3C2O (−10.8\xa0eV) and h‐Ti3C2F (−2.0\xa0eV) are significantly larger than CNTs (−1.1\xa0eV). The stronger binding energy means effectively reduce nucleation energy and form the sodiophilic sites, which is conducive to the uniform Na plating/stripping and dendrite‐free anode.\nThe long‐term cycling stability of symmetrical batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na is assessed by galvanostatic tests. The symmetrical batteries based on Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na anodes are also studied as a control group. At the relatively moderate current densities (1, 5 mA cm−2) and capacities (1, 5 mAh cm−2), symmetrical batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na and h‐Ti3C2/Na anodes exhibit a low polarization voltage and excellent cycling stability, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. The charging–discharge curve of symmetrical batteries based on Na and CNTs/Na anodes, in contrast, show a huge fluctuation and large polarization voltage. For instance, symmetrical batteries based on h‐Ti3C2/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes, remain a low voltage of 0.113–0.050\xa0V, respectively, for more than 1200 h at 1.0 and 1.0 mAh cm−2. On the contrary, symmetrical batteries based on CNTs/Na and pure Na shown a huge polarization voltage fluctuation after cycling time of 300 h.\nWith the current density increased from 5 mA cm−2 to 10, 15, 20, 40 mA cm−2, the cycling stability of symmetrical batteries based on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na and h‐M‐SSG/Na are beginning to show an enormous difference. The symmetric cell based on h‐M‐SSG/Na has a stable charge–discharge curve and a low polarization voltage of only 93\xa0mV for more than 100 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 10 mAh cm−2, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. However, the charge–discharge curve of symmetric battery based on h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na, shows a huge voltage fluctuation, and the polarization voltage began to increase sharply after 9 h operation, and exceeds 1.79\xa0V at 100 h. Impressively, the excellent cycling stability of h‐M‐SSG/Na also continues at high current density of 15, 20, 40 mA cm−2 and high areal capacity of 15, 20, 40 mAh cm−2, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. For example, symmetric battery based on h‐M‐SSG/Na exhibits the charge–discharge curves and a low polarization voltage of only 0.145\xa0V for more than 180 h at 40.0 mA cm−2 and 40.0 mAh cm−2. However, the charge–discharge cycle curves of symmetric batteries based on Na, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na anodes, show a huge fluctuation, and large polarization voltages more than 1.212, 0.584, and 0.547\xa0V, respectively. It further highlights the advantages of h‐M‐SSG framework. Therefore, we can know that the stepped sodiophilic gradient structure could effectively improve the affordability of the scaffold for high current density and capacity, and maintain a lower polarization voltage and longer cycling life in symmetrical batteries. In addition, the related plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies (CE) data of Na || Cu and Na || h‐M‐SSG half batteries are provided in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The first Coulombic CE of Na || h‐M‐SSG half battery is as high as 99.99%, and its cycle life is far superior to that of Na || Cu battery. The cycling performance of h‐M‐SSG/Na is well ahead of all the other previous reported scaffolds for Na composited anodes for cycling current density and areal capacity, as shown in Figure\xa0. Most of scaffold‐based Na anodes are limited by the high charging/discharging capacity (>5 mAh cm−2) at current density (>10 mA cm−2). In addition, the rate performance of h‐M‐SSG/Na is also studied by charge/discharge cycling at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mA cm−2 (Figure , Supporting Information). The voltage hysteresis of h‐M‐SSG/Na stepped increases with ampere density and maintains excellent steady even at 40 mA cm−2, which demonstrate the excellent rate performance. On the contrary, the symmetric batteries based on pure Na, CNTs/Na, and h‐Ti3C2/Na exhibit the huge voltage fluctuations with the increasing of current density.\nTo further verified the feasibility of h‐M‐SSG in practical battery, Na−O2 batteries based on h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes, are assembled (Figure\xa0). The cycling lifetime and potential gap of batteries are tested at 1000 mA g−1 (0.14 mA cm−2, based on the practical loading of Super‐P on carbon paper is 0.14 mg cm−2) and a control capacity of 1000 mAh g−1 (0.14 mAh cm−2). The Na–O2 battery with h‐M‐SSG/Na anode keeps a stable charge–discharge curve with an average CE of 93.74%, and a low potential gap of 0.137\xa0mV for more than 45 cycles, as shown in Figure\xa0 and Figure  in the Supporting Information. However, the cycling life of Na–O2 batteries with pure Na metal, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrodes are 5, 15, and 24 cycles, respectively, as shown in Figure  in the Supporting Information. The discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries with pure Na metal, CNTs/Na and h‐Ti3C2/CNTs/Na electrodes decreased to 548 mAh g−1 (after 7 cycles), 682 mAh g−1 (after 17 cycles) and 151 mAh g−1 (after 24 cycles), respectively. Furthermore, the rate performance of Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na anodes are investigated at the different current densities and a control capacity of 1000 mAh g−1. With the increasement of current density (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mA g−1), the low overpotential gap of batteries is 81, 87, 91, 95, 113, 220, and 425\xa0mV, respectively, which implying the satisfied rate performance (Figure\xa0). Therefore, the introduction of sodiophilic gradient structure in Na–O2 cell can effectively reduce overpotential, and improve the rate performance and cycle life at high current density.\nAs for Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na electrodes, its current density of 1000 mA g−1 is relatively higher than that of the common Na–O2 batteries with pure Na‐metal anodes of 200–500 mA g−1. Due to the open system of Na–O2 batteries, the discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries with h‐M‐SSG/Na electrodes cut‐off with 1000 mAh g−1. The increase of discharge capacity of Na–O2 batteries will increase the running time and aggravate the shuttle effect of O2 between Na‐metal anode and electrolyte resulting in terrible cycling performance. In our next research work, we plan to make use of the synergistic effect of h‐M‐SSG/Na and quasi‐solid electrolyte to resolve above problem and improve discharge capacity.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Among of them, the concentration of CNTs aqueous solution was about 2.0 mg L−1. The h‐M‐SSG scaffold was prepared by vacuum filtration in the order of 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), and CNTs solutions (10\xa0mL), and using two glass plates to keep smooth at 55\xa0°C for 16 h under vacuum condition.\n\nPreparation of the Cathode of Na–O2 Battery\nThe super‐P of 7.5\xa0mg and PVDF of 0.833\xa0mg were mixed in 75\xa0mL ethanol.

The surface properties of samples were tested by XPS (Perkin Elmer PHI). The electrolytes in symmetrical and Na–O2 batteries were 1 mol L−1 NaCF3SO3‐diglyme (NaOTF‐G2) solution. The diameter of electrodes in all batteries was 8.0\xa0mm. All batteries were assembled in glovebox under the condition Ar atmosphere.

However, considering the variability of electrolyte system and the complexity of SEI formation, the dynamic evolution of electrolyte near the surface of Na metal is much difficult to simulate based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Therefore, the electrolyte was kept unchanged in the whole experiments, thus ensuring that the electrolyte has the same effect on the Na deposition process.

Among of them, the concentration of CNTs aqueous solution was about 2.0 mg L−1. The h‐M‐SSG scaffold was prepared by vacuum filtration in the order of 1.0‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), 0.3‐h‐Ti3C2/CNTs (10\xa0mL), and CNTs solutions (10\xa0mL), and using two glass plates to keep smooth at 55\xa0°C for 16 h under vacuum condition.\n\nPreparation of the Cathode of Na–O2 Battery\nThe super‐P of 7.5\xa0mg and PVDF of 0.833\xa0mg were mixed in 75\xa0mL ethanol. After ultrasonic mixing for 2 h, this solution was spray coated onto the carbon paper with the size of 6\xa0cm × 7\xa0cm under 100\xa0°C. This TGP‐H‐060 hydrophilia carbon paper with the thickness of 0.19\xa0mm and density of 0.44 g cm−3 was purchased from Toray Corporation of Japan. The weight of a carbon‐paper disk with the diameter of 8.0\xa0mm in Na–O2 battery was 4.202\xa0mg. The final practical loading of Super‐P on carbon paper was only 0.14 mg cm−2.\n\nCharacterization\nThe SEM (JSM‐7500F, JEOL) and HR‐TEM (FEI Talos F200x G2) were used to characterized the morphology and structure of samples. The surface properties of samples were tested by XPS (Perkin Elmer PHI). The electrolytes in symmetrical and Na–O2 batteries were 1 mol L−1 NaCF3SO3‐diglyme (NaOTF‐G2) solution. The diameter of electrodes in all batteries was 8.0\xa0mm. All batteries were assembled in glovebox under the condition Ar atmosphere. The cycling lifetime and potential gap of Na–O2 batteries were tested in pure O2 at cut‐off voltage of 1.8–2.0\xa0V. The current density of Na–O2 batteries was calculated from the loading of Super‐P on carbon paper.\n\nComputational Details\nThe solution environment does affect the deposition process of Na. However, considering the variability of electrolyte system and the complexity of SEI formation, the dynamic evolution of electrolyte near the surface of Na metal is much difficult to simulate based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Therefore, the electrolyte was kept unchanged in the whole experiments, thus ensuring that the electrolyte has the same effect on the Na deposition process. DFT analysis were performed here for qualitatively comparing the interaction between different substrates and Na. The similar DFT analysis in other research works can further verify above viewpoints.[] All the calculations were carried out by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)[] with the projector augmented wave (PAW)[] potentials for core electrons and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)[] form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchange and correlation functional. An energy cutoff of 450\xa0eV was adopted for the plane wave expansion of valence electron wave functions. A 4 × 4 × 2 k‐point mesh was used for geometric optimization of the 3 × 3 supercell of Ti3C2. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was introduced to avoid interactions between adjacent layers. All structures were relaxed with all atoms allowed to move until the force was less than 0.02\xa0eV Å−1.

Interestingly, the sample BT/C NFs showed a branched structure (Figure c,d) after the alkali hydrothermal treatment, where numerous short branches were well in situ grown with a remarkably high density covered the entire surface of the pristine T/C NFs. It is noted that the average diameter of BT/C NFs (≈800 nm) was larger than those of T/C NFs (≈500 nm), contributing to the stripping and regrowth of TiO2 during the alkali hydrothermal process. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) records the composition changes of samples during the alkali etching process. As presented in Figure S1a (Supporting Information), the energy dispersive X‐ray spectrometry (EDS) investigation verified that the sample T/C NFs only consisted of C, Ti, and O. After alkali hydrothermal treatment, additional Na+ ions appeared (Figure S1b, Supporting Information), and it could be completely removed by the ion‐exchange treatment (Figure S1c,d, Supporting Information).\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to further investigate the detail morphology of as‐prepared BT/C NFs (Figure ). From Figure a, it could be observed that the surface of BT/C NFs was rough, with many branches randomly growing to the trunk, which was in well consistent with scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. According to the high‐resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Figure b, the lattice fringes with spacing was measured to be 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (103) crystal plane of anatase TiO2. The detailed structure collected from the interface between the branch and the trunk is shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It could be seen clearly that the branch rooted into the trunk and a pore was left in the trunk due to the exfoliation of TiO2 on the surface (the yellow line marking area). The trunk remained a good crystallinity, and the branch also showed good crystallinity due to the second calcination after alkali hydrothermal treatment. The amorphous regions around the lattice fringes reflected the disordered carbon phase, and the lattice of graphitic carbon can also be observed clearly (Figure S2, Supporting Information). This feature can not only reinforce the connection between the branches and the trunk, but also provide smooth migration channels for electrons, and ions for the branches were in situ grown on the trunks. The elemental mapping analysis of a single BT/C NF in Figure c further certified the successful preparation of branched TiO2/C nanofibers. Element Ti and O were distributed in the whole nanofibers while element C was only located at the trunk region, illustrating that the branches were only composed with TiO2. This feature was in favor of the contact with electrolyte for TiO2 and guaranteed the well electrical conductivity of the BT/C NFs' electrode at the same time.\nThe crystal phases of the T/C NFs and BT/C NFs were defined by X‐ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure a, both samples exhibited the identical phase structure of anatase TiO2. The major diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 25.32°, 37.75°, 48.01°, 53.90°, 55.07°, 62.72°, 68.77°, 70.14°, and 75.05° belonged to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21‐1272), respectively. A broad peak at around 26° indicated the existence of amorphous carbon, as shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). There were no other diffraction peaks being detected, suggesting the high purity of the as‐synthesized TiO2 crystallites. Comparing with T/C NFs, the BT/C NFs sample showed better crystallization degree. This can be partly attributed to the re‐calcination process at high temperature and the extremely large surface area of BT/C NFs (Figure c) which could promote the process of crystallization. Moreover, the particle size of branched TiO2 became larger due to the exposure of them after the alkali hydrothermal treatment which is different from the sample T/C NFs with TiO2 nanoparticles being embedded in carbon matrix, which caused the sharpen peak. The high crystallinity of BT/C NFs was beneficial for the promotion of the sodium storage performance for anatase TiO2 that can supply effective paths and more accommodation sites for Na+.\nIn order to identify the carbon contents in the samples, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted. As shown in Figure b, there were two steps of weight loss in the TGA curve. The weight loss before 300 °C mainly belonged to the evaporation of adsorbed water. The sloping part between 300 and 550 °C was assigned to the combustion of carbon. The content of carbon in the BT/C NFs was estimated to be ≈48.8%, which was slightly smaller than that of T/C NFs (≈50.0%). This can be attributed to the little amount of carbon loss on the surface of nanofibers during the acid and alkali treatment process. Figure c,d demonstrates the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of the samples. As shown in Figure c, both samples showed type IV isotherm, and the hysteresis loop indicated typical characteristic of mesoporous structures. The pore size distribution plots obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm confirmed that BT/C NFs had well‐defined micropores while T/C NFs had micro‐ and mesopores. Therefore, the distribution of the pore size was much more centralized for BT/C NFs (Figure d). The unique porous features were conducive to fasting ionic diffusion and mass transport; thus, efficient electrochemical reactions were favored. The specific surface area was further calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. The specific surface area of BT/C NFs was 506.7 m2 g−1, which was ≈50 times larger than that of T/C NFs (10.7 m2 g−1). The specific surface area of BT/C NFs was also much larger than that of the similar TiO2 branched architecture (20.41 m2 g−1) obtained via epitaxy growth. Studies revealed that the increase of surface area could also facilitate fast electrons' acceptance and ions' diffusion through the branches and ensure sufficient contact between electrolyte and active materials. Thus, the high specific surface area of BT/C NFs would be beneficial for applications associated with surface structure by supplying more reaction sites, such as pseudocapacitive energy storage.\nTo provide further investigation, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) spectra and Raman spectra of the T/C NFs and BT/C NFs were conducted. From the FT‐IR spectra in Figure a, both samples showed C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO stretch. The C\uf8ffO vibrations were well retained while C\uf8feO vibration was a little shifted from 1588.4 to 1596 cm−1 after alkali hydrothermal treatment. In sample T/C NFs, Ti\uf8ffO vibration was located at 583 cm−1 while in sample BT/C NFs, it is shifted to 504.7 cm−1, indicating the longer bond lengths. This was due to the exposure of TiO2 nanoparticles of nanofibers during the acid and alkali hydrothermal treatment process, which will enhance the amount of the exposure atoms, therefore, large the distance between atoms on the surface. This could cause the small bond force constant and result in the longer bond lengths. A new shoulder peak at 741 cm−1 which was N\uf8ffH bending vibration appeared in sample BT/C NFs due to the concentrated HNO3 treatment before the alkali hydrothermal treatment. The broad band between 3300 and 3700 cm−1 might be mainly due to the adsorbed moisture, which confirmed TGA measurements in Figure b.\nFigure b shows the Raman spectra of the two samples. The Raman spectra of T/C NFs exhibited four Raman vibration characteristic peaks at ≈148, 397, 507, and 634 cm−1 corresponding to the lattice vibrational model of Eg(1), B1g(1), B1g(2) + A1g, and Eg(3) of the anatase TiO2 phase, respectively. A new peak at 205 cm−1 was observed in sample BT/C NFs due to the exposure of TiO2, which can be assigned to the Eg(1) vibration model. It was noted that the peak at 634 cm−1, which was assigned to O\uf8ffTi\uf8ffO bond vibration departing from the static Ti center shifted to left, suggesting longer O\uf8ffTi\uf8ffO bond lengths, which was in consistent with the FT‐IR results. The peak at 397 cm−1 which was O\uf8ffTi\uf8ffO bond stretch vibration toward static Ti center and 507 cm−1 which was assigned to Ti\uf8ffO\uf8ffTi bond bending vibration shifted to right, suggesting shorter Ti\uf8ffO\uf8ffTi bond lengths. These results were also in consistent with FT‐IR results. Likewise, there were two more peaks of both samples at 1354 and 1590 cm−1 which could be commonly assigned to the D and G bands, indicating the presence of amorphous carbon in the as‐prepared samples. The D/G band intensity ratio of BT/C NFs (≈0.95) decreased a little compared to T/C NFs (≈0.99), indicating less defects and higher graphitization degree after the second calcination treatment. In addition, the G band that contains sp2 hybridization was more beneficial for improving the electronic conductivity, compared with the sp3 hybridization attached to D band. The enhanced electronic conductivity was able to fast the ions' diffusion and electrons' transportation, which would enhance the electrochemical performance of the BT/C NFs.\nThe surface element composition and valence state of BT/C NFs were determined by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Figure ). The survey scan spectrum in Figure a attested that both of T/C NFs and BT/C NFs possessed Ti, O, and C, which were in consistent with the previous EDS outcomes. It could also be observed that the intensity of Ti 2p and O 1s in sample BT/C NFs was much stronger than that of T/C NFs, while the intensity of C 1s was the opposite. This was mainly due to the exposure of TiO2 on the surface of BT/C NFs, since the XPS spectra only revealed the properties of materials with the depth of nanometers from the surface. This result was in consistent with the element mapping. Figure b presents the high‐resolution Ti 2p spectra of both samples, and the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks for sample T/C NFs were 458.6 and 464.3 eV, respectively, indicating that the oxidation state of Ti was +4. It was observed that the peaks of BT/C NFs shifted to higher values by 0.1–0.2 eV; this cause was possibly that encapsulation of the TiO2 in the carbon matrix for T/C NFs influenced the binding energy of Ti 2p electrons while the surface was consisted with exposure TiO2 for BT/C NFs. The main portion of the response in Figure c could come from TiO2, as evidenced by the O 1s binding energy peak at ≈529.8 eV for BT/C NFs. The peak in the O 1s fitted spectra located at 531.1 eV for T/C NFs and 530.2 eV for BT/C NFs was assigned to the OH− radical, adsorbed oxygen, or carbonyl. As for the high binding energy peak at 532.3 eV for T/C NFs and 531.3 eV for BT/C NFs, it possibly originated from absorbed H2O. The three fitted O 1s peaks of the T/C NFs were smaller than that of BT/C NFs, due to the encapsulation of TiO2 in the carbon matrix, which was similar to that of Ti 2p and the influence of acid treatment process. The state of carbon in the samples was obtained by C 1s spectrum in Figure d. Deconvolution of the C 1s spectrum indicated the presence of three types of carbon bonds in both samples, namely, C\uf8ffC, C\uf8ffO, and C\uf8feO. The main portion located at ≈284.8 eV was attributed the unoxidized carbon. The peaks at 286.2 eV for T/C NFs and 286.6 eV for BT/C NFs were attributed to oxidant carbon, which were in accordance with the fitted O 1s peaks. The remained peaks at 288.2 eV for T/C NFs and 288.6 eV for BT/C NFs possibly came from a trace amount of carboxyl in the hybrid samples. It could be observed that the peaks of C\uf8ffO and C\uf8feO shifted to higher values. This was mainly due to that the acid treatment process may introduce an increase in fiber surface energy, and the exposure of TiO2 leading to the decrease of carbon on the surface for BT/C NFs, which was in accordance with O 1s spectrum.\nTo get insight into the structural evolution process from T/C NFs to BT/C NFs, a series of experiments were carried out. Figure S4 (Supporting Information) shows the morphology of BT/C NFs without being acid treatment before hydrothermal treatment. It could be observed that the fibers remained in their original morphologies with relatively smooth surface. This result indicated that the acid treatment process of T/C NFs was indispensable for the formation of the branched morphologies. Then the effect of acid treatment for T/C NFs was investigated by detecting the FT‐IR spectrum. As shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), all of the characteristic peaks in the FT‐IR spectrum were the same except for the peak located at 1715 cm−1 which was assigned to \uf8ffCOOH. This illustrated that acid treatment enhanced the hydrophilicity of the T/C NFs. The hydrophilicity was further confirmed by contact angle testing. As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), the contact angle between T/C NFs and water was 141°. However, after acid treatment, the contact angle reduced to nearly 0°, indicating that the fiber after acid treatment can be soaked by water completely. Moreover, acid treatment could partially etched the microstructure of the fiber surface, resulting in the exposure of TiO2 by spalling of some amorphous carbon particles, which was beneficial for the alkali hydrothermal treatment. Figure S7 (Supporting Information) shows the morphologies obtained at different hydrothermal treatment times at 120 °C. It could be seen that only a few short nanofibers dispersed on the surface of T/C NFs at 0.5 h. With the increase of time, more and more branches were formed and when the time was increased to 2 h, the branched morphologies were well obtained. But the branches collapsed gradually with the further increase of hydrothermal time. The same phenomenon was also observed in the different temperature experiments, as shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). These results indicated that the hydrothermal time and temperature were very important factors for the formation of well‐branched morphologies.\nAccording to the above experiments, a possible formation mechanism of the BT/C NFs could be proposed as follows: the acid treatment process enhanced the hydrophily and spalling of some carbon on the surface of the fibers which was in favor of the contact between T/C NFs and the alkali solution, and simultaneously lets TiO2 on the surface or near‐surface to expose to the alkali solution. Under the concentrated alkali conditions, the anatase crystallites would be exfoliated into layered sheets. These sheets remained unstable structure on the T/C NFs due to the increased dangling bonds on the edges and inclined to bend to reduce system energy. These processes accompanied with the regrowth of TiO2 from the dissolved sheets in the aqueous solution and the loss of another part of some carbon on the surface of T/C NFs. Finally, the branched morphologies were successfully in situ obtained (as shown in Scheme a).\nThe free‐standing membranes were directly used as anodes for SIBs (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Sodium insertion performance of the BT/C NFs anode was studied by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements in the range of 0.01–3 V (vs Na/Na+). As demonstrated in Figure a, two large and broad cathodic bands appeared at the potential region of 1.8–0.01 V in the first negative scan. During subsequent cycles, the intensity was considerably decreased, suggesting the formation of a solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) layer by the electrolyte decomposition. The cathodic and anodic current bands kept their shapes and intensities almost unchanged during the subsequent scans, implying the stable and reversible redox reactions of the material. Such results were already observed in the previous study reported by Xiong et al. The galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of BT/C NFs electrode cycled at 200 mA g−1 were shown in Figure b. Similar to the CV features, the charge/discharge profiles were sloping without distinct plateaus, suggesting homogeneous Na+ insertion into the TiO2 lattices. The initial charge/discharge capacities of the BT/C NFs electrode were 636/329 mA h g−1, corresponding to an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 51.7%. This low ICE was attributed to side reactions including electrolyte reduction, and the high surface area significantly increased the SEI formation in the first cycle. This phenomenon was also frequently encountered by the nongraphite Li+‐insertion anodes due to the formation of SEI layer, which was produced by the decomposition of electrolyte and can be well solved by a prelithiation technique for practical applications.\nThe cycle performance and the Coulombic efficiency of BT/C NFs electrode at a current density of 200 mA g−1 were investigated and presented in Figure c. Because of the SEI layer formation, the electrode showed capacity decays in the initial few cycles and then reach stable values. After a long time cycling of 1000 cycles, a high discharge capacity of 283.5 mA h g−1 can be still achieved. The reversible capacity retention was 86.1%, with a capacity fading of ≈0.014% per cycle. It is noteworthy that after the initial several cycles, the Coulombic efficiency increased to ≈100%, indicating a superior reversibility during charge/discharge process. In contrast, the T/C NFs' electrode delivered a relatively low discharge capacity of 147.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the discharge capacity of BT/C NFs was also much higher than that of pure branched TiO2 NFs without carbon and pure carbon derived from electrospinning of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; Figure S9, Supporting Information).\nThe rate performances of the BT/C NFs and T/C NFs were further evaluated at various charge/discharge rates from 50 to 2000 mA g−1 and then returned to 50 mA g−1. Figure d,e displayed charge/discharge profiles at different current densities. It highlighted the excellent rate capability of BT/C NFs. As shown in Figure d,e, the reversible capacity for ten cycles of BT/C NFs electrode was slightly decreased from 358.6 mA h g−1 to 323.9, 292.7, 261.0, and 236.1 mA h g−1 with increasing current densities from 50 mA g−1 to 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Even when the current density was raised up to a very high rate of 2000 mA g−1, this electrode can still obtain a capacity of 204.1 mA h g−1, indicating a rapid reaction process of sodium‐ion insertion. Remarkably, when returning the current density back to 50 mA g−1, the reversible capacity can be almost fully recovered, indicating the stability of the electrode under a wide range of current densities. This superior rate performance was apparently ascribed to the nanoarchitectural design of the branched TiO2/C composites, whose large surface area could provide abundant active sites for Na+ insertion. Meanwhile their surrounding carbon matrix could offer a high electric conduction and the in situ growth of branches could offer smooth paths for fast electron transport. However, the T/C NFs' electrode showed lower rate capacities than that of BT/C NFs at all the current densities.\nTo explain the high rate performance, we analyzed the pseudocapacitance contribution in the BT/C NFs by investigating the kinetics of electrode to separate the diffusion‐controlled capacity and capacitance‐controlled capacity. It was noted in Figure b that the charge/discharge curves were prone to be linear without an obvious plateau. This indicated that the energy storage process in the material was not a diffusion‐dominated behavior but a more capacitive one. To gain a better understanding of the remarkable cycling stability and high rate capacity of the BT/C NFs anode, CV curves at different scan rates were tested to evaluate the electrochemical kinetics toward Na+. As shown in Figure a, the CV curves at various scan rates from 0.1 to 0.7 mV s−1 displayed a similar shape. A couple of broad cathode/anode peaks were located at 0.81/0.66 V in the anodic and cathodic curves, corresponding to the reversible reaction of Ti3+/Ti4+ for the sodiation/desodiation process. According to the relationship between the scan rate (v) and peak current density (i)i\u2009=\u2009avborlogi\u2009=\u2009loga+blogvwhere a and b are adjustable parameters. The value of b was the slope of log(v)–log(i) plots. It was well known that b‐value represented the ratio of capacitive contribution, which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. The b‐value of 0.5 represented a diffusion‐controlled behavior and 1.0 corresponding to a capacitive‐controlled behavior. The fitted b‐values for the anodic and cathodic peaks were 0.93 and 0.88 at the sweep rates between 0.1 and 0.7 mV s−1, respectively, suggesting that the electrochemical reaction kinetics was mainly capacitive‐controlled instead of diffusion‐controlled (Figure b). The capacitive contribution ratio under different scan rates could be quantified by the Equation  or Equation  according to Dunni(V)\u2009=\u2009k1v+k2v1/2ori(V)/v1/2\u2009=\u2009k1v1/2+k2where k1 or k2 is a constant for a given potential V. k1v and k2v1/2 represent the capacitance‐controlled contribution and the diffusion‐controlled contribution, respectively. By plotting i(V)/v1/2 and v1/2 curves at different potentials, one can calculate the values of k1 and k2 from the straight lines. Then the fraction of the current at specific potentials to the capacitive‐ and diffusion‐controlled insertion one can be quantified. Figure c shows the contribution of the pseudocapacitive behavior at 0.5 mV s−1 and the cyan area calculated as 81.8% represented the contribution of pseudocapacitive behavior. Figure d shows that the proportion of the pseudocapacitive contribution gradually improved from 70.8% to 88.3% with the increase of scan rates. This result revealed that the majority of the capacity originated from surface pseudocapacitive behavior, which strengthened the Na+ insertion/extraction and guaranteed its excellent electrochemical performance.\nIn order to further confirm the charge transfer and Na+ diffusion kinetics in the electrode materials, the electrochemical impedance (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests were performed. Figure S10 (Supporting Information) shows the Nyquist plots of BT/C NFs' and T/C NFs' electrodes. In addition, the corresponding equivalent electrical circuit was also shown in the inset of Figure S10 (Supporting Information). Both samples showed a similar shape with a semicircle in the high frequency and a straight line in the low frequency, corresponding to the charge transfer and diffusion process, respectively. The diameter of the semicircle of BT/C NFs' electrode was smaller than that of T/C NFs, suggesting that the BT/C NFs' electrode possessed low contact and charge transfer impedances. A more detailed analysis of the impedance spectra was undertaken on the basis of the fitted equivalent electrical circuit, where Rs represented the Ohmic resistance (including resistance of electrolyte, separator, and electrical contacts) and Rct was the charge transfer resistance. The low Rct value represented the fast kinetic of the Faradic reactions. ZW was referred to as the ion diffusion resistance in the electrolyte, also known as Warburg impedance. CPE1 and CPE2 were the constant phase angle elements. CPE1 represented the capacitances of the interface layers on the electrode surfaces and double layer capacitance while CPE2 represented the intercalation capacitance. The values of these components were listed in Table S1 (Supporting information).The Rct values for the BT/C NFs and T/C NFs were 262 and 498 Ω, respectively. The smaller Rct value of the BT/C NFs indicated that BT/C NFs had a lower activation energy for the ion diffusion and undergone a fast Faradaic reaction. The superior kinetics characteristics of sample BT/C NFs were attributed to the rapid diffusion of electrolyte on the surface profiting from the large surface area and the narrow distributed mesopores obtained via in situ fabrication. This feature could increase active sites for electrochemical reactions and reduce diffusion pathway of Na+ simultaneously. Moreover, the continuous structure of BT/C NFs also provided smooth pathways for fast transmission of Na+ and electrons, and the carbon in the trunk improved the electronic conductivity (Scheme c). This result supported the increased electrochemical performance of BT/C NFs' electrode in comparison to the T/C NFs.\nThe GITT results are shown in Figure S11 (Supporting information). Figure S11a (Supporting information) shows the potential response of the electrodes during GITT measurement which were discharged for 10 min at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and followed with an open‐circuit relaxation for 2 h. In general, the BT/C NFs exhibited smaller overpotentials than that of T/C NFs. The difference was more obvious in the higher voltage range than in the lower range, which implied the better kinetic property of BT/C NFs. The calculated Na+ diffusion kinetics (DNa+) during the discharge process were clearly presented in Figure S11c (Supporting information), and the calculation could be found in Figure S11b (Supporting information). Both electrodes showed a progressively decreasing DNa+ with the sodiation proceeding, which was associated with the sloping characteristics of the discharge profiles. It was obviously that BT/C NFs exhibited much higher DNa+ than that of the T/C NFs' electrode, suggesting the much faster Na+ diffusion in BT/C NFs. This result was in accordance with EIS.\nThe SEM images of the free‐standing BT/C NFs' electrode after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge are displayed in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). The branched structure of BT/C NFs was maintained following the repeated Na‐cycling, although the branches on the surface of trunk became sparse, indicating the structural stability of the BT/C NFs. This result illustrated the advantage of the in situ fabrication, which leaved the materials with strong structural stability. It also maintained the preferred 1D continuous morphology, owing to the free‐standing feature, which leaved out the steps of preparing slurry and also ensured the mechanical stability and stability of the cycling performance of the electrodes. There are also a variety of advantages for the free‐standing branched structure of TiO2/carbon nanofibers when directly used as binder‐free anode materials for SIBs: i) the in situ growth of the branches with the free‐standing film feature can reduce ion transport resistance and endow the materials with strong structures stability; ii) the large surface area supplies abundant active sites; iii) the composition with carbon can enhance the electronic conductivity of the composite materials; and iv) the interconnected network structure also facilitates electron transfer.\nThe potential practical applications of BT/C NFs were further studied by assessing the assembled Na‐ion full cells with Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) as cathode materials (Figure S13a, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S13b,c (Supporting Information), the NVP/C cathode displayed a steady potential plateau at 3.4 V with a capacity of 85 mA h g−1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2 C. Furthermore, the BT/C NFs//NVP/C full cell afforded a reversible capacity of about 70 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 (Figure S13d, Supporting Information). This demonstrated the possible application of BT/C NFs' electrodes in practice.\nTo better understand the electrochemical performance of BT/C NFs in this work, recent investigations based on carbon and TiO2 composites for SIB anodes were compared, as shown in Figure S14 (Supporting Information). It was noticeable that the obtained BT/C NFs exhibited a higher rate performance than most of the other carbon and TiO2 composite anode materials, making it one of the promising candidates for SIBs.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OC4H9)4), methanol (CH3OH), acetic acid (CH3COOH), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydrate (NaOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. PVP (MW = 1 300 000) was purchased from BASF chemical company in Germany.\nPreparation of TiO2/C Nanofibers: About 2.5 g of PVP and 2.5 g of Ti(OC4H9)4 were dissolved in a mixture of CH3OH and CH3COOH (weight ratio 4:1). Then the solution was stirred for about 6 h at room temperature to form the electrospinning precursor. A 10 mL precursor was transferred into a 20 mL syringe with a 22 G stainless steel needle connected to a high‐voltage supply (BGG Bmei Co., Ltd.). A high voltage of 12 kV was applied between the needle tip and aluminum collector. The flow rate and tip‐collector distance were set as 1.6 mL h−1 and 12 cm, respectively. Finally, the as‐obtained fibers were first stabilized at 250 °C in air for 2 h, and then carbonized in a tube furnace at 700 °C in N2 atmosphere for 3 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The as‐prepared flexible TiO2/C nanofibers were denoted as T/C NFs.\nPreparation of Branched TiO2/C Nanofibers: After being treated with concentrated HNO3 at 60 °C for 2 h, T/C NFs were transferred into a 100 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave. Then the NaOH solution (10 mol L−1, 50 mL) was added into the autoclave that was kept at 120 °C for 2 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the obtained samples were washed thoroughly with water and ethanol, followed by the immersion in dilute hydrochloric acid (0.1 mol L−1, 50 mL) for 2 h and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the dried samples were further annealed in a tube furnace at 700 °C for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. The obtained sample was still flexible (Scheme b) and was denoted as BT/C NFs.\nMaterial Characterization: Structures were characterized by XRD with an X'pert MPDPro (PANalytical Co.) by using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Morphologies and elemental compositions of the samples were analyzed through a JEOL 7800F field emission SEM equipped with homologous EDS and G2F30 field emission TEM at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. TGA was used to determine the content of carbon in the samples. The degree of graphitization in the samples was studied by Raman spectroscopy. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured with an ASAP 2020 instrument. XPS was carried out on an Axis Ultra, Kratos (UK) at monochromatic Al Kα radiation (150 W, 15 kV, and 1486.6 eV).\nElectrochemical Measurements: The flexible T/C NFs and BT/C NFs were cut into disks and used as the working electrodes (≈1 mg) directly to assemble batteries with CR2025 coin cells with Na foil as counter and reference electrodes. The full cells were assembled using Na3V2(PO4)3/C as the counter electrode. Na3V2(PO4)3/C powder was prepared via a sol–gel approach. Simply, NH4VO3, NaH2PO4, and citric acid were mixed in aqueous solution in a molar ratio of 2:3:2. The solution was held at 80 °C with stirring. PVP was dissolved in deionized water with a concentration of 10 wt%. The PVP solution was poured to the former solution and stirred to slowly evaporate water until it was transformed into a gel. The gel was sintered at 150 °C for 4 h and then at 850 °C for 8 h under N2 flow to obtain the final material. The electrolyte was 1 m NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 by volume) with 2.0% fluoroethylene carbonatite (FEC). Glass fiber (GF/D, Whatman) was used as the separator. Cell assembly was conducted in an Ar‐filled glove box with oxygen and moisture level below 0.1 ppm. Prior to assembly of full cells, the BT/C NFs' anode was precycled in a half cell for three cycles at 50 mA g−1. The cell was dismantled in a glove box and then taken out for further usage in full cells. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted at a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on a LANHE battery tester. CV measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 and EIS measurements were performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz on a Chenhua CHI660D electrochemical workstation.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OC4H9)4), methanol (CH3OH), acetic acid (CH3COOH), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydrate (NaOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. PVP (MW = 1 300 000) was purchased from BASF chemical company in Germany.\nPreparation of TiO2/C Nanofibers: About 2.5 g of PVP and 2.5 g of Ti(OC4H9)4 were dissolved in a mixture of CH3OH and CH3COOH (weight ratio 4:1). Then the solution was stirred for about 6 h at room temperature to form the electrospinning precursor. A 10 mL precursor was transferred into a 20 mL syringe with a 22 G stainless steel needle connected to a high‐voltage supply (BGG Bmei Co., Ltd.). A high voltage of 12 kV was applied between the needle tip and aluminum collector. The flow rate and tip‐collector distance were set as 1.6 mL h−1 and 12 cm, respectively. Finally, the as‐obtained fibers were first stabilized at 250 °C in air for 2 h, and then carbonized in a tube furnace at 700 °C in N2 atmosphere for 3 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The as‐prepared flexible TiO2/C nanofibers were denoted as T/C NFs.\nPreparation of Branched TiO2/C Nanofibers: After being treated with concentrated HNO3 at 60 °C for 2 h, T/C NFs were transferred into a 100 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave. Then the NaOH solution (10 mol L−1, 50 mL) was added into the autoclave that was kept at 120 °C for 2 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the obtained samples were washed thoroughly with water and ethanol, followed by the immersion in dilute hydrochloric acid (0.1 mol L−1, 50 mL) for 2 h and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the dried samples were further annealed in a tube furnace at 700 °C for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. The obtained sample was still flexible (Scheme b) and was denoted as BT/C NFs.\nMaterial Characterization: Structures were characterized by XRD with an X'pert MPDPro (PANalytical Co.) by using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Morphologies and elemental compositions of the samples were analyzed through a JEOL 7800F field emission SEM equipped with homologous EDS and G2F30 field emission TEM at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. TGA was used to determine the content of carbon in the samples. The degree of graphitization in the samples was studied by Raman spectroscopy. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured with an ASAP 2020 instrument. XPS was carried out on an Axis Ultra, Kratos (UK) at monochromatic Al Kα radiation (150 W, 15 kV, and 1486.6 eV).\nElectrochemical Measurements: The flexible T/C NFs and BT/C NFs were cut into disks and used as the working electrodes (≈1 mg) directly to assemble batteries with CR2025 coin cells with Na foil as counter and reference electrodes. The full cells were assembled using Na3V2(PO4)3/C as the counter electrode. Na3V2(PO4)3/C powder was prepared via a sol–gel approach. Simply, NH4VO3, NaH2PO4, and citric acid were mixed in aqueous solution in a molar ratio of 2:3:2. The solution was held at 80 °C with stirring. PVP was dissolved in deionized water with a concentration of 10 wt%. The PVP solution was poured to the former solution and stirred to slowly evaporate water until it was transformed into a gel. The gel was sintered at 150 °C for 4 h and then at 850 °C for 8 h under N2 flow to obtain the final material. The electrolyte was 1 m NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 by volume) with 2.0% fluoroethylene carbonatite (FEC). Glass fiber (GF/D, Whatman) was used as the separator. Cell assembly was conducted in an Ar‐filled glove box with oxygen and moisture level below 0.1 ppm. Prior to assembly of full cells, the BT/C NFs' anode was precycled in a half cell for three cycles at 50 mA g−1. The cell was dismantled in a glove box and then taken out for further usage in full cells. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted at a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V on a LANHE battery tester. CV measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 and EIS measurements were performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz on a Chenhua CHI660D electrochemical workstation.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, the core–shell structure SiO2@SiO2/RF nanoparticles (Figure S1, Supporting Information) are incorporated into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) by electrospinning method.[] In Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PAN nanofibers are shown as a comparison. Second, the HB CNFs are formed through a two‐step process. In the first step, the formed SiO2@SiO2/RF@PAN nanofibers are calcined and carbonized to obtain the beaded SiO2/C@CNFs (Figure S2c,d, Supporting Information). In the two steps, the HB CNFs are generated after SiO2 is etched away by NaOH (Figure S2e,f, Supporting Information). Finally, WS2 nanosheets preferentially nucleate inside of hollow carbon spheres and then grow on the outer wall of hollow carbon spheres to form HB WS2@CNFs through hydrothermal reaction.[]\nThe field‐emission SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show different microscopic morphologies for materials during the synthesis. In Figure , SiO2/C@CNFs display a homogeneous beaded structure. Figure  shows HB CNFs after etching with NaOH. When HB CNFs are used as nanoreactors, WS2 nanosheets are confined to grow on the surface and inside of HB CNFs (Figure ) during the hydrothermal process based on the synergistic anchoring effect. The confined growth of HB WS2@CNFs can be controlled by varying the solution concentration and reaction time. The synergistic anchoring effect between porous carbon layer and WS2 nanosheets keeps structure intact of HB WS2@CNFs (Figure ). Figure  displays a fewer layered structure of WS2 nanosheets in the intrinsic lattice fringe of HB WS2@CNFs from high‐resolution TEM (HRTEM). At the (002) crystal plane, the spacing of lattice stripes is measured to be 0.62 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED, Figure ) pattern analysis of HB WS2@CNFs shows four typical diffraction ring patterns of (002), (101), (103), and (110), which belong to the standard hexagonal WS2. The distribution of the elements of C, N, S, and W (Figure ) at hollow beaded structure is homogeneous, which are further confirmed using annular dark‐field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectrometry (EDX) mappings. The weight fraction of WS2 in the HB WS2@CNFs is determined to be 73.5% from thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S3, Supporting Information). A typical mesoporous structure (Figure S4, Supporting Information) is found, and the specific surface area is 212.5 m2 g−1 for HB WS2@CNFs from nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis.\nPure WS2 (Figure S5, Supporting Information) and WS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of carbon nanofiber (SG WS2@CNFs, Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information) are synthesized by means of the same method as the synthesis of HB WS2@CNFs to serve as comparisons and to highlight the novelty of HB WS2@CNFs. Figure S6, Supporting Information, shows the synthetic mechanism of SG WS2@CNFs. As shown in Figure S7a,b, Supporting Information, WS2 nanosheets are coated on the surface of carbon fibers. SG WS2@CNFs exhibits a structure with a mixture of mesoporous and microporous structures, and the specific surface area of SG WS2@CNFs is 108.9 m2 g−1 (Figure S8a,b, Supporting Information), which is smaller than that of HB WS2@CNF. The pore size of SG WS2@CNFs is too small to form synergistic anchoring effect between WS2 and CNFs when compared with HB CNFs (Figure S8c,d, Supporting Information) and HB WS2@CNFs (Figure S4, Supporting Information).\nThe crystal structures of pure WS2, SG WS2@CNFs, and HB WS2@CNFs were measured by X‐ray diffraction (XRD, Figure ), which are well‐indexed with hexagonal crystal structure of WS2 (JCPDS no. 08‐0237).[] Nevertheless, when the 2θ value of (002) plane is compared with those of pure WS2 (14.2°) and SG WS2@CNFs (14.0°), the 2θ degree value of HB WS2@CNFs is the smallest, at 13.7° (details can be found in the inset of Figure ), owing to the enlargement of interlayer spacing. Moreover, the Raman shifts exhibit stronger intensities of D and G peaks ascribing to 1340 and 1591 cm. In general, the ratio of intensity of D‐band and G‐band, the ID/IG values, is used as a reference for the degree of graphitization. The ID/IG values are determined to be 1.16 and 1.32 for HB WS2@CNFs and SG WS2@CNFs, respectively. A smaller ID/IG of HB WS2@CNFs than that of SG WS2@CNFs, which is close to the ratio of standard graphite materials,[] suggests that carbon in HB WS2@CNFs is more orderly than that of SG WS2@CNFs and HB WS2@CNFs has a relatively higher degree of graphitization (Figure ). The Raman shifts at 417.2 (E12g) and 349.5 cm (A1g) indicate the formation of high crystallinity of WS2.[]\nX‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of HB WS2@CNFs clearly demonstrates the presence of all expected peaks of C, N, W, and S in the composite (Figure S9, Supporting Information). In the C 1s spectrum, the peaks at 286.2, 283.8, 287.9, and 285.2 eV (Figure ) are assigned to C\uf8ffC, C\uf8ffO, C\uf8feO and C\uf8ffN. The main forms of nitrogen‐doped (Figure ) carbon structure are pyridine N, pyrrolic N, quaternary N, and N=O, which play a significant role in the electrochemical property of material. In the high‐resolution W 4f spectrum, the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 at 31.6 and 33.7 eV, respectively, are dominated to the overall W signal, along with the weaker peak of W 5p3/2 at 36.9 eV, confirming the existence of W4+ in HB WS2@CNFs composite (Figure ).[] The two peaks at 161.2 and 162.4 eV from the spectrum of S 2p are the spin–orbit doublet of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 (Figure ).\n\nElectrochemical Performance of HB WS2@CNFs in LIB\nThe electrochemical performance of HB WS2@CNFs as anode materials for LIBs was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests. Figure  exhibits the CV curves of HB WS2@CNFs. The cathodic peak observed is about 0.79 V, indicating the lithium insertion into WS2 to form LixWS2 (WS2 + xLi+ + xe− → LixWS2). The other cathodic peak is about 0.67 V, which generate solid electrolyte interface (SEI) due to the conversion reaction: LixWS2 + (4‐x) Li+ + (4‐x)e− → W + 2Li2S.[] The oxidation peak at 2.39 V is attributed to the deintercalation of lithium process (Li2S ‐2e− → 2Li+ + S).[] The peaks at 2.14 and 1.93 V for the second and third cycles, respectively, indicate a reversible conversion of polymorphic sulfide to Li2S.[] Additionally, the CV curves for the second and third cycles are almost overlapped, implying remarkable reversibility and stability of HB WS2@CNFs. However, SG WS2@CNFs and pure WS2 show a reduced current with the increase in the scan numbers in Figure ,c.\nFigure  is the GCD profiles of the HB WS2@CNFs, SG WS2@CNFs, and pure WS2, at the current density of 1 A g−1, which are charged and discharged in first, second, third, and fifth cycles. The initial charge/discharge capacities of HB WS2@CNFs are 857.3 and 618.9 mAh g−1 (Figure ), respectively, and the Coulombic efficiency (CE) is 72.2%, which is higher than those of SG WS2@CNFs (67.6%) (Figure ) and pure WS2 (64.9%) (initial capacities at 920 and 597.9 mAh g−1 in Figure ). Moreover, positions of the platforms in the charge and discharge curves correspond to the redox peaks in the CV diagrams. In order to further confirm its electrochemical mechanism, the GCD curves of three materials are converted into dQ/dV differential curves for discussion and shown in Figure S10, Supporting Information, in which the characteristic peaks of the differential curves correspond to the position of the redox peaks of the CV curves, further verifying the authenticity and reliability of experiment.\nIn Figure , the rate performance of HB WS2@CNFs electrode is then compared with SG WS2@CNFs and pure WS2. For SG WS2@CNFs and pure WS2, the specific capacity platform drop is large at various current densities with the poor stability, indicating the fast capacity attenuation exists. HB WS2@CNFs displays preferable values of 603.8, 537.7, 510.8, 479, 351, 256, and 182.4 mAh g−1 from 0.1 to 8 A g−1, with stable platform and smaller drop than WS2 and SG WS2@CNFs. Furthermore, the capacity recovers when the current density is lowered back to 0.1 A g−1, indicating the existence of reversible process. Figure S11a, Supporting Information, shows that HB WS2@CNFs retains remarkable cyclic stability and higher specific capacities after 100 cycles (507 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 446 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1) (CE is nearly 100% after the cyclic process), while SG WS2@CNFs and pure WS2 nanosheets show rapid decay with cycles (Figure S11b, Supporting Information). Besides, the long cycle performance of HB WS2@CNFs is tested at a current density of 2 A g−1 after 500 cycles (Figure ); thus, it is clear that HB WS2@CNFs possesses remarkable cycle performance and structure stability, which are superior to SG WS2@CNFs, pure WS2, and HB CNFs (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Finally, compared with other WS2‐based materials in LIBs listed in Table S1, Supporting Information, it is clear that HB WS2@CNFs is a highly competitive candidate in terms of cycling stability and rate property.\nFigure  exhibits the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of HB WS2@CNFs, SG WS2@CNFs, and pure WS2. The equivalent circuit model of HB WS2@CNFs is obtained using the Nyquist plots and electrochemical workstation software. The electrode process is jointly controlled by the charge transfer and diffusion processes, and electrochemical polarization and concentration polarization coexist in the electrode process. HB WS2@CNFs shows the smallest semicircle arc diameter, compared to SG WS2@CNFs and pure WS2, indicating that it has the lowest charge‐transfer resistance (Rct), which improves the kinetics of reaction at the surface of electrode. EIS of HB WS2@CNFs after different cycles is shown in Figure . The values of Rct are 119, 4.14, 13.6, and 14.5 Ω at 0, 10, 50, and 100 cycles, respectively. Compared the values of Rct at 0, 10 cycles, the activation process enhances the transport properties of the HB WS2@CNFs electrodes. However, with the increase of the cycles (50th and 100th), the values of Rct are increased, but still lesser than that at the 0 cycle. In Figure S13, Supporting Information, the trend of the Nyquist curves of pure WS2 is similar to that of HB WS2@CNFs after different cycles of charge/discharge.\nTo explore the evolution on the structure and morphology of HB WS2@CNFs electrode, ex situ XRD and TEM are applied to the electrode material after different cycles (Figure ).[] First, a preliminary analysis of the Li insertion mechanism of WS2 nanosheets was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation to explore the adsorption energies of various sites on WS2 (Figure S14, Supporting Information).[] Second, the ex situ characterization methods, XRD and TEM, are used to confirm the rationality of the DFT calculation. The internal structure and crystallinity of WS2 nanosheets change with different charge/discharge cycles. In Figure , the peaks at (102) and (110) crystal planes disappear after the first discharge process, suggesting that a conversion reaction of electrode material exists. The peak of the (101) crystal plane remains unchanged, indicating that Li+ is selectively inserted into a specific crystal plane. After the first charge, the reappearance of (102) and (110) crystal planes indicates the good reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. In addition, the peak of the (002) crystal plane shifts to a low angle and the peak of (101) crystal plane disappears. The selective intercalation and deintercalation of Li+ break the structure of some crystal plane, causing the peak to shift or to disappear from the first discharge/charge process. Combined with the DFT calculation, it is fully demonstrated that Li atoms are more easily adsorbed above W atom, resulting in an expansion of layer spacing. When the cycle is increased (from 10 to 100 cycles), some peaks could also be observed, which implies the change in composition. In particular, it is worth noting that the amorphous materials are dominated after 100th cycle of charging/discharging. In addition, the 2θ degrees of 42.7°, 49.8°, and 73.4° are corresponding to the peaks of the copper foil.\nThe TEM images of HB WS2@CNFs electrode after noted cycles are shown in Figure . Most of the WS2 nanosheets are anchored to the inside and the surface of the HB CNFs, further illustrating the anchoring effect between the WS2 nanosheets and the HB CNFs, as well as the confinement effect of hollow mesoporous carbon spheres implanted in the CNFs. For comparison, this is not observed for WS2. In Figure S15, Supporting Information, WS2 nanosheets are seriously pulverized and shed from the surface of carbon fiber after 50 and 100 cycles, indicating that the binding ability between WS2 and CNFs is poor. This is because carbon fiber has no special hollow structure, and cannot alleviate the volume expansion, resulting from the poor capacity retention performance.\nFigure  exhibits the kinetic analysis of HB WS2@CNFs as an anode material of LIBs, to explain the outstanding electrochemical property.[] By adjusting the different sweep rates of CV measurements, a series of similar shaped CV curves are obtained (Figure ). The increased peak intensities are used to calculate the capacitance contribution, according to the relationship of current (i) and sweep rate (ν)1i=aνb\nwhere a and b are the experimental values. The peak values of oxidation (ip,oxi) and reduction (ip,red) at various sweep rates are used to substitute Equation () to get b value (Figure ). In general, the b value of 0.5 represents a pure diffusion‐controlled behavior, whereas 1.0 displays an ideal capacitance process.[] For HB WS2@CNFs, the values of oxidation (bo = 0.79) and reduction (br = 0.82) are close to 1.0, exhibiting the main contribution from surface‐controlled redox reactions. The current response, i, at specific voltage, V, can be further separated into contributions by capacitive effects and diffusion‐controlled reaction, which is the basis of the following equation2iV=k1ν+k2ν1/2 where k1 and k2 are constants and ν is the sweep rate.\nThe polarization and the contribution from capacitive process at 0.2 mV s−1 (the blue area in Figure ) is calculated to be 65.8%. The larger the capacitive contribution, the faster the Li+ transport and the better cyclic performance. As the sweep rate of CV increases, the areas of CV curves increase; in the meantime, the capacitive contribution further enhances, as shown in Figure . Therefore, the design of hollow beaded structure anode material based on synergistic anchoring effect can improve electrochemical performance effectively.\n\nElectrochemical Performance of HB WS2@CNFs in SIB\nIn order to reflect the excellent structure and performance of materials, HB WS2@CNFs are used in SIBs.[] Figure  shows the first three cycles of HB WS2@CNFs at the sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1. During the first cathodic scan, the reduction peak 0.89 V is observed, which indicates Na+ is inserted into WS2 through the conversion reaction (WS2 + xNa+ + xe− → NaxWS2, x < 2).[] The other reduction peak at 0.36 V is from the formation of W and Na2S (NaxWS2 + (4‐x)Na+ + (4‐x)e− → W + 2Na2S) and SEI.[] After the first scan cycle, a weak peak at 0.98 V is detected, corresponding to a partial oxidation of W. Meanwhile, a wide peak at 1.93 V is observed, which is related to the reverse conversion reaction between metallic W and Na2S matrix.[] Additionally, the redox peaks of HB WS2@CNFs in the second and third cycles are almost overlapped, suggesting that HB WS2@CNFs owe outstanding reversibility and stability when compared to WS2, which shows poor stability as the current begins to decay starting from the second lap, shown in Figure .\nThe GCD profiles of the two electrodes in first, second, third, fifth, and tenth cycles are presented in Figure  at 0.5 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V versus Na+/Na. The initial discharge/charge capacities of HB WS2@CNFs are 660.2 and 492.8 mAh g−1 (Figure ), which give an initial CE 74.6% higher than the value (71.3%) of pure WS2 (Figure ). The charge and discharge curves almost overlapped after the first cycle, suggesting a great cyclic stability and outstanding reversibility of HB WS2@CNFs composite exists.\nThe rate capacities of the HB WS2@CNFs electrodes were measured at 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1, as shown in Figure , and their corresponding specific capacities of HB WS2@CNFs are 713, 582, 485, 415, 354, 267, and 188 mAh g−1, respectively. Afterwards, as the current density decreases back to 0.02 A g−1, the specific capacity of HB WS2@CNFs quickly recovers to 641 mAh g−1. Obviously, the rate property of HB WS2@CNFs is much better than those of pure WS2 and HB CNFs (Figure S16a, Supporting Information). The excellent sodium storage properties of HB WS2@CNFs materials stem from the unique hollow beaded structure.\nMoreover, as we can see in Figure S17a, Supporting Information, the entire long‐cycling experiment exhibits that the specific capacity remains steady (381 mAh g−1) with remarkable capacity retention (nearly 100 %) at 0.2 A g−1. As the current density is increased to 0.5 A g−1, the specific capacities of SIBs begin to reduce (about 343 mAh g−1), but still owes good cyclic stability. Additionally, the cycle performance at the current density of 2 A g−1 after 300 cycles (Figure ) is evaluated and compared to that of HB CNFs (Figure S16b, Supporting Information). Figure  shows that HB WS2@CNFs have excellent cyclic stability at 2 A g−1. Without the anchoring effect between WS2 nanosheets and hollow beaded structure, pure WS2 nanosheets show the worst cyclic stability (Figure S17b, Supporting Information). When compared to the electrochemical performance of other WS2‐based anode materials as listed in Table S2, Supporting Information, it is clear that HB WS2@CNFs is a powerful competitive candidate in terms of capacity output and cycling stability.\nIn addition, other tested electrochemical performance data are discussed in Supporting Information. Figure S18, Supporting Information, shows the EIS of HB WS2@CNFs and pure WS2 for SIBs. Figure S19, Supporting Information, exhibits the structure and morphology of HB WS2@CNFs electrode after 50 and 100 charge/discharge cycles explored by TEM. Figure S20, Supporting Information, displays the capacitance contribution of HB WS2@CNFs for SIBs. The result reveals that the storage kinetic mechanism of HB WS2@CNFs is attributed to diffusion‐controlled Faraday process in SIBs. The difference in the radius of the ions accounts for the difference of the charge transfer kinetic mechanism between SIBs and LIBs. Li+ with smaller ion radius (0.76 Å) can freely escape/embed in the graphite and WS2 layers, but the diffusion of Na+ with a larger ion radius (1.02 Å) in the electrolyte is difficult under the same conditions, so it is mainly reflected in the diffusion control. Therefore, HB WS2@CNFs shows various storage kinetic mechanisms for lithium and sodium ions.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The C-HC sample was synthesized through pyrolysis of a coconut shell. As presented in a, the C-HC sample is a large and dense block-like substance (approximately 8 μm in diameter). In contrast, b reveals that the N/O-HC-2 sample has smaller particles, a result of ball milling. Additional morphology and structural information is visible in the TEM and HRTEM images of C-HC and N/O-HC-2 samples. The C-HC sample exhibits long locally ordered crystal domains, extending up to 20 nm in length, as shown in c,d. Conversely, TEM images (e,f) show the highly disordered lattice of the N/O-HC-2 sample, characterized by short-range ordered and intricate vortex structures, leading to the formation of more pores. This structure is conducive to the storage of Na+.  In addition, in N/O-HC-2, multiple double-layer interlayer distances of graphite nanocrystals were selected and the average interlayer distance was calculated to be 0.39 nm, which is greater than that of C-HC (0.38 nm). The local expansion of local interlayer distance in N/O-HC-2 may result from “introduction of nitrogen element”. A larger interlayer spacing can effectively reduce the dynamic hindrance during Na+ insertion, thereby increasing the Na+ of storage.  To verify the differences in lattice structures between the N/O-HC-2 and C-HC samples, we conducted XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses. As shown in g, the XRD pattern of the C-HC sample shows two peaks at 2θ = 23.5° and 43.5°, corresponding to the (002) and (100) lattice planes of graphite. The broad, low-intensity peaks indicate a low degree of graphitization. In contrast, the N/O-HC-2 sample exhibits less graphitization than the C-HC sample. The (100) lattice plane of the N/O-HC-2 sample is almost nonexistent for the C-HC sample, which is in accordance with the highly disordered structure of the N/O-HC-2 sample observed in the HRTEM image (f). Furthermore, it is notable that the (002) diffraction peak of the N/O-HC-2 sample shifts to a lower diffraction angle (2θ = 22.6°) compared with those of the C-HC (2θ = 23.5°) samples. According to Bragg’s law, the (002) plane interlayer distance of the N/O-HC-2 sample can be calculated to be 0.39 nm, which is larger than that of the HC (0.38 nm). This is in agreement with the HRTEM results (0.39 and 0.38 nm for N/O-HC-2 and C-HC, respectively) shown in d–f.\nRaman spectroscopy (h) reveals that the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) is higher for the N/O-HC-1 (, 1.24), N/O-HC-2 (1.27), and N/O-HC-3 sample (, 1.36) than for the C-HC sample (1.12). The D band at 1367 cm–1 and the G band at 1577 cm–1 correspond to defect-induced activation of the C6 ring A1g breathing vibration and sp2-bonded carbon E2g vibration, respectively.  However, excessive disorder can damage the structural integrity of the carbon skeleton, and excessive defects may lead to increased capacity but decreased FCCE.  The higher intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the D band to the G band further confirms that the structure of the N/O-HC samples is more disordered compared to that of the C-HC sample. This is consistent with HRTEM and XRD results. It should be noted that the HRTEM results can only display partial microcrystalline spacing, so the subsequent mechanism discussion will mainly focus on XRD calculations.\nSpecifically, the carbon oxygen nitrogen mapping maps of C-HC samples corresponding to the TEM images in i,j reveal a uniform distribution of carbon and oxygen atoms in the C-HC sample, with nitrogen elements being almost absent. In contrast, for the N/O-HC-2 sample (k,l), nitrogen elements are uniformly distributed alongside carbon and oxygen elements, forming a homogeneous chemical phase. The nitrogen component is evenly dispersed and incorporated into the carbon lattice.  This signifies the successful synthesis of N/O-doped HC materials.\nThe pore size distribution has a significant impact on the performance of HC.   displays the N2 physical adsorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution for C-HC, N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3 samples. All samples exhibit typical type II adsorption isotherms. The pore volume of nitrogen-doped samples is significantly higher than that of the C-HC samples. Notably, the N/O-HC-2 sample shows a significantly higher pore volume compared to the C-HC sample, which is consistent with the observations from TEM images (f). BJH analysis reveals that the most prominent feature of the pore size distribution for N/O-HC-2 is the presence of micropores with sizes around 3 nm, as shown in . According to the BET method, the specific surface area of the N/O-HC-2 sample is calculated to be 24.52 m2 g–1, with a total pore volume of 0.04 cm3 g–1. In contrast, the C-HC sample has a specific surface area of 8.09 m2 g–1 and a total pore volume of 0.01 cm3 g–1, consistent with the observations from the SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images. These results further confirm that nitrogen doping with urea leads to the formation of increased micropores and mesopores, which is beneficial for improving sodium storage performance.\nXPS was further used to analyze the surface elemental composition and bonding configurations of the synthesized C-HC, N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3 samples. As depicted in a–c, the XPS results of C-HC show C 1s and O 1s bonding configurations; no N 1s spectral peak is detected in the XPS survey spectrum, and the content of the elemental O is 4.48% (). In comparison, the XPS results of N/O-HC-1 (), N/O-HC-2 (d), and N/O-HC-3 () show the binding energies of the three main peaks corresponding to C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s which are located at 285.0, 400.0, and 532.0 eV, respectively. XPS shows that the N element content in samples N/O-HC-1 (), N/O-HC-2 (), and N/O-HC-3 () is 3.36%, 4.65%, and 18.93%, respectively. Excessive nitrogen doping can detrimentally affect the carbon framework, leading to reduced conductivity, increased impedance, and compromised cycling stability.  Notably, the oxygen content is measured to be 6.78%, 12.57%, and 9.33%, respectively. The diminished oxygen presence in N/O-HC-3 suggests that an overabundance of nitrogen generates excessive defects, thereby reducing potential oxygen reaction sites.  Overall, the incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen is dictated by the urea proportion added to the mixture. In , e, and , the C 1s spectrum comprises a combination of three peaks at 284.7, 285.7, and 288.8 eV, representing sp2 C–C, C–N, and O–C═O, respectively (). In , e, and , the O 1s spectrum comprises a combination of three peaks at 531.0, 532.3, and 533.4 eV, representing sp2 C═O, O–C–O, and HO–C═O, respectively. Among these functional groups, the presence of C–OH is particularly important because the hydroxyl groups improve the surface wettability. It is worth noting that the increase in the amount of C═O functional groups is significant, C═O + Na+ + e– → C–O–Na reaction for contributing sodium storage capacity,  which is caused by the ball milling of urea and C-HC followed by pyrolysis. The N 1s spectrum can be divided into two peaks located at 398.5 and 400.1 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N and pyrrolic N, as shown in , g, and  and .\nFurthermore, the higher intensity of the pyridinic N peak in the N 1s spectrum suggests that nitrogen in the N/O-HC samples primarily exists in the pyridinic N state (h), and as shown in the figure, the formation of pyridine nitrogen will produce a defect, which has been shown to be more favorable for Na+ storage and reversible capacity in materials. In theory, each pyridinic N contributes one π electron to the graphite π system, thereby enhancing the conductivity of carbon.  In short, the introduction of appropriate N and O atoms is beneficial for storing Na+ through the pseudocapacitive effect and contributing to the slope capacity.  In this study, nitrogen/oxygen codoped samples (N/O-HC) were obtained solely through co-pyrolysis of urea and C-HC precursors. In this process, mechanical ball milling also plays an important role; a comparison was made with the high nitrogen/oxygen content of N/O-HC-2 (4.65% and 12.57%). In contrast, the F–N/O-HC-2 mixed sample, prepared using manual hand milling, shows nitrogen and oxygen contents of 1.42% and 14.01%, respectively, as depicted in  according to XPS analysis. Thus, employing urea in combination with ball milling and Ar pyrolysis represents an excellent strategy for producing nitrogen/oxygen-doped carbon materials with the potential for high performance in SIBs.\n\n Electrochemical Performance\nTo investigate and compare the electrochemical performances of C-HC and N/O-HC (N/O-HC-X, where X represents the urea-to-precursor ratio) samples as potential anode materials for SIBs, half coin cells were assembled with sodium metal as the counter electrode. a-d displays the first two CV cycles of C-HC and N/O-HC (various doping levels) samples between 0 and 1.5 V vs Na/Na+ at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1. In the first cycle, irreversible cathodic peaks are observed at 0.15 V vs Na/Na+, corresponding to electrolyte decomposition, followed by the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.  Notably, it should be mentioned that N/O-HC samples exhibit cathodic and anodic peaks around 0.1 V, which is evidence reported by other researchers, indicating the presence of redox reactions of SIB carbon anodes at low potentials. The cathodic and anodic peaks around 0.1 V are attributed to the insertion and extraction of Na+ on graphene-like planes.  As the area within the CV curve increases with a higher proportion of urea, this suggests that the capacity will correspondingly increase. However, the excessive irreversible cathodic peak observed in N/O-HC-3 indicates significant SEI film formation, leading to extensive irreversible sodiation, which could potentially decrease the FCCE. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the samples before and after doping are shown in e–h, and they are in good agreement with the CV data. The results indicate that at 30 mA g–1, the first reversible capacities of N/O-HC (N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3) are significantly higher than that of C-HC, with values of 296, 343, and 356 mA h g–1, compared to C-HC’s 272 mA h g–1. The capacity increases with a higher urea ratio, consistent with previous predictions. Notably, N/O-HC-3 exhibits the highest capacity; however, its plateau capacity (depicted in gray) diminishes, while its slope capacity (depicted in blue) augments. This shift may lead to an elevated median voltage, consequently reducing the overall voltage range and energy density of the full battery. The FCCEs for N/O-HC (N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3) are slightly lower than that of C-HC, with values of 68.0%, 69.8%, and 66.1% compared to HC’s 71.4%. The higher ICE of the raw material C-HC is due to fewer defects and less irreversible sodiation. It is worth noting that ICE has been reduced but does not significantly decrease the energy density, as the increased capacity of doped samples can offset this minor effect. This may be attributed to the presence of more defects and oxygen functional groups that consume more Na+ ions. Among the samples, N/O-HC-2 demonstrates the highest FCCE. Conversely, the notably reduced FCCE of N/O-HC-3 aligns with CV analysis predictions. This decline could be attributed to an excess of nitrogen incorporation, which leads to an abundance of defects and consequently increases irreversible sodium insertion.  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, i) was measured for C-HC, N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3 samples. The spectra both before and after doping show a compressed semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line in the low-frequency region. The semicircle in the equivalent circuit shown in i represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct), reflecting charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The Rct value for N/O-HC-2 is significantly lower than that of C-HC, indicating the enhanced conductivity of N/O-HC-2 within the cell. However, the Rct value of N-HC-3 sample increased by nearly twice compared to C-HC. The increase in impedance is attributed to a higher nitrogen content leading to a higher amount of pyridine nitrogen, resulting in excessive defects [ID/IG values are the highest ()], which in turn leads to a decrease in the conductivity of the carbon skeleton, which is greater than its electron contribution of  which infers that its rate performance will deteriorate.\nThe N/O-HC-2 obtained by regulating the urea ratio is expected to be further applied due to its high capacity and minimal impedance. j,k displays the CV curves of C-HC and N/O-HC-2 samples at different scan rates. Near 0.1 V, the oxidation–reduction peaks of N/O-HC-2 exhibit higher intensities compared to C-HC, indicating that N/O-HC-2 provides a higher platform capacity through intercalation. Furthermore, the relationship between the peak current (Ip) and the square root of the scan rate (v1/2 s–1/2) is shown in l. Both C-HC and N/O-HC-2 exhibit excellent linear behavior, conforming to the Randles–Sevcik relationship. By calculation, the Na+ diffusion coefficient of N/O-HC-2 is determined to be 4.81 × 10–11 cm2 s–1, which is larger than that of C-HC (2.58 × 10–11 cm2 s–1). The above results indicate that the rate performance of N/O-HC-2 is better. Overall, the number of defects is crucial for regulating the capacity of slopes and platforms.\nTo further assess the impact of hierarchical porosity and N and O doping on the electrochemical properties of the carbon materials, capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability tests were conducted through galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling (). As depicted in a, all N/O-HC samples exhibit higher capacities than the C-HC samples at both current densities of 30 mA g–1. The reversible specific capacities after doping for N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3 are 296, 343, and 356 mA h g–1, which are significantly higher than the 272 mA h g–1 of the C-HC sample. Furthermore, the working voltage of N/O-HC is slightly higher than that of the C-HC samples. To characterize the working voltage, the average midvoltage (voltage at which half of the discharge capacity is reached) was calculated for N/O-HC and C-HC samples during 100 cycles at 30 mA g–1. The average midvoltages for C-HC, N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3 are 0.053, 0.074, 0.058, and 0.062 V, respectively. Although the slightly higher working voltage of N/O-HC may to some extent reduce the overall cell’s working voltage, the high capacity of N/O-HC compensates for this gap, ensuring that the full cell energy does not decrease. b provides a further analysis of the capacity contributions. The main capacity increase of N/O-HC samples is contributed by the slope. The sloping capacity (>0.1 V) of N/O-HC samples is increased by around 50 mA h g–1. The slope capacity increases with the increase of urea ratio, which is essentially due to the increase of defects and oxygen groups, thereby increasing the sodium storage active sites. N/O-HC-2 shows the most significant increase in plateau capacity (<0.1 V), while N/O-HC-3 exhibits a decrease of 19 mA h g–1. This indicates that excessive nitrogen doping will reduce the use of graphite microcrystals as active sites for low-pressure platform sodium storage. c presents a comparative analysis of rate performance among N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, N/O-HC-3, and C-HC samples across varying current densities. From a current density of 30 mA g–1 increasing to 60, 150, 300, 600, 900, and 1500 mA g–1, N/O-HC-2 consistently outperforms, maintaining reversible specific capacities of 338, 307, 289, 272, 250, 222, and 178 mA h–1, respectively. Nevertheless, the overall performance of the N/O-HC series exceeds that of the C-HC samples. The superior rate performance of N/O-HC-2 is attributed to its low impedance and high ionic diffusivity, essentially stemming from an optimal incorporation of nitrogen and oxygen that enhances the material’s conductivity. Conversely, the poor rate capability of N/O-HC-3 aligns with previous impedance speculations, indicating that the improved electronic conductivity due to excess nitrogen doping is insufficient to counteract the reduced conductivity caused by carbon framework disruptions and the creation of carbon vacancies.  Therefore, the excessive introduction of heteroatoms is not conducive to improving the rate performance of the battery. More importantly, N/O-HC-2 achieves better performance than many previous studies of biomass-based HC materials (d,e). Regarding cycling stability, as shown in f, at a current density of 30 mA g–1, the N/O-HC-2 sample achieves a discharge capacity of 315.0 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles, significantly higher than the C-HC sample (262.4 mA h g–1), with 92.1% capacity retention rate. Long cycling life is also crucial for practical applications in SIBs. To study the long-term performance of the N/O-HC samples for SIBs, as shown in g, cycling was performed at a high current density (600 mA g–1). After 300 cycles, a reversible discharge capacity of 199 mA h g–1 was obtained, and the capacity retention rate was 82.8% compared to the third cycle.  shows the cycling process of different samples in the first 100 cycles, where N/O-HC-2 exhibits the best stability, while N/O-HC-3 has a higher initial capacity but the cycling decay is very fast, which is consistent with the previous analysis.\nIn order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of materials in ester-based electrolytes, this study conducted comparative tests using an electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in EC/DMC = 1:1 vol %). Compared with the ether-based electrolyte (343 mA h g–1), the N/O-HC-2 sample has a reversible specific capacity of 302 mA h g–1 in the ester-based electrolyte (). The rate performance shows that it has a better high rate performance in ether-based electrolytes (), attributed to its superior electronic conductivity. The long cycle test () shows that its cycling stability is better and more stable in ether-based electrolytes. Overall, N/O-HC-2 has better compatibility with ether-based electrolytes. Although HC may limit the positive electrode voltage when using ether-based electrolytes in full batteries, it is believed that this issue will be resolved in the near future.\n investigates the capacity, rate, FCCE, and cycling performance of biomass-based HC for SIBs in recent years. Compared with them, this article introduces that the material N/O-HC-2 ranks among the top in terms of performance. In summary, the performance of the material has been greatly improved due to the introduction of nitrogen and oxygen double atoms, which increases more sodium storage sites and enhances conductivity.\n\n Formation and Working Mechanisms\nThe mechanism of using the ball-milling pyrolysis process for C-HC modification is as follows. First, ball milling thoroughly mixes C-HC and urea and reduces their particle size, which promotes the pyrolysis reaction and increases the specific surface area. Second, the O 1s content of N/O-HC-2 (12.57%) is higher than that of C-HC (4.48%), which is attributed to the decomposition of urea into NH3 and the reaction of HOCN with the carbon skeleton caused by heating. Therefore, a large number of C═O functional groups are generated on the surface of microcrystals, as shown in red in a. The slope capacity of N/O-HC-2 is significantly higher than that of C-HC (b,c), and the analysis reasons are as follows: (1) the reaction between oxygen-containing functional groups and Na+ contributes to the slope capacity, C═O + Na+ + e– → C–O–Na.  (2) The generation of defects can provide slope capacity by adsorbing Na+ through the pseudocapacitive effect. Defects arise from the formation of pyridine nitrogen; when a pyridine nitrogen is generated, the carbon framework is destroyed, resulting in a defect, as shown by the blue-green atom in a. It is worth noting that one pyridinic N contributes one pπ electron to the graphitic π system,  enhancing the electrical conductivity of carbon.  This precisely explains the improved rate performance.\nThe increase in platform capacity is attributed to the following reasons: (1) the modified N/O-HC-2 has an extended interlayer spacing, which is beneficial for the Na+ storage contribution platform capacity. The lone-pair electrons of pyrrole nitrogen, perpendicular to the graphene plane, exhibit greater electrostatic repulsion and expand the interlayer spacing.  The increase in interlayer spacing in carbon materials can reduce the hindrance to Na+ insertion (c). (2) Closed pores increase, and the number of closed pores has been proven to increase platform capacity.  Raman spectroscopy shows a higher degree of disorder in N/O-HC-2, which leads to more closed pores in the domain stacking for storing Na+.\nBased on the above analysis, it can be concluded that ball milling contributes to sodium storage by generating a small number of active sites to increase the slope capacity, successfully doping nitrogen and oxygen during secondary heating and subsequently introducing defects and oxygen-containing functional groups and increasing interlayer spacing to increase sodium storage capacity. In summary, this work established a three-dimensional network of modification strategies, material microstructures, and sodium storage mechanisms through various phase characterizations and electrochemistry.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The N/O-HC was typically prepared through a combination of ball milling and pyrolysis, as illustrated in . Initially, coconut shells purchased from Landarun were calcined at 1300 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere to obtain C-HC. Subsequently, the C-HC powder was mixed thoroughly with urea at weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 by ball milling at 300 rpm for 5 h, respectively. Following this, the mixtures were calcined at 300 °C for 2 h in an argon (Ar) atmosphere using a tube-type furnace, with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. The resulting specimens were designated as N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, respectively.\n\n Assembling of a Half SIB\nBoth nitrogen-doped and undoped HC were mixed with Super P carbon black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methylpyrrolidinone to form a uniformly mixed anode slurry. After magnetic stirring, the resulting slurries were coated onto a well-cleaned copper foil using an H-coating machine. Following the coating process, the anode copper foil was dried at 120 °C overnight in a vacuum oven (DZF-6051). Subsequently, the coated anode films were punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm. The average loading capacity of active substances is 2.2 mg cm–2. These anode discs, along with fiberglass and sodium foil, were utilized to assemble CR 2032 coin-type SIBs with the anode acting as the working electrode, fiberglass as the separator, and sodium foil as the cathode. The assembly process was conducted within a glovebox filled with argon (Ar) (Universal 2400/750/900, Shanghai Mikrouna Mech Tech Co., Ltd.). To connect the electrodes, 0.1 mL of dimethoxyethane containing 1 M NaPF6 salt was used as the electrolyte. For comparative analysis, in addition to N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, C-HC was also employed to examine the effects of nitrogen and oxygen atom doping.\n\n Electrochemical Measurements\nThe electrochemical performance of assembled half cells using different working electrodes, including C-HC (coconut HC), N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, was evaluated through galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Specifically, CV curves were recorded between 0 and 1.5 V (vs Na/Na+) using an electrochemical workstation [Autolab electrochemical workstation (MULTI AUTOLAB M204)]. The scanning rates were set at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 mV s–1, respectively. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed by using a Landt CT2001A system in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V at room temperature.\n\n Materials Characterization\nMaterials morphology evolution characteristics were observed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, ZEISS Sigma 300) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM F200), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Thermo Fisher Talos F200s). N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out at 77 K by a N2 adsorption analyzer (NOVA 2200e, Quantachrome Instruments). Before the measurement, all samples were outgassed at 180 °C overnight. Specific surface areas of specimens were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Pore size distributions were obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Structures and components of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (XRD, DX-2700) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with the mono Kα.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The N/O-HC was typically prepared through a combination of ball milling and pyrolysis, as illustrated in . Initially, coconut shells purchased from Landarun were calcined at 1300 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere to obtain C-HC. Subsequently, the C-HC powder was mixed thoroughly with urea at weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 by ball milling at 300 rpm for 5 h, respectively. Following this, the mixtures were calcined at 300 °C for 2 h in an argon (Ar) atmosphere using a tube-type furnace, with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. The resulting specimens were designated as N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, respectively.\n\n Assembling of a Half SIB\nBoth nitrogen-doped and undoped HC were mixed with Super P carbon black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methylpyrrolidinone to form a uniformly mixed anode slurry. After magnetic stirring, the resulting slurries were coated onto a well-cleaned copper foil using an H-coating machine. Following the coating process, the anode copper foil was dried at 120 °C overnight in a vacuum oven (DZF-6051). Subsequently, the coated anode films were punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm. The average loading capacity of active substances is 2.2 mg cm–2. These anode discs, along with fiberglass and sodium foil, were utilized to assemble CR 2032 coin-type SIBs with the anode acting as the working electrode, fiberglass as the separator, and sodium foil as the cathode. The assembly process was conducted within a glovebox filled with argon (Ar) (Universal 2400/750/900, Shanghai Mikrouna Mech Tech Co., Ltd.). To connect the electrodes, 0.1 mL of dimethoxyethane containing 1 M NaPF6 salt was used as the electrolyte. For comparative analysis, in addition to N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, C-HC was also employed to examine the effects of nitrogen and oxygen atom doping.\n\n Electrochemical Measurements\nThe electrochemical performance of assembled half cells using different working electrodes, including C-HC (coconut HC), N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, was evaluated through galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Specifically, CV curves were recorded between 0 and 1.5 V (vs Na/Na+) using an electrochemical workstation [Autolab electrochemical workstation (MULTI AUTOLAB M204)]. The scanning rates were set at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 mV s–1, respectively. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed by using a Landt CT2001A system in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V at room temperature.\n\n Materials Characterization\nMaterials morphology evolution characteristics were observed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, ZEISS Sigma 300) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM F200), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Thermo Fisher Talos F200s). N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out at 77 K by a N2 adsorption analyzer (NOVA 2200e, Quantachrome Instruments). Before the measurement, all samples were outgassed at 180 °C overnight. Specific surface areas of specimens were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Pore size distributions were obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Structures and components of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (XRD, DX-2700) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with the mono Kα.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Subsequently, the C-HC powder was mixed thoroughly with urea at weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 by ball milling at 300 rpm for 5 h, respectively. Following this, the mixtures were calcined at 300 °C for 2 h in an argon (Ar) atmosphere using a tube-type furnace, with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. The resulting specimens were designated as N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, respectively.\n\n Assembling of a Half SIB\nBoth nitrogen-doped and undoped HC were mixed with Super P carbon black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methylpyrrolidinone to form a uniformly mixed anode slurry. After magnetic stirring, the resulting slurries were coated onto a well-cleaned copper foil using an H-coating machine. Following the coating process, the anode copper foil was dried at 120 °C overnight in a vacuum oven (DZF-6051). Subsequently, the coated anode films were punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm. The average loading capacity of active substances is 2.2 mg cm–2. These anode discs, along with fiberglass and sodium foil, were utilized to assemble CR 2032 coin-type SIBs with the anode acting as the working electrode, fiberglass as the separator, and sodium foil as the cathode. The assembly process was conducted within a glovebox filled with argon (Ar) (Universal 2400/750/900, Shanghai Mikrouna Mech Tech Co., Ltd.). To connect the electrodes, 0.1 mL of dimethoxyethane containing 1 M NaPF6 salt was used as the electrolyte. For comparative analysis, in addition to N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, C-HC was also employed to examine the effects of nitrogen and oxygen atom doping.\n\n Electrochemical Measurements\nThe electrochemical performance of assembled half cells using different working electrodes, including C-HC (coconut HC), N/O-HC-1, N/O-HC-2, and N/O-HC-3, was evaluated through galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Specifically, CV curves were recorded between 0 and 1.5 V (vs Na/Na+) using an electrochemical workstation [Autolab electrochemical workstation (MULTI AUTOLAB M204)]. The scanning rates were set at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 mV s–1, respectively. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed by using a Landt CT2001A system in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V at room temperature.\n\n Materials Characterization\nMaterials morphology evolution characteristics were observed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, ZEISS Sigma 300) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM F200), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Thermo Fisher Talos F200s). N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out at 77 K by a N2 adsorption analyzer (NOVA 2200e, Quantachrome Instruments). Before the measurement, all samples were outgassed at 180 °C overnight. Specific surface areas of specimens were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Pore size distributions were obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Structures and components of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (XRD, DX-2700) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with the mono Kα.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Pseudocapacity-Like Storage and Priority Diffusion Mechanism in the Graphene/Na2O\nFirst, the interfacial interaction between the graphene and Na2O was investigated. The interface interaction energy is defined as EI = EG + ENO – EG/N, where EG, ENO, and EG/N represent the energies of the (doped) graphene, Na2O, and (doped) graphene/Na2O interfaces, respectively. The electron density of graphene was redistributed after the formation of G/N interface (see  in the Supporting Information), while the Bader charge analysis shows quantitatively that there is some electron migration (0.64 e) from the outermost Na layer to the graphene layer. Electrons mainly accumulate in the interfacial areas due to the electropositive character of the outermost Na+ layer of Na2O surface. Through the electron localization function (ELF)  analysis (see  in the Supporting Information), it can be clearly seen that no covalent bond exists between the graphene and Na2O, because the ELF value at the interface is ∼0. Combining with the per unit area interfacial interaction energy results (18 meV Å–2), the interaction between the graphene and Na2O can be confirmed to be of vdW type.\nSubsequently, the interfacial storage behavior of Na adatom at the G/N interface is investigated. In order to evaluate the storage ability of the G/N interface quantitatively, we compare the adsorption energy of Na adatom with the cohesive energy of the Na atom in sodium metal, and define the difference between them as the sodiation potential value (Ev). While a positive Ev means that the sodium adatom contributes to the excess storage capacity. The adsorption energy of Na atoms is defined as Ed = −(ET – E0 – nENa)/n, where ET, E0, and ENa are the energies of interfacial system intercalated by n Na atoms, the energy of the pristine interfacial system, and the energy of the single free Na atom, respectively. The average voltage (Ev) is defined as Ev = −(ET – E0 – nENa\u202fbulk)/ne, where e is the absolute value of the electron charge and ENa\u202fbulk is the energy of one Na atom in the Na body-centered cubic (bcc) bulk. Calculated results show that the most stable adsorption site for one Na atom at the G/N interface is Site 3, with a sodiation potential of +0.62 V, which is much bigger than that of one sodium adsorption at the Na2O surface (−0.38 V, Site 2). It seems that the graphene endows the Na2O enhanced adsorption ability of Na atom. To further investigate this interfacial storage mechanism, the electronic structure analysis of the most stable adsorption configuration was performed. As shown in b, the introduction of interfacial Na atom causes more charge transfer toward the graphene layer. Bader charge analysis (see c) revealed that the graphene layer of the G/N interface gains 1.13 e after the interfacial Na atom is inserted, which is bigger than the value (0.64 e) forming the G/N interface. Moreover, interfacial Na adatom losses 0.82 e, which is much greater than the value of 0.26 e on the Na2O surface. As a result, much stronger interaction between the interfacial adatom and the G/N interface can be induced. The electrons transfer from the Na adatom to the graphene layer and Na2O layer when Na atoms are adsorbed at the G/N interface. The partial density of states (see  in the Supporting Information) for the s-orbital of the interfacial Na atom and p-orbital of the nearest neighboring O atom at Na2O at the G/N interface, and it can be clearly seen that these two states hybridize at the energy range from −2.0 eV to −0.6 eV. Such adsorption behavior clearly indicates that the Na2O can be served as the host for Na+ cation, because of the binding between the O atom of Na2O and the interfacial Na+ cation, while the graphene layer serves as an electron acceptor. Hence, spatial electron–cation separation can be depicted as a pseudocapacity-like interfacial mechanism. In addition, more additional Na atoms can be intercalated further at the interface region between graphene and Na2O surface. We gradually increase the number of interface Na atoms until the Ev value turns negative. Results show that the G/N interface system can adsorb 3 Na atoms corresponding to 0.099 mAh/m2 (see d).\nDuring the sodiation process of G/MO anode materials, the diffusion of Na atoms involves two pathways. The first one is at the interface of G/N, while the second one is inside the Na2O bulk phase. Because of the high symmetry of the Na2O bulk phase and the big radius of the Na atom, the interstitial Na atom prefer to locate at the center of the octahedron zone composed of six nearby O atoms (see e). An interstitial atom can diffuse to the interstitial site without displacing lattice atoms via a direct-hopping mechanism. Alternatively, it can also diffuse into a host lattice site by knocking a neighboring lattice atom into an adjacent interstitial site (interstitialcy mechanism). Our calculated results show that the diffuse mechanism in the Na2O bulk phase occurs mainly via the latter mechanism, because of its much lower energetic barrier. The interstitial Na atom (marked by “I” in the inset of e) first move to the position of adjacent Na atom (marked by “S” in the inset of e) of normal lattice of Na2O bulk, while S–Na atom will simultaneously move to the center of the nearby octahedron. However, because of the high coordination number of the interstitial Na atom with adjacent O ions, this process shows a relatively high energetic diffusion barrier of 0.51 eV. We further measured the energy evolution for the diffusion of the Na atom at the Na2O surface, and the result shows that the diffusion barrier is 0.37 eV (see  in the Supporting Information).\nAt the G/N interfaces, the calculation results show that the Na ion at the interface will encounter an energy barrier as low as 0.25 eV (f), which is smaller than the value in the Na2O surface or the Na2O bulk phase. Particularly, the Na ion prefers to follow a novel “V” diffusion pathway to move to another stable site, as shown in f. The migration behavior of single Na atom at the interface involves the simultaneous movement of Na atom adjacent to the first layer of the Na2O surface. However, such a cooperative mechanism is different from the interstitialcy mechanism. such that, in the bulk Na2O, and the diffusion can be realized by a two-step interstitialcy mechanism, which involves the cooperative motion by one interstitial Na atom and one host Na atom of the Na2O (111) surface. First, the interface Na atom (marked by “I” in f) will substitute the Na atom (marked by “S” in f) in the original lattice of the outermost layer of Na2O at the interface of G/N, while the present host Na atom “S” will migrate to the adjacent interstitial site, which is different from the initial “I” site. Second, the “I” atom will continuously diffuse to the adjacent stable site, meanwhile the “S” atom, now located in the new interstitial site, will diffuse back to its previous host site. The entire diffusion behavior involves two cooperation interstitialcy mechanism processes, in which the S–Na atom act as a temporary assistant role when the I–Na atom diffuse. From the perspective of the entire migration process, the interstitial atom and host atom does not change their own roles.\nIn order to reveal the mechanism of such unique interstitialcy mechanism, we further investigated the Bader charge of I–Na atom and S–Na atom at every diffusion image state (see  in the Supporting Information). The Bader charge value results show that both of them exhibits a coordination change trend along the diffusion. Because of the ionization of the interface Na atom, its properties are similar to the first Na layer atoms of Na2O surface while both of them are bound with three adjacent O atoms, which is smaller than the value in bulk phase (six adjacent O atoms). In this situation, the migration of Na atoms at the interface of G/N results in low local lattice deformation. Downward migration of ions at the high-energy sites can offset a portion of the energy barrier of the upward migration of ions at low-energy sites. In addition, the concerted diffusion can also decrease the repulsion effect between the “I” atom and ”S” atom. We also investigate Na ion diffusion when more Na ions are inserted into the interface; the results show that the magnitude of barrier is also very low, and the diffusion behavior is still similar to the two-step interstitialcy process (see detail discussion in  in the Supporting Information). On the basis of the barrier simulation, the diffusion constant D can be calculated, while the calculated diffusion constants at room temperature (300 K) for the systems are listed in  in the Supporting Information. Diffusion along the G/N interface is the prioritized diffusive path when Na atom transfer to the active electrode materials occurs in the sodiation process. Combining both thermodynamic and kinetic factors, it is obvious to design materials that possess a high interface ratio of G/N, will highly enhance the rate performance, and improve the storage capacity. In the next section, we will verify this hypothesis and continue to investigate the influence of high G/N interface ratio on G/MO materials, together with experimental studies.\n\n3.2.  Experimental Validation of High Interface Ratio Structure\nIn order to verify the smooth diffusion of Na along the G/N interface, unique structure of sandwiched C@SnO2@C composite was synthesized, in which SnO2 nanocrystals were confined in carbon shells, as shown in the schematic illustration of a. Such a sandwiched structure design ensures that numerous interfaces between Na2O and the carbon sheet can be produced during sodiation. b and c show SEM images of the C@SnO2@C composite, from which it can be seen that the cubic carbon shells are assembled together to form a micrometer-scale interconnected conductive network. The large pores on the surface of the carbon shell demonstrate its hollow structure, which contribute to the deep penetration of the electrolyte and shorten the diffusion path of ions through the solid phase. In addition, the smooth surface of carbon shells indicates that the SnO2 nanocrystals are all-around confined in the carbon shell, increasing the interface area between SnO2 and carbon.\nThe TEM image (d) confirms the hollow structure of the interconnected cubic C@SnO2@C, and the corresponding EDS pattern (inset in d) represents the only existence of elemental C, O, and Sn. It can be seen from the HRTEM image (e) that the carbon shell has a wall thickness of ∼15 nm and is embedded with several 5 nm nanocrystals, which can be confirmed as SnO2 from the XRD and SAED patterns (see f, as well as  in the Supporting Information). Note that the SnO2 nanocrystals are completely embedded in the carbon shell and remain monodisperse, which, on the one hand, can prevent the high-energy surface of the active nanocrystals from directly contacting the electrolyte, and on the other hand, increases the two-phase interface between SnO2 and carbon. In order to better understand the role of G/N interface in electrochemical reactions and its effect on the energy storage mechanism, coin cells with sodium metal as the counter electrode were employed to analyze the electrochemical behavior of C@SnO2@C electrode including cycle performance, rate performance, cyclic voltammetry and energy storage mechanisms.\na and b show the cycling and rate performance, from which it can be seen that the C@SnO2@C electrode delivers a high average capacity of ∼370 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Besides, as the current rates increase from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A/g, the capacities of the C@SnO2@C electrode are 338, 289, 237, 193, 146, and 105 mAh/g, respectively, exhibiting excellent rate performance and superior to most SnO2-based electrodes (see  in the Supporting Information). The electrochemical reactions of the C@SnO2@C electrode can be inferred from the CV curve of c. In the cathodic scan, a reduction peak of ∼0.68 V can be seen initially, which corresponds to the conversion of SnO2 to Sn and it accompanies the formation of Na2O.  Subsequently, two peaks, located at 0.23 and 0.05 V, are associated with the alloying reaction of Sn into NaxSn and the intercalation reaction of carbon with Na.  In the anodic scan, the peak at 0.29 V corresponds to the dealloying reaction of NaxSn. Notably, the broad peak at ∼1 V corresponds to the conversion reaction of Sn to SnO2.  As is generally known, the conversion reaction between Sn and SnO2 is difficult to be reversible, so the sodium storage capacity of SnO2 is unsatisfactory.  However, it is considered that the SnO2 nanocrystals in C@SnO2@C electrode can be partially reversible during cycling and the entire electrochemical reaction can be illustrated as follows:Thus, to further verify this inference, structure and phase change of the electrode were investigated by TEM, as shown in  in the Supporting Information.  show the HRTEM images of the C@SnO2@C composite at sodiated state (0.25 V vs Na/Na+) and desodiated state (3.0 V vs Na/Na+), respectively. Through Fourier transform and lattice spacing analysis, SnO2 is first converted to Sn and then sodiated to Na15Sn4, which is consistent with the reaction equation above (see  in the Supporting Information). Importantly, the conversion of SnO2 to Sn results in the formation of Na2O, which is amorphous and dispersed around the Sn nanoparticles after several cycles. While, during desodiation process, the Na15Sn4 is first dealloyed to form Sn, and from  in the Supporting Information, it can be seen that some Sn nanoparticles can indeed be reversibly converted to SnO2. This confirms that SnO2 is partially reversible in this structure, which may be attributed to the fact that SnO2 nanocrystals are completely confined in the carbon matrix, resulting in the formation of a large amount of Na2O/carbon and Na2O/SnO2 interface during sodiation (see ). This can provide fast transfer channels for ions and electrons and promote the dynamic process of reversible conversion.\nd shows the CV curves of C/SnO2/C electrode tested at various scan rates, from which it can be seen that, as the scan rate increases, the redox peaks gradually widen and the overall shape become more rectangular, indicating a capacitive energy storage behavior. In fact, the power law relationship between the scan rate v and the corresponding current i can be used as follows to measure the capacitive feature of electrodes: For b = 0.5, a diffusion-controlled energy storage process is suggested; while b = 1.0 represents a capacitive-controlled process, since a typical capacitor-like linear relationship between current and scan rate is obtained. A voltage range of 0.29–2 V in the anodic scan was selected to calculate the b-value, as it included two major oxidation peaks. It can be seen from the result shown in e that the b-value approaches 0.5 in the NaxSn dealloying process (0.29 V), which shows the typical diffusion-controlled energy storage. However, as the dealloying reaction progresses, the b-value gradually increases and reaches a maximum value of 0.97 at the end of the reaction. Subsequently, as the conversion reaction of Sn to SnO2 proceeds, the b-value decreases again until reaching its lowest value of 0.78. If b = 0.75 is used as the boundary between the two reaction mechanisms, then the conversion reaction of SnO2 is always capacitive-controlled. The ultrafast electrochemical reaction brought by the capacitive-controlled process verifies why SnO2 can be reversibly converted. In addition, the quantitative calculation of the contribution of capacitive controlled energy storage were also investigated (see the detailed discussion in  in the Supporting Information), the results show that this structure can indeed change its energy storage mechanism, thus accelerating the diffusion/conduction of ions/electrons and improving the rate performance of the electrode.\nThese experimental results confirm our hypothesis that the storage capacity mechanism and rate performance can be greatly regulated by designing electrode materials with high G/N interface ratio. In adition, we also find that the high G/N interface structure is improving the reversible conversion of the active material during electrode cycling.\n\n3.3.  Doping Effect on Interface Storage and Diffusion Property\nMoreover, it was reported that heterogeneous atom doping can make a great influence in the electronic structure and Li diffusion behavior on the graphene. Thus, it can be predicted that such a doping effect can also affect both the storage and rate behavior performances of G/N interfaces. In this section, we provide a systematic study on the doping effect at the interface of XG/N (where X represents the doping atom), which helps to further optimize the high electrochemical performance anode materials. Here, N, O, and S dopants are selected because they are the most widely studied in graphene experimentally. \nAs shown in a, all of the doping atoms can increase the interface interaction energies between the graphene and Na2O. The EI values for the NG/N and OG/N interfaces are still within the range of vdW force, which are consistent with the ELF analysis (see  in the Supporting Information). However, the SG/N can induce the biggest value of 33.43 meV/Å2. As shown in b, the charge in the region near the S doping atom varies greatly, indicating that the SG/N interface is quite different from other interfaces (G/N, NG/N, OG/N). This can also be proved by the PDOS analysis (see  in the Supporting Information), where it is clearly seen that the S-2p orbital electrons, O-2p electrons, and Na-2s electrons are intensively hybridized at the energy windows ranging from −3.2 eV to −1.3 eV. This indicates the existence of the covalent-type bonding, concentrating at the adjacent region of S atom and O atom. Bader charge analysis further shows that the S dopant loses electrons while the SG layer gains electrons, resulting in more electron accumulation at doped graphene and a stronger adhesion with Na2O surfaces. Therefore, S-doped graphene can induce the largest adhesive strength between graphene and Na2O, which can greatly improve the stability of the heterojunction-type negative materials during its charge and discharge cycle.\nThe storage at doped G/N interface were also investigated. Our results show that the interface Na storage capabilities varies with the different dopants of the G/N interface, while the NG/N, OG/N and SG/N interface systems can adsorb 5, 6, and 4 Na atoms, respectively (see c and  in the Supporting Information). For the OG/N system, the sodiation voltage go directly from 2 to 4, which were caused by the change of structures (see detailed discussion in  in the Supporting Information). As discussed in , the interfacial storage mechanism can be depicted as pseudocapacity-like interfacial behavior with charge separation, so the capability of the electron acceptance of graphene layer will play the decisive role on the interface Na storage (see detailed discussion in  in the Supporting Information). In order to study the doping effect on the rate performance of interfacial structure, the electronic structure and energy barrier of Na on the G/N interface were calculated. Although Na2O is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.42 eV,  there is always considerable state across the Fermi level when forming the composite structure of (N, O, S doped)-graphene/Na2O (see  in the Supporting Information). Combining with the good conductivity of pristine graphene, such interface structure can greatly improve the electronic conductivity of the materials. d shows the doping effect on the diffuse performance of Na on the G/N interface. The results show that all doping systems via double-interstitialcy mechanism show smaller diffusion energy barrier than the value of pristine G/N interface (0.25 eV), corresponding to the 0.17 eV for NG/N, 0.13 eV for OG/N, and 0.11 eV for SG/N. The diffusion constant of S-doped systems is the largest among of them with 2.34 × 10–4 cm2 s–1 due to the smallest barrier, which is observably improved, compared with the pristine G/N interface and the diffusivity can be ∼3 orders faster. Combining with the interfacial stability, the storage capacity and the diffusion behavior of doping systems, the S-doping systems exhibits a good balance property among the three indicators, which show a good potential to further improve the electrical performance of G/MO materials.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experiments\nTo synthesize the C@SnO2@C composite, 15 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of citric acid (C6H8O7), and 0.79 g of SnCl4 were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. After stirring for 6 h, the homogeneous solution was freeze-dried under the condition of vacuum and −43 °C to obtain the precursor. Subsequently, the precursor spread on a small corundum tube was annealed at 650 °C for 1 h under a C2H2/Ar atmosphere (5% C2H2) and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with distilled water, C@SnO2@C composite was obtained. XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/max diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation at a wavelength of 1.5406 Å. SEM and TEM were performed on JEOL Model JSM-6700F, FEI Tecnai Model G2 F20, and JEOL Model JEM-2100Plus systems. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using a coin-type test cell (CR2032). For fabrication of cells, the working electrode was composed of C@SnO2@C, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and carbon black in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 on a copper foil. The electrolyte was 1.0 M NaClO4 in EC and DEC (volume ratio, 1:1) CV measurements were conducted at 0.2–1.8 mV/s within 0.01–3.0 V on a Princeton electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles were tested by a LAND CT2001A electrochemical workstation at various current densities, from 0.1 A/g to 10 A/g.\n\n\n3.2.  Experimental Validation of High Interface Ratio Structure\nIn order to verify the smooth diffusion of Na along the G/N interface, unique structure of sandwiched C@SnO2@C composite was synthesized, in which SnO2 nanocrystals were confined in carbon shells, as shown in the schematic illustration of a. Such a sandwiched structure design ensures that numerous interfaces between Na2O and the carbon sheet can be produced during sodiation. b and c show SEM images of the C@SnO2@C composite, from which it can be seen that the cubic carbon shells are assembled together to form a micrometer-scale interconnected conductive network. The large pores on the surface of the carbon shell demonstrate its hollow structure, which contribute to the deep penetration of the electrolyte and shorten the diffusion path of ions through the solid phase. In addition, the smooth surface of carbon shells indicates that the SnO2 nanocrystals are all-around confined in the carbon shell, increasing the interface area between SnO2 and carbon.\nThe TEM image (d) confirms the hollow structure of the interconnected cubic C@SnO2@C, and the corresponding EDS pattern (inset in d) represents the only existence of elemental C, O, and Sn. It can be seen from the HRTEM image (e) that the carbon shell has a wall thickness of ∼15 nm and is embedded with several 5 nm nanocrystals, which can be confirmed as SnO2 from the XRD and SAED patterns (see f, as well as  in the Supporting Information). Note that the SnO2 nanocrystals are completely embedded in the carbon shell and remain monodisperse, which, on the one hand, can prevent the high-energy surface of the active nanocrystals from directly contacting the electrolyte, and on the other hand, increases the two-phase interface between SnO2 and carbon. In order to better understand the role of G/N interface in electrochemical reactions and its effect on the energy storage mechanism, coin cells with sodium metal as the counter electrode were employed to analyze the electrochemical behavior of C@SnO2@C electrode including cycle performance, rate performance, cyclic voltammetry and energy storage mechanisms.\na and b show the cycling and rate performance, from which it can be seen that the C@SnO2@C electrode delivers a high average capacity of ∼370 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Besides, as the current rates increase from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A/g, the capacities of the C@SnO2@C electrode are 338, 289, 237, 193, 146, and 105 mAh/g, respectively, exhibiting excellent rate performance and superior to most SnO2-based electrodes (see  in the Supporting Information). The electrochemical reactions of the C@SnO2@C electrode can be inferred from the CV curve of c. In the cathodic scan, a reduction peak of ∼0.68 V can be seen initially, which corresponds to the conversion of SnO2 to Sn and it accompanies the formation of Na2O.  Subsequently, two peaks, located at 0.23 and 0.05 V, are associated with the alloying reaction of Sn into NaxSn and the intercalation reaction of carbon with Na.  In the anodic scan, the peak at 0.29 V corresponds to the dealloying reaction of NaxSn. Notably, the broad peak at ∼1 V corresponds to the conversion reaction of Sn to SnO2.  As is generally known, the conversion reaction between Sn and SnO2 is difficult to be reversible, so the sodium storage capacity of SnO2 is unsatisfactory.  However, it is considered that the SnO2 nanocrystals in C@SnO2@C electrode can be partially reversible during cycling and the entire electrochemical reaction can be illustrated as follows:Thus, to further verify this inference, structure and phase change of the electrode were investigated by TEM, as shown in  in the Supporting Information.  show the HRTEM images of the C@SnO2@C composite at sodiated state (0.25 V vs Na/Na+) and desodiated state (3.0 V vs Na/Na+), respectively. Through Fourier transform and lattice spacing analysis, SnO2 is first converted to Sn and then sodiated to Na15Sn4, which is consistent with the reaction equation above (see  in the Supporting Information). Importantly, the conversion of SnO2 to Sn results in the formation of Na2O, which is amorphous and dispersed around the Sn nanoparticles after several cycles. While, during desodiation process, the Na15Sn4 is first dealloyed to form Sn, and from  in the Supporting Information, it can be seen that some Sn nanoparticles can indeed be reversibly converted to SnO2. This confirms that SnO2 is partially reversible in this structure, which may be attributed to the fact that SnO2 nanocrystals are completely confined in the carbon matrix, resulting in the formation of a large amount of Na2O/carbon and Na2O/SnO2 interface during sodiation (see ). This can provide fast transfer channels for ions and electrons and promote the dynamic process of reversible conversion.\nd shows the CV curves of C/SnO2/C electrode tested at various scan rates, from which it can be seen that, as the scan rate increases, the redox peaks gradually widen and the overall shape become more rectangular, indicating a capacitive energy storage behavior. In fact, the power law relationship between the scan rate v and the corresponding current i can be used as follows to measure the capacitive feature of electrodes: For b = 0.5, a diffusion-controlled energy storage process is suggested; while b = 1.0 represents a capacitive-controlled process, since a typical capacitor-like linear relationship between current and scan rate is obtained. A voltage range of 0.29–2 V in the anodic scan was selected to calculate the b-value, as it included two major oxidation peaks. It can be seen from the result shown in e that the b-value approaches 0.5 in the NaxSn dealloying process (0.29 V), which shows the typical diffusion-controlled energy storage. However, as the dealloying reaction progresses, the b-value gradually increases and reaches a maximum value of 0.97 at the end of the reaction. Subsequently, as the conversion reaction of Sn to SnO2 proceeds, the b-value decreases again until reaching its lowest value of 0.78. If b = 0.75 is used as the boundary between the two reaction mechanisms, then the conversion reaction of SnO2 is always capacitive-controlled. The ultrafast electrochemical reaction brought by the capacitive-controlled process verifies why SnO2 can be reversibly converted. In addition, the quantitative calculation of the contribution of capacitive controlled energy storage were also investigated (see the detailed discussion in  in the Supporting Information), the results show that this structure can indeed change its energy storage mechanism, thus accelerating the diffusion/conduction of ions/electrons and improving the rate performance of the electrode.\nThese experimental results confirm our hypothesis that the storage capacity mechanism and rate performance can be greatly regulated by designing electrode materials with high G/N interface ratio. In adition, we also find that the high G/N interface structure is improving the reversible conversion of the active material during electrode cycling.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experiments\nTo synthesize the C@SnO2@C composite, 15 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of citric acid (C6H8O7), and 0.79 g of SnCl4 were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. After stirring for 6 h, the homogeneous solution was freeze-dried under the condition of vacuum and −43 °C to obtain the precursor. Subsequently, the precursor spread on a small corundum tube was annealed at 650 °C for 1 h under a C2H2/Ar atmosphere (5% C2H2) and then cooled to room temperature. After washing with distilled water, C@SnO2@C composite was obtained. XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/max diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation at a wavelength of 1.5406 Å. SEM and TEM were performed on JEOL Model JSM-6700F, FEI Tecnai Model G2 F20, and JEOL Model JEM-2100Plus systems. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using a coin-type test cell (CR2032). For fabrication of cells, the working electrode was composed of C@SnO2@C, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and carbon black in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 on a copper foil. The electrolyte was 1.0 M NaClO4 in EC and DEC (volume ratio, 1:1) CV measurements were conducted at 0.2–1.8 mV/s within 0.01–3.0 V on a Princeton electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles were tested by a LAND CT2001A electrochemical workstation at various current densities, from 0.1 A/g to 10 A/g.\n\n\n3.2.  Experimental Validation of High Interface Ratio Structure\nIn order to verify the smooth diffusion of Na along the G/N interface, unique structure of sandwiched C@SnO2@C composite was synthesized, in which SnO2 nanocrystals were confined in carbon shells, as shown in the schematic illustration of a. Such a sandwiched structure design ensures that numerous interfaces between Na2O and the carbon sheet can be produced during sodiation. b and c show SEM images of the C@SnO2@C composite, from which it can be seen that the cubic carbon shells are assembled together to form a micrometer-scale interconnected conductive network. The large pores on the surface of the carbon shell demonstrate its hollow structure, which contribute to the deep penetration of the electrolyte and shorten the diffusion path of ions through the solid phase. In addition, the smooth surface of carbon shells indicates that the SnO2 nanocrystals are all-around confined in the carbon shell, increasing the interface area between SnO2 and carbon.\nThe TEM image (d) confirms the hollow structure of the interconnected cubic C@SnO2@C, and the corresponding EDS pattern (inset in d) represents the only existence of elemental C, O, and Sn. It can be seen from the HRTEM image (e) that the carbon shell has a wall thickness of ∼15 nm and is embedded with several 5 nm nanocrystals, which can be confirmed as SnO2 from the XRD and SAED patterns (see f, as well as  in the Supporting Information). Note that the SnO2 nanocrystals are completely embedded in the carbon shell and remain monodisperse, which, on the one hand, can prevent the high-energy surface of the active nanocrystals from directly contacting the electrolyte, and on the other hand, increases the two-phase interface between SnO2 and carbon. In order to better understand the role of G/N interface in electrochemical reactions and its effect on the energy storage mechanism, coin cells with sodium metal as the counter electrode were employed to analyze the electrochemical behavior of C@SnO2@C electrode including cycle performance, rate performance, cyclic voltammetry and energy storage mechanisms.\na and b show the cycling and rate performance, from which it can be seen that the C@SnO2@C electrode delivers a high average capacity of ∼370 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Besides, as the current rates increase from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A/g, the capacities of the C@SnO2@C electrode are 338, 289, 237, 193, 146, and 105 mAh/g, respectively, exhibiting excellent rate performance and superior to most SnO2-based electrodes (see  in the Supporting Information). The electrochemical reactions of the C@SnO2@C electrode can be inferred from the CV curve of c. In the cathodic scan, a reduction peak of ∼0.68 V can be seen initially, which corresponds to the conversion of SnO2 to Sn and it accompanies the formation of Na2O.  Subsequently, two peaks, located at 0.23 and 0.05 V, are associated with the alloying reaction of Sn into NaxSn and the intercalation reaction of carbon with Na.  In the anodic scan, the peak at 0.29 V corresponds to the dealloying reaction of NaxSn. Notably, the broad peak at ∼1 V corresponds to the conversion reaction of Sn to SnO2.  As is generally known, the conversion reaction between Sn and SnO2 is difficult to be reversible, so the sodium storage capacity of SnO2 is unsatisfactory.  However, it is considered that the SnO2 nanocrystals in C@SnO2@C electrode can be partially reversible during cycling and the entire electrochemical reaction can be illustrated as follows:Thus, to further verify this inference, structure and phase change of the electrode were investigated by TEM, as shown in  in the Supporting Information.  show the HRTEM images of the C@SnO2@C composite at sodiated state (0.25 V vs Na/Na+) and desodiated state (3.0 V vs Na/Na+), respectively. Through Fourier transform and lattice spacing analysis, SnO2 is first converted to Sn and then sodiated to Na15Sn4, which is consistent with the reaction equation above (see  in the Supporting Information). Importantly, the conversion of SnO2 to Sn results in the formation of Na2O, which is amorphous and dispersed around the Sn nanoparticles after several cycles. While, during desodiation process, the Na15Sn4 is first dealloyed to form Sn, and from  in the Supporting Information, it can be seen that some Sn nanoparticles can indeed be reversibly converted to SnO2. This confirms that SnO2 is partially reversible in this structure, which may be attributed to the fact that SnO2 nanocrystals are completely confined in the carbon matrix, resulting in the formation of a large amount of Na2O/carbon and Na2O/SnO2 interface during sodiation (see ). This can provide fast transfer channels for ions and electrons and promote the dynamic process of reversible conversion.\nd shows the CV curves of C/SnO2/C electrode tested at various scan rates, from which it can be seen that, as the scan rate increases, the redox peaks gradually widen and the overall shape become more rectangular, indicating a capacitive energy storage behavior. In fact, the power law relationship between the scan rate v and the corresponding current i can be used as follows to measure the capacitive feature of electrodes: For b = 0.5, a diffusion-controlled energy storage process is suggested; while b = 1.0 represents a capacitive-controlled process, since a typical capacitor-like linear relationship between current and scan rate is obtained. A voltage range of 0.29–2 V in the anodic scan was selected to calculate the b-value, as it included two major oxidation peaks. It can be seen from the result shown in e that the b-value approaches 0.5 in the NaxSn dealloying process (0.29 V), which shows the typical diffusion-controlled energy storage. However, as the dealloying reaction progresses, the b-value gradually increases and reaches a maximum value of 0.97 at the end of the reaction. Subsequently, as the conversion reaction of Sn to SnO2 proceeds, the b-value decreases again until reaching its lowest value of 0.78. If b = 0.75 is used as the boundary between the two reaction mechanisms, then the conversion reaction of SnO2 is always capacitive-controlled. The ultrafast electrochemical reaction brought by the capacitive-controlled process verifies why SnO2 can be reversibly converted. In addition, the quantitative calculation of the contribution of capacitive controlled energy storage were also investigated (see the detailed discussion in  in the Supporting Information), the results show that this structure can indeed change its energy storage mechanism, thus accelerating the diffusion/conduction of ions/electrons and improving the rate performance of the electrode.\nThese experimental results confirm our hypothesis that the storage capacity mechanism and rate performance can be greatly regulated by designing electrode materials with high G/N interface ratio. In adition, we also find that the high G/N interface structure is improving the reversible conversion of the active material during electrode cycling.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

First, SbCl3 was put into an NH4VO3 solution to form a Sb–V-containing solution. Second, a dispersed graphene suspension was added dropwise to the aforementioned solution. Subsequently, the mixed liquid was transferred to a hydrothermal kettle for the hydrothermal treatment. Finally, the SbVO4/G composites were obtained after freeze-drying. The XRD patterns of the SbVO4/G composites and SbVO4 are shown in a. Compared with pure SbVO4, the SbVO4/G composites indicated no other phase except for SbVO4, where peaks are indexed to tetragonal SbVO4 with a space group of P42/mnm (PDF #77-0331) (b). The peaks of SbVO4/G composites become broader, which may result from the encapsulated nanostructure by graphene.  Raman spectra were further recorded to reveal the structure composition of SbVO4/G samples (c). Two distinct peaks at ∼1320 and ∼1590 cm–1 correspond to the D band and the G band, verifying the existence of disordered graphite carbon and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, respectively.  These results correspond well with XRD analysis, indicating the successful synthesis of SbVO4/G composites. XPS was carried out to detect the elemental composition and chemical valence of the SbVO4/G composites. The survey spectra of SbVO4/G primarily consist of Sb, C, O, and V elements (d). For the high-resolution V 2p spectrum of SbVO4/G, two primitive peaks of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 orbitals are exhibited in e. These two asymmetric peaks can be further divided into V5+ (516.9 and 524.2 eV) and V4+ (515.8 and 523.1 eV), indicating the mixed-valence state of V in the materials.  The Sb 3d located at 531.18 and 540.58 eV (f) correspond to the Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2 orbitals, respectively. \nThe morphology and microstructures of the materials were revealed by SEM characterization. As shown in a,b, pure SbVO4 is mainly in the form of nanoparticles, showing obvious particle agglomeration. By contract, the SbVO4/G composites exhibit that evenly distributed SbVO4 nanoparticles are embedded on the surface of graphene (c,d). The average particle size of SbVO4 in SbVO4/G composites is about 30 nm, which is smaller than that of the bare SbVO4 nanoparticles (the average size is 70 nm). The small particle size of SbVO4 embedded in the graphene substrate can increase the intimate contact with the electrolyte, increase the number of active sites, and shorten the ion transport pathway, which could be favorable to the improvement of cycling and rate performance for lithium and sodium storage.  The EDS mapping of SbVO4/G composites is shown in e–i; Sb, V, O, and C elements are well distributed within the structure of SbVO4/G, indicating that the SbVO4 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in the graphene substrate. The specific surface area and pore structure of SbVO4/G and SbVO4 were obtained by the N2 adsorption–desorption measurement. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and the average pore size of SbVO4/G are 130 m2 g–1 and 5 nm, respectively. (j and). In contrast, the BET specific surface area and the pore size of SbVO4 are calculated to be 93 m2 g–1 and 9 nm, respectively. The combination of the SbVO4 nanoparticles and graphene was also explored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. As presented in k, the SbVO4 nanoparticles are well embedded in the graphene substrate. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (l) displays a lattice distance of 0.41 nm, which indexes to the (111) plane of SbVO4.\nThe electrochemical performance of SbVO4 and SbVO4/G for LIB anodes was measured in half cells. a shows the CV curves of the SbVO4/G electrode at 0.2 mV s–1. The results of the CV profiles are consistent with the previously reported results.  The electrochemical reactions are revealed by the following reactions \nThree obvious reduction peaks of SbVO4/G electrodes at 1.25, 0.61, and 0.35–0.01 V can be seen in the first anodic scanning, which mainly correspond to the generation of Sb, Li3Sb (Li2Sb), and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) films.  The reduction peak at 1.25 V in the second cycle changes significantly, indicating that  is an incomplete reversible process. However, the CV curves almost overlap in the following cycles, revealing the distinguished reversibility and stability of the SbVO4/G composites. The GCD curves of SbVO4/G and pure SbVO4 nanoparticles under different cycles were evaluated to further investigate the electrochemical reactions during the Li+ insertion/deinsertion processes (b and ). The discharge platforms at 1.3 and 0.7 V represent the generation of Sb and Li3Sb (Li2Sb). A small platform at 0.2 V can be observed, which corresponds to the formation of SEI films.  In the subsequent cycles, the discharge platforms from the 10th to 100th cycle remain nearly unchanged, indicating excellent electrochemical reversibility and stability of the SbVO4/G composites. The results of the charge/discharge curves of SbVO4/G (b) well coincide with the CV analysis, further demonstrating the multistep electrochemical lithiation/delithiation processes of the SbVO4/G composites. In contrast, the pure SbVO4 nanoparticles displayed a significantly irreversible reaction during the Li+ insertion/deinsertion processes. The discharge platform of SbVO4 at 0.7 V gradually becomes shorter (), directly resulting in the rapid attenuation of capacity during the cycling process. The SbVO4/G composites display high initial discharge and charge capacities of 1394 and 998.7 mAh g–1, respectively. SbVO4/G shows a higher initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 71.64% when compared with that of the SbVO4 nanoparticles (ICE of 65.33%). The low ICE is mainly derived from the electrolyte decomposition and SEI film formation. The Coulombic efficiency (CE) of SbVO4/G increases to 98% from the fifth cycle. Surprisingly, the SbVO4/G electrode shows a certain capacity increase, which might be arising from the activation process of the electrode materials.  The SbVO4/G composite electrode remains 1079.5 mAh g–1 after 150 cycles (c). Nevertheless, the capacity of SbVO4 gradually decreases and drops to 583.4 mAh g–1 (only 69.5% of the initial capacity) after 150 cycles. The poor structural stability and rapid capacity decline of SbVO4 nanoparticles can be ascribed to the material pulverization and agglomeration as a result of the huge volume changes in the alloying process.\nThe rate performances of SbVO4/G composites and SbVO4 nanoparticles for LIB anodes are conducted at 0.1–3.0 A g–1, as presented in d and . The SbVO4/G composites display reversible capacities of 1070.1, 1025.4, 962.75, 917.95, 864.9, and 813.85 mAh g–1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 A g–1, respectively. In contract, the SbVO4 nanoparticles exhibit poor capacities of 867.95, 817.3, 667.2, 546.05, 430.2, and 344.8 mAh g–1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 A g–1, respectively. As the current density comes back to 0.1 A g–1, an excellent reversible capacity of 1047.7 mAh g–1 is obtained, revealing the well-preserved nanostructure and good reversibility of the SbVO4/G composites. The charge/discharge curves of SbVO4/G composites and pure SbVO4 electrodes at different current densities are displayed in . The discharge platform near 0.7 V is basically stable, suggesting the excellent stability of the SbVO4/G anode. In sharp contrast, the charge/discharge curves of SbVO4 change greatly, where the rapid shrinkage platform at 0.7 V leads to a low capacity of SbVO4. In addition, the discharge platform of SbVO4 gradually moves to a high potential resulting in serious polarization. The EIS of the SbVO4/G and SbVO4 electrodes are performed to investigate the electrochemical kinetics for lithium and sodium storage. In EIS spectra, the high-frequency depressed semicircle reflects the impedance of the interface membrane (RS) and contact resistance (Rf), and the middle represents interfacial charge-transfer resistance (Rct), while the slope is related to the Warburg diffusion (ZW).  The SbVO4/G anode displays a smaller Rct value compared to SbVO4 (e), indicating that the composite structure of SbVO4/G improves the conductivity.\nThe SbVO4/G composites and pure SbVO4 are further applied as anodes for SIBs. a and  show the CV curves of SbVO4/G and pure SbVO4 electrodes with 0.2 mV s–1. The characteristics of the CV curves are very similar to those of Sb2O3.  The wide reduction peak at 0.6–0.01 V can be observed during the first anodic scanning (a), corresponding to the SEI film and Sb forming. The reduction and oxidation peaks of SbVO4/G at 0.83 and 1.78 V can be attributed to the alloying reaction between Sb and Na.  The GCD curves of SbVO4/G composites and SbVO4 nanoparticles were measured during different cycles at 0.1 A g–1. The SbVO4/G composites and SbVO4 nanoparticles exhibit initial discharge capacities of 744.9 and 680.4 mAh g–1 with ICE of 68.93 and 36.98%, respectively (b and ). The lower ICE for SbVO4 is mainly attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the irreversible redox reaction. A quite apparent long discharge platform at 0.5 V is shown in the first cycle for both SbVO4/G and SbVO4, which corresponds to the formation of the SEI layer and Na3Sb. After the 30th cycle, the charge/discharge platforms of SbVO4/G composite anodes remained almost unchanged, which may be caused by the gradual stable optimization of the SEI film and its robust structure. In contrast, the charge/discharge platforms of SbVO4 disappear after 100 cycles, which could have been originated from the structure pulverization of SbVO4 (). As shown in c, the SbVO4/G anode still maintains a discharge specific capacity of 401.6 mAh g–1 after 450 cycles. By comparison, the pure SbVO4 anode shows a considerable capacity fade (less than 100 mAh g–1 after 60 cycles). In addition, the reversible capacities of 525.16, 408.9, 364, 321, and 291 mAh g–1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 A g–1 are obtained for the SbVO4/G composites (d,e), which are significantly higher than those of pure SbVO4 nanoparticles. As the current returns to a low current density of 0.1 A g–1, the SbVO4/G composites still have a capacity of 467.7 mAh g–1, indicating preeminent reversibility. The high-rate cycling performance of the two samples was evaluated at 1 A g–1 (f). The SbVO4/G electrode delivers a discharge specific capacity of 283.9 mAh g–1 after 380 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g–1. By sharp comparison, the SbVO4 anode suffers from inferior stability and the capacity rapidly declines to 60 mAh g–1 after 30 cycles, indicating that the structure of pure SbVO4 nanoparticles is severely damaged during the cycle. EIS was tested to investigate the electrochemical kinetics of SbVO4/G composites and pure SbVO4 anodes for SIBs. The SbVO4/G electrode exhibits a lower Rct value than the pure SbVO4 nanoparticles (), suggesting that the hierarchical structure of SbVO4/G composites can offer more accessible active areas for charge transfer. \nThe phase evolutions of SbVO4/G at different discharge/charge states were revealed by ex situ XRD (a,b). Almost no obvious diffraction peaks were detected upon lithiation/delithiation, which may be due to the amorphous structure of Li2O wrapping the Li3Sb and V nanoparticles.  No peaks of Sb were detected in the SbVO4/G electrode surface during the discharging/charging process (c). This result may indicate that the Li2O and SEI films were formed in the outermost of the SbVO4/G electrode.  The possible reaction mechanism was further checked by HRTEM (d,e). At the full discharge stage, the amorphous area and lattice fringe of Li3Sb were observed in the SbVO4/G electrode (d). These results confirmed that SbVO4 transformed into Li3Sb and Li2O. During the delithiation process, SbVO4 can be reformed after being fully charged (e). The formation of the amorphous structure may result in the capacity increase of SbVO4/G in LIBs.  The morphology of SbVO4/G after 50 cycles in LIBs and SIBs was observed by SEM ( and f,g). The results showed that no cracking occurred both in LIBs and SIBs (). The initial morphology of the SbVO4/G composites is still maintained after 50 cycles (f,g). These results indicate that the SbVO4/G composite electrode material possesses excellent structure stability.\nCompared to the lithium storage of SbVO4/G, SbVO4/G possesses larger volume changes and more serious structural damages during the SbVO4 sodiation/desodiation reaction resulting from the slow electrochemical reaction kinetics and the unstable SEI layer caused by the larger ion radius of the Na ion compared to that of the Li ion.  Therefore, SbVO4/G displayed a more obvious capacity fade during the first several cycles in SIBs than in LIBs. However, the SbVO4/G anode exhibited superior long cycle life in SIBs than in LIBs. It is generally believed that the formed Li3Sb possesses a rock salt structure, which is different from Na3Sb with a hexagonal phase. The slight volume expansion in the hexagonal Na3Sb phase contributes to the stable cycling performance for sodium storage.  The cycling performance of SbVO4/G anodes is better than those of the lately reported LIB and SIB anodes (a,b).  The poor electrochemical properties of the pure SbVO4 electrodes stem from the agglomeration of nanoparticles, which results in insufficient space to relieve volume expansion, thus the structure of the SbVO4 material collapses during repeated cycles (c). Fortunately, in SbVO4/G composite electrodes, SbVO4 nanoparticles acting as an active material provide a high electrochemical activity, meanwhile, graphene contributes to the reversible transport of electrons/ions and maintains structural stability. Second, graphene effectively inhibits the self-agglomeration of SbVO4 nanoparticles, thus promoting SbVO4 particles to fully store Li+ or Na+ ions. Third, the small SbVO4 nanoparticles shorten the ion diffusion path, improving the reaction kinetics (d). Therefore, the SbVO4/G composite anodes exhibit more outstanding cycle performance and rate property than pure SbVO4 nanoparticles.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Typically, the suspension was obtained by dispersing the graphene oxide powder into deionized water with advanced ultrasonication. SbVO4/G composites were prepared by hydrothermal and subsequent freeze-drying. First, 0.234 g of the NH4VO3 powder was dissolved into 50 mL of deionized water with a water bath at 60 °C. Second, 0.456 g of the SbCl3 powder was added to that solution. Subsequently, 10 mL of the graphene suspension (2.5 mg mL–1) was dropped into the solution and stirred for 15 min. The mixed liquid was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. Finally, SbVO4/G composites were obtained by liquid nitrogen freeze-drying. As a comparison sample, a pure SbVO4 material was synthesized by the same process without the addition of the graphene suspension.\n\n Material Characterization\nThe structure of the materials was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, DMAX-2400, Cu Kα with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å, Japan). Raman spectroscopy was performed on an RFS100/S with a wavelength of 532 nm. The elemental composition and chemical valence were determined using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PHI-1600 ESCA, U.K.). The morphologies were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 600, Netherlands) with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector.\n\n Electrochemical Measurements\nThe working electrode was mixed with the active material Super P and the binder carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) according to a mass ratio of 7:2:1. The mass loading of the active substance was about 1–1.2 mg cm–2. The lithium metal served as the counter/reference electrode, 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1:1) was used as the electrolyte, and Celgard 2400 was used as a separator. LIBs were assembled using CR2025 coin cells. In addition, the electrochemical measurements of SIBs were performed on CR2032 coin cells. Na metal, 1 M NaClO4 in EC/DMC (1:1), and Whatman glass fiber were used as a reference electrode, electrolyte, and separator, respectively. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests were performed on a LAND CT2001A at 0.01–3.0 V. The scanning voltage ranges of cyclic voltammetry (CV) were tested on a CHI604E electrochemical workstation with the voltage ranging from 0.01 to 3.0 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at 105 to 0.01 Hz. The EIS experiments for LIBs and SIBs were performed at the open-circuit voltage, and the bias potential was set as 0.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Typically, the suspension was obtained by dispersing the graphene oxide powder into deionized water with advanced ultrasonication. SbVO4/G composites were prepared by hydrothermal and subsequent freeze-drying. First, 0.234 g of the NH4VO3 powder was dissolved into 50 mL of deionized water with a water bath at 60 °C. Second, 0.456 g of the SbCl3 powder was added to that solution. Subsequently, 10 mL of the graphene suspension (2.5 mg mL–1) was dropped into the solution and stirred for 15 min. The mixed liquid was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. Finally, SbVO4/G composites were obtained by liquid nitrogen freeze-drying. As a comparison sample, a pure SbVO4 material was synthesized by the same process without the addition of the graphene suspension.\n\n Material Characterization\nThe structure of the materials was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, DMAX-2400, Cu Kα with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å, Japan). Raman spectroscopy was performed on an RFS100/S with a wavelength of 532 nm. The elemental composition and chemical valence were determined using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PHI-1600 ESCA, U.K.). The morphologies were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 600, Netherlands) with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector.\n\n Electrochemical Measurements\nThe working electrode was mixed with the active material Super P and the binder carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) according to a mass ratio of 7:2:1. The mass loading of the active substance was about 1–1.2 mg cm–2. The lithium metal served as the counter/reference electrode, 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1:1) was used as the electrolyte, and Celgard 2400 was used as a separator. LIBs were assembled using CR2025 coin cells. In addition, the electrochemical measurements of SIBs were performed on CR2032 coin cells. Na metal, 1 M NaClO4 in EC/DMC (1:1), and Whatman glass fiber were used as a reference electrode, electrolyte, and separator, respectively. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests were performed on a LAND CT2001A at 0.01–3.0 V. The scanning voltage ranges of cyclic voltammetry (CV) were tested on a CHI604E electrochemical workstation with the voltage ranging from 0.01 to 3.0 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at 105 to 0.01 Hz. The EIS experiments for LIBs and SIBs were performed at the open-circuit voltage, and the bias potential was set as 0.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and Discussion\nTo explore the performance of ether electrolytes with NaPF6 and NaBF4 when applied in high-potential cathodes, NFM cathode with a high operation potential (4.2 V vs Na+/Na) was selected. As shown in a, the NFM//Na cell with the NaPF6 G4-based electrolyte (PG) exhibits poor cycling performance and low Coulombic efficiencies. After 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the specific capacity of PG decreases from 149.7 to 58.9 mAh g–1, and the average Coulombic efficiency is as low as 96.15%. From our previous study, the low-efficiency phenomenon of PG was attributed to the “redox shuttle” effect of ether electrolytes between cathodes and low-potential anodes, which would lead to the rapid deterioration of batteries.  However, when NaPF6 is replaced by NaBF4 (BG), the cycling performance and efficiencies were promoted obviously, and the capacity could remain 83.0 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles. Interestingly, when a small amount of NaBF4 (0.1 M) was mixed with NaPF6 (0.9 M) in G4 to obtain PB91, the cycling performance and efficiencies could be improved significantly as BG, which implies that a small amount of NaBF4 could induce more stable SEI layers. The cycling performance at 1 C also shows the same result (). The first charge and discharge profiles of NFM//Na cells with three electrolytes (b) display that PG shows an obvious side reaction platform corresponding to the shuttle effect at ∼3.5 V, which leads to a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 71.2%. However, BG and PB91 do not show the side reaction platform; thus, the ICEs are improved remarkably to 83.9% and 87.0%, respectively. This result further indicates that NaBF4 could suppress the side reaction of PG. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were also conducted to explore the difference of PG, BG, and PB91 electrolytes (). The initial CV curves of NFM//Na further manifest that BG and PB91 could inhibit the side reactions of ether electrolytes (c). Due to the structural instability of NFM materials, Na3V2(PO4)3 materials with a far more stable structure than NFM were also applied to assess the effect of PG and PB91 (). The Na3V2(PO4)3//Na cell with PG electrolytes fails at 319 cycles, and the battery shows low cycling efficiency, which is also attributed to the ‘redox shuttle’ effect. However, Na3V2(PO4)3//Na in PB91 could stably run 1700 cycles with high efficiencies and maintain a capacity retention rate as high as 84.52%. These results further indicate that NaBF4 as an ancillary salt (PB91) can significantly improve the efficiencies and significantly prolong the cycle life. In addition, the obtained ionic conductivities of PG, BG, and PB91 are 2.187, 1.277, and 2.124 mS cm–1, respectively, which further indicate that NaBF4 as an ancillary salt (PB91) can not only stabilize the cells but also maintain a higher ionic conductivity as PG.\nTo further explore the performance of these three electrolytes in full cells, NFM//HC full cells with PG, BG, and PB91 were assembled. As shown in d, BG and PB91 still display enhanced cycle stability and higher Coulombic efficiencies as compared to PG in NFM//HC full cells, and this phenomenon is consistent with that in NFM//Na half-cells. In order to uncover the mechanism of NaBF4 on NFM//HC full cells, electrochemical impedance tests were conducted (e). It could be seen that the impedance of NFM cathodes cycled 100 times is much larger than that of HC anodes in the three electrolytes, indicating that the kinetics of NFM electrodes is much slower than that of HC electrodes in the full cells. BG and PB91 show higher resistance on HC electrodes than PG, which is attributed to the larger SEI film impedance formed by BF4– in BG and PB91. In , the three electrolytes show the same performance in HC//Na cells (0.01–2.0 V), and almost no capacity fading occurs after 100 cycles, which is attributed to the extremely stable structure of HC electrodes. In addition, because the failure of ether electrolytes caused by “redox shuttle” does not occur in the range of 0.01–2.0 V, the three electrolytes show high stability in HC//Na cells. To further analyze the impedance difference of NFM electrodes with the three electrolytes, the fitting results are displayed in f, and the equivalent circuit used for EIS fitting is displayed in . It was found that the CEI impedance (RCEI) of BG (381 Ω) was significantly larger than that of PG (257 Ω), while the charge-transfer impedance (Rct) is significantly smaller than that of PG, indicating that BG will induce a CEI layer with a larger impedance on NFM electrodes, and the CEI layer can effectively inhibit the increase of Rct. It is worth noting that RSEI of PB91 is similar to that of PG, but Rct is significantly smaller than that of PG, which suggests that a small amount of NaBF4 can not only obviously suppress the increase of Rct but also maintain a lower RSEI value.\nFurthermore, self-discharge measurement ( and a–c) and chronoamperometry tests (d) were conducted to explore the stability of CEI and SEI layers derived from PG, BG, and PB91. As shown in , NFM//HC cells were cycled at 0.2 C with different pause times in fully charged state, and PG shows a much larger voltage drop than BG and PB91 during every pause process, which leads to a much significant capacity loss of PG than that of BG and PB91 (b). A more visual comparison of capacity loss ratio is displayed in c; after a 100 h pause, the capacity loss ratio of PG is as high as 64.5%, which is much higher than that of BG (13.4%) and PB91 (13.5%). These results indicate that BG and PB91 could induce more stable CEI and SEI layers, inhibiting the serious capacity loss of self-discharge. Chronoamperometry test is another effective approach to reflect the stability of CEI and SEI layers. In our previous study, it had been proved that the current at the stable state of chronoamperometry tests mainly comes from the redox shuttle effect of ether electrolytes, which to some extent reflects the rate of the side reaction.  As shown in d, when NFM//HC full cells were held at 4.0 V, the current density of BG and PB91 is much smaller than that of PG, implying that the CEI and SEI layers derived from BG and PB91 are more stable, and they can reduce the side reactions occurring in NFM//HC full cells. Transition-metals (Mn, Fe, and Ni) deposited on the cycled HC anodes (obtained from NFM//HC full cells) were tested by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometry (e) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) technique (). It could be found that the atom percent of transition metals (Mn, Fe, and Ni) in BG and PB91 is remarkably smaller than that of PG, which further declares that BG and PB91 could promote the formation of more stable CEI layers on NFM cathodes and inhibit the dissolution of transition metals.\nThe properties of SEI and CEI layers have a crucial influence on the battery performance.  Thus, SEM, XPS, EDS, and solubility test were further carried out to study the effect of NaBF4 on the morphology, structure, composition, and solubility of CEI layers on the NFM () and SEI layers on HC electrodes (). As shown in a and , the NFM electrode cycled 20 times in PG is visually covered by a thick layer of byproducts, which makes the boundary of NFM particles blurred. However, the surface of NFM electrodes cycled in BG and PB91 shows no obvious difference from pristine NFM electrodes. These results suggest that BG and PB91 could induce more stable CEI layers on NFM cathodes to suppress the serious decomposition of electrolytes, and the CEI layers derived from BG and PB91 are much thinner than PG.\nTo explore the effect of NaBF4 on the composition of CEI layers covered on the NFM cathode, XPS measurements were conducted (b–d and ). The C–C/C–H (284.8 eV), C–O (286.7 eV) peaks in C 1s spectrum and O–C (532.3 eV) in O 1s spectrum are mainly derived from some organic species such as RCH2ONa, Na2[(OCH2CH2O)n], and so forth.  O–C═O (CO3) (289.3 eV) in the C 1s spectrum and O═C/Na–O (531.1 eV) in the O 1s spectrum are mainly derived from some inorganic species such as Na2CO3, and so forth.  The Na–F (684.1 eV) peak in the F 1s spectrum can be ascribed to NaF. The B 1s spectrum is almost overlapped with the P 2s spectrum;  the NaxBOyFz or NaxPOyFz peak (687.2 eV) in the F 1s spectrum and B–F or P–F (198.8 eV), NaxBOyFz, or NaxPOyFz (194.9 eV) peaks in the B 1s or P 2s spectrum mainly stem from some incomplete decomposition products of NaPF6 and NaBF4. \nIt could be found that C–F peaks coming from PVDF in the C 1s and F 1s spectra disappear after cycling 20 times in PG, BG, and PB91, indicating the formation of CEI layers on NFM electrodes (b,c). The C–C peaks in the pristine NFM sample stem from carbon black (Super P), but the NFM electrode cycled in PG shows a much weaker C–C peak than that in BG and PB91, suggesting that the CEI layers induced by PG are much thicker than that by BG and PB91 (b). The same conclusion could be drawn by the content of Ni element obtained from the surface of cycled NFM electrodes (f and ); a thicker CEI layer derived from PG would mask the signal of Ni element from the NFM material, thus leading to a lower Ni atomic ratio. From the B 1s/P 2s spectrum (d), it could be observed that a strong NaxPOyFz peak is induced by PG, which means serious decomposition of NaPF6. In the BG electrolyte, an obvious NaxBOyFz peak induced by the decomposition of NaBF4 could also be observed. However, the NaxPOyFz/NaxBOyFz peak in PB91 almost disappeared, which is because the content of NaxBOyFz decomposed from 0.1 M NaBF4 in PB91 is greatly reduced than BG, and the small amount of NaxBOyFz could inhibit the decomposition of NaPF6 to NaxPOyFz. This result indicates that a small amount of NaBF4 would inhibit the large amount of decomposition of NaPF6. It is worth noting that the C–O peaks largely reflect the content of organic species in the CEI layers, while the O–C═O (CO3) and Na–F peaks largely represent the content of inorganic species in the CEI layers.  To clearly show the content difference between organic (C–O peak) and inorganic species (O–C═O (CO3) and Na–F peaks) in the CEI layers, the peak area ratio of organic and inorganic species is displayed in e. BG and PB91 exhibit lower organic contents but higher inorganic contents when compared to PG, indicating that NaBF4 could induce a CEI layer with more inorganic species. In addition, the solubility test of CEI on cathodes is shown in , and the capacity loss caused by the solubility of CEI layers in PG is much larger than that in BG and PB91, which suggests that CEI layers derived from BG and PB91 are more difficult to dissolve than that from PG.  Based on the analysis of , ether electrolytes with NaBF4 as the main salt or an ancillary salt could form a more stable CEI layer that is thin, rich in inorganic species, and difficult to dissolve.\nFurthermore, the characterization of SEI layers on HC anodes is also carried out (). After being cycled 20 times in NFM//HC cells, the surface of HC anodes in PG is also covered by large amounts of byproducts, but this phenomenon does not appear in BG and PB91, which explains that the SEI layer in PG is much thicker than that in BG and PB91 (a). The HRTEM tests displayed in  also show that the SEI layer induced by PG is thicker than that by BG and PB91. As shown in b, the C–O peak that mainly originated from the decomposition of the solvent in PG is much higher than that in BG and PB91, indicating that the addition of NaBF4 could suppress the decomposition of the solvent. The high NaxBOyFz peaks of BG and PB91 in F 1s and B 1s spectra declare that NaBF4 would be reduced to some NaxBOyFz species, which may be the key to stabilize the SEI layers (c,d). In addition, the ratio of inorganic (O–C═O (CO3) and Na–F peaks) and organic species (C–O peak) was roughly calculated and displayed in e. BG and PB91 show a lower ratio of organics and a higher ratio of inorganics, also manifesting that NaBF4 could suppress the decomposition of the solvent into some organic species. Moreover, the solubility tests of SEI layers on the anodes declare that the capacity loss attributed to the SEI layer dissolution in PG is much higher than that in BG and PB91 (f,g).  Combining all the above conclusions in , the SEI layer with much NaxBOyFz species induced by NaBF4 is rich in inorganics, which could inhibit the continuous decomposition of the solvent and the solubility of SEI layers.\nMoreover, the solvation structure of Na+ in electrolytes would significantly affect the composition and structure of SEI and CEI layers.  Here, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were further conducted to investigate the effect of BF4– on the solvation structure in . The coordination number of Na–O (G4) and Na–F (PF6–) is 4.89 and 1.74 in the first solvation sheath of PG (d), but the coordination number of Na–O (G4) decreases to 3.66 and that of Na–F (BF4–) increases to 2.94 in BG (e), indicating that BF4– could decrease the coordination of G4 and Na+. The optimized Na+ solvation structure in g also displays the same result that fewer O (G4) in BG is coordinated with Na+ than PG. The obtained Na+ solvation free energies in PG, BG, and PB91 are −145.47, −149.6, and −149.25 kcal mol–1, which indicate that the interaction of Na+-BF4– is stronger than that of Na+-PF6–, and Na+ in BG and PB91 is more difficult to be desolvated than in PG (h). These results indicate that the stronger interaction between BF4– and Na+ could decrease the coordination of G4 and Na+, which could increase the decomposition of anion but decrease the decomposition of G4 on the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. This is why BG and PB91 could induce an SEI/CEI rich in inorganic species, as shown in the result of XPS tests ( and ).\nThe 23Na NMR spectrum of PG, BG, and PB91 electrolytes was analyzed to further verify the effect of NaBF4 on Na+ solvation (a). It can be seen from a that all three electrolytes have only one peak, indicating that there is only one chemical environment for sodium ions in the homogeneous solution in the three electrolytes. The chemical shifts of PG, BG, and PB91 samples are −2.83, −4.09, and −3.76 ppm, respectively, implying that the electron cloud density around Na+ is PG < PB91 < BG.  This result suggests that the addition of BF4– will increase the electron cloud density around Na+, which is related to the stronger interaction between BF4– and Na+. The larger polarization of BG and PB91 between the reduction and oxidation peaks also indicates the slower kinetics of BG and PB91 (c). Then, Na3V2(PO4)3 with a potential platform at ∼1.7 V (vs Na+/Na) was selected to eliminate the interference of SEI layers, and rate capability test was carried out. In b, the rate capacity of BG is lower than that of PG when the rate is larger than 1 C, which is attributed to the slower desolvation process. The slower desolvation process is caused by the stronger interaction between BF4– and Na+, which is consistent with the result of solvation free energy (h). More importantly, the stronger interaction between BF4– and Na+ could reduce the solvation of Na+ with the solvent, which is the key factor for the formation of CEI and SEI layers rich in inorganic species.\nThe gas evolution of NFM//HC cells with three electrolytes is displayed in c–e. H2 is found to release when NFM//HC starts charging in three electrolytes, which is attributed to the electrochemical reduction of trace water (HF or ROH) in electrolytes (H2O/ROH/HF + e– → OH–/RO–/F– + 1/2 H2↑).  A smaller H2 evolution rate in BG and PB91 than that in PG could be found, which is because more stable SEI films on HC derived from BG and PB91 could inhibit the reduction of H2O (HF or ROH). It is worth noting that PG begins producing a large amount of CH4 and C2H4 at 3.95 V, which is proved to be derived from the redox shuttle effect of PG in our previous published work.  However, the gassing rate of CH4 and C2H4 in BG and PB91 is reduced greatly, further implying that the stable CEI and SEI layers induced by NaBF4 on NFM cathodes and HC anodes could suppress the gas evolution of NFM//HC cells.\nBased on all of the above analyses, the scheme of solvation structures and electrode/electrolyte interfaces in PG and BG electrolytes is constructed and displayed in . BF4– shows the stronger interaction with Na+ than PF6–, and the stronger interaction between BF4– and Na+ could reduce the solvation of Na+ with the solvent, thus inducing the formation of CEI and SEI layers rich in inorganic species. Moreover, the CEI and SEI layers with many inorganic species induced by BG are thinner and more stable, which could inhibit the continuous decomposition of solvent and the solubility of SEI layers.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Chemicals and Materials\nNaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) was purchased from Guangdong Greenway Technology Co., Ltd. Hard carbon (HC) material was purchased from KAIJIN New Energy Co., Ltd., China. Sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) was purchased from Do-fluoride Chemicals Co., Ltd., China; sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4) was purchased from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. (Adamas-beta); and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4) was purchased from Duoduo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China.\n\n2.2.  Electrode and Electrolyte Preparation\nTo prepare NFM electrodes, NFM material, carbon black (super P), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) at a weight ratio of 95:3.5:1.5 were mixed with an appropriate amount of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. HC electrodes were prepared by mixing HC material, Super P, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR) at a weight ratio of 95:1:1.5:2.5; then, an appropriate amount of H2O was added and stirred to obtain a homogeneous slurry. Then, the slurry was cast onto an Al foil and dried at 90 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h, and the material was cut into disks with diameters of 12 mm.\nThe electrolytes were prepared by dissolving 1 M (mol L–1) NaPF6/NaBF4 or 0.9 M NaPF6 + 0.1 M NaBF4 into G4 to obtain 1 M NaPF6 in G4 electrolyte (PG), 1 M NaBF4 in G4 electrolyte (BG), and 0.9 M NaPF6 + 0.1 M NaBF4 in G4 electrolyte (PB91). All electrolytes were prepared in a glovebox, with the moisture and oxygen contents below 0.1 ppm. Coin cells (CR2032) were assembled in a glovebox, and GF/A glass filters impregnated with 80 μL of electrolyte were applied as separators.\n\n2.3.  Electrode and Electrolyte Characterization\nThe surface morphology and element content determination of NFM and HC electrodes were explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, EOL, JSM-5612LV) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy technique (EDS). The content of traditional metal element was determined by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP, PerkinElmer, Avio 500). The elemental composition of CEI and SEI layers with Al Kα radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV) was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi). A differential electrochemical mass spectrometer (DEMS, HPR-40, Hiden) with high-purity He (99.999%) as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.75 mL min–1 was used to explore the gas evolution of NFM//HC full cells. All electrodes obtained from cycled cells were washed with the DME solvent before the characterization of SEM and XPS. A liquid nuclear magnetic resonance instrument (NMR) (Bruker AVANCE NEO 400M) was used to obtain the 23Na NMR spectrum. The solubility of CEI and SEI layers was calculated by the capacity loss of Al//Na and Cu//Na cells with different pause times.  The ionic conductivity was tested by a conductivity meter (METTLER S230) at 25 °C.\n\n2.4.  Electrochemical Measurement\nGalvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted by a Neware battery test system. The rate of 1 C corresponds to 120 mA g–1 for NFM electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed by an electrochemical workstation (Admiral, 2245w). Chronoamperometry tests were conducted after the NFM//HC full cells were charged to 4.0 V at 0.2 C, and then the batteries were held at 4.0 V for 5 h. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in a frequency range from 500 kHz to 10 mHz.\n\n2.5.  Calculation Methods\nThe molecular dynamics simulations were conducted in the Forcite module by Materials Studio of Accelrys Inc., and all the dynamics simulations used the COMPASS II force field. The PG electrolyte model box contains 50 NaPF6 and 227 G4, the BG model contains 50 NaBF4 and 227 G4, and the PB91 electrolyte model contains 45 NaPF6, 5 NaBF4, and 227 G4. First, all electrolyte systems were initially equilibrated at 600–300 K in the NVT ensemble for 10 cycles to obtain the optimized structure with the lowest energy. Then, the electrolytes were equilibrated in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble (constant NPT) using the Berendsen barostat to maintain a pressure of 0.0001 GPa for 300 ps. The products were obtained by the canonical ensemble (NVT) running 500 ps at 298 K. Finally, dynamic simulation of the optimized model was conducted to obtain the radial distribution function (g(r)) and coordination number distribution (n(r)). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was applied to calculate the solvation free energies.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Then, the slurry was cast onto an Al foil and dried at 90 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h, and the material was cut into disks with diameters of 12 mm.\nThe electrolytes were prepared by dissolving 1 M (mol L–1) NaPF6/NaBF4 or 0.9 M NaPF6 + 0.1 M NaBF4 into G4 to obtain 1 M NaPF6 in G4 electrolyte (PG), 1 M NaBF4 in G4 electrolyte (BG), and 0.9 M NaPF6 + 0.1 M NaBF4 in G4 electrolyte (PB91). All electrolytes were prepared in a glovebox, with the moisture and oxygen contents below 0.1 ppm. Coin cells (CR2032) were assembled in a glovebox, and GF/A glass filters impregnated with 80 μL of electrolyte were applied as separators.\n\n2.3.  Electrode and Electrolyte Characterization\nThe surface morphology and element content determination of NFM and HC electrodes were explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, EOL, JSM-5612LV) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy technique (EDS). The content of traditional metal element was determined by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP, PerkinElmer, Avio 500). The elemental composition of CEI and SEI layers with Al Kα radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV) was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi). A differential electrochemical mass spectrometer (DEMS, HPR-40, Hiden) with high-purity He (99.999%) as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.75 mL min–1 was used to explore the gas evolution of NFM//HC full cells. All electrodes obtained from cycled cells were washed with the DME solvent before the characterization of SEM and XPS. A liquid nuclear magnetic resonance instrument (NMR) (Bruker AVANCE NEO 400M) was used to obtain the 23Na NMR spectrum. The solubility of CEI and SEI layers was calculated by the capacity loss of Al//Na and Cu//Na cells with different pause times.  The ionic conductivity was tested by a conductivity meter (METTLER S230) at 25 °C.\n\n2.4.  Electrochemical Measurement\nGalvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted by a Neware battery test system. The rate of 1 C corresponds to 120 mA g–1 for NFM electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed by an electrochemical workstation (Admiral, 2245w). Chronoamperometry tests were conducted after the NFM//HC full cells were charged to 4.0 V at 0.2 C, and then the batteries were held at 4.0 V for 5 h. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in a frequency range from 500 kHz to 10 mHz.\n\n2.5.  Calculation Methods\nThe molecular dynamics simulations were conducted in the Forcite module by Materials Studio of Accelrys Inc., and all the dynamics simulations used the COMPASS II force field. The PG electrolyte model box contains 50 NaPF6 and 227 G4, the BG model contains 50 NaBF4 and 227 G4, and the PB91 electrolyte model contains 45 NaPF6, 5 NaBF4, and 227 G4. First, all electrolyte systems were initially equilibrated at 600–300 K in the NVT ensemble for 10 cycles to obtain the optimized structure with the lowest energy. Then, the electrolytes were equilibrated in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble (constant NPT) using the Berendsen barostat to maintain a pressure of 0.0001 GPa for 300 ps. The products were obtained by the canonical ensemble (NVT) running 500 ps at 298 K. Finally, dynamic simulation of the optimized model was conducted to obtain the radial distribution function (g(r)) and coordination number distribution (n(r)). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was applied to calculate the solvation free energies.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The solubility of CEI and SEI layers was calculated by the capacity loss of Al//Na and Cu//Na cells with different pause times.  The ionic conductivity was tested by a conductivity meter (METTLER S230) at 25 °C.\n\n2.4.  Electrochemical Measurement\nGalvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted by a Neware battery test system. The rate of 1 C corresponds to 120 mA g–1 for NFM electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed by an electrochemical workstation (Admiral, 2245w). Chronoamperometry tests were conducted after the NFM//HC full cells were charged to 4.0 V at 0.2 C, and then the batteries were held at 4.0 V for 5 h. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in a frequency range from 500 kHz to 10 mHz.\n\n2.5.  Calculation Methods\nThe molecular dynamics simulations were conducted in the Forcite module by Materials Studio of Accelrys Inc., and all the dynamics simulations used the COMPASS II force field. The PG electrolyte model box contains 50 NaPF6 and 227 G4, the BG model contains 50 NaBF4 and 227 G4, and the PB91 electrolyte model contains 45 NaPF6, 5 NaBF4, and 227 G4. First, all electrolyte systems were initially equilibrated at 600–300 K in the NVT ensemble for 10 cycles to obtain the optimized structure with the lowest energy. Then, the electrolytes were equilibrated in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble (constant NPT) using the Berendsen barostat to maintain a pressure of 0.0001 GPa for 300 ps. The products were obtained by the canonical ensemble (NVT) running 500 ps at 298 K. Finally, dynamic simulation of the optimized model was conducted to obtain the radial distribution function (g(r)) and coordination number distribution (n(r)). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was applied to calculate the solvation free energies.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The almost identical peak centers of B-TO and W-TO at 25.28°, 37.80°, 48.05°, 53.89°, 55.06°, and 62.69° were clearly observed, corresponding to (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 0 1), and (2 0 4) crystal faces of tetragonal anatase TiO2 indexed to the JCPDS card 21–1272 with a space group of I41/amd. After Rietveld refinement, the lattice parameters of the tetragonal anatase phase were a = b = 3.7867 Å and c = 9.4938 Å for W-TO (Rwp= 11.3% Rp = 8.29%), and a = b = 3. 7908 Å and c = 9.5108 Å for B-TO (Rwp= 14.2% Rp = 6.73%). The slightly greater lattice parameters along the a- and c- axes of B-TO were probably associated with the partial formation of Ti3+ in its lattice, considering the larger ionic radius of Ti3+ than that of Ti4+ (Ti3+: 0.56 Å, Ti4+: 0.48 Å).  It was found that after TiO2 was reduced by NaBH4 at 350 °C, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of B-TO was a bit weaker than those of W-TO, revealing that the crystallinity was slightly decreased during the strong reduction procedure, although the crystal phase remained mostly unchanged. Besides, the broader full width at half-maximum (fwhm) suggested that the crystallite was smaller for B-TO. Utilizing the Scherrer formula (L = kλ/βcos θ, β is the peak width of the diffraction peak profile at half-maximum height resulting from small crystallite size in radians, k is a constant related to crystallite shape normally used as 0.9) with the broadening of the (1 0 1) peaks, the crystal sizes along the [101] direction for W-TO and B-TO were calculated to be 22.5 and 18.7 nm, respectively. Additionally, no other peaks resulting from the presence of impurities were noticed in the B-TO spectrum, indicating that the possible borides were fully removed after acid-washing and the pure anatase TiO2 obtained. Alongside the XRD patterns, the corresponding visual photographs of TiO2 powders were displayed, where the B-TO showed a totally black color, and the air-annealed TiO2 was purely white.\nStructural properties of B-TO and W-TO were further analyzed by Raman scattering, as displayed in b. Both samples exhibited typical bands of anatase TiO2, while more broadened peaks were observed for B-TO, which was in accordance with the literature about black TiO2.  Also note that the main Raman active mode of W-TO at around 145.2 cm–1 (Eg) shifted toward higher wavenumbers after the introduction of OVs (B-TO: 149.7 cm–1). It has been reported that the blue-shift and broadening of the Eg mode could be caused by the finite size of grains (<10 nm) or the decreasing of correlation length resulting from localized defects like OVs.  Because the crystalline sizes of the samples were no less than 18 nm, the presence of OVs should be the main reason for the blue-shift and broadening of the Raman peak.\nThe morphologies of B-TO and W-TO were shown in . Both of the samples were composed of numbers of nanoparticles according to the SEM images (a,b). The TEM images of W-TO in c clearly depicted that the diameters of the solid nanoparticles with smooth surfaces were around 30 nm. For comparison, in the same resolution TEM of B-TO in d, there were no obvious changes in the size of particles between B-TO and W-TO, while the slight irregularity of the particle shape, as well as the roughness and looseness of surfaces, were found for B-TO, which might be more facilitated for sodium diffusion. According to the N2 absorption and desorption isotherms in , the specific surface area of B-TO was calculated to be 106.1 m2 g–1, high than that of W-TO (80.72 m2 g–1), which could be ascribed to its more rough and loose surface structure. As demonstrated in the HRTEM image of a single particle in e,f, lattice fringes of approximately 0.35 nm for both samples were indexed to the (101) lattice plane of anatase. Notably, an obvious disordered surface layer could be observed coating on the crystalline core of B-TO, which was also found on black TiO2 nanoparticles in some literature  and might be a reconstructed layer with oxygen vacancies consisting of a disordered Ti2O3 shell and a transition region of connection according to the very recent report by Tian et al.,  which was produced in the NaBH4 reduction process.\nTo analyze the surface chemical composition of the B-TO and W-TO, we performed XPS as exhibited in . The survey scan of XPS (a) showed typical TiO2 spectra, and no other peaks were seen except for Ti, O, and C, eliminating the existence of impurities and doping by alien elements, which was also verified in the EDX spectrum (). The detailed information on the chemical state of titanium ion of B-TO was clarified by the Ti 2p core level XPS spectra in b, where two major peaks at 458.7 and 464.5 eV were attributed to the typical Ti4+ 2p 3/2 and Ti4+ 2p1/2 peaks, and two shoulder peaks at 456.9 and 462.3 eV should be ascribed to Ti3+ 2p 3/2 and Ti3+ 2p1/2, demonstrating the containing of Ti3+ at B-TO, which accorded well with the previous literature  and could account for the existence of disordered layer on B-TO nanoparticles observed in the HRTEM pattern. Meanwhile, a semiquantitative analysis of the chemical state of B-TO was performed in terms of Ti 2p XPS spectra, and the Ti3+ molar proportion of of ∼15% was obtained. In contrast, the Ti 2p XPS spectra of W-TO in c only showed two characterized Ti4+ 2p 3/2 and Ti4+ 2p1/2 peaks at 458.8 and 464.5 eV, respectively. In the O 1s XPS spectra for both samples (d), the broad peak could be resolved into two peaks centered at 530.1 and 532.1 eV, attributed to Ti–O and surface −OH bondings, separately.  By comparison, the proportion of the latter peak of B-TO was relatively higher than that of W-TO, resulting from more oxygen-defective sites that tended to bind with hydrogen atoms and formed more hydroxyl surface groups. \nESR spectroscopy was carried out to detect the circumstances of unemployed electrons in the TiO2 molecules of the two samples and was displayed in . No ESR peak was found in W-TO spectrum, while B-TO could present two strong signals. The one at g = 2.001 was attributed to the oxygen vacancies in the bulk TiO2 that could form the Ti3+ paramagnetic center and trap the electrons, and the other signal at g = 1.946 was corresponding to the surface Ti3+ ions,  which was in good agreement with the outcome of the Ti 2p XPS. In consequence, the ESR analyzation confirmed that the oxygen vacancies induced Ti3+ ions were not only located on the surface but also in the lattice of the bulk of B-TO.\n\n3.2 Electrochemical Properties for Sodium Storage\nThe galvanostatic charge–discharge capabilities for B-TO and W-TO were obtained at a constant current density of 0.2 C (equal to 33.6 mA g–1) for 200 cycles and were compared as shown in a. Distinct differences between the two samples were clearly observed in the cycles of preliminary section. A large discharge specific capacity of 444.2 mAh g–1 was yielded by B-TO in the initial cycle, and the corresponding charge specific capacity was 178.9 mAh g–1, which were much higher than those of W-TO, whose initial discharge and charge capacities were 262.4 and 111.9 mAh g–1, respectively. During the subsequent cycles, the capabilities of the both samples exhibited an increase trendency, while the rising range and duration notably varied. For B-TO, the charge capacity climbed up to 205.7 mAh g–1 in the 15th cycle with a growth rate of 13.9% and was kept steady in the following cycles, retaining 205.5 mAh g–1 after 200 cycles, which was a comparable capacity value with excellent cycling retention to the reported anatase TiO2 anode for SIBs.  With regard to W-TO, it crept up by 67.9% in the 85th cycle until a charge capacity plateau of 187.9 mAh g–1 was reached, which maintained stable afterward, and the preserved capacity was 184.4 mAh g–1 in the 200th cycle. That phenomenon above was termed as an electrochemical activation process of nanosized anatase TiO2 anode material for sodium ion batteries; that is, the reversible sodium insertion was kinetically hindered and needed repeated charging–discharging to functionalize the inner part of anatase, which was also reported in some previous literature.  According to Yang et al.,  an amount of trivalent titanium ions were detected at the fully activated anatase, which meant that sodium ions were irreversibly trapped into the anatase lattice, and the Ti3+ emerged correspondingly during the activation process. Therefore, the activation process of sodium storage might be triggered by an increased conductivity derived from the irreversibly generated Ti3+, which could also refer to the case of lithium.  That might be the key reason for the enhanced sodium storage initially and lessened duration of activation, which was the notable self-activated properties for B-WO containing Ti3+ in the surfaces and lattices itself. b displayed the Coulombic efficiencies of the two samples during the 0.2 C discharge–charge cycles. The initial cycle Coulombic efficiencies were 40.3% and 42.6% for B-TO and W-TO, respectively, which were typical values of natase TiO2 together with its composite materials.  Such a low Coulombic efficiency was primarily caused by the irreversible sodiation initially along with partial decomposition of TiO2,  and the formation of SEI film as well as some side reactions with the electrolytes.  The efficiency of B-TO rose significantly to 95.1% in the sixth cycle and then reached up to 99.5% in the 30th cycle and sustained over that value throughout the following cycles. As to W-TO, it took 10 loops to ascend to 95.2% and 70 cycles to 99.1%, and kept around that value subsequently. In comparison, B-TO required fewer loops to elevate the efficiency and exhibited a higher value during further cycling, revealing a superior reversibility in sodium storage.\nThe voltage profiles of B-TO and W-TO in different cycles at 0.2 C were displayed in c,d, which present the typical electrochemical characteristics of anatase. The first discharge curve could be divided into three regions () referring to the previous reports.  In region A, the voltage dropped rapidly from the open-circuit voltage to 1.5 V (B-TO) or 1.0 V (W-TO), mainly relevant to a pseudocapacitive sodium-ion adsorption. A slower trend of decrease in voltage was observed when further discharged to 0.3 V (Region B), where the main uptake of amounts of sodium ions happened. As suggested by Wu et al.,  partial and irreversible decomposition of TiO2 and reduction of Ti4+ to metallic titanium to form a sodium titanate phase happened in the initial sodiation of anatase, which will no longer participate in the electrochemical redox. During the following discharge–charge process, the reversible (de)insertion into and out of the anatase host structure occurred mostly in the voltage range of 0.8 to 0.01 V, based on the Ti4+/3+ redox couple.  In the 20th cycle profile, the voltage plateau around 0.8 V was better-defined of B-TO than that in the third cycle, while it was still ambiguous in W-TO, which was ascribed to different activation behavior of the two samples as has analyzed above. Moreover, the curves of the 20th, 100th, and 200th profiles of B-TO almost overlapped, indicating stable electrochemical performances during the continuous charge–discharge process.\nThe electrochemical behavior of the samples as anode for sodium-ion batteries was investigated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1, and the initial three cycles profiles of B-TO and W-TO were depicted in  a,b, respectively. In the first cathodic sweep, the broad peak at approximately 1.2 V (Peak C) was associated with the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and the decomposition of electrolyte impurities and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive as well as other organic material,  which was typically irreversible. Besides, the causes of the rather broad peak at around 0.5 V were still not completely clarified, yet considering the sodiation peaks emerged in the following two cyclic scans at about 0.69 V (B-TO) or 0.65 V (W-TO), marked as Peak A, that peak did not vanish but shifted to the higher potentials, probably resulted from a decreased overpotential for the reversible sodium-ion storage.  For the anodic sweeps, both B-TO and W-TO exhibited a oxidative peak at around 0.83 V (Peak B) referring to the typical desodiation of anatase TiO2,  which was successively pronounced during the subsequent cycles, and manifesting there was an activation process in sodiation–desodiation, in agreement with the initial increase in the capacities in a. Moreover, it should be noted that the peak current intensity of B-TO was relatively larger than that of W-TO, indicating a preferable sodium storage behavior for B-TO in the initial numbers of cycles. For the sake of investigating electrochemical process after cycling, CV tests with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 were performed after 200 cycles at 0.2 C as presented in c, where the couple of redox peaks were better-shaped and became stronger compared with the original curves, which should be assigned to the electrochemical redox of Ti4+/Ti3+ and also testified that the sodiation was enhanced after accomplished activation. By comparison, the peaks of B-TO were stronger and better shaped not only in the initial CV curves (a,b) but also after cycling, demonstrating that a more favorable sodium insertion could be enabled into the host structure of B-TO. Notably, higher sodiation voltage as well as lower desodiation voltage were observed for B-TO, and accordingly, the deviation between the anodic and cathodic peak of B-TO (ΔV = 0.14 V) was smaller than that of W-TO (ΔV = 0.27 V), suggesting a more feasible Na+ insertion–extraction was likely due to the improved kinetics  and a better reversibility of B-TO in cycling, which could also be confirmed by the Coulombic efficiency records in b.\nTo further evaluate the long cycling stability at a higher rate, we discharged and charged those two samples at a constant rate of 1 C over 500 cycles, as presented in a. The activation proceeded more slowly compared with the cycling at 0.2 C, and likewise, W-TO took more cycles to be completely activated than B-TO. For W-TO, the charge capacity climbed from 104.4 to 145.5 mAh g–1 in the initial 150 cycles, and a capacity of 134.3 mAh g–1 was kept with the retention of 92.4% after discharge–charge for 500 cycles at 1 C (compared with the fully activated status). In regard to B-TO, it increased from 167.6 to 186.8 mAh g–1 in 70 cycles, and after 500 cycles, it still maintained 185.1 mAh g–1, holding the retention of as high as 99.1%, which illuminated an extraordinary enduring stability. Additionally, the Coulombic efficiency kept around 99.7% during cycling (), which was an attractive value for practical utilization in full Na cells and further verified the excellent sustainability of B-TO.\nThe rate capabilities of the two samples were tested at escalated current densities and were exhibited in b–d. To have a more precise appraisal, we discharged and charged the electrodes at a very low current density 0.05 C in the first cycle to be fully activated initially.  Regarding W-TO, the charge specific capacity was measured to be 189.6 mAh g–1 at 0.2 °C and declined rapidly to 170.8, 147.3, 115.3, 72.9, and 38.1 mAh g–1, respectively. As for B-TO, the charge specific capacities of 207.6, 199.1, 188.9, 170.5, and 140.4 mAh g–1 were delivered at the rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 °C, separately. Even when the current densities increased to high rates of 10, 15, and 20 C, it was still able to yield capacities of 115.0, 101.8, and 91.2 mAh g–1, respectively, and as the current density went back to 0.5 °C, the specific capacity recovered to 199.5 mAh g–1, illustrating a considerably admirable high-rate performance of B-TO, which was much superior to W-TO as well as other pristine anatase TiO2 anode materials in previous reports,  and could hopefully enable it to be practically utilized in high-power sodium-ion batteries. The greatly enhanced high-rate performances of B-TO indicated the crucial benefits of OVs, which could significantly improve the electron-transfer process. Indeed, direct measurements revealed a much higher electronic conductivity of B-TO (4.3 × 10–4S cm–1) than pristine W-TO (2.1 × 10–8S cm–1). Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the corresponding sodium batteries of the two samples, which were tested after 10 cycles at 0.2 C and charged to the voltage of 0.8 V. The Nyquist plots were presented in e. Generally, the diameter of the semicircle in the intermediate frequency region signified the impedance of the charge transfer.  Obviously, the charge-transfer resistance of B-TO was much lower than that of W-TO, which confirmed a more favorable charge-transfer process on the electrode–electrolyte resulting from the introduction of oxygen vacancies.\n\n3.3 Understanding the Role of Oxygen Vacancies\nTo acquire fundamental insights into the role of oxygen vacancies to the electrical structures and sodiation properties of anatase, we performed DFT calculations on anatase, anatase with oxygen vacancies (anatase-OV), sodiated anatase, and sodiated anatase-OV. The obtained DOS patterns and PDOS patterns of Ti, O, Na for each structure were displayed in i (a–d) in the range of −25–12 eV, which exhibited the discrete valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB). It can be seen from the DOS of anatase-OV that after introducing OV into anatase lattice, the Femi level shifted to the CB, meaning electrons were the main carriers in this structure.  Besides, the Ti 3d orbits became more delocalized, leading to an increase in the CB width and a narrowing of the band gap between VB and CB, which implied the electron conductivity was improved, which was well in accord with the measured conductivity of B-TO and W-TO as well as the outcomes of the previous reports.  After Na+ insertion into the lattice of anatase and anatase-OV, the CB and VB both moved negatively, while a smaller extent of movement was observed for sodiated anatase-OV. Moreover, the electron orbits of Ti, O, and Na of sodiated anatase-OV overlapped in more parts compared with those of pristine anatase, manifesting in a higher activity toward Na ions for anatase-OV.\nThe Na ion insertion process was also investigated with DFT calculations to obtain the energy barriers of sodiation, termed by the energy change (ΔEsodiation) before and after Na ions insertion using the following formula: where Esodiated\xa0TiO2, ETiO2, and ENa represented the total energy of sodiated TiO2, bulk TiO2, and Na ions, respectively. The final structure models from panels a–c for anatase, anatase-OV, sodiated anatase, and sodiated anatase-OV were shown alongside their corresponding DOS patterns in ii (a–d), and those in the ball–stick styles were depicted in , attached by the Mulliken atomic populations in . The obtained Esodiated\xa0TiO2, ETiO2, and ENa for each model was presented in , from which the average energy barriers ΔEsodiation for two Na ions inserted into unit cells of pristine anatase and anatase-OV were calculated to be 5.63 and 4.75 eV, respectively. Therefore, the lower sodiated energy barriers suggested it was more energetically favorable for Na insertion into anatase-OV than the pristine anatase structure.\nIntegrating the calculations analyze with the experimental results, the superiorities of electrochemical performances of black anatase TiO2 as anode for sodium ion batteries stimulated by oxygen vacancies was mainly ascribed to the following positive factors. On the one hand, the intrinsic conductivity of anatase was improved derived from the narrowed band gap of oxygen-deficient anatase, contributing to the significantly accelerated electron transfer and boosted kinetics of Na ions uptake and release. On the other hand, the energy barrier of sodiation was lowered, and in the meantime, the activity of crystal structure toward Na ions was enhanced after the introduction of oxygen vacancies, giving rise to a more favorable Na ions insertion into anatase structure. These merits synergistically functioned for the facilitated sodium accommodation, made the activation process in the charge–discharge process faster, and remarkably promoted high-rate capabilities.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Meanwhile, 2.4 g of oxalic acid (OA) was dissolved in 60 mL of water–ethanol solution (2:1 in volume), named as solution B. Then, the mixture A was added dropwise into solution B under vigorous stirring at a temperature of 55 °C. After being further stirred for 3 h, the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifuge and washed by ethanol and deionized water for several times, followed by drying for 12 h at the temperature of 60 °C in an oven. Titania precursor Ti(OH)2C2O4 (HTO) was obtained by the reaction between TBOT and OA. \nTo prepare black titania, we first calcined the precursor HTO in air at 350 °C for 2 h, followed by being ground together uniformly with NaBH4 (2:1 in mass) as reductant and then heated in Ar atmosphere at 350 °C for 2 h. The resulting completely black sample was washed by 0.1 mol L–1 HCl and deionized water repeatedly and collected by centrifuge. After being dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h, the black TiO2 powder was obtained and named B-TO for brevity. For comparison, the nanocrystalline white TiO2 was prepared via calcining HTO in air at 350 °C for 4 h and named W-TO.\n\n2.2 Materials Characterization\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out utilizing a Bruker D8 diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (the wavelength of 1.5406 Å) with a scan rate of 2°/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, using FEI Quanta 200) together with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, using JEM-2100F) were employed in the characterization of as-prepared samples morphology. Raman spectra were tested using Renishaw InVia with wire 4.2. Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET, BELSORP-Mini II) surface area was obtained from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, using K-Alpha 1063) was performed to detect the chemical composition of the samples’ surfaces. The DC electrical conductivities were tested on disc-shaped samples by direct four-point probe conductivity measurements (SDY-40, Guangdong, China). Electron spin resonance (ESR, using JES-FA200) measurements were conducted by utilizing the micro frequency of 9057.904 MHz for the white TiO2 sample and 9059.228 MHz for the black TiO2 sample.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical Tests\nThe assembly of sodium half-cells was conducted in a MBraun glovebox full of argon atmosphere to investigate the properties of as-prepared samples in sodium storage. The powder of obtained active material (70%) was mixed with 15% super P as the conductive agent and 15% carboxymethyl cellulose as the binder in deionized water, and the formed homogeneous slurry was painted on a copper foil, which was subsequently dried for 12 h at 100 °C in a vacuum oven. The copper foil loaded by active materials were pressed and cut as the electrode slices. Metallic Na was employed as the counter electrode, and Celgard 2400 was used as the separator. The electrolyte was composed of 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate and added by 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Cyclic voltammetric (CV) were measured on Solartron Analytical to examine the electrochemical reaction using the assembled cell in the voltage range of 3–0.01 V (versus Na/Na+). Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on the Arbin battery cycler (BT2000) in 3–0.01 V (versus Na/Na+). The electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS) were performed on Solartron Analytical at an AC voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz after 10 discharge–charge cycles. All electrochemical tests were conducted at room temperature.\n\n2.4 Calculation Methods\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on the basis of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation energy function utilizing ultrasoft pseudopotential (USPP) formalism,  and the cutoff of the kinetic energy was set to 300 eV for all calculations in reciprocal space. The k-points were sampled on Monkhorst–Pack grid of 6 × 6 × 7 for the unit cell, and the maximum self-consistent field convergence tolerance was <2 × 10–6 eV atom–1.

Meanwhile, 2.4 g of oxalic acid (OA) was dissolved in 60 mL of water–ethanol solution (2:1 in volume), named as solution B. Then, the mixture A was added dropwise into solution B under vigorous stirring at a temperature of 55 °C. After being further stirred for 3 h, the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifuge and washed by ethanol and deionized water for several times, followed by drying for 12 h at the temperature of 60 °C in an oven. Titania precursor Ti(OH)2C2O4 (HTO) was obtained by the reaction between TBOT and OA. \nTo prepare black titania, we first calcined the precursor HTO in air at 350 °C for 2 h, followed by being ground together uniformly with NaBH4 (2:1 in mass) as reductant and then heated in Ar atmosphere at 350 °C for 2 h. The resulting completely black sample was washed by 0.1 mol L–1 HCl and deionized water repeatedly and collected by centrifuge. After being dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h, the black TiO2 powder was obtained and named B-TO for brevity. For comparison, the nanocrystalline white TiO2 was prepared via calcining HTO in air at 350 °C for 4 h and named W-TO.\n\n2.2 Materials Characterization\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out utilizing a Bruker D8 diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (the wavelength of 1.5406 Å) with a scan rate of 2°/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, using FEI Quanta 200) together with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, using JEM-2100F) were employed in the characterization of as-prepared samples morphology. Raman spectra were tested using Renishaw InVia with wire 4.2. Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET, BELSORP-Mini II) surface area was obtained from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, using K-Alpha 1063) was performed to detect the chemical composition of the samples’ surfaces. The DC electrical conductivities were tested on disc-shaped samples by direct four-point probe conductivity measurements (SDY-40, Guangdong, China). Electron spin resonance (ESR, using JES-FA200) measurements were conducted by utilizing the micro frequency of 9057.904 MHz for the white TiO2 sample and 9059.228 MHz for the black TiO2 sample.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical Tests\nThe assembly of sodium half-cells was conducted in a MBraun glovebox full of argon atmosphere to investigate the properties of as-prepared samples in sodium storage. The powder of obtained active material (70%) was mixed with 15% super P as the conductive agent and 15% carboxymethyl cellulose as the binder in deionized water, and the formed homogeneous slurry was painted on a copper foil, which was subsequently dried for 12 h at 100 °C in a vacuum oven. The copper foil loaded by active materials were pressed and cut as the electrode slices. Metallic Na was employed as the counter electrode, and Celgard 2400 was used as the separator. The electrolyte was composed of 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate and added by 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Cyclic voltammetric (CV) were measured on Solartron Analytical to examine the electrochemical reaction using the assembled cell in the voltage range of 3–0.01 V (versus Na/Na+). Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out on the Arbin battery cycler (BT2000) in 3–0.01 V (versus Na/Na+). The electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS) were performed on Solartron Analytical at an AC voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz after 10 discharge–charge cycles. All electrochemical tests were conducted at room temperature.\n\n2.4 Calculation Methods\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on the basis of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation energy function utilizing ultrasoft pseudopotential (USPP) formalism,  and the cutoff of the kinetic energy was set to 300 eV for all calculations in reciprocal space. The k-points were sampled on Monkhorst–Pack grid of 6 × 6 × 7 for the unit cell, and the maximum self-consistent field convergence tolerance was <2 × 10–6 eV atom–1. The bond-energy tolerance was 1 × 10–5 eV for the density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) calculations.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Morphology and Structure\nAs shown in the XRD patterns (), the sharp identified peaks observed at 25.25, 37.81, 48.08, 53.8555.16, 62.78, 68.67, 70.38, and 75.03° can be assigned to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) crystal faces of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 (a space group of I41/amd) according to the JCPDS card 21-1272. Additionally, there is no impurity peak resulting from the other secondary phases, suggesting the presence of the highly pure anatase TiO2 phase.\nThe structural and morphological properties of the S–TiO2/CS sample are confirmed by SEM and TEM. As displayed in a,b, plenty of tiny nanograins are captured on both sides of the sheets, which are ultralarge in size and rather thin. In addition, the wrinkled/rough surfaces and porous feature might be distinctly identified through the SEM images at a higher magnification (c,d) and a typical TEM image in e. Interestingly, the enlarged TEM images (f,g) show that unique nanograins anchored in a folded microsheet architecture composed of numerous nanoparticles with a size of 8–12 nm. It can also be clearly observed that nanograins are irregularly shaped features. As shown in the high-resolution TEM image (h), it displays a set of parallel lattices with a spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) lattice plane of anatase TiO2. The nanoparticles with a size of 8–12 nm might be helpful to shorten the ion diffusion paths, and the structural porosity may facilitate sodium-ion diffusion. The large-area thin sheet substrate with the wrinkle feature can be beneficial to interfacial reaction and electrolyte wetting.\nThe specific surface area and pore size distribution are determined by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. As displayed in a, there is a distinct hysteresis loop that appeared at high pressures in the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, which indicates a type IV isotherm characteristic of the H3 hysteresis loop. According to the BET measurement, the specific surface area of the S–TiO2/CS composites is 181.95 m2 g–1. Meanwhile, based on the BJH method, it confirms the narrow pore with a size distribution of 3.965 nm (b), demonstrating the mesoporous structure of the material, which resulted from the wrinkled surfaces of sheets and that between nanograins.  The high specific surface area accompanied with the mesoporous feature could be greatly helpful to the more active sites of sodium storage and increase the wetting areas of electrolytes, accelerating the kinetic reaction between the TiO2 electrodes and sodium ions.\nTo study the chemical state of the as-prepared S–TiO2/CS composites, the XPS spectra of the samples, Ti 2p, S 2p, and C 1s were analyzed. As exhibited in a, the typical TiO2 spectra and obvious S, N, and C peaks are identified, eliminating the presence of other impurities. The obvious Ti 2p peak at 458.56 eV and a weaker peak at 464.24 eV are the typical signals of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of the tetravalent Ti ion species, respectively (b).  The chemical state of sulfur was verified by the S 2p core-level XPS pattern in c, which was fitted with several peaks. The intense peaks at the binding energies (BEs) of 163.23 and 164.29 eV can be assigned to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks of the sulfide group (−C–Sx–C–, x = 1–2).  Two extra intense XPS peaks that appear at a higher BE (166.12 and 168.35 eV) are associated with the existence of the doped S element,  which strongly suggested that sulfur is possibly covalently bonded with carbon and successfully incorporated into TiO2. Note that the S content is close to 4% and the percentage of TiO2 is about 50% according to the XPS data. Additionally, the small split that separately occurred at 161.64 eV corresponds to the anionic S2– species, which is also in good agreement with previous reports.  In the case of C 1s (d), the feature of carbon mainly appears at 284.81 (C–C/C–S), 285.99 (C–O/C–S), 286.94 (C═O), 288.54 (−CO2–), and 291.29 eV (π–π*).  More significantly, the peak at 283.79 eV can be assigned to the C–Ti covalent bond,  and the peaks at 284.81 and 285.99 eV could be ascribed to the C–S bridge bond. \nNotably, taking into account the formation of covalent bonds among S, Ti, and C, it is indicated that there is a unique chemical attachment between S-doped TiO2 and the large-area carbon sheet-conductive substrate, rather than a simple adhesion connection. These strong chemically combined interactions can provide a coherent pathway for electron transfer and ion transmission, which is beneficial to the fast charge–discharge process. On the other hand, it can also lead to a more interfacial pseudocapacitive sodium storage performance, which is responsible for a high-rate long-term cycling life.\nAn “electrostatic interaction-induced self-assembling” can be introduced as the formation mechanism of S–TiO2/SC.  As displayed in , titanium oxysulfate, as a titanium source, is in the form of (TiO)n2n+ polymerized by TiO2+ in the IPA solution, directly exhibiting positive surface charges. During the solvothermal reaction process, glucose prefers to produce some aromatic composites, which mostly possess a high amount of multiple hydroxyl groups.  Thus, these hydroxyl functional groups can serve as anchoring bridges to strongly connect the positive titanium source and carbon sheets by π–π* interactions, which cannot be similar to the commonly reported methods through directly adding graphene nanosheets or acid-assisted CNTs.  Compared to the van der Waals forces inducing the connection of active materials and carbon substrates, the electrostatic interaction between two oppositely charged reaction composites can induce a strong driving force through self-assembling and further form an interface by the unique chemical bond. As for S–TiO2/CS, the cooperation effects of sulfur doping and large-area carbon sheet substrate can provide a coherent electronic transfer path, which is helpful to the fast electron and sodium-ion transportation. The strong interaction between the large-area carbon sheet and tiny TiO2 nanoparticles can have a great improvement of the pseudocapacitive sodium storage capacity, which is significantly crucial for the high-rate long-term cycle life.\n\n3.2.  Electrochemical Performance\nThe cyclic voltammograms of the as-obtained S–TiO2/CS electrode are obtained at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1, as shown in a, which display a characteristic electrochemical feature of anatase TiO2. In the initial cathodic scan, two irreversible peaks are observed at around 0.48 and 1.01 V, which are assigned to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface layer and some parasitic side reactions of the electrolyte.  Additionally, a small peak at approximately 0.87 V appears, suggesting the reversible reduction between the tetravalent and trivalent titanium ions. In all anodic sweeps, the peak at 0.89 V is reserved, which indicates the reversible oxidation of TiO2. Meanwhile, the CV curves and a pair of redox peaks almost overlap from the second to fifth cyclic scan, further pointing out the highly reversible reaction of TiO2 with the sodium ion. The discharge–charge curves at a current density of 0.5 C (b) also verify a similar phenomenon, where the charge profiles overlap well, but the profiles vary in the initial three discharge processes. Accompanied with the discharge–charge processes at different rates (c), it can be observed that a wide plateau at 0.7–1.0 V in the discharge period and a broad plateau at 1.0–1.3 V in the charge period are maintained, significantly manifesting the reversible insertion–extraction of Na+ ions.\nThe galvanostatic discharge–charge tests at the current densities of 0.5 C and 2 C are depicted in a,b. In the first cycles, moderate discharge capacities of 445.6 (0.5 C) and 317.6 mA h g–1 (2 C) are delivered, whereas relatively small charge capacities of 209.4 (0.5 C) and 140.7 mA h g–1 (2 C) are yielded, corresponding to the low Coulombic efficiencies of 47% (0.5 C) and 44.3% (2 C). The large capacity loss and inferior initial Coulombic efficiency might be mainly derived from some side reactions between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte as well as some irreversible reduction from TiO2 to metallic titanium and sodium superoxide,  which would resolve through the presodiation technique in terms of practical applications. In addition, a trend of gradually increasing capacity over first 25 cycles can be seen at different current densities, resulting from the activation phenomenon of the electrode,  which is also coincident with the CV tests where the current density of the anodic peak keeps rising with the increasing number of sweeps. During repeated cycles, the specific capacities of 293.5 (0.5 C) and 256.4 mA h g–1 (2 C) are retained, reflecting an excellent cycle performance. Note that the Coulombic efficiency significantly goes up in the 10th cycle and then rises smoothly to 99% and keeps at the level in the following cycles.\nc presents the superior rate performance of S–TiO2/CS electrodes; the specific capacities of 255.5, 228.6, 200.8, 167.6, 146.5, and 120.6 mA h g–1 are achieved at the rates of 0.25, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 C, respectively. Even at 20 C, it can deliver a high capacity of about 120 mA h g–1 after 655 cycles, exhibiting a robust tolerance during the fast sodium-ion insertion/extraction process. More excitingly, at a higher current density of 30 C, a surprising capacity of 100.5 mA h g–1 is obtained for 5000 cycles (d), further revealing that the S–TiO2/CS electrodes possess a high-rate long-term cyclability, which is a crucial but challenging factor for an attractive anode in future commercial batteries.\nThe kinetic process of sodium storage for the S–TiO2/CS electrode is investigated by CV tests at various sweep rates ranging from 0.1 to 100 mV s–1. As displayed in a,b, it can be seen that a pair of broad redox peaks is almost reserved at a scan rate of 0.1–30 mV s–1. Further, when the sweep rate exceeds 40 mV s–1 (c), there occurs a distinct distortion because of the polarization of the electrode. Meanwhile, the current value (i) of the peak becomes large with an increasing sweep rate (ν). A power-law equation (i = aνb) between the peak current and sweep rate is used for studying the difference in kinetics.  By means of plotting log(i) against log(ν), it can be equivalent to the relationship: log(i) = log(a)+ b log(ν), where i and ν are acknowledged from the experimental tests and a and b are determined by the fitting method. Generally, the b value close to 1 corresponds to the capacitive-controlled electrochemical behavior, also named surface Faradic redox reaction, whereas b close to 0.5 stands for a diffusion-controlled process. d reflects the linear relation according to the b value from the slope. The b value of 0.792 reveals that the dominant electrochemical process is a pseudocapacitive behavior at a relatively slow sweep rate scope (<20 mV s–1).\nAt a certain fast scan rate (>30 mV s–1), the b value changes to 0.504, indicating that the rate-limiting step is mainly determined by ion diffusion. Note that the total sodium storage capacity of the S–TiO2/CS electrode comes from two contributions, namely, the pseudocapacitance-controlled (the interfacial Faradic redox reaction) and diffusion-controlled (a redox reaction between Ti4+/Ti3+) processes, and the dominating pseudocapacitive mechanism is responsible for the excellent high rate performance of the S–TiO2/CS electrode. \nThe outstanding sodium storage capacity of the S–TiO2/CS composite can be ascribed to the significant synergistic effects of the structure design and the chemically bonded correction. The TiO2 nanograins consisting of nanoparticles with a size of 8–12 nm anchored on carbon sheets that may shorten the ion transport pathways and possess a high capability of reversible accommodation of sodium in the bulk. The combination of sulfur doping and large-area carbon sheets can highly improve the electronic conductivity of TiO2, resulting in a much faster electronic charge transfer and the enhanced kinetics of the sodium storage process. More importantly, the strong chemical bond hybrid induced by the electrostatic interaction between TiO2 and the carbon sheets can be beneficial to more feasible paths for sodium-ion diffusion in the S–TiO2/CS interface, which leads to the acceleration of the sodium storage pseudocapacitive process. In addition, the kinetic analysis also demonstrated the pseudocapacitive behavior, which is markedly responsible for the high rate performance and rapid sodium storage process.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Preparation of S–TiO2/CS Composites\nAll reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical preparation process, 2.0 g of titanium oxysulfate (TiOSO4, >99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 40 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA, >99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) by vigorously stirring for 0.5 h. Subsequently, 0.03 mL of diethylenetriamine (DETA, >99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 g glucose (99%, Alfa Aesar) were added into the above uniform solution. When the reaction was finished, the as-obtained products were washed with ethanol and deionized water for several times via centrifugation and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The S–TiO2/CS composites were synthesized after annealing in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere.\n\n2.2.  Materials Characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/max 2550 VB+ 18 kW diffractometer (Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å), which were used to confirm the crystalline structures of the S–TiO2/CS composites. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained with a FEI Quanta 200 instrument (Japan), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100F electron microscope (Japan), which was aimed at observing the morphologies of the S–TiO2/CS samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a K-Alpha 1063 instrument (UK). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, BELSORP-MINI II) specific surface area was calculated according to the nitrogen adsorption–desorption curves at 77 K. The pore size distribution was determined on the basis of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.\n\n2.3.  Electrochemical Measurements\nThe S–TiO2/CS electrode was prepared as below: the mixed slurries were made up of 70 wt % of the as-prepared active material (S–TiO2/CS composites), 15 wt % of the conductive additive (Super P, >99%, Alfa Aesar), and 15 wt % of the binder (polyvinylidene fluoride, Alfa Aesar), which were uniformly painted on a copper foil. After drying, it was punched into wafers and used as the anode for SIBs. The average mass loading of the wafers was approximately 1.2–1.5 mg cm–2. The sodium storage performance was estimated by CR2016-type coin cells, where the sodium metal acted as the counter electrode and Celgard 2400 polyethylene was used as the separator. The electrolyte consisted of 1 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO4, >99%, Alfa Aesar) dissolved in a solvent of propylene carbonate (>99.7%, Alfa Aesar) and fluoroethylene carbonate (>99%, Alfa Aesar) additives (the volume ratio of 95:5). The half-cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (mBraun, Germany) where the water/oxygen content is lower than 1 ppm. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) data were recorded on a Solartron Analytical analyzer (Ametek, UK). Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling and rate performance analysis were carried out on a LAND cycler (Wuhan Kingnuo Electronic Co., China) and an Arbin battery cycler (BT 2000, USA). All the cell tests were performed in a voltage range between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs Na+/Na).\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

No diffraction peaks or bumps assigned to GO or rGO can be observed, probably due to the low contents and/or poor crystallinity. To clarify this point, Raman spectra () were measured, where two peaks at ∼1435 and ∼1580 cm–1 assigned to the D-band and the G-band of carbon are readily observed.  It is believed that GO is reduced to rGO during the synthesis, due to the annealing in Ar/H2 at a high temperature. Such a reduction is directly confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectra (). In this context, the final product is denoted as SbPO4/rGO. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) () shows that the content of rGO in SbPO4/rGO is approximately ∼14.3 wt %. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to reveal the surface species of SbPO4/rGO. The signals of Sb, P, O, and C could be easily observed in the survey spectrum (). The high-resolution spectra of these elements confirm the formation of SbPO4/rGO. As illustrated in c, the peaks at 530.8 and 540.2 eV are assigned to Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2 of SbPO4, and the peak at 531.9 eV is ascribed to O 1s.  The similar overlapping between Sb 3d and O 1s has been reported in previous works.  The peak at 134.5 eV in d is assigned to P 2p from P–O in PO43–.  Different from the spectra of P 2p and Sb 3d, there are four peaks in the C 1s spectra (e), which are 284.6 eV from sp2-bonded C–C, 284.9 eV from sp3-bonded C–C, 286.2 eV from C–O, and 289.6 eV from O═C–OH.  The presence of C–O, C═O, and O═C–OH offers numerous anchoring sites for electrochemically active materials and then inhibits particle agglomeration or drop-off from electrodes.\nThen, SbPO4/rGO was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and TEM. f shows that numerous nanoparticles are well dispersed on a sheet-like structure, indicating the formation of SbPO4/rGO. The high-magnification TEM image (g) reveals that there are many short nanorods, with a diameter of 50 nm and length up to 350 nm. It is also noted that there is a small quantity of ellipsoids in SbPO4/rGO. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image on a single nanorod (h) exhibits clear lattice fringes throughout the entire nanorod, indicating a single-crystal nature. The fringes with their interlayer spacings at 0.339 and 0.362 nm correspond to (020) and (−101) planes of SbPO4, respectively. The fast Fourier transform pattern, as shown in , suggests that the nanorods grow along the direction of [−101], parallel to the polyhedron layers of SbPO4. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) () confirm the molar ratio of Sb to P at almost 1:1, close to that in SbPO4. To figure out the distributions of these elements, high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images and element mapping were conducted. As presented in i–m, the patterns of Sb, P, and O are well overlapped with that of nanorods, strongly supporting the formation of SbPO4 nanorods. Meanwhile, the signal of carbon from rGO is also observed in l. All of these results confirm that SbPO4 nanorods are attached to rGO. This good contact would benefit the charge transfer between rGO and SbPO4 and restrain the particle pulverization upon cycling, thereby improving rate capability and cycling stability. N2 sorption isotherms () suggest that SbPO4/rGO has a specific surface area of about 50.8 m2 g–1 and an average pore size of about 30 nm.\na shows the discharge/charge profiles of SbPO4 at the first cycle. There is a pronounced voltage plateau at 0.9 V, indicating a typical two-phase process. After that, the voltage profile is followed by a shallow slope over 0.6–0.25 V. Compared to the discharge profile, only one short voltage slope between 0.5 and 0.75 V is observed in the first charge. In view of specific capacity and average voltage, it is believed that this voltage slope corresponds to the reverse reaction that happens over 0.5–0.3 V in the first discharge. To identify these electrochemical reactions, in situ XRD patterns and ex situ HRTEM images/SAED patterns are measured. As shown in b, the diffraction peaks at 24 and 38.5° can be attributed to conductive carbon and the current foil, Al, which do not alter in intensity and in peak positions upon cycling. Different from the cases of C and Al, the diffraction peaks of SbPO4 gradually weaken with discharging and almost disappear below 0.8 V. This result can be speculated as the reduction reaction from SbPO4 to metallic Sb. However, no obvious peaks from metallic Sb and Na3PO4 are observed, which is likely caused by their poor crystallinity/small size. The similar phenomenon is very common in the products from conversion reactions.  Although metallic Sb is invisible in XRD patterns, its appearance is confirmed by ex situ SAED patterns (c) and HRTEM images (f), strongly supporting the reduction reaction. As the discharge process proceeds, metallic Sb is alloyed with Na, generating NaSb and Na3Sb in sequence. At the end of the discharge process, Na3Sb is easily identified in the XRD patterns (b), SAED pattern (d), and HRTEM image (g). Then, the electrode is charged back, where the diffraction peaks of Na3Sb shift the high angles and become weak (b). This result indicates the contraction of unit cells and the damage of crystal structures. At ∼0.8 V, these diffraction peaks almost disappear from the XRD pattern. Similar to the case of the discharge process, the diffraction peaks from metallic Sb are absent in the XRD pattern, but its diffraction rings and lattice fringes are confirmed by SAED patterns (e) and HRTEM images (h). This result is kept in the XRD patterns, even as the electrode is charged to 1.5 V (). These results confirm that the alloying reaction, rather than the conversion reaction, contributes to the reversible capacity over 0.01–1.5 V, well explaining the low initial Coulombic efficiency of SbPO4. The involved electrochemical reactions upon cycling could be described by  and :\nAs the voltage window is expanded to 0.01–2.5 V, there is one more pair of voltage plateaus, 1.7 V in the discharge process and 2.2 V in the charge process (). The HRTEM images and SAED patterns of the electrode charged to 2.5 V () confirm the formation of SbPO4 again. Thus, it is believed that the new voltage plateaus originate from the redox reaction between Sb and SbPO4. However, the capacity contributed by this reaction (∼90 mA h g–1) is much smaller than the expected one (∼366 mA h g–1), indicating that this reaction is partially reversible. The high capacity of SbPO4/rGO over 0.01–2.5 V only lasts for 80 cycles (). After that, the capacity decays quickly, due to the larger structure stain/stress caused by the insertion/extraction of more Na ions. In this regard, the electrochemical test in this work is limited within the voltage window of 0.01–1.5 V.\nIn situ TEM technique could intuitively reflect the changes of individual electrode particles in morphology and structure with nanometer/atomic resolution. a shows the configuration of in situ TEM imaging, where SbPO4 nanorods and metallic Na were employed as the working electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The thin layer of NaxO on Na acted as a solid-state electrolyte, so sodium ions gradually passed through this layer and diffused into SbPO4. b shows the real-time TEM images upon discharge, where the nanorod expands anisotropically during sodiation; that is, the length of the SbPO4 nanorod increases slightly (∼23 nm) upon discharging, but the diameter expands violently (∼90 nm) ( and c). This anisotropic volume change is likely associated with the unique layered structure of SbPO4 that is aligned along the longitudinal direction of nanorods. Thus, as Na ions diffuse into the interlayers during the sodiation process (right side of a), SbPO4 nanorods would preferentially expand along the transverse direction. The in situ SAED patterns in d were also recorded to track the structural evolution during the discharge process. The diffraction rings are radially integrated to intensity profiles in order to increase the accuracy (, Supporting Information). Both the position and intensity of the diffraction peaks vary a lot with the sodiation process, revealing the phase transition from SbPO4 to Sb, NaSb, and eventually to Na3Sb (e). These results disclose the stepwise alloying of Sb during sodiation, in excellent agreement with ex situ TEM images.\na shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of SbPO4/rGO during the first four cycles over 0.01–1.5 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1. In the first cycle, the cathodic peak at 0.75 V is related to the reduction of SbPO4 to metallic Sb, the decomposition of electrolytes, and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.  After that, as-formed Sb alloys with Na, producing a cathodic peak at ∼0.25 V, consistent with that reported for this alloying reaction.  In the first-charge process, there is only one broad and strong anodic peak at ∼0.75 V, which can be attributed to the desodiation of NaxSb alloy.  This result is also in line with those from in situ XRD patterns and in situ SAED patterns. In the second cycle, the cathodic peak at 0.75 V vanishes, but another peak at 0.4 V shows up, which also originates from the alloying reaction of Sb.  The cathodic peak at 0.22 V probably comes from residual Sb that did not react completely during the first discharge. Compared to the changes on the cathodic peaks, that of the anodic peak is quite small. In the third cycle, the cathodic peaks at 0.4 and 0.22 V merge together. From then on, the CV curves become almost identical, implying a good electrochemical stability. b shows the discharge/charge profiles of SbPO4/rGO at 0.1 A g–1 for the first four cycles. The voltage profiles are in good agreement with the cathodic/anodic peaks in the CV curves. The first discharge/charge capacity is 766/309 mA h g–1, resulting in an initial Coulombic efficiency of 40%. The low Coulombic efficiency comes from irreversible reactions during the first discharging, such as the formation of a SEI film, the irreversible conversion between SbPO4 and metallic Sb, and so on.  However, after that, the Coulombic efficiency quickly rises to 99.5% and the capacity remains at 306 mA h g–1, very close to the theoretical capacity of this composite (330.4 mA h g–1 = 372 mA h g–1 × 0.86 + 75 mA h g–1 × 0.14) (). This result indicates that most of the active material in this composite has been well utilized in a high efficiency. It is noted that the low initial Coulombic efficiency can be improved by presodiation or wide voltage window (). c displays the cycling performances of SbPO4/rGO and SbPO4 within 0.01–1.5 V, using 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate as the electrolyte. Both of them were activated at 0.1 A g–1 for the first three cycles and then cycled at 0.5 A g–1. Apparently, SbPO4/rGO exhibits a much better cycling stability than SbPO4. After 100 cycles at 0.5 A g–1, SbPO4/rGO still delivers a capacity of 280 mA h g–1, much higher than 20 mA h g–1 of SbPO4. This result indicates that rGO greatly improves the cycling stability. Unfortunately, the nanorods are not preserved after cycles (), probably due to the repeated deformation upon cycling, as illustrated in . Despite this, active materials are still firmly attached to carbon, maintaining the electrochemical activity.\nThe excellent cycling performance can be attributed to the aggregation resistance of the Sb-containing particles, which comes from their secure attachment to rGO. First-principles calculations revealed that there are strong interactions at the interface region. Here, the (012) plane of Sb was adopted to simulate the contact surface of the particles. As revealed by our first-principles simulations, most of the contribution to the interaction between rGO and Sb come from van der Waals forces. The nature of such an interaction indicates that the bonding would not depend on the particular composition and termination of the Sb-containing particles. Therefore, we expect that the physical picture of the bonding patterns obtained on (012) planes can also be extended to other crystal facets including but not limited to (104) and (100) planes. Meanwhile, C–O groups were used as the anchor sites on rGO. More details about the computational model are described in . Interestingly, even in the absence of the anchor sites, the binding energy of Sb (012) on rGO is ∼2.62 eV, which originates from the van der Waals interaction. Upon the involvement of the anchor sites, the binding energy further increases to 3.26 eV, owing to the chemical bonds between Sb and O/C atoms (d). It is worth noting that the value of 3.26 eV is a lower limit because, in reality, the fluctuation of the rGO geometry is more flexible than that in the simulations, which could result in more effective bonding patterns. Overall, the van der Waals interactions lead to the deposition of the particles, and the formation of the chemical bonds effectively prevents these particles from diffusing and aggregating on rGO, both of which, cooperatively, stabilize the working units of the battery. This strong interaction is also supported by XPS spectra of SbPO4 and SbPO4/rGO discharged to 0.5 V, where Sb was in situ generated. Because Sb 3d is always interfered by O 1s, Sb 4d is used to confirm this point. As shown in , Sb 4d of the discharged electrode from SbPO4/rGO shifts to the high binding energies, as compared to that from SbPO4. This shift indicates the decreasing of electron density around Sb, which is in good agreement with the interaction between Sb and rGO. Encouraged by these results, the long-term cycling of SbPO4/rGO at a high rate was measured. As presented in e, SbPO4/rGO was cycled at 0.1 A g–1 for the first 10 cycles and then at 1 A g–1 for the following cycles. After 1000 cycles, the specific capacity still maintains at 100 mA h g–1, corresponding to a capacity retention of 66%. Although this capacity is not impressive (), the lifespan outperforms many Sb-related anodes. Moreover, if evaluated in terms of the cycling stability, SbPO4/rGO is also superior to many reports.\na shows the rate performance of SbPO4/rGO, where the specific capacity decreases from 323 mA h g–1 at 0.1 A g–1 to 301 mA h g–1 at 0.2 A g–1, 289 mA h g–1 at 0.5 A g–1, 278 mA h g–1 at 1 A g–1, 262 mA h g–1 at 2 A g–1, and 214 mA h g–1 at 5 A g–1. Even at a high current density of 10 A g–1, it still reaches 127 mA h g–1. The capacity retention of SbPO4/rGO is higher than that of SbPO4 and most of the Sb-related materials (). To gain insights about this result, EIS spectra were measured at 1.5 V after 10 cycles and fitted by an equivalent circuit (the inset of b). Rs indicates the resistance of the electrolyte and cell components. Rf is the resistance related to the surface film; Rct refers to the charge transfer resistance at the interfaces, and Zw represents the Warburg impedance related to Na+ diffusion.  It is noted that both Rf and Rct of SbPO4/rGO are much smaller than those of SbPO4 (), implying the enhanced reaction kinetics in SbPO4/rGO. Why SbPO4/rGO shows the superior performances in rate capability and cycling stability could be illustrated as follows. First, rGO and as-formed NaxSb and Sb offer three-dimensional highways for charge transfer and promote the electrochemical reactions.  Second, rGO and Na3PO4 work as the buffers to volume change upon cycling, improving the cycling stability. Third, the strong interaction between Sb and rGO restrains the particle pulverization and aggregation during sodiation/desodiation processes. All of these features make the composite promising as an anode material.\nKinetics analysis was conducted on the basis of CV curves at different scan rates. As shown in c, these CV curves scanned from 0.2 to 2.0 mV s–1 exhibit a similar contour. The relationship between the peak current (ip) and the scan rate (v) could be described by : where a and b are empirical constants that could be obtained by a logarithmic plot of ip with v, as displayed in d; b = 0.5 indicates an ideally diffusion-controlled electrochemical process, whereas b = 1.0 implies a typical surface-controlled electrochemical process. In most cases, b stays between 0.5 and 1.0, suggesting a mixed contribution from two processes. In SbPO4/rGO, b values of the cathodic and anode peaks are identified as 0.73 and 0.78. According to Dunn et al., the ratio of the two contributions could be estimated from : Here, i is the current at a fixed potential. k1v and k2v1/2 represent the contributions of a surface-controlled process and a diffusion-controlled process, respectively. To simplify the calculation, this equation is reorganized by dividing both sides by v1/2, giving :In this context, k1 and k2 can be easily obtained as the slope and intercept point at the y-axis in a plot of i/v1/2versusv1/2. Thus, the ratio of a diffusion-controlled process and a surface-controlled process at this potential could be clarified.  Expanding this procedure to other potentials would disclose the contributions of the two processes to the total capacity. As illustrated in e, the capacitive process contributes 79% of the total capacity at a scan rate of 2.0 mV s–1. These data gradually decrease to 44%, as the scan rate slows to 0.2 mV s–1 (f).\nIn view of the excellent performances of SbPO4/rGO in half cells, it is tested in full cells by using homemade Na3V2(PO4)3/C as a cathode material (, Supporting Information). a shows the scheme of the full cell. The full cell was tested within 1.2–3.4 V at a current density of 0.5 A g–1anode. As shown in b, there is a pronounced voltage plateau at 2.6 V, and this result would benefit the practical applications in the future. The cycling performances are evaluated at 0.5 A g–1anode, but the first five cycles were conducted at 0.1 A g–1anode for electrochemical activation. As illustrated in c, the full cell displays a very stable cycling. After 100 cycles at 0.5 A g–1, the capacity is still 190 mA h g–1anode, corresponding to a capacity retention of almost 99.2%. The superior rate performances of SbPO4/rGO are also inherited in full cells (d). There is a specific capacity of 204 mA h g–1anode for 0.1 A g–1anode, 202 mA h g–1anode for 0.2 A g–1, 200 mA h g–1anode for 0.5 A g–1anode, 179 mA h g–1anode for 2 A g–1anode, and 136 mA h g–1anode for 5 A g–1anode. These results indicate that the full cells could be charged to 66.7% within 1.6 min. The electrode polarization slowly increases with the increasing rate (e). f shows the energy density and power density of full cells calculated on the basis of total mass of active materials (Na3V2(PO4)3/C + SbPO4/rGO). It is found that the energy density decays slowly. Even at 1.2 kW kg–1, there is still an energy density of 99.8 W h kg–1total, 81.3% of that at 0.06 kW kg–1. All these data indicate the promising potential of SbPO4/rGO as a high-performance anode material for Na ion batteries.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

GO (30 mg) was dispersed in ethylene glycol (40 mL), followed by addition of SbCl3 (228 mg) and NH4H2PO4 (345 mg). This dispersion was heated to 70 °C and transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. After being maintained at 160 °C for 4 h, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The powders were collected by centrifuge, washed by distilled water and absolute ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the powders were annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in Ar/H2 (95:5). This product, SbPO4/rGO, was used for structure characterization and electrochemical performances. SbPO4 nanoparticles were prepared without rGO in the recipe and used as the benchmark to illustrate the role of rGO.\n\n Characterization\nPowder XRD patterns were measured on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advanced, Germany), using monochromatic Cu Kα as a radiation source. SEM images were taken from a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss SUPRA55, Germany), connected with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Oxford Instruments). TEM images were acquired on an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (FEI Titan Themis G2, USA) operated at 300 kV. Raman spectra were obtained on a LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer, using an excitation at 632 nm at room temperature. XPS spectra were achieved from an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCA LAB 250, USA). TGA was conducted on a thermal analyzer (Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA85, Canada) from room temperature to 800 °C in air. N2 sorption isotherms were measured on a gas sorptometer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88, USA) at 77 K.\n\n Electrochemical Measurements\nElectrochemical performances of SbPO4 and SbPO4/rGO as anode materials in sodium ion batteries were evaluated in CR2032-type coin cells, using pure sodium foil as the counter electrode and glass fitter (whatman GF/F) as a separator. The working electrode was fabricated by spreading a slurry of SbPO4 or SbPO4/rGO, acetylene black, and sodium alginate (SA) in a weight ratio of 7:2:1 on a copper foil. After the foil was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h, the electrode was cut into disks with diameters of 12 nm. The mass loading of active material was 1.0–1.5 mg cm–2. Then, the coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (Mikrouna, Super 1220/750/900, H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 1 ppm), using 1.0 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate containing 3 wt % FEC as an electrolyte. For full cells, the cathode was made of homemade Na3V2(PO4)3/C, acetylene black, and poly(vinylidene) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 deposited on an alumium foil. The anode was fabricated by the above protocol and electrochemically activated in a half cell before it was assembled into full cells. The capacity ratio between anode and cathode was controlled to about 1.2:1. In this case, the anode capacity slightly exceeds the cathode one, promoting the utilization of cathode materials and preventing the formation of dendrites. CVs were performed using an electrochemical workstation (LK 2005A, China) at room temperature. Galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles were obtained on battery cyclers (LAND CT-2001A, China) between 0.01 and 1.5 V at 25 °C. EIS spectra were taken on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 302N) over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\n\n In Situ TEM Characterization\nIn situ TEM images and SAED patterns were obtained out using Tecnai F20 at 200 kV equipped with an OneView IS (Gatan) camera. The in situ experiment was conducted using a simplified battery configuration with SbPO4 dispersed onto a half-copper mesh as the working electrode and a piezo-driven tungsten tip coated by Na as the counter electrode. To achieve this fabrication, SbPO4 was dispersed in a half-copper grid and transferred to a specially designed specimen holder (PicoFemto). Then, the W tip was used to scratch the surface of Na metal. All of the process was conducted in an argon-filled glovebox. Finally, the holder was transferred into a microscope column. During the transfer process, the Na was shortly exposed to the air to form a layer of NaxO on the surface of Na, serving as the solid electrolyte. The W tip is kept in touch with SbPO4 by a piezo-ceramic manipulator. To initialize the sodiation, a bias of −2 V was applied on SbPO4 against the counter electrode to promote Na ion transport through the Na2O layer.\n\n Computation Details\nAll calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).  The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 400 eV, and optB86b-vdW was employed as the exchange-correlation functional.  All atoms were allowed to relax until the maximum force was below 0.03 Å /eV. Dipole correction on the total energies was added along the perpendicular direction.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

GO (30 mg) was dispersed in ethylene glycol (40 mL), followed by addition of SbCl3 (228 mg) and NH4H2PO4 (345 mg). This dispersion was heated to 70 °C and transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. After being maintained at 160 °C for 4 h, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The powders were collected by centrifuge, washed by distilled water and absolute ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the powders were annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in Ar/H2 (95:5). This product, SbPO4/rGO, was used for structure characterization and electrochemical performances. SbPO4 nanoparticles were prepared without rGO in the recipe and used as the benchmark to illustrate the role of rGO.\n\n Characterization\nPowder XRD patterns were measured on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advanced, Germany), using monochromatic Cu Kα as a radiation source. SEM images were taken from a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss SUPRA55, Germany), connected with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Oxford Instruments). TEM images were acquired on an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (FEI Titan Themis G2, USA) operated at 300 kV. Raman spectra were obtained on a LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer, using an excitation at 632 nm at room temperature. XPS spectra were achieved from an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCA LAB 250, USA). TGA was conducted on a thermal analyzer (Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA85, Canada) from room temperature to 800 °C in air. N2 sorption isotherms were measured on a gas sorptometer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88, USA) at 77 K.\n\n Electrochemical Measurements\nElectrochemical performances of SbPO4 and SbPO4/rGO as anode materials in sodium ion batteries were evaluated in CR2032-type coin cells, using pure sodium foil as the counter electrode and glass fitter (whatman GF/F) as a separator. The working electrode was fabricated by spreading a slurry of SbPO4 or SbPO4/rGO, acetylene black, and sodium alginate (SA) in a weight ratio of 7:2:1 on a copper foil. After the foil was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h, the electrode was cut into disks with diameters of 12 nm. The mass loading of active material was 1.0–1.5 mg cm–2. Then, the coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (Mikrouna, Super 1220/750/900, H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 1 ppm), using 1.0 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate containing 3 wt % FEC as an electrolyte. For full cells, the cathode was made of homemade Na3V2(PO4)3/C, acetylene black, and poly(vinylidene) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 deposited on an alumium foil. The anode was fabricated by the above protocol and electrochemically activated in a half cell before it was assembled into full cells. The capacity ratio between anode and cathode was controlled to about 1.2:1. In this case, the anode capacity slightly exceeds the cathode one, promoting the utilization of cathode materials and preventing the formation of dendrites. CVs were performed using an electrochemical workstation (LK 2005A, China) at room temperature. Galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles were obtained on battery cyclers (LAND CT-2001A, China) between 0.01 and 1.5 V at 25 °C. EIS spectra were taken on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 302N) over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.\n\n In Situ TEM Characterization\nIn situ TEM images and SAED patterns were obtained out using Tecnai F20 at 200 kV equipped with an OneView IS (Gatan) camera. The in situ experiment was conducted using a simplified battery configuration with SbPO4 dispersed onto a half-copper mesh as the working electrode and a piezo-driven tungsten tip coated by Na as the counter electrode. To achieve this fabrication, SbPO4 was dispersed in a half-copper grid and transferred to a specially designed specimen holder (PicoFemto). Then, the W tip was used to scratch the surface of Na metal. All of the process was conducted in an argon-filled glovebox. Finally, the holder was transferred into a microscope column. During the transfer process, the Na was shortly exposed to the air to form a layer of NaxO on the surface of Na, serving as the solid electrolyte. The W tip is kept in touch with SbPO4 by a piezo-ceramic manipulator. To initialize the sodiation, a bias of −2 V was applied on SbPO4 against the counter electrode to promote Na ion transport through the Na2O layer.\n\n Computation Details\nAll calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).  The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 400 eV, and optB86b-vdW was employed as the exchange-correlation functional.  All atoms were allowed to relax until the maximum force was below 0.03 Å /eV. Dipole correction on the total energies was added along the perpendicular direction.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and Discussion\n shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the CNFs at different carbonization temperatures (800, 900, and 1000 °C).  shows the XRD images of samples CNF1 and CNF3. A broad peak around 23.6° corresponding to the (002) plane implies a highly disordered pseudo-graphitic structure. Also, the absence of peak ∼42 corresponding to the (100) diffraction of graphite implies that CNFs do not have a graphitic carbon structure.  The XRD graph demonstrates that the (002@23.6°) peak has noticeably shifted toward lower angles as compared to graphite (002@26.3°).\nThe shift implies an increase of the interlayer distance which helps during the intercalation of Na ions. According to Bragg’s law, the (002) plane interlayer distance of the CNF sample was calculated and observed to be ∼0.39 nm, which is larger than that of graphite (0.34 nm). This confirms that CNFs have a pseudo-graphitic structure.  An expanded plane interlayer distance in the carbon material favors the intercalation of Na+ ions and thus improves the electrochemical performance (especially the rate performance) of SIBs. \nField emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the CNFs carbonized at different temperatures with 5% of melamine are shown in . The stabilization and carbonization process resulted in randomly oriented submicron-sized carbon fibers. The average diameter of the CNF2 CNFs with 1% melamine was about 200 nm at 800 °C. The diameters of CNF2A and CNF2B were observed to be 150–180 and 100–150 nm, respectively. Higher magnification images show that, with increasing temperature, the diameter of the fiber gets reduced further, leading to an increasing bending behavior. The reduction in diameter is quite obvious because at higher carbonization temperature, there is a slight evaporation of trapped organic carbon. The bending is increased due to the decrease in the diameter of CNF. The morphology of the pristine CNFs (PCNFs), CNF2, CNF2A, and CNF2B samples was elucidated under FE transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in .\nFETEM images demonstrate the diameter of fibers ∼200 nm with a smooth surface. The diameters of CNF2A and CNF2B were observed to be ∼170 and ∼120 nm, respectively. It indicates that there is a slight decrease in the diameter of CNF with an increase in the carbonization temperature. However, the edge surface appeared to be amorphous and smooth. FETEM depicts that the interplanar spacings for CNF2, CNF2A, and CNF2B are 0.50, 0.49, and 0.46 nm and correspond to the (002) hkl plane. This interplanar distance decreases with temperature. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern () exhibits diffraction rings, demonstrating the amorphous nature of the carbon, which are assigned to the (002), (110) plane of carbon. These observations indicate that nitrogen doping in CNFs significantly expands the interplaner distance than graphite, which reduces the barrier for Na+ insertion. These observations are in close agreement with the XRD results.  shows the FETEM image with varied magnifications, high-resolution (HR) TEM images, SAED patterns, and nitrogen mapping images of PCNF from which we can clearly infer that the majority of nitrogen has been contributed from melamine along with marginal contribution from polyacrylonitrile. Moreover, the polyacrylonitrile starts decomposing at 280 °C where the decomposition temperature of melamine is 345 °C. The prepared electrospun PAN/Mel nanofibers were stabilized in air at 280 °C, which leads to the decomposition of polyacrylonitrile, and hence, we could infer that the majority of nitrogen contribution has taken place from melamine rather than polyacrylonitrile.\nRaman spectroscopy is an important tool for the investigation of structural defects and nature of carbon materials.  shows the Raman spectra for the CNFs synthesized with different melamine concentrations and carbonization temperatures. CNFs have the D-band at 1354 cm–1 due to the breathing mode of k-point phonons of the A1g symmetry plane with termination by disordered graphite, while the G-band at 1590 cm–1 is designated to the >C═C < E2g phonons of the symmetric stretching vibration sp2 carbon atom (hexagonal graphite).  Disordered graphitic structures in CNFs are clearly illustrated from Raman spectra, which are consistent with XRD. Generally, the intensity of the D-band measures the presence of such disorders (defects) of the graphitic structure. In graphite, the intensity of the D-band is lower than that of the G-band. However, in synthesized CNFs, there is a marginal difference in the intensity of D- and G-band which predicts the formation of a new sp2 structure due to substantial stress. The ID/IG ratios of CNF1, CNF2, and CNF3 are 0.88, 0.89, and 0.94, respectively. With increasing melamine, the ID/IG ratios increase, which confirm that a more distorted structure was formed due to nitrogen doping.  However, with an increase in temperature, CNF2A and CNF2B showed ID/IG ratios of 0.88 and 0.84, respectively. The calculated ID/IG ratios of CNFs demonstrate a high degree of graphitization. With increasing carbonization temperature, the ID/IG ratios of CNFs decrease, which indicate the development of a local short-range ordering.  This high crystallinity in general supports high electrical conductivity as desired for the application in Na-ion batteries. Due to the N-doping in carbon, additional defects are formed in carbon.\nAdditional information of CNF2, CNF2A, and CNF2B toward the surface elemental composition and chemical bonding with configuration was examined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in b–d. As shown in b, there are three main binding energy values located at 284.5 eV corresponding to C 1s, while the values located at 398.5 and 401.1 correspond to N 1s. c shows the HR spectra of C 1s, which are deconvoluted into two peaks, that is, 284.5 and 285.8 representing the sp2 C–C and C–N, respectively. \nd shows three peaks detected in the N 1s spectra in which the peak located at 398.5 eV is assigned to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen (C–N–C), confirming the existence of a graphite-like sp2-bonded carbon.\nA binding energy of 400.1 eV originates from N–(C)3 groups and the weakest peak at 401.1 eV is attributed to amino functions (C–N–H).  The atomic concentration of nitrogen in the CNF2A sample is 10.86%, which reveals its significant contribution in the sample. This demonstrates that the nitrogen is efficiently doped in carbon. The PAN fiber is first oxidized at a temperature of 280 °C. During the stabilization process, the PAN fiber transforms into a stable ladder polymer that converts C≡N into C═N. This develops a cross linkage between the molecules of PAN, which become thermally stable at high temperatures and melting does not reoccur. The thermal stability of the stabilized fibers is attributed to the formation of the ladder structure due to the cyclization of the nitrile groups in an acrylic molecule.  Melamine contains 67% nitrogen by mass, and its derivatives have fire-retardant properties since they releases nitrogen gas when burned. As per the reports, below 300 °C, the product is still a melamine crystal. However, above 500 °C, the product completely transforms into amorphous C3N4. Herein, carbonization is carried out between 800 and 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere. Therefore, during further decomposition, in situ available nitrogen which is successfully doped within carbon is also confirmed via different characterizations. Nitrogen doping in carbon produces copious extrinsic defects as well as enhances the electronic conductivity, which acts as active sites for sodium-ion diffusion. This can significantly improve the electrochemical performance.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Synthesis of PAN-/Mel-Based CNFs\nAll the reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Polyacrylonitrile-/melamine (PAN/Mel)-based CNFs were synthesized by electrospinning, as per our previous work with modification.  Melamine (1, 5, and 10%) was dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). 10 weight % PAN was added to melamine-dispersed DMF solution with continuous stirring and heating to ensure the formation of a homogeneous solution. This polymeric solution was brought into a syringe and ejected (the feed rate was kept at 4 mL/h) by applying a 25 kV bias between the syringe needle and a rotating collector to form nanofibers. The prepared electrospun PAN/Mel nanofibers were stabilized in an air atmosphere at 280 °C. The stabilized nanofibers of 1, 5, and 10% melamine were further heated at 800 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C/min for carbonization to obtain the final products denoted as CNF1, CNF2, and CNF3. In our previous work, we reported that the CNF2 sample gave the best performance and hence sample CNF2 has further been studied in detail.  The CNF2 sample was carbonized at 900 and 1000 °C and products are named as CNF2A and CNF2B, respectively. For the PCNF material, the same synthesis process without the addition of melamine was used and the product was named as PCNF. The electrodes weighed ∼0.5–1 mg.  shows the digital images of the self-standing, flexible CNF anodes.\n\n5.2.  Material Characterization\nThe crystal structures of the PAN-/Mel-based CNFs were examined with a powder XRD technique (Bruker ADVANCED D8) using a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphological and microstructural analyses of the as-synthesized CNFs were investigated with FESEM (Hitachi, S-4800) and FETEM (JEOL; JEM-2200FS). The surface chemical composition was studied with XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Theta Probe). Room-temperature micro-Raman scattering was performed using an HR 800-Raman spectroscope (HORIBA Jobin Yvon France), with an excitation at 532 nm.\n\n5.3.  Electrochemical Measurements\nTo perform electrochemical measurements for a Na-ion cell, 2032-type coin cells were fabricated using the self-standing, flexible tapes of CNFs. These CNF tapes were used without any binding and conductive materials as the working electrode. CNF tapes were cut into circular disks of 16 mm diameter. Metallic sodium foil and quartz filter paper were used as the counter electrode and separator, respectively. 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 in volume) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate was used as an electrolyte. The amount of electrolyte is constant in every cell (250 μL). CV behavior of the half cells was tested on the Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab) between 0.01 and 3 V. The galvanostatic charge–discharge behavior was tested on a MTI battery analyzer (vs Na/Na+) at room temperature. EIS was performed using an amplitude of 5 mV with a frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Pristine MoS2 nanosheets are synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets are then used as the precursor for preparing interlayer-expanded M-MoS2 nanosheets through a second solvothermal method. XRD was used to characterize the crystal structure of pristine MoS2 and M-MoS2. The (002) diffraction of MoS2 is located at 13.7°, revealing an interlayer distance of 0.65 nm (Fig. 2a). After the solvothermal treatment, the (002) diffraction shifts to a lower angle of 11.0°, reflecting the expansion of the interlayer distance to 0.80 nm. The enlarged interlayer distance of M-MoS2 could be attributed to the intercalation of organic compounds. The (102) diffraction of M-MoS2 also shows a shift towards a lower angle, which is consistent with the enlarged interlayer distance along the c-axis. The morphology of M-MoS2 was characterized by SEM and TEM (Fig. 2b–d). The M-MoS2 consists of nanosheets with a size between 100–200 nm, and a thickness below 10 nm, which is similar to the pristine MoS2 (Fig. S1a–c, ESI†). This indicates the nanosheet structure is well maintained during the second solvothermal treatment. The HRTEM image of M-MoS2 shows a 2D laminar structure (Fig. 2e) and the interlayer distance can be clearly observed from the curled edges. The lattice fringes are determined to be 0.80 nm, corresponding to the (002) facet of M-MoS2, larger than that of pristine MoS2 (0.65 nm, Fig. S1d, ESI†). The SAED pattern of M-MoS2 shows two separated diffraction rings, which correspond to the (100) and (110) planes; the same two diffraction rings were also observed in the pristine MoS2 (Fig. S1e, ESI†). The EDS mapping of M-MoS2 is shown in Fig. 2g; the C element is uniformly distributed with Mo and S, indicating the homogenous intercalation of organic compounds.\nTo identify the intercalated species, FTIR tests were performed using the KBr pellet method. As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), M-MoS2 displays two strong signals at 943 and 1292 cm−1, which are attributed to the methyl rocking and deformation modes, respectively. The peak at 700 cm−1 is attributed to the S–C stretching. FTIR tests in paraffin oil were performed to determine the presence of hydroxyl groups (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The O–H stretch vibration of methanol is located at 3356 cm−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), no signal from hydroxyl groups is detected in both MoS2 and M-MoS2. In addition, the three peaks shown in the KBr pellet method are also observed. The FTIR results indicate that the expansion of the interlayer distance in M-MoS2 is not caused by the intercalation of methanol molecules but the functionalization of methyl groups. The carbon content of M-MoS2 is determined by the CHNS/O elemental analyzer to be 3.44 wt%, suggesting a methyl group content of 4.3 wt%.\nXPS was used for phase composition analysis. Fig. 3a shows the Mo 3d spectrum of pristine MoS2. The peaks at 232.1 and 228.9 eV are attributed to the Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 of 2H MoS2, respectively. And the peak located at 226.1 eV is attributed to S 2s. For M-MoS2, the main peaks in the Mo 3d spectrum shift towards lower binding energies, indicating the formation of 1T-phase MoS2 (Fig. 3c). The binding energies of the Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 peaks for 1T-phase MoS2 are ∼0.5 eV lower than those of 2H-phase MoS2, and the peaks located at 235.3 and 232.1 eV could be attributed to Mo(VI). The Mo 3d XPS spectrum demonstrates that the M-MoS2 is dominated by the 1T phase. The S 2p spectrum of pristine MoS2 shows two peaks at 163.2 and 161.8 eV (Fig. 3b). Compared to the pristine MoS2, the M-MoS2 shows two extra peaks from the 1T-phase MoS2 (located at 162.7 and 161.3 eV) and two extra peaks from the newly formed S–C (located at 163.9 eV and 162.5 eV). The S2p spectrum further confirms the functionalization of MoS2 by methyl groups. Raman spectroscopic analysis also confirms the phase transition from 2H to 1T (Fig. S4, ESI†). For pristine MoS2, the two peaks located at 380 and 405 cm−1 represent the in-plane opposite vibration of the S atoms based on Mo atoms (E12g) and out-of-plane opposite vibration of the S atoms (A1g) (Fig. S4a, ESI†). For the M-MoS2, the spectrum shows two additional peaks at around 150 and 320 cm−1, which are ascribed to the J1 and J3 vibration modes of 1T-phase MoS2 (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The XPS and Raman results reveal that the pristine MoS2 is mostly converted from the 2H to 1T phase after methyl functionalization.\nCoin cells (2016-type) were assembled to evaluate the electrochemical performances of M-MoS2 and MoS2. Fig. 4a shows the cycling stability of the samples. At a current density of 1 A g−1, the pristine MoS2 demonstrates a capacity of 174 mA h g−1 at the initial discharge process and fast capacity fading during cycling. After 500 cycles, the capacity fades to 29 mA h g−1 (∼17% capacity retention). In contrast, the M-MoS2 shows an initial discharge capacity of 129 mA h g−1, retaining 64 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles (∼50% capacity retention). The results demonstrate that the M-MoS2 possesses much better cycling stability than the pristine MoS2 in sodium storage. Representative discharge/charge curves are shown Fig. S5 (ESI†). The specific capacity of pristine MoS2 decreases dramatically during cycling, while the specific capacity of M-MoS2 is well maintained. Besides, the discharge/charge curves of M-MoS2 are quasi-linear, revealing a pseudocapacitive sodium storage property. The rate performances are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). At a low current density of 0.2 A g−1, the pristine MoS2 shows an initial specific capacity of 262 mA h g−1, higher than that of M-MoS2 (159 mA h g−1). This is because some of the active sites are occupied by the methyl groups. At a high specific current of 5 A g−1, the specific capacity of M-MoS2 is 69 mA h g−1, showing a capacity retention of 44% against the initial discharge capacity obtained at 0.2 A g−1. At the same current density of 5 A g−1, the specific capacity of MoS2 is merely 17 mA h g−1 (∼6% capacity retention). The enhanced rate capability of M-MoS2 can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer distance, which facilitates Na+ diffusion.\nTo examine the sodium storage mechanisms and electrochemical kinetic properties in the sodium intercalation/de-intercalation processes, CV tests were performed. For the pristine MoS2, there are two anodic peaks at 1.04 and 1.36 V at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 4d). These peaks can be attributed to the two-step intercalation of Na+. There is only one cathodic peak at 1.94 V (Fig. 4b) in the subsequent cathodic process, revealing the one-step de-intercalation of Na+ during charge. For the M-MoS2, there is only one pair of redox peaks in the CV curves at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1, which are located at 1.3/1.62 V. The CV curves of M-MoS2 tend to be more like a capacitor with smaller polarization. For both samples, the anodic and cathodic peaks shift slightly with an increase in scan rate, revealing a feature similar to pseudocapacitive materials. A related analysis of the current dependence on the scan rate is performed by the following relation:\nIn this equation, i is the current, v is the scan rate, a is a constant and the value of b indicates the type of charge storage occurring in the material, which is between 0.5 and 1. If b = 0.5, the current is controlled by semi-infinite linear diffusion (diffusion-controlled process); if b = 1, the current is capacitive (surface-controlled process). To solve the b-values, the log(i) versus log(v) plot is shown Fig. S7 (ESI†). The anodic and cathodic b-values for M-MoS2 are 0.93 and 0.98, respectively (Fig. S7a, ESI†), while those for the pristine MoS2 are 0.80 and 0.87 (calculated from the second anodic peak) (Fig. S7b, ESI†). The results reveal that the electrochemical reactions occurring at the peak current for M-MoS2 are surface-controlled (capacitive). In contrast, the electrochemical reactions occurring at the peak current for pristine MoS2 are still largely diffusion-controlled, indicating that the M-MoS2 shows improved capacitive behaviour over MoS2. The larger cathodic b-values for both M-MoS2 and MoS2 are ascribed to the higher conductivity in the full sodiated state, which facilitates electrochemical reactions.\nAt a particular potential, the current is contributed from both capacitive and diffusion behaviours, thus, the capacitive contributions can be identified by the following equation:\nThe capacitive and diffusion contributions to the current are determined by solving k1 and k2. Fig. 4c and e show the results of the analysis applied to M-MoS2 and pristine MoS2. The capacitive contribution in M-MoS2 is higher than that in pristine MoS2. At a slow rate of 0.1 mV s−1, 68.2% of the capacity of M-MoS2 comes from capacitive processes, which is 13.8% higher than that of pristine MoS2. At 1 mV s−1, the diffusion-controlled contributions are only 20.9% and 14.8% for pristine MoS2 and M-MoS2, respectively. The higher capacitive contribution in M-MoS2 implies that the expanded interlayer can facilitate ion diffusion and thus enhance the rate performance. Moreover, the capacitive contributions to the current at each potential are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). In the peak regions, the current of M-MoS2 is mainly contributed from capacitive processes, which is consistent with the b-value analysis. The b-value and capacity contribution analyses demonstrate that the sodium storage in M-MoS2 is dominated by capacitive processes, which results from the reduced phase transition and enlarged interlayer spacing.\nEx situ XRD was carried out to investigate the structure change during cycling. For pristine MoS2, the initial discharge to 0.6 V is accompanied by a phase transition from 2H MoS2 to sodiated 1T NaxMoS2 (Fig. 5a). The (002) diffraction of MoS2 shifts to 9.6° and becomes the (001) diffraction of 1T NaxMoS2. During the initial discharge, the interlayer distance is expanded from 0.65 to 0.92 nm, corresponding to an expansion ratio of 42% along the c-axis. During the de-sodiation to 3 V, the (001) diffraction shifts back to the original position (the (002) diffraction of MoS2) and the interlayer distance shrinks to 0.65 nm, implying reversible intercalation/de-intercalation processes. As the cycle number increases, the intensity of the (002) diffraction decreases continually, while the intensity of the (100) diffraction is well maintained. After 50 cycles, the (002) diffraction almost disappears, revealing a collapsed 2D structure (Fig. 5c). For M-MoS2, the interlayer distance is expanded to 0.93 nm during the initial discharge to 0.6 V, corresponding to an expansion ratio of 16% along the c-axis (Fig. 5b). This result demonstrates that the structure change in the M-MoS2 is suppressed and the smaller crystallographic change is consistent with the pseudocapacitive characteristics. During cycling, the intensity of the (002) diffraction is well maintained, revealing a stabilized 2D structure (Fig. 5d). Moreover, ex situ SEM was performed after 500 cycles at the current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. S9, ESI†). The SEM image clearly shows that the nanosheet structure of M-MoS2 can be well maintained after cycling, revealing its stable structure. The enhanced structural stability and cycling stability of M-MoS2 can be attributed to its dominant 1T phase as well as the expanded interlayer distance. The former inhibits phase transition, while the later inhibits lattice breathing during intercalation/de-intercalation.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The preparation of pristine MoS2 was modified from a previously reported method. First, 1.366 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 2.534 g CS(NH2)2 and 100 μL HCl were dissolved in 39 mL distilled water. The solution was stirred for 1 h to form a homogeneous and clear solution. Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained products were washed with water and ethanol several times.\nPreparation of M-MoS2. The M-MoS2 was obtained through a second solvothermal method. 0.16 g as-prepared MoS2 was dispersed into 35 mL methanol under stirring for 30 min, followed by sonication for 1 h. The suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained products were washed with ethanol several times.\n\nMaterials characterization\nThe morphology of the as-prepared samples was studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL 7100F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (JEM-2100F). The crystallographic information was obtained through a Bruker D8 DISCOVER X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The phase composition was obtained through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (VG MultiLab 2000). Raman spectroscopy was done on a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw in Via plus at 514.5 nm laser). A 60-SXB IR spectrometer was used to collect the Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) transmittance spectra. The carbon content was determined using a Vario EL cube CHNS/O elemental analyzer.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical performances were evaluated by assembling 2016 coin cells in an argon-filled glove box. The working electrode was prepared by mixing the active material (75 wt%), carbon black (20 wt%), and carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC) (5 wt%) in an appropriate amount of water and then coating the slurry onto Cu foil. For assembling SIBs, sodium metal was used as the anode; 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbon (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 v/v) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the electrolyte; Whatman Glass Micro-fibre Filter (Grade GF/F) was used as the separator. Galvanostatic discharge/charge cycling behaviors were investigated at a potential window ranging from 0.6 to 3 V (vs. Na+/Na) using a multi-channel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was tested with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 605E). All the measurements were performed at room temperature.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The preparation of pristine MoS2 was modified from a previously reported method. First, 1.366 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 2.534 g CS(NH2)2 and 100 μL HCl were dissolved in 39 mL distilled water. The solution was stirred for 1 h to form a homogeneous and clear solution. Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained products were washed with water and ethanol several times.\nPreparation of M-MoS2. The M-MoS2 was obtained through a second solvothermal method. 0.16 g as-prepared MoS2 was dispersed into 35 mL methanol under stirring for 30 min, followed by sonication for 1 h. The suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained products were washed with ethanol several times.\n\nMaterials characterization\nThe morphology of the as-prepared samples was studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL 7100F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (JEM-2100F). The crystallographic information was obtained through a Bruker D8 DISCOVER X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The phase composition was obtained through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (VG MultiLab 2000). Raman spectroscopy was done on a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw in Via plus at 514.5 nm laser). A 60-SXB IR spectrometer was used to collect the Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) transmittance spectra. The carbon content was determined using a Vario EL cube CHNS/O elemental analyzer.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical performances were evaluated by assembling 2016 coin cells in an argon-filled glove box. The working electrode was prepared by mixing the active material (75 wt%), carbon black (20 wt%), and carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC) (5 wt%) in an appropriate amount of water and then coating the slurry onto Cu foil. For assembling SIBs, sodium metal was used as the anode; 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbon (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 v/v) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the electrolyte; Whatman Glass Micro-fibre Filter (Grade GF/F) was used as the separator. Galvanostatic discharge/charge cycling behaviors were investigated at a potential window ranging from 0.6 to 3 V (vs. Na+/Na) using a multi-channel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was tested with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 605E). All the measurements were performed at room temperature.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nThe typical co-impregnation procedure for the fabrication of the M-Fe2O3/C composite is shown in Fig. 1. Mesoporous silica SBA-15 is employed as the sacrificial template. Fe(NO3)3 and sucrose are used as the Fe2O3 precursor and carbon source, respectively. A precursor solution containing Fe(NO3)3, sucrose, and H2SO4 is penetrated into the mesoporous channels of SBA-15. After the calcination in N2 and the subsequent removal of SBA-15 in NaOH solution, the final well-ordered mesoporous M-Fe2O3/C composite with Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded within the carbon walls is obtained. For comparison, the Fe2O3/MC composite was prepared by the incorporation of Fe2O3 precursors into the mesoporous channels of CMK-3.\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of M-Fe2O3/C and Fe2O3/MC composites are shown in Fig. 2a. The peaks of M-Fe2O3/C and Fe2O3/MC can be indexed to the crystalline phase γ-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 39-1346), demonstrating the formation of Fe2O3. Compared with that of Fe2O3/MC, the peak intensity of M-Fe2O3/C is relatively weak, which might indicate the low crystallinity and the small particle size of Fe2O3 in the M-Fe2O3/C composite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of these composites are shown in Fig. 2b. Two distinct peaks are detected at approximately 710.9 eV and 724.7 eV, attributable to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 configurations of Fe3+, respectively. The XPS analyses suggest the formation of Fe2O3 in the M-Fe2O3/C and Fe2O3/MC composites, consistent with the XRD analyses.\nThe morphology and structural feature of the as-prepared M-Fe2O3/C composite were revealed by SEM and TEM observation (Fig. 3). A worm-like morphology, similar to the hard template SBA-15 is well preserved (Fig. 3a). Well-ordered porous channels with a pore size of approximately 4.0 nm in diameter are observed in the TEM image (Fig. 3c). The mesopores are derived from the removal of the hard template. Thus, the pore size of the M-Fe2O3/C composite is in the same range with the wall thickness of SBA-15. Fe2O3 nanoparticles with a particle size not more than 5.0 nm are embedded in the carbon walls. The carbon walls can not only prevent the aggregation of the Fe2O3 nanocrystals, but can also suppress the volume variation during the charge/discharge process. The Fe2O3/MC composite prepared by the incorporation of the Fe2O3 precursor into the mesopores of CMK-3 also has a worm-like morphology, similar to SBA-15 (Fig. 3b). Different from the M-Fe2O3/C composite, Fe2O3 nanoparticles are distributed along the direction of mesoporous channels of CMK-3 (Fig. 3d). These Fe2O3 particles would block the mesoporous channels of CMK-3, impacting the mass transport efficiency within the composite.\nThe structural features of M-Fe2O3/C and Fe2O3/MC composites are also revealed by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 4a). M-Fe2O3/C exhibits type IV isotherms with a marked hysteresis loop in a desorption branch between relative pressures P/P0 of 0.4 and 0.6, which is typical of mesoporous materials. The pore volume and pore size distribution are calculated from the desorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The M-Fe2O3/C composite holds a pore volume of 0.765 cm3 g−1 and relatively narrow pore size distribution with an average pore size of approximately 3.6 nm (Fig. 4b). For the Fe2O3/MC composite, the pore volume is reduced to approximately 0.381 cm3 g−1 and the pore size distribution is around 2.2 to 3.5 nm. The low pore volume, reduced pore size and broadened pore size distribution of Fe2O3/MC are resulted from the formation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles within the porous channels of CMK-3, consistent with the TEM observation. As determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), the contents of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in both M-Fe2O3/C and Fe2O3/MC are approximately 36.7 wt% (Fig. S1, ESI†).\nThe electrochemical performance of the M-Fe2O3/C composite as an electrode material for SIBs was evaluated by performing cyclic voltammogram (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments. Fig. 5a shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the M-Fe2O3/C electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. In the first cathodic scan, two distinct peaks are observed at 1.19 V and 0.65 V, ascribed to the irreversible formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and the reduction of Fe2O3, respectively. In the following anodic scan, the reduction peak of Fe2O3 shifts to 0.75 V. The corresponding reversible oxidation process occurs at approximately 0.84 V and 1.6 V, which is ascribed to the oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ and subsequent Fe2+ to Fe3+, respectively. Negligible changes are observed in the following scans, suggesting the high reversibility and excellent cycling stability of the M-Fe2O3/C composite.\nThe first five galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles of the M-Fe2O3/C electrode at a current density of 50 mA g−1 are shown in Fig. 5b. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the M-Fe2O3/C electrode calculated based on the total weight of the composite are 980.3 and 423.8 mA h g−1, respectively, giving a coulombic efficiency of 43.2%. The low coulombic efficiency is due to the irreversible formation of a SEI film during the discharge process. Two plateaus are observed in the first discharge profile, consistent with the CV analysis. After 5 cycles, the discharge and charge capacities are 412.7 and 391.9 mA h g−1 respectively. A high coulombic efficiency of over 90% is achieved after the second discharge/charge cycle, indicating the high reversibility of the M-Fe2O3/C electrode. For comparison, the electrochemical performance of the Fe2O3/MC composite was also evaluated by galvanostatic charge/discharge tests at a current density of 50 mA g−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The Fe2O3/MC composite delivers an initial discharge capacity of 578.6 mA h g−1, much lower than that of M-Fe2O3/C. Given the fact that the contents of Fe2O3 in these two composites are quite similar, the high specific capacity of M-Fe2O3/C is ascribed to the well-ordered mesoporous structure with open pore channels. For the Fe2O3/MC composite, the formation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles within the mesoporous channels would block the transport path for the electrolyte and Na+ ions. In addition, it is possible that those Fe2O3 nanoparticles entrapped deeply in the mesopores could not be reached by the electrolyte and Na+ ions, consequently leading to the low specific capacity of Fe2O3/MC.\nThe cycling performances of M-Fe2O3/C and Fe2O3/MC at the current density of 100 mA g−1 are shown in Fig. 5c. It is obvious that M-Fe2O3/C shows better cycling performance than Fe2O3/MC. Discharged/charged at a current density of 100 mA g−1, high discharge and charge capacities of 689.2 and 292.3 mA h g−1, respectively, are achieved for the first cycle, giving an initial efficiency of approximately 42.4%. After 100 cycles, a charge capacity of approximately 270.1 mA h g−1 is still maintained for M-Fe2O3/C, corresponding to approximately 7.6% fading of the initial capacity. After 100 cycles under the same conditions, the charge capacity of Fe2O3/MC is only 168.4 mA h g−1, much lower than that of M-Fe2O3/C. For M-Fe2O3/C, the specific charge capacity of the second cycle increases to 318.6 mA h g−1. The increase in the specific capacity might be due to the activation of the electrode material. However, such an activation process for Fe2O3/MC is over the initial 10 cycles. This gradual activation of Fe2O3/MC might be due to the pore blockage of Fe2O3/MC.\nThe rate capabilities of the M-Fe2O3/C and Fe2O3/MC anodes are evaluated at different current densities from 100 to 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5d). The specific discharge capacities of M-Fe2O3/C are 270, 226, 194, and 166 mA h g−1 at current densities of 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. When the current density was switched from 2000 mA g−1 to 100 mA g−1, the specific capacity of approximately 265 mA h g−1 is recovered. However, for Fe2O3/MC, a specific capacity as low as 79 mA h g−1 is achieved at a current density of 2000 mA g−1.\nThe excellent cycling stability of the M-Fe2O3/C composite was further demonstrated by discharge/charge tests at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5e). After 300 cycles, M-Fe2O3/C still delivers a specific discharge capacity of 101.9 mA h g−1, much higher than those reported in the literature. And the coulombic efficiency was almost 100% after 10 cycles, further confirming the superior electrochemical performance of M-Fe2O3/C. Composites with Fe2O3 contents of 26.6% and 62.3%, denoted as M-Fe2O3/C-1 and M-Fe2O3/C-2, respectively were also prepared following the same co-impregnation method and tested under the same conditions (Fig. S3, ESI†). With the high carbon content and ordered mesoporous structure, M-Fe2O3/C-1 shows quite stable cycling performance. However, its specific capacity is approximately 50 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles, much lower than that of M-Fe2O3/C. M-Fe2O3/C-2 with an Fe2O3 content of 62.3% exhibits a high initial specific capacity with poor cycling stability. With the increase in the Fe2O3 content, a large amount of Fe2O3 would attach to the surface of the composite, blocking the ordered mesoporous structure and consequently impacting the electrochemical performance. This result further demonstrates the importance of an accessible mesoporous structure for good sodium ion storage performance. As revealed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses (Fig. S4, ESI†), the resistance of M-Fe2O3/C is much smaller than that of Fe2O3/MC after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1. It is supposed that the well-ordered mesoporous structure would reduce the solid/electrolyte interface resistance effectively, improving the charge transfer rate and ion migration rate.\nThe better electrochemical performance is attributed to the structural features of M-Fe2O3/C. First, the well-ordered mesoporous structure with a large specific surface area and high porosity plays an essential role in improving the electrochemical performance of M-Fe2O3/C. The co-impregnation preparation strategy ensures the formation of ordered open mesoporous channels, which provide a fast transportation path for the electrolyte and Na+ ions. The large specific surface area provides plenty of active sites for the diffusion of Na+ ions. The high porosity derived from the mesoporous structure would accommodate a significant volume variation upon discharging/charging. The thin mesoporous wall shortens the diffusion distance for Na+ ions, contributing to the rate performance. Second, the incorporation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles with a high theoretical capacity significantly increases the specific capacity of the composite. In addition, carbon formed during the heating process not only contributes to the specific capacity of the composite, but also functions as a conducting matrix to enhance the electron conductivity of the composite. In addition, the carbon coating would buffer the large volume expansion of Fe2O3 nanoparticles upon the discharge process.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental section\n\n2.1 Preparation of hard template SBA-15\nThe mesoporous silica SBA-15 was synthesized following the procedure reported in the literature. First, 5.3 g Pluronic P123 (EO20PPO70EO20) was dissolved in 200 mL of 1.6 M HCl at 40 °C. Then 11.3 g tetraethylorthosilicate was added slowly to the above solution with vigorous stirring. After being stirred at 40 °C for 24 h, the mixture was put into an autoclave and heated at 110 °C for 24 h. The filtered samples were dried and calcined at 600 °C in air to obtain the SBA-15 template.\n\n2.2 Synthesis of M-Fe2O3/C composite by a co-impregnation method\nThe typical co-impregnation procedure is as follows. First, 0.5 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 1.25 g sucrose were dissolved in 5 mL of water containing 0.14 g H2SO4. Then this solution was incorporated into 1.0 g SBA-15 by sonication. The resulting mixture was heated in an oven at 100 °C for 6 h and subsequently at 160 °C for 12 h. The above impregnation process was repeated once with a solution containing Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.32 g), sucrose (0.8 g), and H2SO4 (0.09 g). After the co-impregnation procedure, the obtained precursor composite was thermally treated at 600 °C for 5 h in N2 with a heating ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 to carbonize the whole composite. The resulting material was washed with hot 1 M NaOH solution several times to remove the hard template. After washing with distilled water and drying at 60 °C, a well-ordered mesoporous M-Fe2O3/C composite was obtained. Mesoporous M-Fe2O3/C composites with different Fe2O3 contents can also be prepared by adjusting the amount of Fe precursors.\n\n2.3 Synthesis of Fe2O3/MC composite\nFirst, the mesoporous carbon template CMK-3 was prepared by using SBA-15 as the hard template and sucrose as the carbon source via the procedure reported in the literature. Then, the mesoporous CMK-3 template (0.4 g) was added to a precursor solution prepared by dissolving Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1 g) into 20 mL ethanol with vigorous stirring. After drying, a similar calcination procedure to that of M-Fe2O3/C was adopted to obtain the Fe2O3/MC composite.\n\n2.4 Characterization\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with a scan rate of 6° min−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer using monochromated Al Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation was performed on a FEI Nova NanoSEM 2300. The microstructure was characterized with a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, Japan) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption analyses were conducted with a Quadrasorb at 77 K with samples degassed at 200 °C for 16 h in advance. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a SDT Q600 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air.\n\n2.5 Electrochemical measurements\nActive materials (80 wt%), Super-P (10 wt%), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, 10 wt%) were mixed in water to form a slurry. The slurry was spread onto a Cu foil with a doctor blade method, followed by drying in a vacuum at 70 °C for 12 h. CR2016 coin cells were assembled in an argon-atmosphere glove box with a Millipore glass fiber membrane as the separator, Na metal as the anode, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate (1:1:0.1 v/v/v) as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge and discharge experiments were performed with a battery tester LANDCT2001A in the potential range of 0.01–3 V (vs. Na+/Na) at room temperature. The specific capacity was calculated based on the whole mass of the M-Fe2O3/C composite. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT302N) at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in a potential range of 0.01–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were also performed on the electrochemical workstation from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The filtered samples were dried and calcined at 600 °C in air to obtain the SBA-15 template.\n\n2.2 Synthesis of M-Fe2O3/C composite by a co-impregnation method\nThe typical co-impregnation procedure is as follows. First, 0.5 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 1.25 g sucrose were dissolved in 5 mL of water containing 0.14 g H2SO4. Then this solution was incorporated into 1.0 g SBA-15 by sonication. The resulting mixture was heated in an oven at 100 °C for 6 h and subsequently at 160 °C for 12 h. The above impregnation process was repeated once with a solution containing Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.32 g), sucrose (0.8 g), and H2SO4 (0.09 g). After the co-impregnation procedure, the obtained precursor composite was thermally treated at 600 °C for 5 h in N2 with a heating ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 to carbonize the whole composite. The resulting material was washed with hot 1 M NaOH solution several times to remove the hard template. After washing with distilled water and drying at 60 °C, a well-ordered mesoporous M-Fe2O3/C composite was obtained. Mesoporous M-Fe2O3/C composites with different Fe2O3 contents can also be prepared by adjusting the amount of Fe precursors.\n\n2.3 Synthesis of Fe2O3/MC composite\nFirst, the mesoporous carbon template CMK-3 was prepared by using SBA-15 as the hard template and sucrose as the carbon source via the procedure reported in the literature. Then, the mesoporous CMK-3 template (0.4 g) was added to a precursor solution prepared by dissolving Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1 g) into 20 mL ethanol with vigorous stirring. After drying, a similar calcination procedure to that of M-Fe2O3/C was adopted to obtain the Fe2O3/MC composite.\n\n2.4 Characterization\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with a scan rate of 6° min−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer using monochromated Al Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation was performed on a FEI Nova NanoSEM 2300. The microstructure was characterized with a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, Japan) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption analyses were conducted with a Quadrasorb at 77 K with samples degassed at 200 °C for 16 h in advance. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a SDT Q600 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air.\n\n2.5 Electrochemical measurements\nActive materials (80 wt%), Super-P (10 wt%), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, 10 wt%) were mixed in water to form a slurry. The slurry was spread onto a Cu foil with a doctor blade method, followed by drying in a vacuum at 70 °C for 12 h. CR2016 coin cells were assembled in an argon-atmosphere glove box with a Millipore glass fiber membrane as the separator, Na metal as the anode, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate (1:1:0.1 v/v/v) as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge and discharge experiments were performed with a battery tester LANDCT2001A in the potential range of 0.01–3 V (vs. Na+/Na) at room temperature. The specific capacity was calculated based on the whole mass of the M-Fe2O3/C composite. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT302N) at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in a potential range of 0.01–3 V (vs. Na+/Na). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were also performed on the electrochemical workstation from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

No clear signals from other TiO2 phases are observed in the spectrum. The as-prepared x% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT nanocomposite retains the typical TiO2 diffraction peaks. The peak positions did not alter, even after the formation of x% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT nanocomposites that suggest the presence of Mn-ions (2+, 4+) in a highly dispersed state along with their insertion into the TiO2 lattice. The less intense and broad peak features with increasing Mn-doping levels imply that the crystalline structure of TiO2 slightly degrades during substitution of Ti4+ by Mn-ions. The lower crystallite size with doping is due to the restricted crystal growth of TiO2 after the incorporation of Mn-ions. A low angle broad diffraction peak located at 12.03° in all the nanocomposite samples is due to the increased interlayer spacing of graphene sheets after functionalization of MWCNTs (Fig. 1a).\nTGA analysis was performed to confirm the thermal stability and wt% of MWCNTs and TiO2 in the nanocomposites. The first step weight loss below 200 °C is due to residual water evaporation, while a steep decrease in mass is observed from 200–600 °C due to the combustion of MWCNTs, and finally, a very slow loss up to 1000 °C. TGA data show a MWCNT wt% of about 5% in the entire nanocomposite samples, which is consistent with our synthesis procedure, confirming that negligible loss of MWCNTs occurred during the nanocomposite synthesis procedure. The results also confirm an optimal amount of TiO2 for all nanocomposite samples, as inferred from the high wt% of residue. The TiO2 phase is quite stable with almost no weight loss up to 1000 °C, other than the loss of some moisture below 200 °C. The inset of Fig. 2 shows that the functionalized MWCNTs are completely decomposed at about 720 °C; however, the same happens at about 600 °C in the nanocomposite samples. The reason was earlier reported to be the presence of excess oxygen in the form of metal oxides present on the MWCNT surface, leading to the accelerated combustion of graphene layers.\nFig. 2a shows the Raman spectra of samples that were obtained. For bare TiO2, a well-defined peak at 148 cm−1 is confirmation of the Eg vibration mode of anatase TiO2. This vibration is observed to be slightly shifted to a higher frequency due to Mn-doping and the involvement of MWCNTs while forming nanocomposite structures. The Eg mode at low frequency is due to O–Ti–O bending vibrations, and is particularly sensitive to any oxygen deficiency. The substitution of Mn in titanium sites causes a perturbation in the phonon states of TiO2 lattice, resulting in a gradual red shift in the low frequency Eg mode of TiO2. Other characteristic anatase vibrations appearing at 396, 507 and 632 cm−1 are due to B1g, A1g, and E1g vibration modes. In the Raman spectra of nanocomposite samples, two additional vibrations at 1593 and 1335 cm−1 are due to graphitic and defect structures in graphene layers of MWCNTs, respectively. A strong D-band instead of G-band indicates a larger defect structure after functionalization of the MWCNTs, generating useful functional moieties for capturing metal nanoparticles for efficient nanocomposite formation.\nThe specific surface area (SSA) and pore distribution of samples are estimated from BET and BJH analysis. The bare TiO2 sample shows a type-III isotherm indicating no mesoporosity, while the 5% Mn-TiO2 and 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT sample demonstrate type-IV isotherms with surface areas of 79 and 123 m2 g−1, respectively. The much higher surface area of MWCNT supported nanocomposite samples is definitely due to the large surface area of MWCNTs offering sites for the anchoring of metal particles. The mean pore size of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT nanocomposite sample is in the range of 2–5 nm with a pore volume of 25.12 cm3 g−1, as compared with the mean pore size of 9–10 nm and pore volume of 10.02 cm3 g−1 for 5% Mn-TiO2. The optimal surface area along with a suitable pore size is highly crucial for better Li+-ion conductivity of these samples.\nThe TEM of bare TiO2 displays irregularly shaped nanoparticles with an approximate diameter of 35–40 nm. Fig. 3b shows that the TiO2 nanoparticles after doping with Mn-ions are lower in size, due to defect structure. The nanoparticles are regularly attached on the surface of MWCNTs, with few smaller particles inside the tube in the nanocomposite structure. Very few aggregates are noticed on the surface of MWCNTs, and the metal oxide particle sizes are retained, owing to restriction in nucleation and particle growth. The increase in internal diameter of the MWCNTs is observed after incorporation of metal oxide particles, due to the degradation of graphene layers. It appears from the energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping results in Fig. 3d–g that the distribution of 5% Mn-doped TiO2 is fairly uniform on the surface of MWCNTs, with nearly no scattered particles observed.\nThe XPS survey scan obtained to identify the elements present on the surface of the samples confirmed the presence of carbon, oxygen, titanium, and manganese. Fig. 4 shows the Mn 2p, O 1s, Ti 2p, and C 1s spectra that were obtained to investigate the surface oxidation states. The Mn 2p3/2 peak is deconvoluted into two sub-peaks located at 640.6 and 642.3 eV, which indicate the presence of Mn2+ and Mn4+ oxidation states, respectively. The peak at 647.6 eV corresponds to shake-up satellite structures below the main Mn 2p peaks. The quantitative analysis shows that Mn2+ and Mn4+ exist in a 1:1 ratio (50% each). The coexistence of two different oxidation states is due to charge transfer between Mn and Ti atoms leading to Mn2+ along with Mn4+.Fig. 4 shows the Ti 2p spectrum, in which the two spin–orbit components at 458.45 and 464.20 eV are attributed to the anatase phase of TiO2. Between these two peaks, there is a binding energy difference of about 5.6 eV, which agrees well with the energy reported for Ti4+ in an oxygen environment. The O 1s core level is resolved into three sub-peaks located at 529.8, 531.7 and 533.6 eV, typically showing the presence of Mn–O–Mn, Ti–O, and CO/–COOH configurations, respectively. The C 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into four peaks. The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV is assigned to the sp2-configuration of carbon, whereas the peak at 286.2 eV is due to C–OH bonded carbon. The other small peaks located at 287.4 and 288.8 eV indicate the C–O–C and CO groups, correspondingly.\nFig. 5a shows the Ti L-edge NEXAFS spectra of pure TiO2 and 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNTs, where Ti displays more or less a TiO6 octahedral environment. The Ti L-edge consist of two-fold symmetrical spin–orbit splitting of titanium 2p level into 2p1/2 (L2-edge) and 2p3/2 (L3-edge), and 2-fold splitting of 3d levels in the octahedral field. Pre-edge features p1 and p2 are typical for core hole d-electron coupling. In L-3 edge features, A and B represent the transition from a Ti 2p3/2 state to T2g and Eg unoccupied states, respectively. Similarly, peaks C and D in L-2 edge show the transition from Ti 2p1/2 state to T2g and Eg unoccupied states, respectively. In the L-2 edge, the separation energy between T2g and Eg, which is about 1.9 eV in pure TiO2 and about 2.0 eV for TiO2/MWCNTs and 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNTs, is in good agreement with the anatase phase of TiO2, with some distortion from Oh to D2d symmetry. Although the intensities of T2g and Eg of the L-2 edge of doped and undoped TiO2 have been changed, it doesn't correspond to any other phase of the TiO2.\nOxygen K-edge consists of the characteristic doublet appearing at photon energies of 531.6 (A) and 534.2 eV (B). The doublet arises as a result of an electron transfer from the O 1s orbital to a covalently mixed state derived from O 2p and Mn and Ti-3d states. The crystal field splitting value of 2.6 eV suggests that Mn-ions have replaced the Ti-atoms in the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT matrix. Peaks appearing at 539.8 and 545.2 eV are assigned to electronic transitions from O 1s to O 2p covalently hybridized with Mn and Ti hybrid states. A unique feature appearing at photon energies of about 553 eV (E) rules out the presence of any other oxidation state of Ti, and is related to the long-range ordered structure of TiO2. The increase in intensity of T2g and Eg upon doping along with the ligand field splitting [Δd = E(Eg) − E(T2g)] value confirms that Mn occupies the Ti position in the TiO2 matrix.\nMn L-edge NEXAFS spectra show the presence of Mn2+ and Mn4+ species. Peaks at 653.6 and 641.4 eV correspond to Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2, respectively. The Mn 2p3/2 peak has a sub-peak at 642.4 eV that is characteristic of Mn4+.\nCarbon K-edge is characterized by a peak at 284.6 eV that demonstrates the electronic excitation from the C 1s level to the conduction π* levels of sp2-hybridized C. A small pre-peak appearing at a photon energy of 282.8 eV reveals the presence of a very small amount of Ti-C that may belong to the carbon-doped titania nanoparticles of very small size (<10 nm), mainly confined inside the MWCNTs, as exposed by TEM. Peaks appearing at 287.0 and 288.4 eV are assigned to σ* transitions of oxygen-bearing moieties of the functionalized MWCNTs, while the transitions at 291.3 and 291.6 eV may belong to the C 1s-to-σ* transition of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms within the layers of MWCNTs.\n\nElectrochemical lithium-storage performance\nThe bare and x% Mn-doped TiO2 (x = 3%, 5%, and 7 wt%) electrodes with MWCNTs are tested as anodes for LIBs and SIBs, using Li and Na metal as counter electrodes, respectively. The Mn-doped TiO2/MWCNT has a tetragonal anatase TiO2 structure with a distorted octahedral oxygen environment (TiO6), bearing tetrahedral–octahedral sites for Li-occupancy. The intercalation mechanism proceeds via two-phase equilibrium between a Li-rich orthorhombic and a Li-poor tetragonal phase, according to eqn (1). The theoretical capacity is calculated to be 336 mA h g−1 considering y = 1; however, in general y = 0.5 in anatase TiO2, due to stronger Li–Li repulsion reaching a theoretical capacity of 168 mA h g−1.\nThe major capacity is derived from the redox reaction responsible for converting Ti4+ to Ti3+ during charge–discharge, along with some contribution from carbonaceous reactions in eqn (2). The capacity observed in this study is more than the usual insertion rate of 0.5, due to effective Mn-doping, along with the contribution of highly conducting MWCNTs.\nFig. 6a shows the charge/discharge profile of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT electrode at various charge–discharge cycles between 1.0 to 3.0 V at a current rate of 0.1C. A clear discharge plateau at 1.75 V and the corresponding charge plateau at 1.92 V confirm the initial anatase TiO2 structure. The discharge curve is further divided into three parts, with the first region of rapid potential drop up to 1.85 V, due to insertions of Li+ into TiO2 host. A plateau at 1.75 V is due to two-phase reaction with Li-rich and Li-poor phases, followed by a linear voltage drop to cut-off voltage, due to further Li+-insertion up to the maximal capacity of TiO2. As the maximal capacity observed for TiO2-based electrodes is between 1.0 and 2.0 V, which is at a higher potential than that of conventional graphite electrode, it is an important factor from the viewpoint of the safety and stability of LIBs. Longer voltage plateaus with lower polarization (Vch–Vdis) are observed for Mn-doped and MWCNT supported electrodes in comparison with bare TiO2, confirming the significance of Mn-doping and MWCNTs (Fig. S1†). All the electrodes show a clear difference between the 1st and 2nd cycle charge capacities, due to some well known interfacial reactions between the active materials and the electrolyte. The large irreversible capacity decay for the bare TiO2 is due to poor intrinsic conductivity, the formation of the surface insulating layer, and possible volume changes. A charge capacity of 226.3 mA h g−1 for a 5%-Mn electrode in the 1st cycle is retained at 176.4 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles, due to conductive MWCNTs and the better defect structure caused by appropriate Mn-doping, which reduces the conduction area between TiO2 and electrolyte, thus minimizing irreversible side reactions. On the other hand, MWCNTs help TiO2 strongly anchor to their surface, and reduce the chances of developing an insulating layer. Due to this, the charge–discharge reactions are highly reversible in succeeding cycles, and the curves are almost identical, suggesting stable electrode kinetics.\nFig. 6b shows the cycle life of all electrodes at a constant current density of 0.1C, which further proves that all nanocomposite electrodes show high performance, as compared with the bare TiO2. The reversible charge capacities of bare TiO2, TiO2/MWCNTs and 3%, 5%, and 7% Mn-doped samples are 119.9, 137.4, 154.3, 176.4, and 148.9 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. S1†). The coulombic efficiency of 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNTs approached 98.4%, asserting the usefulness of appropriate Mn-doping concentration with MWCNTs for larger reversibility of electrode reactions, together with the stability of TiO2 nanostructures on the MWCNT surface. MWCNTs possess a high surface area together with a tubular network structure, to facilitate electrolyte permeation, and accelerate ionic conductivity.\nThe performance of TiO2-based electrodes is also measured between 0.1 and 20C current rates. High charge capacities of 226.3, 180.5, 154.5, 133.8, 113.5, 90.8, 74.2, and 59.1 mA h g−1 are delivered by the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT electrode, which is the highest among all samples (Fig. 6c). At higher current rates, a clear difference in specific capacities is noted for bare TiO2 and doped TiO2 electrodes at the MWCNT surface, as shown in Fig. 6d. The specific capacity of TiO2 significantly fades from 143.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C to only 19.1 mA h g−1 at 20C, and cannot rise to its average level when the testing current returns to 0.1C. After operating the cells at high current densities, when it is switched back to 0.1C, a stable charge capacity of 131.2 mA h g−1 is achieved for the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT electrode, indicating the highest stability of the electrode as compared with other electrodes. These results further confirm the best Li-storage performance of this electrode combination for long cycle life and high rate capability. At higher current rates, this drastically improved performance is due to (1) Mn-doping and increased Ti4+ vacancies that enhance electronic conductivity, along with (2) better surface area, due to smaller sized particles compared with the bare TiO2. The capacities obtained in this study are compared with some already reported hetero-metal doped TiO2 electrodes and TiO2 on carbonaceous supports (Table 1).\nIn comparison with bare TiO2, the better electrochemical performance of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNTs is credited to the high surface area allowing proper electrolyte penetration, and greater interfacial area of contact between the electrolyte and electrode, increasing Li+-ion flux through the interface. The porous network structure of MWCNTs shortens Li+-ion transmission distances, hence speeding up the intercalation mechanism. The appropriate doping level suppresses the growth of TiO2 particles, and keeps them in the nano range, which is helpful in improving the stability and kinetics of electrode reactions during charge/discharge. It is also believed that doping Mn-ions in TiO2 lattice results in increased Ti4+ vacancies generating increased free holes, contributing towards intercalation. Mn2+ (0.83 Å) is believed to be responsible for overall expansion in the TiO2 lattice (Ti4+ = 0.61 Å) while a negligible lattice contraction is caused by the presence of Mn4+ (0.53 Å). Mn2+ may not be useful for battery cycling as it makes the SEI layer unstable, but we did not encounter such a capacity fading issue, and also, Mn2+-ions are vulnerable to further oxidization to higher oxidation states due to fast Li interchange kinetics.\nThe creation of vacancies highly contributes to ionic conductivity. It has already been established that ionic and electronic conductivity can be best controlled by optimized dopant concentration and nanosizing of TiO2 particles. Furthermore, the decoration of TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of MWCNTs enables π–π interaction of graphene sheets, and results in reducing the degree of restacking of graphene layers, presenting a large contact area between electrode/electrolyte, and hence increases in charge/discharge rates.\nIt is worth mentioning that with increased Mn-doping, the electrochemical performance increases up to 5% of Mn, but then drops for 7% Mn-doped samples. One of the contributors could be the larger surface area achieved for 7% Mn-doped samples, which results in decreased cycle performance because of large SEI formation, which hinders the effective permeation of electrolyte, and hence increases the charge transfer resistance, resulting in unstable cyclic performance. Furthermore, an abnormality in the band gap of TiO2 is observed with 7% Mn substitution in TiO2, which results in lowering of conduction electrons, and hence capacity (Fig. S2†).\n\nElectrochemical sodium-storage performance\nIn comparison with the Li-cell, a lower potential range was chosen for sodium cells to achieve better capacity. In the first galvanostatic charge/discharge cycle in Fig. 7a, a typically extended plateau at about 0.17 V, which seems endless and is limited by the imposed time, is due to the irreversible SEI formation on the surface of TiO2, and is not observed for Li-cells with TiO2 electrodes. Three distinct regions in the discharge curve include a steep plateau above 1.3 V, a sloping curve down to 0.3 V, and finally a flat voltage up to 0.01 V. No other voltage plateau is apparent, except for a shoulder in the charging curve beyond 2.4 V, which is in accordance with the theoretical limits. The insertion of sodium into the TiO2 host also results in the conversion of Ti4+ to Ti3+, according to eqn (3):\nWhen TiO2-based electrodes are used as an anode, the initial charge capacities of the bare TiO2 and the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT electrode are 143.2 and 152.1 mA h g−1, respectively. In the subsequent cycles, the charge capacity of both electrodes is decreased, with a final capacity of 107.0 and 121.4 mA h g−1 for the bare TiO2 and the doped nanocomposite electrode, respectively. The rapid decrease of capacity in the initial few cycles is due to SEI formation, along with the irreversible capture of Na+ on the surface, and within the TiO2 matrix. After the initial few cycles, the lower coulombic efficiency (76.7%) increases dramatically to 92.8%, and the cyclic capacity of the electrodes stabilizes with slow fading (Fig. 7b).\nFig. 7c and d show the rate capability for the Na+-ion insertion–extraction process, which is also evaluated at various current densities from 0.1 to 20C. Achieving good rate capability is a substantial challenge for SIBs, due to the apparent volume changes upon insertion of large Na+-ions in the host matrix. The charge capacities for 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT nanocomposite electrode are calculated to be 152.1, 116.1, 97.2, 86.0, 75.8, 59.6, 40.0, and 24.3 mA h g−1 from 0.1 to 20C, respectively, demonstrating good rate capability as an anode for SIBs. The slow decline of charge capacity with increasing current rates for 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT electrode confirms that Mn-doping along with MWCNT network imparts remarkable rate performance. In particular, when the current density is decreased to 0.1C, the nanocomposite electrode after high rates can still demonstrate capacity as high as 117.2 mA h g−1, while bare TiO2 shows a very low capacity of 58.7 mA h g−1, possibly due to irreversible structural changes. This weak performance of TiO2 at higher current rates shows the inferior rate capability of the bare TiO2 electrode. Here, the significance of MWCNTs is highlighted, bearing a tunnel structure for fast ion diffusion, holding particles together, and acting as a buffer to alleviate any volume changes at high current rates. The rate capability studies show that the nanocomposite electrode can endure a large current, and has a good capability for a high charge storage system. Fig. 7c shows the charging curves at different current densities from 0.1 to 20C, which also show that the rate capacity of 5% Mn-doped TiO2 is much better than that of the bare TiO2. The charge curves demonstrate a small plateau at 0.9 V.\nThe effect of improvement in powder tap density is displayed in the form of high charge capacity per volume of the electrodes in Fig. S3.† The 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNTs exhibit a high electrode density of 1.22 g cm−3, which is 1.71 times higher than that of pure TiO2. The volumetric charge capacity of 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNTs (213.5 mA h cm−3) after 80 cycles is substantially higher than that for pure TiO2 (85.1 mA h cm−3) without sacrificing cyclability. Mesoporous materials composed of densely packed nanocrystals are the best choice as electrode materials due to their high tap density and hence volumetric capacities. As shown in Fig. 2, the pure TiO2 possesses an average pore size greater than 50 nm while the doped samples display a type-IV mesoporous structure. Such mesoporous electrode materials possess high particle mobility and easily form a compact electrode layer with high electrode density. The TEM image in Fig. 3a and b also demonstrates that the TiO2 particles are aggregated while doped samples are not completely merged together ensuring porosity and hence high tap density.\nFig. 8a and b show a comparison of all of the electrode systems tested in this study. The observed lower capacity of SIBs, as compared with LIBs is possibly due to the slower diffusion of the larger Na+-ion (1.02 Å) than the smaller Li+-ion (0.76 Å), and relatively less accommodation of Na+-ion on TiO2 electrodes. Due to the smaller ionic radii of Li+, it can be accommodated in the interlayer spacing of (001) and (110) planes of TiO2; however, only (001) planes with a relatively large spacing of 0.56 nm can accommodate the bigger Na+-ions, leading to lower electrochemical capacities for sodium-cells. Large volume changes are obvious when Na+-ions are inserted in (001) spacing, leading to volume expansion of up to 0.64–0.68 nm. For bare TiO2, this volume expansion results in rapid structural deterioration, while for nanocomposite electrode, the MWCNTs act as a buffer to circumvent these changes. The insertion of Na+-ion into MWCNTs is less likely, due to the larger Na+-ion radius. The suitable doping of Mn also leads to lattice expansion, which results in ease of Na+-ion diffusion.\nMore specifically, the optimized Mn-doping leads to lowering in the band gap (Fig. S2†), thus decreasing the electronic resistance, which is beneficial for surface charge transfer processes in multiple cycles. In addition, the optimal doping level can enhance the specific surface area to a suitable level, along with nanosizing for large electrode/electrolyte contact. Moreover, the highly conductive MWCNT network makes a great contribution towards sodium storage capacity. The capacities reported in this study are either better than, or comparable to, those reported in most of the early studies on similar TiO2-based electrodes (Table 2).\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Cellulose nitrate membrane filter (0.22 µm) was obtained from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Germany, and MWCNTs were purchased from China. All of the chemicals were used as such, without any further purification.\n\nSample preparation\nMWCNTs were functionalized using a literature-cited method. Briefly, 200 mg of MWCNTs were oxidized at 400 °C for 30 min for the removal of amorphous carbon, followed by sonication and reflux in 3 M HCl at 70 °C for 3 h to remove metal catalyst impurities, and incorporated into the MWCNTs during the synthesis process.\nThese purified MWCNTs (100 mg) were transferred to a two-neck round-bottomed flask, and were sonicated in a 1:1.5 mixture of 6 M NaNO2 and 6 M HCl for 8 h at ∼0 °C. The mixture was then diluted with deionized water, filtered through a cellulose nitrate membrane filter (0.22 µm pore size), washed several times to neutral pH, and vacuum-dried overnight at 80 °C.\nSynthesis of x% Mn-TiO2/MWCNTs was carried out by a modified controlled hydrolysis method. TTIP (97, 95 and 93 wt%) was added to 80 ml of isopropanol, and 1% Triton X-100 was added to it, along with 5 wt% of well-dispersed aqueous MWCNTs. A pH of ∼2 was obtained using 1 M HCl, and the solution was stirred for 15 min. A solution of Mn(OAc)2·4H2O (3, 5, and 7 wt%) was prepared in water, and slowly added to the above solution. The slurry was stirred for 15 min, and precipitated by aqueous NaOH (pH > 12). The precipitates were filtered, washed with 0.1 M HCl until neutral pH was obtained, dried at 100 °C, and calcined at 400 °C for 6 h in air. Similarly, undoped-TiO2/MWCNTs and 3%, 5%, and 7% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT samples were synthesized.\n\nSample characterization\nXRD measurements were made by using PANalytical X'pert PRO MRD XL. Thermal analysis was done in a Mettler-Toledo thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Approximately 20 mg of powder sample was heated in an open alumina pan in oxidative (air) atmosphere (10 ml min−1) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Raman spectra of samples were recorded on JASCO NRS-3300 spectrometer equipped with a 532.1 nm diode laser. The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area of samples was determined by Coulter SA-3100 analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature, while pore size distribution was measured by using the Barrett Joyner Halenda (BJH) method. For surface morphology, transmission electron microscope (TEM) EFI-Titans was utilized, where samples were dispersed in ethanol, sonicated in an ultrasonic bath, and a drop of supernatant suspension was poured onto a carbon-coated copper TEM grid for analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done using a Scienta-Omicron XPS instrument equipped with a micro-focused monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The source was operated at 15 keV and with 700-micron spot size, constant analyzer energy (CAE) 100 eV for survey scans, and 20 eV for detailed scans. The charge neutralization was applied using a combined low energy/ion flood source, to avoid the charging effects. The data acquisition was performed with Matrix software, and data analysis was performed with Igor pro, along with XPS fit procedures. The curve fitting of spectra was done using Gaussian–Lorentzian line shape, after performing the Shirley background corrections. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) of Ti and Mn L-edge and O and C K-edge were measured at 10D KIST-PAL beamline at Pohang Light Source (PLS-II). All the spectra were collected in a total electron yield mode at room temperature, with a resolution of 0.01 eV, and a high vacuum of 4 × 10−10 Torr.\n\nElectrochemical measurements\nGalvanostatic measurements were performed using coin cells of type CR 2032. The electrodes were prepared by mixing the active material, carbon, and polyvinylidene difluoride in a ratio of 8:1:1. The slurry was prepared by adding N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to the above mixture in an appropriate amount, and then cast on Cu foil. The electrodes were roll-pressed after evaporating the NMP, and again vacuum dried overnight, before fabricating the cells. Lithium half cells were prepared using the active material as a working electrode, lithium metal foil as a counter electrode, and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) in an equivalent ratio (1:1:1) as an electrolyte. Sodium half cells were fabricated using the active material as a working electrode, sodium metal foil as a counter electrode, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), and propylene carbonate (PC) in an equivalent ratio (1:1:1) as an electrolyte. The active material loading was 1.2 (±0.3) mg cm−2, and the average thickness of the electrodes was ∼22 μm. The cells were fabricated in an argon filled glovebox (Mbraun Unilab, Germany) with controlled contents of O2 and H2O (<0.2 ppm), and cycled at a multichannel battery tester (Maccor 4000) at room temperature.\n\n"}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\n\n3.1 Structure and compositions characterization\nThe crystallographic structures of the ZIF-67 and Co3S4@NC were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction. The XRD pattern of ZIF-67, displayed in Fig. 1a, confirms its high crystallinity due to the sharp diffraction peaks. For Co3S4@NC, the XRD analysis pattern depicted in Fig. 1b suggests that the diffraction peaks are well-matched with the standard XRD pattern of Co3S4 (PDF no. 47-1738), and no other phases of cobalt sulfide appeared, manifesting the high purity of the product. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of Co3S4@NC at around 26.7°, 31.5°, 38.2°, 50.3° and 55.1° are assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) crystal planes of Co3S4, respectively. The Raman spectrum is presented in Fig. 1c, in which the disordered D band and graphitic G band can be detected at around 1342.75 and 1594.81 cm−1, respectively. The intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG) is about 0.95, verifying that the nitrogen-doped carbon is also composed of amorphous and graphitic carbon.\nMoreover, the specific surface areas and pore-size distribution of the product were analyzed through nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 1d, the BET specific surface area of the as-prepared Co3S4@NC is 176.67 m2 g−1 and the pore size of Co3S4@NC is mainly centered at 3.62 nm, which reasonably demonstrates the mesoporous microstructure.\nIn Fig. 2a, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) result of the final product Co3S4@NC under air atmosphere is presented, in which three stages of weight changes are observed. The weight loss of approximately 3.06% from 20 °C to 200 °C (Stage I) is attributed to the loss of absorbed water, and another two weight changes between 200 °C and 700 °C (Stage II and III) are owing to the conversion of Co3S4 into CoSO4 (confirmed by XRD in Fig. 2a) and the combustion of carbon during the burning process in air, respectively. According to the TGA results, the calculated Co3S4 content is about 56% based on the following equation:\nThe XPS survey of the sample is shown in Fig. 2b, which indicates the presence of Co, S, C, N and O. As displayed in Fig. 2c, the Co 2p spectrum can be resolved into six peaks. The peaks located at 779.4 and 782.01 eV are assigned to Co 2p3/2, while the peaks at 794.04 and 797.25 eV are attributed to Co 2p1/2. The first couple of peaks at 779.40 and 794.04 eV verify the presence of Co2+, and the second couple of peaks at 782.01 and 797.25 eV confirm the presence of Co3+. Moreover, the two broad peaks at 787.03 and 802.61 eV are well-ascribed to the satellite peaks of Co 2p. Accompanied with the Co 2p spectrum, the S 2p peaks (Fig. 2d) at 162.74 (S 2p3/2) and 163.84 eV (S 2p1/2) further illustrate the existence of Co3S4. The C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2e) shows four peaks at binding energy of 284.74, 285.96, 287.01 and 288.84 eV, assigned to the carbon atoms in C–C, CN, C–N and O–CO groups, respectively. Additionally, as exhibited in Fig. 2f, the three peaks located at around 398.23, 399.80 and 401.89 eV are effectively assigned to pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N, respectively.\n\n3.2. Morphology characterization\nThe morphologies of the obtained products were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at different magnifications. As displayed in Fig. 3a–c, the ZIF-67 precursors are composed of dodecahedron structures with relatively smooth surfaces and typical particle size of about 200 nm. After continuous carbonization and sulfuration, SEM images (Fig. 3d–f) of the obtained Co3S4@NC show that the basic outline of the ZIF-67 is maintained, but the particle size shrinks to about 160 nm and the surfaces become slightly rough. According to Fig. 3e, the elemental mappings manifest the uniform distribution of C, N, S, Co elements in Co3S4@NC. Moreover, the TEM images (Fig. 4a–c) of Co3S4@NC further illustrate the existence of polyhedral morphology and enhance the reliability of the SEM results.\nFurthermore, some black points belonging to the nanocrystals can be observed clearly. Based on the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 4d), it is observed that Co3S4@NC nanoparticles are coated by amorphous and graphitic carbon due to the carbonization of organic chains, and some visible nanocrystals with diameter of about 5 nm are embedded around the carbon, demonstrating the evident lattice spacing of about 0.28 nm, which can be indexed to the (311) lattice plane of Co3S4. The lattice spacing of 0.34 nm is observed for graphitic carbon. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED), presented in Fig. 4e, adequately illustrates the crystallinity of Co3S4 in the obtained Co3S4@NC hybrid.\n\n3.3 Formation mechanism of Co3S4@NC\nAs illustrated in Scheme 1, the MOFs-derived Co3S4@NC was obtained through successive carbonization and sulfuration processes. First, the ZIF-67 precursors were acquired by a precipitation reaction with cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and 2-methylimidazole, which are the source of cobalt ions and the organic ligands, respectively. Co2+ species were linked by 2-methylimidazole by strong chemical bonds in the formation of ZIF-67 and then, the precursor was formed. The as-prepared ZIF-67 was then carbonized at 550 °C for 2 h. During the carbonization process under nitrogen atmosphere, the organic ligands were carbonized to N-doped carbon and then, the cobalt ions were reduced to metallic Co particles by the obtained carbon species. Finally, Co3S4@NC was prepared using thioacetamide as the sulfur source through a solvothermal sulfuration reaction at 180 °C, while the final sample retained the polyhedral morphology of the ZIF-67 precursors.\n\n3.4. Electrochemical properties\nThe electrochemical properties of Co3S4@NC were characterized using a series of coin cells. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of Co3S4@NC were performed under the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 within the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) to investigate the characteristic Na-storage mechanism. As shown in Fig. 5a, the cathodic peak at 1.02 V was observed in the first cycle, which was ascribed to the reaction of Na+ insertion, and this cathodic peak shifts to 1.44 V in the subsequent cycles. The insertion reaction between Na+ and Co3S4@NC can be described in the following equation (eqn (2)). In addition, the cathodic peak at 0.76 V can be indexed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase and the conversion reaction of Co3S4 with Na. However, this peak is divided into two peaks at 0.44 V and 0.85 V in the next four cycles. The conversion reaction of the Co3S4@NC is illustrated as shown below (eqn (3)).\nFor the anodic process, the peaks at 1.84 V and 2.08 V can be assigned to the reactions of Na+ extraction and the conversion reaction of Na with Co3S4, respectively. During the subsequent cycles, the locations of the two anodic peaks are essentially unchanged, except the peak becomes sharper, but notably, a small peak appears at about 1.97 V due to the division of the anodic peak at 2.08 V, which is well-matched with the cathodic process.\nTo further explore the Na-storage behavior of the acquired material, CV measurements under various scan rates from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 were collected. As shown in Fig. 5b, the CV curves at different scan rates display similar outlines. Furthermore, the intensity of the oxidation and electrochemical charge carrier transfer was analyzed by a functional relationship between the peak current (i) and scan rate (v) as shown below (eqn (4)):\nwhere a and b are adjustable values. When the b-value is close to 0.5, the storage capacity is primarily controlled by the diffusion-controlled process, whereas when the b-value approaches 1.0, the storage capacity mainly originates from the surface-induced capacitive process. According to the fitted line of log(v) vs. log(i) curve depicted in Fig. 5c, the b-value is calculated to be 0.838, which indicates that the capacities originate from both the diffusion-controlled behavior and surface-capacitance behavior.\nFurthermore, in order to quantify the source of storage capacity, the current (i) under a certain potential (V) can be divided into two parts (eqn (5)):\nwhere k1v and k2v1/2 relate to surface capacitive charge and diffusion-controlled charge, respectively. As presented in Fig. 5d, the values of k1 and k2 are obtained by plotting and fitting the i/v1/2vs. v1/2 lines, where k1 and k2 correspond to the slope and intercept, respectively. The storage behavior of the product under different voltages (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 V) at the same scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are described in Fig. 5e, in which the capacity from capacitive charge increased gradually with the increase in voltage, illustrating that the surface-induced capacitive process mainly occurs at a high voltage and the diffusion-controlled process can be accomplished at a relatively lower voltage. Simultaneously, Fig. 5f depicts the storage behavior of the material at various scan rates at the voltage of 0.5 V, in which the capacitive contributions gradually increased from 35.8% to 63.8%, indicating that most of the capacity of the material stems from the surface-capacitance behavior at high current density.\nFig. 6a exhibits the galvanostatic charge and discharge profiles of the as-prepared material at a current density of 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Na+/Na) for different cycles. The sample shows three discharge plateaus at 1.44 V, 0.85 V and 0.44 V during the discharging process, and two charge plateaus are observed at 1.84 V and 2.08 V in the discharging process. All the reaction plateaus are in good agreement with the CV curves, except the first cycling process, which is probably due to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Furthermore, during the first cycle, the discharge and charge capacities of the electrode are 748.9 and 531.5 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 70.97%. The relatively low initial coulombic efficiency is attributed to the irreversible formation of the SEI occurring on the surface of the Co3S4@NC. As shown in Fig. 6b, the cycling performance of Co3S4@NC electrode was tested at a current density of 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Na+/Na) for 100 cycles, in which a capacity of 420.9 mA h g−1 and a stable coulombic efficiency of about 99% are obtained after 100 cycles. Fig. 6c presents the rate performances of the as-prepared samples for SIBs at different currents. The anode displays reversible capacities of 491.2, 442.2, 386.7, 324.7, 284.0, 191.8, and 151.2 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 A g−1, respectively. When the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, a stable specific capacity of 403.8 mA h g−1 is obtained. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to analyze the electrochemical impedance in the sodium/Co3S4@NC cells. As depicted in Fig. 6d, the charge transfer resistance of Co3S4@NC of fresh cells is 5287 Ω. However, the charge transfer resistances decrease to 103.8, 93.85 and 81.92 Ω after 5, 15 and 20 cycles, respectively, indicating that the charge transfer resistance tends to be more stable after five cycles due to the wettability of the electrode.\nFurthermore, the comparison of electrochemical properties between Co3S4@NC and other transition metal sulfide anodes for sodium-ion batteries reported in previous literature is provided in Table 1. The superior sodium-ion storage performance of Co3S4@NC can be attributed to the nitrogen-doped carbon coating, the Co3S4 ultrafine nanocrystal and the unique porous structure derived from ZIF-67. First, the nitrogen-doped carbon coating can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity, relieve the volume expansion and obtain excellent cyclability. Second, the Co3S4 ultrafine nanocrystal can reinforce the mass transfer rate, resulting in relatively good rate performances. Third, the porous structure and the large specific area are beneficial for the electrolyte to permeate into the materials, finally leading to high surface-capacitance contribution and high specific capacity.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

All of the chemicals were directly used after purchase without further purification. The ZIF-67 precursors were obtained according to the reported literature. Typically, 0.45 g cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Sinopharm Chemical) was first dissolved in 3 mL deionized (DI) water and then, the second solution was obtained by dissolving 5.5 g 2-methylimidazole (Hmim, Energy Chemical) in 20 mL DI water. After complete dissolution, the solution of 2-methylimidazole was poured into the former pink cobalt nitrate solution quickly, and the two solutions were mixed under vigorous stirring for 6 h at room temperature. The obtained purple precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with water and methanol several times and finally dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight.\n2.1.2 Preparation of Co3S4@NC. In a typical synthesis, the as-prepared purple ZIF-67 was carbonized under the protection of nitrogen at 550 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to acquire the black Co@NC products. The sulfidation process was proceeded through a facile solvothermal process. First, 0.1 g obtained Co@NC products and 0.34 g thioacetamide (TAA, Sinopharm Chemical) were dispersed into a mixture solution of 25 mL DI water and 25 mL ethylene glycol under ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, the mixture was transferred into an 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and sealed at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the sample was collected by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol several times, and finally dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight.\n\n2.2 Materials characterization\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Rint-2000) with Cu-Kα radiation at 0.154 nm. The Raman spectrum was recorded using a Raman spectrometer (DXR, Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Composition measurements were conducted using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyzer (XPS) (VG Multi Lab 2000 system). The specific surface area and pore size distributions of the obtained product were measured by a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument, while the morphology and crystal lattice of the sample were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM 6400) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL). The content of the carbon in the Co3S4@NC was investigated in air atmosphere using a thermal analysis instrument (NETZSCH STA449F3) with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to 700 °C.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nElectrochemical experiments were performed by utilizing CR2016 coin cells. The electrodes were fabricated by mixing 70 wt% Co3S4@NC (active materials), 15 wt% conductive carbon, and 15 wt% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder in deionized water to form a homogenous slurry. Then, the resultant slurry was coated on a copper foil and dried at 80 °C under vacuum overnight. The CR2016 coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box using metallic sodium as the counter electrode and a polypropylene film (Celgard 2400) as the separator. The electrolyte was made by dissolving 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) with the addition of 5 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Na+/Na) on an Arbin battery cycler. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a Multi Autolab M204 electrochemical station in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were performed on a Solartron 1470 Multistat system under frequencies ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. All electrochemical tests were performed at room temperature.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The main characteristic diffraction peaks of TCNQ are at 18°, 24° and 27°. After the reaction with NaI, the main peaks of the product emerge at 16°, 20° and 26°. The crystal structure of NaTCNQ was also investigated by Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD pattern according to previous literature. As shown in Fig. S2,† the refined structure fits well with the triclinic crystal system (C space group) with Rwp = 4.52% and Rp = 3.40%. The refined lattice parameters are: a = 6.986 Å, b = 23.643 Å, c = 12.441 Å, α = 90.140°, β = 98.580°, γ = 90.760° and V = 2023.868 Å3. The XRD refinement result confirms the conversion of TCNQ to the sodium salt (NaTCNQ). SEM images of the as-prepared NaTCNQ powder show a hexagonal-prism like morphology in Fig. 1b and c. The cross section is a regular symmetrical hexagon and the average size of the particles is approximately 1 μm.\n\nElectrochemical performance of NaTCNQ\nWe investigated the electrochemical performance of NaTCNQ as a cathode material for SIBs. We found it is not rechargeable in 1 M NaClO4 in EC/PC, as shown in Fig. S3a.† Associated with the solubility of TCNQ, this poor performance may be due to the dissolution of the active material. Then, we investigated the solubility of the NaTCNQ electrode, as displayed in Fig. S3b.† The color of the electrolyte rapidly changed to orange after the NaTCNQ electrode was immersed in the electrolyte, indicating that NaTCNQ is also easily soluble in the electrolyte. Since the separator is always porous and has little resistance to liquid penetration, the dissolved active material easily migrates through the separator to the anode side, resulting in extremely poor electrochemical properties.\nAs reported in our previous study, a thin carbon film prepared from SP can be introduced as an adsorption layer (AL) to inhibit the shuttle effect of the dissolved active materials and serve as an upper current collector to increase active material utilization. It can significantly improve the cycling stability of organic electrode materials. We also studied the barrier effect of the Super P adsorption layer (SP-AL), as shown in Fig. 2a. It displays the initial two charge–discharge cycles within the voltage range 1.5–3.8 V at a current density of 20 mA g−1. In the first cycle, an evident charge voltage platform appears at 3.3 V and two distinct plateaus occur at 3.0 V and 2.2 V during discharging. It achieves a specific capacity of 192 mA h g−1 in the first discharging process, corresponding to 81% of the theoretical capacity of NaTCNQ (236 mA h g−1) calculated based on two electron transfer in the redox reaction of NaTCNQ. During the second cycle, both the charge and discharge processes present two potential plateaus, in accordance with a two-electron-transfer reaction (Fig. 2a). The corresponding redox reactions associated with the TCNQ species are illustrated in Scheme S1† according to a previous report. Meanwhile, the second discharge profile coincides well with the first cycle, suggesting that the redox reaction of NaTCNQ is reversible in the cell with an adsorption layer composed of Super P (SP-AL). To identify the adsorption effect of SP-AL, an operando battery was assembled in a quartz cell to observe the change in the electrolyte according to our previous report. As shown in Fig. 2e, after being charged and discharged for two cycles, the electrolyte in the cell with SP-AL is obviously discolored, but the color is much lighter than that in Fig. S3b,† demonstrating that the dissolution of the active material has been reduced. However, the color change of the electrolyte shows that SP-AL is not effective as a barrier to prevent the active material diffusing into the electrolyte. SP is a porous and superior conductive carbon with a surface area of about 75 m2 g−1, which is rather limiting for effective adsorption. AC is extremely porous and has a very large surface area higher than 1000 m2 g−1 with the strongest physical adsorption capacity. The great interfacial tension of pristine AC makes it hard to form a uniform adhesive film on the PP membrane, even when the AC content is more than 10%. Finally, we selected three different AC contents of 1%, 5% and 10% to prepare the carbon AL. Fig. 2b–d displays the charge–discharge curves of the NaTCNQ cells assembled with SP-AC (1%)-AL, SP-AC (5%)-AL and SP-AC (10%)-AL within the voltage range 1.5–3.8 V at a current density of 20 mA g−1. All three samples exhibit similar charge and discharge profiles, which are less flat than that of NaTCNQ/SP-AL because AC has capacity contributions in the sodium ion battery. As shown in Fig. S4,† AC gives a discharge capacity of approximately 80 mA h g−1 in the voltage window 1.5–3.8 V vs. Na+/Na with a slope voltage profile. However, when the AC content is reduced to 1%, 5% and 10%, the discharge capacity is decreased to 9.3, 10.2 and 12.8 mA h g−1. The initial discharge capacity of NaTCNQ/SP-AC (1%)-AL, NaTCNQ/SP-AC (5%)-AL and NaTCNQ/SP-AC (10%)-AL is 204 mA h g−1, 233 mA h g−1 and 216 mA h g−1, respectively, which amount to 86%, 98% and 91% of the theoretical capacity. Moreover, the electrolyte in the operando cell with SP-AC (1%)-AL is slightly discolored (Fig. 2f), but the other two with a higher AC content are still unchanged and clear after two cycles (Fig. 2g and h), implying that the AC-containing AL is effective at stopping organic active materials dissolving into the electrolyte.\nSpecific surface area (SSA) and pore size are important parameters in adsorptive materials, therefore we measured the BET curves and pore size distribution plots of SP, SP-AC (1%), SP-AC (5%), SP-AC (10%) and the AC powder in Fig. 3 and the results obtained by the fitting calculation are displayed in Table S1.† It is clear that the AC powder has a super high surface area of 1592 m2 g−1, which is 20 times higher than that of SP, indicating that AC can provide many more active adsorption sites. Even with the low AC content of SP-AC (5%) and SP-AC (10%), the specific surface areas are greatly improved associated with enhanced physisorption capability. Although the nitrogen adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions suggest micropores (<2 nm) are dominant in the AC powder, the low content of AC (<10%) does not change the typical capillary condensation of mesopores (2–50 nm) in SP (Fig. 3c, d).\nSince the AC-containing carbon powders have higher physisorption capability than the pristine SP powder, we further investigated the rechargeability of the NaTCNQ cells assembled with different carbon ALs. Fig. 4a exhibits the cycling performance of the NaTCNQ cells with various adsorption layers at a current density of 50 mA g−1. For the NaTCNQ/SP-AL cell, the initial discharge specific capacity is 163 mA h g−1 and it is reduced to 90 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, showing 55% capacity retention. The first discharge capacity of the NaTCNQ/SP-AC (1%)-AL, NaTCNQ/SP-AC (5%)-AL and NaTCNQ/SP-AC (10%)-AL cells is 183 mA h g−1, 224 mA h g−1 and 216 mA h g−1, respectively. After 50 cycles, the capacity retention is 55%, 70% and 55%. These results demonstrate the significantly improved cycling stability of the NaTCNQ cells with carbon adsorption layers, which enables the reversible redox reaction of the TCNQ species in liquid electrolyte sodium ion batteries. Especially in the NaTCNQ cell with SP-AC (5%)-AL, high physisorption further provides increased capacity and improved cycling performance.\nTo gain further insight into the differences in the electrochemical properties of the various adsorption layers, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the cells with SP-AL, SP-AC (1%)-AL, SP-AC (5%)-AL and SP-AC (10%)-AL was performed. The EIS curves consist of a depressed semicircle in the high frequency region and an inclined line in the low frequency region, and we fitted the curves as displayed in Fig. 4b. The Fig. 4b inset shows the equivalent circuit of the cells. R1 stands for the electrolyte resistance, R2 is the interface resistance for the carbon adsorption layer and R3 corresponds to the electrochemical reaction resistance in the NaTCNQ electrode. Rw is the Warburg impedance and is related to the diffusion of Na+ within the electrode. Table 1 shows the fitted resistance values of the cells. We found that all of the R1 values are large, which is ascribed to the poor wettability of the Celgard membrane in the cyclic carbonate-based electrolyte. This is the reason why NaTCNQ batteries exhibit much lower capacities at a little higher current density. Also, it is clear that the electrolyte resistance and the interface resistance reduce firstly with the addition of AC, which is due to the better infiltration of the electrolyte in the highly porous carbon, and it is lowest when the content of AC is 5%. When more AC is added up to 10%, R1 and R2 appear to increase owing to the poor contact of AC with the PP film due to its much higher surface tension. The EIS results clearly show that the NaTCNQ/SP-AC (5%)-AL cell achieved the lowest impedance and greatly improved the electrochemical performance.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Typically, 1.05 mmol NaI (99.99%, Aladdin) was dissolved in 25 mL degased acetonitrile (99.8%, SCR) to form solution A, while 1 mmol TCNQ (98%, Aladdin) was dissolved in 100 mL degased acetonitrile to form solution B. Then, solution A was injected into solution B rapidly under ultrasonic vibration. The yellow solution B instantly turned into a purple suspension and the mixture was maintained at room temperature (20 °C, RT) for 10 minutes. Then the formed dark purple powder was separated by filtration and washed with acetonitrile until the filtrate became colorless. Finally, the powder was dried at RT in air overnight.\n\nPreparation of the adsorption layer (AL)\nSuper P (SP) and activated carbon (AC) were selected as the composition materials of the adsorption layer. SP, or the mixture of SP and AC, was thoroughly ground. Then 80 wt% of carbon and 20 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were fully mixed in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). Then, the slurry was uniformly coated onto a Celgard polypropylene (PP) membrane and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the adsorption layer was cut into a wafer with a diameter of 19 mm.\n\nMaterials characterization\nXRD patterns were collected using a Panalytical X’pert PRO MRD (Holland) with Cu Kα radiation. A JSM 7600 FE-SEM (JEOL, Japan) was used to check the morphology and size of the materials. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurements of the porous carbon were carried out with a volumetric sorption analyser (Beishide 3H-2000PM1, Beijing) using the physical adsorption and desorption of N2 at the liquid-nitrogen temperature. Pore size distributions were calculated according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nThe 2032 type coin cells were assembled and sealed in an Ar-filled glove box to study the electrochemical properties. The active electrodes were made by coating a slurry of 60 wt% NaTCNQ, 30 wt% Super P and 10 wt% PVDF onto carbon-coated aluminium foil. The electrodes were dried at 80 °C in an oven overnight and punched into round discs with a diameter of 8 mm. The typical mass loading of the electrodes was 0.80–1.2 mg cm−2. Sodium metal, a Whatman glass fiber membrane GF/B and 1 mol L−1 NaClO4 solution in EC/PC (1:1 v/v) were used as the counter electrode, separator and electrolyte, respectively. The adsorption layer was placed between the cathode and the separator. The charging–discharging cycles were performed on a battery measurement system (Land CT2001A, China) within the potential range 1.5–3.8 V (vs. Na+/Na) at RT. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were recorded on a CHI660D (Shanghai, China) in the voltage range 1.5–3.8 V vs. Na+/Na and the frequency range 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at RT.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Typically, 1.05 mmol NaI (99.99%, Aladdin) was dissolved in 25 mL degased acetonitrile (99.8%, SCR) to form solution A, while 1 mmol TCNQ (98%, Aladdin) was dissolved in 100 mL degased acetonitrile to form solution B. Then, solution A was injected into solution B rapidly under ultrasonic vibration. The yellow solution B instantly turned into a purple suspension and the mixture was maintained at room temperature (20 °C, RT) for 10 minutes. Then the formed dark purple powder was separated by filtration and washed with acetonitrile until the filtrate became colorless. Finally, the powder was dried at RT in air overnight.\n\nPreparation of the adsorption layer (AL)\nSuper P (SP) and activated carbon (AC) were selected as the composition materials of the adsorption layer. SP, or the mixture of SP and AC, was thoroughly ground. Then 80 wt% of carbon and 20 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were fully mixed in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). Then, the slurry was uniformly coated onto a Celgard polypropylene (PP) membrane and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the adsorption layer was cut into a wafer with a diameter of 19 mm.\n\nMaterials characterization\nXRD patterns were collected using a Panalytical X’pert PRO MRD (Holland) with Cu Kα radiation. A JSM 7600 FE-SEM (JEOL, Japan) was used to check the morphology and size of the materials. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurements of the porous carbon were carried out with a volumetric sorption analyser (Beishide 3H-2000PM1, Beijing) using the physical adsorption and desorption of N2 at the liquid-nitrogen temperature. Pore size distributions were calculated according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.\n\nElectrochemical characterization\nThe 2032 type coin cells were assembled and sealed in an Ar-filled glove box to study the electrochemical properties. The active electrodes were made by coating a slurry of 60 wt% NaTCNQ, 30 wt% Super P and 10 wt% PVDF onto carbon-coated aluminium foil. The electrodes were dried at 80 °C in an oven overnight and punched into round discs with a diameter of 8 mm. The typical mass loading of the electrodes was 0.80–1.2 mg cm−2. Sodium metal, a Whatman glass fiber membrane GF/B and 1 mol L−1 NaClO4 solution in EC/PC (1:1 v/v) were used as the counter electrode, separator and electrolyte, respectively. The adsorption layer was placed between the cathode and the separator. The charging–discharging cycles were performed on a battery measurement system (Land CT2001A, China) within the potential range 1.5–3.8 V (vs. Na+/Na) at RT. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were recorded on a CHI660D (Shanghai, China) in the voltage range 1.5–3.8 V vs. Na+/Na and the frequency range 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at RT.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

No diffraction peaks attributed to the carbon matrix can be observed because of the amorphous structure. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of NTP was carried out from 25 to 800 °C in air (Fig. 1b). The weight loss below 300 °C is related to the evaporation of water. The mass loss from 300 to 500 °C can be ascribed to the combustion of the carbon matrix. The percentage of carbon in NTP was estimated to be 18.1%. Fig. 1c displays the N2 adsorption–desorption curves. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of NTP was 194.4 m2 g−1. Obviously, NTP possessed a mesoporous structure, and the size distribution ranged from 2 to 30 nm (Fig. 1d). Meanwhile, the larger surface area of NTP resulted from the porous carbon matrix with abundant micropores (1–2 nm) and the perfect 1D hybrid nanostructure. These pores and large surface area will result in superior Na+ transfer from the electrode.\nField emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) provided details regarding the morphological characteristics of NTP (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a shows the SEM image of NTP, revealing the 1D morphology with a diameter of 100–120 nm. No obvious agglomerated particles were observed. However, the surface of NTP had some bulges. To further identify the clear morphology of the sample, the TEM images of NTP are given in Fig. 2b and c. The hybrid possesses a perfect bamboo-like shape; the lighter and darker colors of the hybrid represent the carbon matrix and NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles, respectively. Obviously, the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles with different size distributions (5–50 nm) are well embedded in the 1D carbon nanotubes. Meanwhile, the major NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles are half-embedded in the wall of the nanotubes, leading to bulges on the surface of NTP. The formation of the embedded structure can be due to the presence of the Ti-based gel precursor in the walls of SPNTs. In addition, the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles have uniform dispersion and small size due to the weak precipitation between Ti4+ and HPO42−/H2PO4−/PO43− because the main ingredient of the ionic ethanol solution containing P2O5 can form organic phosphate.\nThe HRTEM image shown in Fig. 2d indicates the disordered thin layers of carbon around the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles (darker color). Inside the particles, an indistinct lattice fringe of 0.276 nm is observed, corresponding to the interplanar spacing of the (116) plane for the rhombohedral lattice (Fig. S1†). The presence of the 3D carbon matrix not only inhibits the agglomeration but also prevents the growth of the NaTi2(PO4)3 particles. According to the elemental mappings shown in Fig. 2e–h, the C, P, Na, and Ti elements are uniformly distributed in NTP. The SEM image (NTP) of ESD mappings is shown in the ESI (Fig. S2†). The combination of the preparation of dispersive small nanoparticles and the introduction of a 3D carbon matrix with a porous structure greatly shortens the transfer pathway of Na+ and improves the electronic conductivity.\nThe electrochemical performance of NTP was tested between 0.01 and 3 V. Fig. 3a displays the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of NTP in the initial three cycles at 0.1 mV s−1. The redox pairs at 2.05/2.22 V and 0.35/0.51 V can be assigned to the mutual transformation of Ti4+ → Ti3+ and Ti3+ → Ti2+, respectively, which is consistent with a previous report. An irreversible cathodic peak at about 1.1 V is observed in the first cycle owing to the decomposition of the electrolyte to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Compared with most reported NaTi2(PO4)3-based electrodes, NTP shows well-defined peaks and smaller potential interval, which demonstrates the lower polarization. The diffusion/migration barrier of Na+ insertion was reduced due to the porous carbon matrix and the well-dispersed nanoparticles.\nThe lowest pair at about 0 V is caused by the insertion of Na+ in amorphous carbon. Moreover, the overlap of the subsequent CV curves indicates high reversibility of Na+ in NTP. The typical galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles of the NTP electrode at 0.2 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 3b. Two voltage plateaus at about 2.1 and 0.5 V in the 1st GCD profiles are observed, which are similar to that in the CV profiles. The formed SEI layer is confirmed by the plateau at 1.1 V in the initial GCD profile and the low coulombic efficiency (CE) of 56.7%. After the 2nd cycle, all the GCD profiles are superimposed on each other with a high discharge capacity over 160 mA h g−1. Moreover, a good CE over 97% was obtained after the 10th cycle.\nThe cycling behaviors of NTP at different current densities are given in Fig. 3c. The electrodes deliver the initial capacities of 357.4, 286.3, and 225.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, 2 A g−1, and 5 A g−1, respectively. After 150 cycles, the electrode retains a high capacity of 129 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Notably, it maintains high reversible capacities of 102.1 and 93.7 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 5 A g−1 after 150 cycles, respectively, which indicates excellent cycling stability and rate capability. Meanwhile, the results for the coulombic efficiency of the cycled cells under the above-mentioned different rates are given in the ESI (Fig. S3†). The rate cycling performance of the NTP electrode was further tested upon increasing the current density from 0.1 A g−1 to 6 A g−1 (Fig. 3d); the electrode delivered a high capacity of 88.5 mA h g−1 at 6 A g−1. When the current density returned to 0.1 A g−1, the reversible capacity rapidly returned to the original value once more, demonstrating its good cycling stability and flexible structure. In addition, to further demonstrate the cycling stability of NTP, the electrode was cycled at 10 A g−1 (Fig. 3e). A long lifespan of 3000 cycles was realized with a high CE of 100% as well as a desirable capacity of 55.5 mA h g−1.\nMoreover, NTP exhibited superior electrochemical performance than the NaTi2(PO4)3-based materials tested between 0.01 and 3 V reported in the open literature; this fully demonstrates that the construction of a 1D hybrid structure can be used to promote the electrochemical performance. The aggregation and pulverization of the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles were effectively prevented, which could accommodate the volume change during the electrochemical reaction and also shorten the diffusion path of Na+ and electrons. Meanwhile, the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles wrapped with a porous carbon matrix could provide fast electronic and ionic transport. Also, the carbon skeleton improved the electrical conductivity of NTP and further prevented the structure from collapsing during long cycling. In addition, the hierarchical pore structure of NTP increased the surface area between the electrodes and the electrolytes and abundant active sites, which endowed the electrodes with high capacitive contribution.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

The sample N–C obtained from chitosan directly via carbonization shows a rough block structure, while MoS2 powder exhibits an irregular thick sheet structure (Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 1d–f, the 1T-MoS2-Sb, 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 composites have a similar nanosheet layered structure, illuminating that ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheets are evenly embedded into the chitosan-derived carbon matrix.\nFig. 2 shows high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite. In Fig. 2a, the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite possesses an ultra-thin nanostructure, wherein a large number of MoS2 are orderly arranged in the N-doped carbon layer, whereas some amorphous carbons are found at the edge. In Fig. 2b, the few-layered structure of MoS2 is shown to feature 2–4 layers. In addition, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite indicates the crystalline phase of the MoS2. As illustrated in Fig. 2c, doping with antimony metal leads to the transformation of the crystal phase of 1T-MoS2-Sb. The layer spacing of the (002) crystal plane significantly improves from 0.62 nm to 0.69 nm. The mapping results show that Mo, S, Sb, C and N are evenly spread in the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite (Fig. 2d). In situ N doping is prone to increasing the number of active sites, and the introduction of Sb-doping leads to the expansion of the layer spacing and induces transformation of the 2H phase MoS2 to 1T phase MoS2 and then enhances the electronic conductivity.\nThe X-ray diffractometry (XRD) patterns of the bulk MoS2, 1T-MoS2-Sb, 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 composites are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The diffraction peaks of bulk MoS2 at 33°, 41.1° and 58.3° correspond to the (101), (103), and (110) crystal planes of MoS2 (JCPDS: 065-3656), respectively. Compared with the pure phase MoS2 powder, the peak for the (002) crystal plane disappears in the patterns, indicating that the synthesized MoS2 possesses a few-layered structure. It is remarkable to note that the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite significantly shifts to a small angle near to the (103) crystal plane compared with the other samples, suggesting that antimony was successfully doped in MoS2 and its layer spacing was enlarged.\nTo further identify the structure of the MoS2 powder, 1T-MoS2-Sb, 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 composites, Raman spectroscopy analyses were also performed. As shown in Fig. 3c, the vibrational peaks observed at 382 and 407 cm−1 correspond to the A1g and E12g vibrations of bulk MoS2. However, the characteristic peaks of A1g and E12g for 1T-MoS2-Sb and 2H-MoS2 are observed at 378, 401 and 383, 403 cm−1. The distance between the A1g and E12g peaks of both 1T-MoS2-Sb and 2H-MoS2 (23.0 and 20 cm−1) is less than that of the bulk MoS2 (25.0 cm−1), demonstrating that the synthesized composites possess a few-layered structure. The D- and G-bands of chitosan-derived carbon at 1358 and 1589 cm−1 in its Raman spectrum can be attributed to ordered and disordered carbon, respectively. Besides this, 1T-MoS2-Sb shows two weak vibration peaks unique to the 1T phase of MoS2 at 153 cm−1 (J1) and 216 cm−1 (J2), whereas 2H-MoS2 shows no peaks at these locations, revealing the successful fabrication of Sb-doped 1T-MoS2.\nAs shown in Fig. 3d, the weight loss at 100 °C (Δm1) corresponds to the evaporation of water, while the weight loss at 100–700 °C (Δm2) is considered to be related to the sublimation of sulfur dioxide (MoS2 + O2 → MoO3, S + O2 → SO2) and the formation of carbon dioxide (C + O2 → CO2). The residues left at 700 °C were determined to be MoO3 and a minor amount of Sb. The ratio of tungsten and tin in 1T-MoS2-Sb sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The weight ratio of Mo:S in 1T-MoS2-Sb is 1:0.05. The contents of MoS2, Sb and the chitosan-derived carbon in 1T-MoS2-Sb are ca. 71.4, 0.5 and 28.1%, respectively. The calculated proportions of MoS2 in the 1T-MoS2-Sb, 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 samples are ca. 71.4, 71.6 and 95.0 wt%, respectively.\nThe X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data are shown in Fig. 4. A shown in Fig. 4a, the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite contains C, N, Sb, Mo and S, which is consistent with the mapping analysis results. As shown in Fig. 4b, the peaks at 284.75, 286.04 and 288.22 eV correspond to C–C, C–N and CO, indicating that N is doped in the chitosan-derived carbon. The obvious characteristic peaks at 396.8 eV, 398.32 eV and 399.71 eV in Fig. 4c, are related to pyridine, pyrrole and graphite nitrogen, respectively. The characteristic peaks at 531.21 eV and 539.98 eV in Fig. 4d are for Sb 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, suggesting the successful doping of Sb3+ in 1T-MoS2-Sb. As illustrated in Fig. 4e, the peaks at 229.52 eV and 232.70 eV correspond to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 in 2H-MoS2, indicating the presence of Mo4+ in the composite. The two peaks exhibit an obvious blue shift (the difference in the binding energy is 0.31 eV) for the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite, which are located at 229.42 eV and 232.39 eV and consistent with the Mo in 1T phase MoS2. The characteristic peak at 235.85 eV can be attributed to Mo–O–C, suggesting the occurrence of the firm binding of chitosan-derived carbon to MoS2 in 1T-MoS2-Sb. The peaks at 162.35 and 163.62 eV in Fig. 4f can be attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 in 2H-MoS2, revealing the introduction of S2+ into the composite, and those at 162.02 and 163.29 eV can be attributed to S in 1T-MoS2. These results suggest that the Sb-doping induces the conversion of 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2, which is in good agreement with the TEM, XRD and Raman analysis results. N-Doped carbon and Sb-doping induce the formation of the T phase MoS2 in the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite, which not only effectively enhances the entire stability of the structure, but also facilitates Na+/K+ interactions and e− transmission that promote cycling performance and stability.\n\nElectrochemical behavior of 1T-MoS2-Sb as an anode in half/full-SIBs\nThe electrochemical properties of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 0.2 mV s−1 (0.01–3 V) and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. As shown in Fig. 5a, the reduction peaks at 1.9 and 0.71 V in the initial discharging process correspond to Na+ embedded into the 1T-MoS2-Sb composite to form NaxMoS2, Mo monomer, Na2S and SEI film, while the oxidation peaks at 1.72 and 1.22 V in the charging process can be attributed to the transformation of Mo into MoS2 and the formation of Sb2S3. Accordingly, the reduction peaks at 0.61 and 0.89 V can be attributed to the formation of NaS2 and Na3Sb. As depicted in Fig. S2a,† it can be seen that the characteristic oxidation peak for dealloyed Sb2S3 appears at 1.22 V due to Sb doping. However, this oxidation peak was not observed for the 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 electrodes (Fig. S2b and c†).\nFig. 5b shows galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at 0.1 A g−1 from different cycles. The voltage platform (1.72/0.89 V) of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode is well matched with its CV curve. In addition, the first coulombic efficiency of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode is 46%, while the irreversible capacity decay can probably be attributed to the SEI film. Apart from the initial cycle, the other curves coincide well, indicating the superb cycling reversibility of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode.\nThe properties of the 1T-MoS2-Sb, 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 and bulk MoS2 electrodes at 0.1 A g−1 were examined and the results are given in Fig. 6a. After 50 cycles, the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode shows an outstanding capacity of 493 mA h g−1. By contrast, 2H-MoS2-1, 2H-MoS2-2 and bulk MoS2 electrodes only maintained 394, 318 and 103 mA h g−1, respectively. More importantly, the first coulombic efficiency of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode (46%) is higher than those of the 2H-MoS2-1 (35%) and 2H-MoS2-2 (44%) electrodes, indicating that the introduction of metal antimony transforms 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2, provides more edge active sites, greatly improves the conductivity and increases the sodium storage capacity.\nThe rate properties of each sample are shown in Fig. 6b. It is clear that the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode exhibits high storage capacities of 523, 459, 347, 272, 253 and 183 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. It also indicates impressive rate performance by returning to its original capacity after 90 cycles. In contrast, the 2H-MoS2-1, 2H-MoS2-2 and bulk MoS2 electrodes show inferior reversible capacities of 438, 395, 322 and 166, 145, 95 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 5 A g−1, respectively.\nThe long-term cycling stability of the 1T-MoS2-Sb, 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 electrodes at 1 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 6c. The 1T-MoS2-Sb anode shows a storage capacity of 253 mA h g−1 after 2200 cycles, while 2H-MoS2-1 and 2H-MoS2-2 anodes only maintain reversible capacities of 229 and 200 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. Additionally, the coulombic efficiency (CE) of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode is close to 100% in successive cycles, implying its admirable cycling reversibility and capacity retention.\nAs shown in Fig. 8a, the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode was matched with a Na3V2 (PO4)3 (NVP) cathode to form 1T-MoS2-Sb//NVP full SIBs. The electric properties of the SIBs are given in Fig. 8b–f. As shown in Fig. 8b, the SIBs can easily light commercial LED lamps, and the voltage platform of the 1T-MoS2-Sb//NVP full cell (1.53/1.64 V) is related to the potential difference between the 1T-MoS2-Sb anode (0.89/1.72 V) and NVP cathode (3.4 V). In Fig. 8c, 1T-MoS2-Sb//NVP still maintains a prominent capacity of 242 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating that the 1T-MoS2-Sb anode has great application prospects. As shown in Fig. 8d, the 1T-MoS2-Sb anode delivers an admirable reversible capacity of 324, 256, 221, 199 and 159 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. More importantly, an ideal capacity of 235 mA h g−1 is still maintained after 80 cycles. Meanwhile, charge/discharge curves were recorded over different numbers of cycles and current densities (Fig. 8e and f). Obviously, the curves overlap well and show low polarization. These results suggest that 1T-MoS2-Sb is a good candidate for use as an advanced anode material for sodium storage.\nThe CV curve of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode is presented in Fig. 8a. The tested current (i) and sweep rate (v) follow the relationship:\nwhere the value of a and b are constants that can be obtained by calculating the slope of log(i) and log(v). When b = 0.5, the reaction is mainly contributed to by diffusion, and when b = 1.0, it is dominated by capacitance effects. The b values of the cathode and anode peaks calculated by fitting are 0.82 and 0.86, as demonstrated in Fig. 8b, indicating that the behaviour of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode is mainly controlled by the pseudo-capacitance on its surface. In addition, according to eqn (3), the contribution of the anode materials to different charge storage mechanisms such as capacitance and diffusion process is as follows: where k1v and k2v1/2 respectively represent the storage mechanism dominated by the surface induced capacitance and diffusion contributions.Fig. 8c shows the capacitance contribution diagram at 0.6 mV s−1. By calculating the capacitance storage, it was found that the contribution of surface pseudo-capacitance behaviour (pink part) is significantly higher than that of the diffusion capacitance. The contribution diagram of the different scan rates (Fig. 8d) indicates that the pseudo-capacitance effect also increases significantly with an increase in scan rate. Ultimately, the capacitance effect reaches a maximum, accounting for 73.4% at 1.0 mV s−1. In addition, increasing conductivity and layer spacing is favourable to afford a short-range diffusion path and reveal more reactive sites, thereby hastening the transmission speed of Na+.\nThe galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was performed via a pulse relaxation process of 180 min at 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 7e and f). The Na+ diffusion coefficient increases gradually during the first discharge, mainly due to the faster reaction kinetics as a result of the increase in conductivity and volume expansion. Instead, the reduction of the diffusion coefficient in the charging process indicates diffusion resistance and an increase in the diffusion path in the process of Na+ deintercalation.\n\nElectrochemical behavior of 1T-MoS2-Sb as an anode in PIBs\nThe CV curves of the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode in a PIB at 0.2 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 9a. A reduction peak at 1.86 V was observed in the first discharge process, corresponding to the formation of KxMoS2 when K+ was inserted into the interlayer of MoS2. The reduction peak at 0.62 V is attributed to the simultaneous formation of Mo, K2S and the SEI film. The wide peak at 2.09 V in the charging process is related to the conversion of Mo into MoS2.\nMoreover, in Fig. 9b, the platform of 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode is shown to be stable at 0.62/2.09 V, which is consistent with the CV curves. Evidently, irreversible loss of capacity during circulation is observed, which is mainly lost via the SEI film. The curves almost coincide, except for the first cycle, implying the remarkable cycling stability of this electrode.\nAs shown in Fig. 9c, a high specific capacity of 343 mA h g−1 is observed upon cycling for 50 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, indicating that this 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode shows fascinating cycling performance as an anode in PIBs. Fig. 9d shows the long-term cycling performance, where the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode exhibits outstanding storage performance of 150 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 1000 cycles. As shown in Fig. 9e, the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode shows remarkable storage capacities of 312, 196, 149 and 96 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 A g−1. The capacity of the electrode returns to 311 mA h g−1 after 90 cycles, revealing that the electrode material exhibits remarkable cycling reversibility. Due to the excellent conductivity of 1T-MoS2-Sb and its great layer spacing, the kinetics in the electrochemical reaction process are improved, and K+ can be quickly de intercalated. The chitosan-derived carbon, as a buffering effect, exhibits small volume variation and displays prominent long-term stability and reversibility. By virtue of the superior potassium electrochemical properties, the 1T-MoS2-Sb electrode was compared with the previously reported 1T-MoS2/MoOx@NC, activated graphite, NCNTs, KMnF-LE, and FeS2@C electrodes. These comparisons manifest that 1T-MoS2-Sb shows excellent performance as an electrode in PIBs.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Results and discussion\nThe ionic structures of PO43− and SiO44− are both tetrahedron, which suggested a good structural compatibility for our anionic manipulation strategy in an NVP matrix (Fig. 1a). To prepare SiO44−-substituted NVP, a hydrothermal method followed by an annealing process were employed. The XRD Rietveld refinement analysis of NVP-Si suggested that the crystal structure of NVP was maintained after the introduction of SiO44− anions (Fig. 1b and S1†). However, the lattices turned out to be expanded, as exemplified by the (113) diffraction peak of NVP-Si at ∼24° shifted to lower degrees, in accordance with the larger atom size of Si4+ (0.40 Å) than that of P5+ (0.38 Å), demonstrating the enlarged crystal lattice and ion diffusion channels. Interestingly, it was revealed that the Na+ content in NVP-Si was higher than that in pristine NVP so as to balance the charge difference between SiO44− and PO43−. As is evident from the XRD refinement (Table S1†), the occupancy ratio at the Na2 site increased from 0.3489 to 0.3652, which should be beneficial for the capacity improvement of NVP-Si materials. The SEM image of as-prepared NVP-Si showed a particle morphology with an average size of ∼200 nm (Fig. 1c), similar to that of pristine NVP (Fig. S2†). The EDS elemental mapping results of NVP-Si in Fig. 1d indicate the successful introduction of SiO44−, where uniform Si distribution over the detected particle is shown. XPS was also employed to confirm the introduction of Si (Fig. S3†). The Si 2p XPS analysis of NVP-Si demonstrated the mixed valence states of +3 and +4 (Fig. 1e), suggesting a balanced charge state and implying the redox-able nature of these Si sites in the NVP lattice. The Na 1s XPS peak area of NVP-Si was larger than that of NVP as shown in Fig. 1f, implying higher Na content in NVP-Si, in accordance with the XRD Rietveld refinement results (Fig. 1b and S1, Table S1†).\nThe distinctive chemical composition, crystal structure, and valence state of as-designed NVP-Si make it promising for an SIB cathode. To study the SiO44− substitution–electrochemical performance relationship, NVP samples with different SiO44− substitution amounts were prepared and tested in Na||NVP half cells. The results showed that the NVP with 3.3% PO43− substituted with SiO44− (i.e., NVP-Si) was the best-performing one (Fig. S4–S6†). As shown in Fig. 2a, the Na||NVP-Si cells exhibit a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g−1 than the pristine NVP (109.6 mA h g−1) at a current density of 0.5 C, indicating the improved capacity performance. It is noted that the average discharge voltage of an NVP-Si cathode was ∼3.36 V, 50 mV higher than that of pristine NVP. Remarkably, both the power density and energy density of as-assembled Na||NVP cells are higher than those values for most reported NVP materials in recent publications (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the rate performance of an NVP-Si cathode was also improved. The Na||NVP-Si cell exhibited a capacity of 90.7, 83.6, and 74.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 C, 20 C, and 40 C, respectively, significantly higher than the Na||NVP cell under the same test conditions (Fig. 2c). Under 0.5 C, the NVP-Si cathodes delivered an excellent cycling performance with 88.9% capacity retention after 150 cycles, outperforming pristine NVP (80.1% under the same test conditions, Fig. 2d). The NVP-Si cathode also displayed 76% capacity retention after 2000 cycles under 10 C, outperforming NVP (only 51%), further confirming the good cycling stability (Fig. 2e). Besides, the XRD analysis of NVP-Si cathodes before and after cycling also suggested outstanding structural stability (Fig. S7†). All these results confirmed the improved electrochemical performance of as-designed NVP-Si cathodes.\nTo understand the outstanding electrochemical performance of NVP-Si materials, the electronic structures of V3+ active centers for NVP and NVP-Si were first investigated. Results of XPS analysis, shown in Fig. S8,† suggested the same V valence state for NVP and NVP-Si, indicating the active V3+ sites for NVP-Si have not been affected by the introduction of SiO44−. The electronic structures of introduced Si centers during battery cycling were subsequently analyzed by XPS and theoretical modeling. As demonstrated in Fig. 3a, the Si3+/Si4+ ratio of NVP-Si was determined to be 1:1.02 before cycling, which turned out to be 1:3.23 after charging to 4.0 V, before recovering to 1:0.93 after discharging to 2.5 V, indicating the redox-active nature for the Si sites, which should be beneficial for the capacity increase of as-designed NVP-Si cathodes. The differential charge analysis demonstrated that the introduced Si centers should attract electrons from neighboring O (Fig. 3b), leading to a lower valence state (e.g. Si3+), agreeing well with the results of the XPS analysis shown in Fig. 1e. Moreover, the introduced Si centers promoted electron mobility compared with native P centers within the unit cell of NVP, implying enhanced electroconductivity of NVP-Si. Furthermore, Na1V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, with two Na atoms extracted from the unit cells, was established to simulate the NVP-Si structure after charging, which was recovered to Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 after full discharging (Fig. S9†). The differential charge analysis indicated the electronic density of Si sites in Na1V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 was quite different from that in Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 (Fig. S10†), suggesting the change of Si valence state during the electrochemical cycling of NVP-Si. Bader charge analysis of the Si sites for NVP-Si was also applied. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Bader charge value of Si centers after charging was 0.023 eV lower than that after discharging, suggesting a higher valence state of Si centers after charging and a redox-active nature of these Si centers in NVP-Si, in good agreement with the results of the XPS analysis shown in Fig. 3a. In addition, it should be noted that the diffusion activation energy difference of NVP-Si after charging and discharging was 42.23 eV, higher than that of NVP (41.34 eV), leading to the higher theoretical discharge voltage for NVP-Si than that for NVP (3.746 V vs. 3.675 V, Table S2†), in accordance with the electrochemical results of the higher discharge voltage for NVP-Si shown in Fig. 2a.\nThe as-substituted SiO44− in NVP should not only increase the capacity by introducing redox-active Si centers and increasing the Na content, but also improve the rate performance by optimizing ion diffusion and intrinsic electroconductivity. As shown in Fig. 4a, Fig. S11 and S12,† the NVP-Si material showed faster Na+-ion diffusion kinetics than NVP at different depths of charge and discharge based on GITT measurements. Moreover, the NVP-Si showed a 0.1 eV lower energy barrier than that of NVP for the Na+-ion diffusion modeling (Fig. 4b), suggesting improved ion diffusion kinetics, which was in accordance with the GITT results. In order to study the effects of SiO44− substitution on the intrinsic electronic conductivity of NVP, the density of states (DOS) of both NVP and NVP-Si were calculated. The bandgap of the NVP-Si material was calculated to be 1.2 eV, 0.7 eV lower than that of NVP, indicating a higher electronic conductivity (Fig. 4c and S13†). Furthermore, when EIS was employed, as demonstrated in Fig. 4d and S14,† the solution resistance of NVP-Si was observed to be 3.9 Ω, lower than that of NVP (4.4 Ω), suggesting enhanced electroconductivity. Besides, the charge transfer resistance of NVP-Si was 420 Ω, also lower than that of NVP (1250 Ω), suggesting improved ion diffusion kinetics, in good agreement with the GITT and calculation results in Fig. 4a and b.\nThe electrochemical properties and practicability of as-achieved NVP-Si cathodes were further examined in a full-cell configuration by using commercial hard carbon (HC) anodes (Fig. 5a and S15†). The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of as-assembled HC||NVP and HC||NVP-Si full cells are shown in Fig. 5b, which suggested a high capacity of 102.7 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C for HC||NVP-Si full cells, 8.9 mA h g−1 higher than that for HC||NVP full cells. Such an NVP-Si cathode displayed a high energy density of 335.9 W h kg−1, which is among the highest energy densities when compared with the values reported for NVP-based cathodes in recent publications (Fig. S16†). The NVP-Si cathodes also exhibited improved rate performance in full-cell configurations (Fig. 5c), which showed a reversible capacity of 73.1 mA h g−1 under a high current density of 10 C, outperforming the HC||NVP full cells (49.3 mA h g−1 at 10 C). Furthermore, the HC||NVP-Si full cells manifested a long-term cycling stability with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a high average CE of 99.88%, far better than the HC||NVP cells (only 20.8% capacity retention under the same test conditions). It was noted that the as-assembled HC||NVP-Si full cell powered up a light emitting diode (LED) lamp successfully, indicating the NVP-Si as a promising SIB cathode material at a practical level.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthetic procedures\nThe silicate-substituted Na3V2(PO4)3 materials were prepared by combining hydrothermal and annealing methods. To prepare NVP-Si (i.e., Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1), 468.0 mg of NH4VO3 and 756.4 mg of oxalic acid were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under stirring at 70 °C. Afterwards, 296.8 mg of Na2CO3, 56.8 mg of Na2SiO3, and 667.2 mg of NH4H2PO4 were added to form a homogeneous solution, which was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 190 °C for 20 h. Subsequently, a gel precursor was obtained, which was mixed with 50 mL of 2 mg L−1 graphene oxide solution under stirring and dried at 120 °C. The as-obtained powder was annealed at 400 °C for 4 h and then at 700 °C for 8 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere. The preparation of Na3V2(PO4)3−x(SiO4)x (x = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.15) was the same as that of NVP-Si except for employing stoichiometric amounts of Na2SiO3 precursor.\n\n2.2 Material characterizations\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were conducted with a JEOL JSM-7100F Schottky field emission SEM instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi scanning microprobe.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical properties of as-prepared materials were evaluated by assembling standard CR2016-type coin cells in a glove box with an Ar atmosphere. The cathodes were prepared by coating the homogeneous mixture of 70 wt% active material, 20 wt% super P, and 10 wt% PVDF with an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent on an Al foil. Then the electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 6 h. The active material mass loading of the cathodes was 0.7 mg cm−2. For the half-cell assembly, sodium metal was employed as the anode, 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (EC:DMC = 1:1, wt%) with 5% FEC was employed as electrolyte, and glass fiber (GF/D, Whatman) was used as the separator. For the full-cell assembly, a HC anode was employed and the N/P mass ratio was carefully controlled to be 1.5:1. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on a Land battery system (LAND CT2001A). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted at an open circuit voltage with a frequency range of 10−1–105 Hz and an AC voltage of 5 mV. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement, the electrodes were tested by galvanostatic charging or discharging for 10 min and resting for 30 min.\n\n2.4 Theoretical calculations\nDensity functional theory analysis in this work was implemented with the Vienna ab initio simulation package. The electronic structures were calculated based on the exchange–correlation functional proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof with the spin-polarization scheme. The valence electrons were simulated with a plane-wave basis set, the cutoff energy was set as 400 eV and the core electrons were analyzed by the projector augmented wave method. The Bader division scheme of charge density was employed to calculate atomic charges of the materials.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Experimental\n\n2.1 Synthetic procedures\nThe silicate-substituted Na3V2(PO4)3 materials were prepared by combining hydrothermal and annealing methods. To prepare NVP-Si (i.e., Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1), 468.0 mg of NH4VO3 and 756.4 mg of oxalic acid were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under stirring at 70 °C. Afterwards, 296.8 mg of Na2CO3, 56.8 mg of Na2SiO3, and 667.2 mg of NH4H2PO4 were added to form a homogeneous solution, which was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 190 °C for 20 h. Subsequently, a gel precursor was obtained, which was mixed with 50 mL of 2 mg L−1 graphene oxide solution under stirring and dried at 120 °C. The as-obtained powder was annealed at 400 °C for 4 h and then at 700 °C for 8 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere. The preparation of Na3V2(PO4)3−x(SiO4)x (x = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.15) was the same as that of NVP-Si except for employing stoichiometric amounts of Na2SiO3 precursor.\n\n2.2 Material characterizations\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were conducted with a JEOL JSM-7100F Schottky field emission SEM instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi scanning microprobe.\n\n2.3 Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical properties of as-prepared materials were evaluated by assembling standard CR2016-type coin cells in a glove box with an Ar atmosphere. The cathodes were prepared by coating the homogeneous mixture of 70 wt% active material, 20 wt% super P, and 10 wt% PVDF with an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent on an Al foil. Then the electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 6 h. The active material mass loading of the cathodes was 0.7 mg cm−2. For the half-cell assembly, sodium metal was employed as the anode, 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (EC:DMC = 1:1, wt%) with 5% FEC was employed as electrolyte, and glass fiber (GF/D, Whatman) was used as the separator. For the full-cell assembly, a HC anode was employed and the N/P mass ratio was carefully controlled to be 1.5:1. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on a Land battery system (LAND CT2001A). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted at an open circuit voltage with a frequency range of 10−1–105 Hz and an AC voltage of 5 mV. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement, the electrodes were tested by galvanostatic charging or discharging for 10 min and resting for 30 min.\n\n2.4 Theoretical calculations\nDensity functional theory analysis in this work was implemented with the Vienna ab initio simulation package. The electronic structures were calculated based on the exchange–correlation functional proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof with the spin-polarization scheme. The valence electrons were simulated with a plane-wave basis set, the cutoff energy was set as 400 eV and the core electrons were analyzed by the projector augmented wave method. The Bader division scheme of charge density was employed to calculate atomic charges of the materials.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Synthesis and characterization\nThe schematic preparation processes of CBC and S-CBC using BC aerogels as precursors are illustrated in Scheme 1. The purified BC after fermentation was freeze-dried into BC aerogel, from which the flexible S-CBC was prepared by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation of BC aerogels under an Ar flow atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h, while CBC was prepared by carbonization alone. The sample photos are shown in Fig. S1.†\nTo study the chemical reactions more precisely, a number of techniques have been utilized to characterize the samples. The morphologies of BC, CBC and S-CBC are evidenced by SEM and TEM. The BC aerogel as the precursor has a 3D nano-fibrous network structure (Fig. S2a†). After carbonization, the obtained CBC inherits the nanofiber structure with highly cross-linked macropores (Fig. S2b and S3a†). Moreover, SEM and TEM images with different magnifications in Fig. 1a and b show that S-CBC obtained by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation at high temperatures also retains the fibrous structure well. Owing to the pyrolysis of cellulose during high-temperature carbonization, the diameter of fibers in S-CBC significantly shrinks compared to those in pristine BC. As presented in Fig. 1b, the width of S-CBC mostly ranges from 10 to 50 nm. According to HRTEM images, the microstructure of S-CBC and CBC obtained by carbonization is amorphous (Fig. 1c and Fig. S3b†). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1c) shows that S-CBC exhibits an obvious amorphous structure. In addition, the calculated carbon layer spacing of S-CBC is about 0.37 nm, larger than that of CBC (0.34 nm). This large carbon layer spacing can easily accommodate the large size of sodium ions and facilitate the transport of sodium ions. HAADF-STEM images demonstrate a uniform distribution of C, O, and S on the surface of S-CBC (Fig. 1d), in which homogeneous sulfur is conducive to ion diffusion. Furthermore, EDX analyzes the composition of CBC and S-CBC (Table 1). The atomic fractions of C, O and S in S-CBC are 88.66%, 5.39% and 5.95%, respectively, indicating the successful doping of the S element. The HAADF-STEM and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping also prove the existence of C and O elements in the CBC fiber, as shown in Fig. S3c.†\nThe phase structures of the samples were investigated by XRD. Three diffraction peaks at 2θ of around 15.0°, 17.4° and 23.3° can be observed in the original BC sample, corresponding well to the planes of (10), (110) and (200), respectively (Fig. S4†). As shown in Fig. 2a, these three peaks disappear in the CBC and S-CBC samples, which may be because the high temperature leads to the fracture or depolymerization of the cellulose macromolecular chain, thus losing the original crystallinity of BC. Meanwhile, a new wide diffraction peak at around 25° appears in both CBC and S-CBC, of which the 2θ value of S-CBC is smaller than that of CBC, which corresponds to the (002) diffraction of the amorphous carbon. Using the Bragg equation, we determine that the spacing between S-CBC layers is larger. These results indicate the formation of amorphous carbon during pyrolysis, which further supports the view shown in Fig. 1c.\nThe surface elements and electronic structures of CBC and S-CBC were analyzed by XPS. Fig. S5a† displays the C 1s high-resolution XPS spectrum of CBC. The three peaks located at binding energies of 284.8, 286.0, and 287.3 eV correspond to the C–C, C–O–C, and O–CO groups, respectively. As for the O 1s spectrum of CBC (Fig. S5b†), the two peaks located at binding energies of 531.8 and 533.3 eV are ascribed to O–CO and C–O, respectively. Fig. 2b shows the C 1s peaks of S-CBC, in which those located at binding energies of 284.8, 285.6, 287.1 and 289.4 eV correspond to the C–C, C–O–C, O–CO, and C–S groups, respectively. The existence of the C–S bond is due to the successful doping and bonding of S atoms. The two O 1s peaks of S-CBC at binding energies of 531.5 and 533.4 eV are assigned to O–CO and C–O, respectively, which are consistent with CBC (Fig. 2c). The high-resolution spectrum of S 2p in S-CBC (Fig. 2d) exhibits four peaks centered at 163.8, 165.0, 167.7 and 168.7 eV, which originate from the –C–S–C– covalent bond (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2) and oxidized sulfur (–C–Sox–C–), probably due to partial oxidation of surface sulfur by oxygen in the air. Quantitative XPS analysis in Table S1† shows that sulfur doping in S-CBC is 5.03 at%, which confirms the results of EDX. In particular, doping heteroatom S into the carbon skeleton can form more defects and introduce electrochemically active sites.\nExcept for the layer spacing, the graphitization degree of carbon also affects the Na-ion storage capacity. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2e) was carried out to study the graphitization degrees of CBC and S-CBC. CBC and S-CBC spectra present two prominent peaks at around 1332 and 1583 cm−1, along with the D band (sp3 lattice defects or disordered carbon) and the G band (sp2-hybridized crystalline graphitic carbon) of carbon materials, respectively. This proves the presence of graphitized carbon. The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) of S-CBC is 1.04, significantly higher than that of CBC (0.86), indicating that S-CBC has a higher disorder and defect degree. Consequently, we anticipate that S-CBC will display high electrochemical performance as a sodium ion battery.\nNitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms were used for evaluating the specific surface area and porosity of the materials. As displayed in Fig. 2f, CBC and S-CBC exhibit type-IV isotherms. The hysteresis loop of S-CBC appears at P/P0 > 0.4, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures, which is consistent with the TEM image. Meanwhile, the pore size distribution shows that the average pore size of S-CBC is about 12.6 nm, larger than that of CBC samples (1.48 nm). The increase in pore size after sulfur doping may be caused by the shrinkage of the S-CBC fiber diameter owing to the pyrolysis of S during the processes of high-temperature carbonization and vulcanization. Notably, the specific surface area of S-CBC is 53.1 m2 g−1, much smaller than that of CBC (336.6 m2 g−1). The results together show that sulfur doping could effectively increase the pore size and reduce the specific surface area of carbon, thus inhibiting the formation of a solid electrolyte layer, reducing the storage loss of Na+, and improving the initial Coulombic efficiency of the SIB anode.\n\n3.2. Electrochemical performances\nTo evaluate the electrochemical storage properties of S-CBC, we assembled a Na+ half-cell using sodium as the counter/reference electrode and S-CBC as the negative electrode of SIBs. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization of S-CBC was performed in the potential range from 0.01 to 3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 to investigate the Na+ insertion/extraction behavior. Fig. 3a shows the initial five CV curves of S-CBC. In the first scan, a large broad peak could be observed at 0.93 V, which was mainly caused by the decomposition of the electrolyte, the irreversible reaction of sodium ions with surface functional groups and the generation of a solid electrolyte interface film (SEI). In subsequent scans, the peak disappeared while a cathodic peak associated with Na+ insertion was observed in the low-voltage region (near 0 V). This peak still existed in subsequent cycles, indicating that the process was reversible. During successive scans, two different redox peaks appeared at 1.76/2.17 V and 1.06/1.82 V, which could be attributed to the stepwise redox reaction between S and Na. The results implied that the electrode had inserted/extracted sodium ions, and the covalent bond between S and Na was electrochemically active and could accommodate additional Na to increase the reversible capacity. The CV curves almost overlapped with each other, illustrating the favorable reversibility of the electrode.\nFig. 3b displays the first five galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of the S-CBC electrode at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The initial discharge curve presents a slow slope, showing the formation of an SEI, which is consistent with CV behavior. The initial specific discharge and charge capacities of S-CBC were found to be 1113.6 and 372.5 mA h g−1, respectively. The first Coulombic efficiency (CE) was 33.5%, much higher than that of CBC (26.8%, Fig. S6†). The initial Coulombic efficiencies of the materials are low and the irreversible capacity loss could be attributed to the formation of the SEI membrane in the first cycle and irreversible phase transitions, among others. Moreover, the GCD curves show favorable overlapping from the second to the fifth curve without significant changes, indicating high reversibility of the electrochemical reaction processes. After several cycles, the CE of S-CBC reached approximately 100%.\nFig. 3c and Fig. S7† show the cycling performance of the CBC and S-CBC electrodes at 100 mA g−1. Obviously, S-CBC has a higher Na+ storage capacity than CBC. The reversible specific capacity of S-CBC is 302.9 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, much higher than that of CBC (132.5 mA h g−1), presenting superior cycling stability. It can be seen that S doping has a significant impact on improving the cycling properties of materials.\nTo further study the sodium storage properties of S-CBC and CBC for SIBs, their rate performances were evaluated at different current densities. As shown in Fig. 3d, S-CBC demonstrates reversible discharge capacities of 313.2, 292.6, 260.5, 235.8, 204.9, and 148.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g−1, respectively. Impressively, S-CBC could also maintain a high capacity of 312.3 mA h g−1 when the current density is restored to its original 0.1 A g−1, suggesting its good rate performance. Nevertheless, CBC only achieves a rate of 6.5 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1. In addition, S-CBC exhibits excellent long cycling stability. At a high current density of 2 A g−1, S-CBC still delivers a high capacity of 177.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles, as shown in Fig. 3e. Significantly, sulfur doping plays a crucial role in the charging/discharging process of materials. It not only improves the electron transfer efficiency, but could also effectively adapt to the volume expansion during the charging/discharging processes at a high current density. The electrochemical performances of S-CBC are compared with some other carbon anode materials for SIBs in Table S1,† showing that S-CBC has superior electrochemical performance.\nTo further verify the structural stability of S-CBC, the SEM image of S-CBC after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 is displayed in Fig. S8.† S-CBC retains its original fibrous structure during the long cycling test, which ensures its excellent electrochemical performance. To research the Na+ storage mechanism of S-CBC, CV curves were measured at different scan rates from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a). Obviously, with the increase in scan rate, the shape of the CV curves was well preserved, which also proves that S-CBC has good scanning rate capability. According to the relationship between the peak current (i) and the scan rate (v), the contribution of capacity could be distinguished using the following equation:\nwhere a and b are adjustable parameters and the value of b could be calculated by plotting log(i) and log(v) curves. In general, a value of b close to 0.5 represents the full contribution of the embedded behavior of diffusion control, while a value close to 1 represents the contribution of capacitance completely induced by the surface. After plotting the peak current and scan rate in Fig. 4b, the cathodic peak b value of the S-CBC electrode was calculated to be 0.87, and the anodic peak b values were 1.00 and 0.92, respectively, indicating that the main electrochemical control process is surface-induced pseudocapacitance control behavior.\nThe quantization of capacitance contribution can be calculated using the following equation:\nwhere i(V) is the current at a given voltage, k1 and k2 are constant values, and k1v and k2v1/2 are the pseudocapacitive and diffusion contributions of the current, respectively. In Fig. 4c, the contribution of capacitive charge storage at the S-CBC electrode to the total current was measured at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1, and the capacitance contribution was 90.4%. The contribution ratio of the overall charge at different scan rates is shown in Fig. 4d. It can be seen that the capacitive contribution of S-CBC increased from 74.3% to 90.4% as the scan rate increased from 0.1 mV s−1 to 1 mV s−1. The results suggest that the high pseudocapacitive contribution plays a leading role in improving the rate and cycling capacity of S-CBC, which is in accordance with the preceding analysis.\nIn addition, the mechanisms of charge transport and storage capability were also evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Generally, the semicircle radius in the high-frequency range of the Nyquist diagram could be used to explain the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrode and electrolyte, whereas the sloped line corresponding to the diffusion coefficient in the low-frequency region is related to the diffusion process of sodium ions. As depicted in Fig. 4e and Fig. S9,† S-CBC possesses a smaller semicircle radius than pure CBC, indicating a lower Rct value and higher electrical conductivity. It could be inferred from the high kinetic characteristics of S-CBC that S doping could improve the diffusion kinetics, effectively facilitating Na+ transport and metastasis and ultimately leading to the improvement in the storage performance of sodium ions.\nThe diffusion coefficient of Na+ (DNa+) in S-CBC and CBC at 0.1 A g−1 was assessed using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) curves (Fig. 4f). The GITT potential curves presented similar trends, indicating that their sodium storage mechanisms are similar. The value of DNa+ could be calculated using the following equation:\nwhere τ is the pulse current time, mB and MB represent the mass and the molar mass of the active material, respectively, VM is the corresponding molar volume, A stands for the surface area of the electrode, ΔEs is the difference in the steady-state potential before and after the current pulse is applied, and ΔEτ is the total potential change during the constant current pulse, excluding the iR drop. Fig. S10† describes the sodiation and desodiation processes of S-CBC. The calculated DNa+ of S-CBC was 1.09 × 10−10 cm−2 s−1 during the process of sodiation/desodiation, indicating that the sulfur-doped electrode has strong sodium migration kinetics and a fast sodium storage mechanism.\n\n3.3. First-principles calculations\nTo better explain the role of S doping in the process of sodium storage in CBC, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the promoting effect of S doping on the adsorption and transport of sodium ions in CBC. A carbon model and an S-doped carbon model were constructed, respectively. The top and side views of adsorbed Na at the S-CBC and CBC interfaces are shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b suggests the adsorption energy of Na on S-CBC to be −1.179 eV, which is lower than that on CBC (−0.903 eV), which may be caused by the formation of a C–S bond. This lower adsorption energy indicates that S doping is conducive to the adsorption and storage of sodium ions in CBC, reflecting the strong adsorption stability of sodium in S-CBC, which is beneficial for the conversion reaction and capacitance control process.\nTo study the mobility of sodium in the material, the diffusion channels of sodium at the interface between CBC and S-CBC materials were further simulated. Fig. S11† shows the Na migration models of (a) pure carbon materials and (b) S-doped carbon materials. The calculated diffusion energy barrier at the S-CBC interface was 0.38 eV, which is significantly lower than 0.90 eV at the CBC interface, indicating that the S-CBC interface has a faster rate of sodium diffusion.\nTo deeply explore the electronic structure of the S-CBC and CBC materials, the charge density difference of sodium adsorption was investigated (Fig. 5c and d and Fig. S12†). The yellow and blue parts of the constructed model represent the accumulation and consumption of charges, respectively. Besides, the direction of electron transfer was determined by means of the plane-averaged electron density difference, which reflects the interface charge characteristics. As observed in Fig. 5d, the Δρ visualized by S-CBC could be obtained from the contour diagram, and the redistribution of charge mainly concentrates at the interface, further confirming the possible chemical bond cooperation. The results suggest that the charge was transferred from sodium to the graphene layer, and an S-CBC charge density transfer of 0.842e was greater than that of CBC (0.811e), implying that S-doping could make the material have an higher sodium binding energy. In addition, Fig. 5e shows the total state density (TDOS) and partial state density (PDOS) diagrams of S-CBC and CBC. After S atom doping, electrons are more abundant near the Fermi level than in pure graphene (Fig. S13†), and the DOS near the Fermi level increases slightly, which is mainly contributed by Sp orbitals. This slight increase in DOS indicates that the electronic conductivity is not significantly improved after S doping, which is also in good agreement with the results of EIS. At the same time, it reveals the important role of S doping in the adsorption of Na+.\nBased on the results above, the doping of the S element effectively improves the sodium ion diffusion rate of CBC and reduces the diffusion energy barrier, thus improving the rate performance and cycling stability. As shown in Fig. 6, the excellent performance of this material is mainly attributed to the following aspects. First, the porous structure of the S-CBC surface provides a fast transmission channel for sodium ions. Second, the doping of S effectively increases the pore size of carbon, resulting in a greater degree of disorder and defects, reducing the storage loss of Na, and improving the rate performance of S-CBC. Finally, doping of S makes S-CBC have strong adsorption stability, abundant active sites and bonding synergies, improving the storage capacity of sodium, which is conducive to the conversion reaction.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['cathode', 'anode', 'electrolyte']}, 'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_properties': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'capacity_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'capacity_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'capacity_type': {'type': 'string', 'enum': ['charge', 'discharge', 'reversible', 'specific', 'not mentioned']}, 'current_density_value': {'type': 'number'}, 'current_density_unit': {'type': 'string'}, 'cycle': {'type': 'number'}}, 'required': ['capacity_value', 'capacity_unit', 'capacity_type', 'current_density_value', 'current_density_unit', 'cycle'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material_type', 'material_name', 'material_formula', 'material_properties'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Preparation of BC\nBC hydrogel was prepared by static fermentation of A. xylinum NUST4.2 conserved in our laboratory as reported previously. In short, the seed suspension at 8% (v/v) was prepared in a sterilized fermentation medium and cultured under uniform oscillation at 30 °C for an activated seed inoculum system. The obtained suspension containing a large number of bacteria was transferred to a stainless steel tray and placed in an incubator at 30 °C for 3–4 days. The bio-based BC membrane collected in the supernatant was treated with a solution containing 3‰ sodium hydroxide and 3‰ hydrogen peroxide at 80 °C for 2 h to remove the residual thallus, and then washed with deionized water several times until the pH became neutral. The purified BC hydrogel was then freeze-dried into BC aerogel.\n\n2.2. Preparation of CBC and S-CBC\nS-CBC was synthesized by a facile calcination process. Typically, the as-prepared BC aerogel was placed at one end of a ceramic crucible, while sulfur powder with a mass ratio of 1:5 (sulfur to BC) was placed at the other end for sublimation. The resulting flexible self-supported S-CBC material was obtained by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a flowing Ar atmosphere. As a control, CBC without sulfur doping was prepared by carbonization of BC aerogel at 800 °C under the same reaction conditions as those mentioned above.\n\n2.3. Material characterization\nThe surface morphology and microstructure of the materials were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JEM-7800F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F), and elemental distribution analysis was conducted by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. The crystal structures of CBC and S-CBC were characterized using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.154 nm) in the 2 theta range of 10°–80°. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a laser Raman spectrometer (Labram-010, Renishaw) with a laser wavelength of 532 nm. The surface elemental states of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250XI) with an Al Kα source. The specific surface area and porosity of the samples were measured at 77 K using a N2 adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus).\n\n2.4. Electrochemical measurements\nThe working electrodes were prepared directly using binder-free 3D CBC and S-CBC. The materials were cut into circular structures with a diameter of 14 mm. CR2032 button batteries were placed in a glove box filled with argon gas and metallic sodium was used as the counter electrode. GF/A glass microfiber diaphragms were employed as separators. For the electrolyte, 1 M NaClO4 was used as the solute, and a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (PC) (1:1, v/v) with 5 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the solvent. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation to analyze the battery performance. The measurements of galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), based on the mass of the active substance, were carried out in a Land CT2001A system. The test voltage range was from 0.01 to 3 V.\n\n2.5. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations\nThe DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), in which the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange functions were implemented. The projected augmented wave (PAW) potential was used to describe the ionic nucleus, and the cut-off energy was set to 450 eV. The density of states (DOS) was calculated using the Brillouin zone integration with a Monkhorst–Pack 4 × 4 × 1 K-point grid. The convergence criteria for energy and force calculations were set to 10−5 eV per atom and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. To avoid interactions between periodic images, a vacuum layer thickness of 18 Å was chosen for the model. Here, the adsorption energy was calculated using the following equation: Ea = Esupport+Na − Esupport − ENa, where Esupport+Na, Esupport and ENa represent the bulk energies of the carrier with Na, the corresponding carrier and the free Na atom, respectively. Simultaneously, Na potential energy diffusion pathways and minimum diffusion energy barriers were studied for related carbon systems.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}

Preparation of BC\nBC hydrogel was prepared by static fermentation of A. xylinum NUST4.2 conserved in our laboratory as reported previously. In short, the seed suspension at 8% (v/v) was prepared in a sterilized fermentation medium and cultured under uniform oscillation at 30 °C for an activated seed inoculum system. The obtained suspension containing a large number of bacteria was transferred to a stainless steel tray and placed in an incubator at 30 °C for 3–4 days. The bio-based BC membrane collected in the supernatant was treated with a solution containing 3‰ sodium hydroxide and 3‰ hydrogen peroxide at 80 °C for 2 h to remove the residual thallus, and then washed with deionized water several times until the pH became neutral. The purified BC hydrogel was then freeze-dried into BC aerogel.\n\n2.2. Preparation of CBC and S-CBC\nS-CBC was synthesized by a facile calcination process. Typically, the as-prepared BC aerogel was placed at one end of a ceramic crucible, while sulfur powder with a mass ratio of 1:5 (sulfur to BC) was placed at the other end for sublimation. The resulting flexible self-supported S-CBC material was obtained by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a flowing Ar atmosphere. As a control, CBC without sulfur doping was prepared by carbonization of BC aerogel at 800 °C under the same reaction conditions as those mentioned above.\n\n2.3. Material characterization\nThe surface morphology and microstructure of the materials were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JEM-7800F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F), and elemental distribution analysis was conducted by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. The crystal structures of CBC and S-CBC were characterized using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.154 nm) in the 2 theta range of 10°–80°. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a laser Raman spectrometer (Labram-010, Renishaw) with a laser wavelength of 532 nm. The surface elemental states of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250XI) with an Al Kα source. The specific surface area and porosity of the samples were measured at 77 K using a N2 adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus).\n\n2.4. Electrochemical measurements\nThe working electrodes were prepared directly using binder-free 3D CBC and S-CBC. The materials were cut into circular structures with a diameter of 14 mm. CR2032 button batteries were placed in a glove box filled with argon gas and metallic sodium was used as the counter electrode. GF/A glass microfiber diaphragms were employed as separators. For the electrolyte, 1 M NaClO4 was used as the solute, and a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (PC) (1:1, v/v) with 5 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the solvent. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation to analyze the battery performance. The measurements of galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), based on the mass of the active substance, were carried out in a Land CT2001A system. The test voltage range was from 0.01 to 3 V.\n\n2.5. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations\nThe DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), in which the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange functions were implemented. The projected augmented wave (PAW) potential was used to describe the ionic nucleus, and the cut-off energy was set to 450 eV. The density of states (DOS) was calculated using the Brillouin zone integration with a Monkhorst–Pack 4 × 4 × 1 K-point grid. The convergence criteria for energy and force calculations were set to 10−5 eV per atom and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. To avoid interactions between periodic images, a vacuum layer thickness of 18 Å was chosen for the model. Here, the adsorption energy was calculated using the following equation: Ea = Esupport+Na − Esupport − ENa, where Esupport+Na, Esupport and ENa represent the bulk energies of the carrier with Na, the corresponding carrier and the free Na atom, respectively. Simultaneously, Na potential energy diffusion pathways and minimum diffusion energy barriers were studied for related carbon systems.\n\n'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_schema', 'json_schema': {'name': 'sodium_ion_battery_data', 'schema': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'starting_material': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'material_name': {'type': 'string'}, 'material_formula': {'type': 'string'}, 'amount': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'value': {'type': 'number'}, 'unit': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['value', 'unit'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['material_name', 'material_formula', 'amount'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['starting_material'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}, 'stream': False}}
