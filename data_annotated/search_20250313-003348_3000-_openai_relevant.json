        "abstract": "Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g-1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at ≈380 Wh kg-1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.",

        "title": "Demystifying In Situ Pyrolysis Chemistry for High-Performance Polyanionic Cathodes in Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "The carbon coating strategy has emerged as an indispensable approach to improve the conductivity of polyanionic cathodes. However, owing to the complex reaction process between precursors of carbon and cathode, establishing a unified screening principle for carbonaceous precursors remains a technical challenge. Herein, we reveal that carbonaceous precursor pyrolysis chemistry undeniably influences the formation process and performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes from in situ insights. By investigating three types of carbonaceous precursors, it is found that O/H-containing functional groups can provide more bonding sites for cathode precursors and generate a reducing atmosphere by pyrolysis, which is beneficial to the formation of polyanionic materials and a uniform carbon coating layer. Conversely, excessive pyrolysis of functional groups leads to a significant amount of gas, which is detrimental to the compactness of the carbon layer. Furthermore, the substantial presence of residual heteroatoms diminishes graphitization. In this case, it is demonstrated that carbon dots (CDs) precursors with suitable functional groups can comprehensively enhance the Na+ migration rate, reversibility, and interface stability of the cathode material. As a result, the NVP/CDs cathode displays outstanding capacity retention, maintaining 92% after 10,000 cycles at a high rate of 50 C. Altogether, these findings provide a valuable benchmark for carbon source selection for polyanionic cathodes.",

Li doping in layered transition-metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials is known to enhance their electrochemical properties. Nevertheless, the influence of Li at different locations in the structure has not been investigated. Here, the crystallographic role and electrochemical impact of lithium on different sites in PNNMO is investigated in LixNa0.67–yNi0.33Mn0.67O2+δ (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, y = 0, 0.1). Lithium occupancy on prismatic Na sites is promoted in Na-deficient (Na < 0.67) PNNMO, evidenced by ex situ and operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. Partial substitution of Na with Li leads to enhanced stability and slightly increased specific capacity compared to PNNMO. In contrast, when lithium is located primarily on octahedral TM sites, capacity is increased but at the cost of stability.",

        "abstract": "A cobalt-free biphasic (P2/O3) layered Na[Ni0.55Mn0.35Fe0.1]O2 (NFM) cathode material has been synthesized and dual surface and structural modifications have been performed. Bi5+ is doped into pure NFM in order to tune the P2/O3 phase, whereas, a thin layer of Bi2O3 is coated on surface of the Bi5+-doped NFM (BNFM) for surface modification. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance of prepared samples are analyzed and compared by various characterization techniques. The pristine NFM cathode exhibits the specific discharge capacity of 170 mAh g−1, while Bi-doped cathode exhibits 181 mAh g−1, and Bi2O3 coated cathode renders 180 mAh g−1. It is observed that, pristine NFM cathode suffers rapid capacity degradation and nearly ~80 % capacity loss within first 250 cycles. After 1000 cycles, BNFM shows 47 % capacity retention, while, Bi2O3 coated BNFM (BNMF@Bi2O3) shows 73 % capacity retention of initial capacity. This improvement in the rate capability is obtained due to the effect of Bi-doping and Bi2O3 coating, where, former enlarges interlayer spacing and latter provides the ionic conducting channel as well as protects the particle from the contact of the electrolyte. The combined effect of Bi-doping and Bi2O3 coating facilitates fast diffusion of Na-ions within the transition metal layers resulting in superior rate capability.",

        "abstract": "Charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface and mass transfer within the electrode are the two main factors affecting the high‐rate performance of O3‐type layered oxide cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries. Here a multidimensional lanthurization strategy is proposed to construct the surface LaCrO3 heterostructure and create a Cr─O─La configuration for O3‐type NaCrO2. The electrified heterogeneous LaCrO3 induces a built‐in electric field to accelerate charge transfer at the interface. Meanwhile, the Cr─O─La configuration in the transition metal layer leads to local charge aggregation, weakens the interaction force between Na─O, and reduces the Na+ migration barrier. This strategy significantly improves the electrochemical reaction kinetics and the structural reversibility of the layered oxide cathode. As a result, the designed stoichiometric ratio Na0.94Cr0.98La0.02O2 electrode exhibits remarkable rate performance (101.8 mAh g−1 at 40 C) as well as outstanding cycling stability (83.1% capacity retention at 20 C for 2000 cycles) in a half‐cell, along with a competitive full battery performance (89.3% after 500 cycles at 2 C).

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries are proposed as the most appropriate alternative to lithium batteries due to the fast consumption of the limited lithium resources. Due to their improved safety, polyanion framework compounds have recently gained attention as potential candidates. With the earth‐abundant element Fe being the redox center, the uniform carbon‐coated Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite represents a promising alternative for sodium‐ion batteries. The electrochemical results show that the as‐prepared Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite can deliver capacity of ≈100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 120 mA g−1), with capacity retention of 92.3% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. After adding fluoroethylene carbonate additive to the electrolyte, 89.6% of the initial capacity is maintained, even after 1100 cycles at 5 C. The electrochemical mechanism is systematically investigated via both in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The results show that the sodiation and desodiation are single‐phase‐transition processes with two 1D sodium paths, which facilitates fast ionic diffusion. A small volume change, nearly 100% first‐cycle Coulombic efficiency, and a pseudocapacitance contribution are also demonstrated. This research indicates that this new compound could be a potential competitor for other iron‐based cathode electrodes for application in large‐scale Na rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has been recognized as a promising material for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity. However, tremendous volume variation and low conductivity limit its widespread applications. Hence, we design and synthesize uniformly distributed honeycomb-like hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon nanospheres (HHPCNSs) with ultralarge pore volume (3.258 cm3 g-1) on a large scale through a facile way. The large pore volume provides enough space for loading of P and the expansion of P, and the uniform distribution of the micro-mesopores makes the red P loaded uniformly. The resulted HHPCNSs/P composite exhibits extremely high capacity (2463.8 and 2367.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively), splendid rate performance (842.2 and 831.1 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively) and superior cycling stability (1201.6 and 938.4 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for LIBs, and 1269.4 and 861.8 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for SIBs, respectively). More importantly, when coupled with LiFePO4 and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, lithium/sodium-ion full batteries display high capacity, superior rate and cycling performances, revealing the practicability of HHPCNSs/P composite. The exceptional electrochemical performance is caused by the honeycomb-like carbon network with ultralarge pore volume, uniformly distributed hierarchical micro-mesoporous nanostructure, outstanding electronic conductivity and excellent nanostructural stability, which is much better than currently reported P/C materials for both LIBs and SIBs.",

Herein, we present an Mg2+ doping strategy to conquer the above crucial obstacles and carry out a systematic investigation of how the Mg doping affect the sodium storage performance of NMAP. The findings indicate that this method endows the materials with boosted electrode reaction kinetics and structural stability. Consequently, the composites show visible enhancements in the electrochemical performance after the introduction of Mg. The optimal Mg doped sample (Mg0.10-NMAP/C) presents a high discharge capacity of 105.1 mAh g−1 and an acceptable energy density of 360.5 Wh kg−1 at 0.1 C, as compared with those (91.4 mAh g−1 and 308 Wh kg−1) of undoped NMAP/C.

Our study offers a valuable strategy to modify NMAP with improved electrochemical performance, which would accelerate its course of commercial application.",

        "abstract": "Cu-Ni-Mn-based ternary P2-type NaxCu0.15Ni0.20Mn0.65O2 (x = 0.50, 0.67, and 0.75) cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are synthesized by a co-precipitation method. We find that Na content plays a key role on the structure, morphology, and the charge-discharge performances of these materials. For x = 0.67 and 0.75, superstructure from Na+-vacancy ordering is observed, while it is absent in the x = 0.50 sample. Despite the same synthesis conditions, materials with x = 0.67 and 0.75 show smaller particle sizes compared to that of the x = 0.50 sample. In addition, redox potentials of the materials differ significantly even though they have the same transition metal ratios. These differences are attributed to the changes in local structures of the as-prepared materials arising from the different amount of Na and possibly oxygen in the lattice. Materials with x = 0.67 and 0.75 show excellent rate performance and cycle stability when tested as cathode material of SIBs. Average discharge potential is as high as 3.41 V versus Na-Na+ with capacity of 87 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1. Excellent capacity and cycle stability are maintained even when they are tested with higher current rates. For instance, a capacity of 62.3 mAh g-1 is obtained from the x = 0.67 sample at 1000 mA g-1 after 1000 cycles between 3.0 and 4.2 V without any decrease in capacity.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 has shown great promise in next-generation cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owning to its fast Na+ diffusion in the three-dimensional open NASICON framework and high theoretical energy density. However, Na3V2(PO4)3 suffers from undesirable rate performance and unstable cyclability arising from low electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a facile approach for significantly enhancing the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3 by Ti doping at V site and constructing nanoparticle@carbon core-shell nanostructure. This material design provides fast electron conduction network within the whole active particles because of the mixed valence Ti4+/3+ in bulk and highly conductive carbon shell on the surface. Lattice doping and carbon coating reduce the electrode polarization and facilitate the electrode reaction kinetics, while the nanostructure enhances the ionic conduction by shortening the diffusion distance and offers sufficient contact of active particles with organic electrolyte. The multiple synergetic effects enable a superior electrochemical performance. The optimized Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C cathode shows a high specific capacity (116.6 mAh g-1 at 1C), an unprecedented rate performance (93.4 mAh g-1 at 400C), and an exceptional long-term high-rate cycling stability (capacity retention of 69.5% after 14 000 cycles at 100C, corresponding to 0.0002% decay per cycle).",

However, the material suffers from severe capacity decay during the electrochemical reaction process. Herein, P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2 cathode is gained by moderately substituting lithium/zinc into the nickel sites. The inactive Li/Zn co-substitution is endowed with safeguard ability to stabilize the crystal structure, resulting in enhanced electrochemical kinetics and remarkable long cyclic performance in liquid & solid-state electrolyte. Thus the Li/Zn co-substituted cathode presents specific capacity of 154 mAh g1 at the first discharge process, excellent rate capability with 77 mAh g1 at a high current density of 5 C, and long cyclic stability in liquid-state batteries. Excitingly, it is also endowed with a high capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles in solid-state batteries.

        "abstract": "Utilizing anion redox reaction is crucial for developing the next generation of high‐energy density, low‐cost sodium‐ion batteries. However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction in Na‐ion layered cathodes, which leads to voltage fading and reduced overall lifespan, has hindered their practical application. In this study, selenium is incorporated as a synergistic redox active center of oxygen to improve the stability of Na‐ion cathodes. The redesigned cathode maintains stable voltage by demonstrating reversible oxygen redox while significantly suppressing the redox activity of manganese. The anionic redox contribution capacity of the selenium‐doped Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 cathode remains as high as 84% after 50 cycles, while the pristine Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 cathode experiences a reduction to 39% of its initial capacity. The X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy data and computational analysis further revealed that selenium doping participates in redox as Se+4/5 which stabilizes the charged state and increases the energy step for O─O dimerization, thus improving the stability and lifespan of Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 cathodes.

However, challenges such as phase separation arising from different expansion coefficients among phases under high voltage or during prolonged cycling have been a concern.

The introduced stabilized spinel-bridged phase can create a structural confinement between the O3 and P2 phases and realize interface reconstructing simultaneously by target-element optimization. Based on the experimental and computational results, the multiphase riveting-structured O3/spinel/P2 triphasic structure provides a structural constraint and alleviates the internal stress, which can suppress detrimental irreversible phase changes to enhance the structural reversibility and stability.

Nat. Commun. 2014, 5, 4358). It forms an Fe-based polyanionic compound delivering the highest Fe-redox potential along with excellent rate kinetics and reversibility. However, like all known SO4-based insertion materials, its synthesis is cumbersome that warrants careful processing avoiding any aqueous exposure. Here, an alternate low temperature ionothermal synthesis has been described to produce the alluaudite Na2+2xFe(II)2-x(SO4)3. It marks the first demonstration of solvothermal synthesis of alluaudite Na2+2xM(II)2-x(SO4)3 (M = 3d metals) family of cathodes. Unlike classical solid-state route, this solvothermal route favors sustainable synthesis of homogeneous nanostructured alluaudite products at only 300 °C, the lowest temperature value until date. The current work reports the synthetic aspects of pristine and modified ionothermal synthesis of Na2+2xFe(II)2-x(SO4)3 having tunable size (300 nm ∼5 μm) and morphology. It shows antiferromagnetic ordering below 12 K. A reversible capacity in excess of 80 mAh/g was obtained with good rate kinetics and cycling stability over 50 cycles. Using a synergistic approach combining experimental and ab initio DFT analysis, the structural, magnetic, electronic, and electrochemical properties and the structural limitation to extract full capacity have been described.",

This study investigates the co-substitution of Cu, Mg, and Ti, guided by principles of the periodic law, to enhance the material's stability under varying conditions. The substituent elements were selected based on their atomic properties and introduced into specific sites within the structure: Cu and Mg were substituted at Ni sites, while Ti replaced Mn sites. These modifications strengthened the crystal lattice, mitigating phase transitions, and improved electrochemical performance.

Furthermore, it exhibited remarkable high-temperature stability in half-cell testing and excellent cycling performance in full-cell evaluations.

This work aims to provide a deeper insight into the dehydration process of PW materials and a better understanding of the impact of their fast rehydration, upon exposure to moisture, on their characterization. For this purpose, a Na1.87Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.99·1.99H2O sample was synthesized by a coprecipitation method and subsequently dehydrated to remove water. After thorough characterization, our findings show that drying parameters, such as temperature and pressure, strongly influence the post-drying result.

NVF nanoparticles show an excellent Na+ storage capacity (∼205 mAh g-1) in a high voltage window up to 4.2 V with ultralong cycling stability. That is associated with the mixed occupancy of V and Na in NVF. The multivalent V centers serve as electron reservoirs to inhibit phase transformation, and the Na-enriched Na3VF6 with better electron conductivity acts as a Na+ reservoir for effective electron transfer.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are gaining broad application prospects in the field of new energy due to their high energy density, low cost, and good safety. However, the irreversible phase transformation of layered oxides during charge and discharge cycles limits their long-term cycling performance and practicality. This article utilizes the sol–gel method to prepare a stable Na_0.7MnO_2 (NMO) crystal phase and explores the effects of double doping with Fe and Co on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of Na_0.7MnO_2. The XRD pattern indicates that Fe and Co ions were successfully incorporated into the lattice of the Na-Mn–O system, stabilizing the P2 crystal phase and increasing the sodium layer spacing. Na_0.7Co_0.1Fe_0.1Mn_0.8O_2(NCFMO) can deliver an initial capacity of 109.78 mAh/g, with an average operating voltage of 3 V, and retains a capacity retention rate of 96.31% after 100 cycles. Moreover, at a current density of 0.2 C and a voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V, the cycle charge–discharge specific capacity reaches 226.08 and 159.3 mAh/g, respectively, demonstrating excellent cycle and rate performance. Graphical abstract The cycle performance of the material Na_0.7Co_0.1Fe_0.1Mn_0.8O_2 in different voltage ranges is tested in the figure, and it shows excellent performance in the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V.",

        "abstract": "Fe-based mixed phosphate cathodes for Na-ion batteries usually possess weak rate capacity and cycle stability challenges resulting from sluggish diffusion kinetics and poor conductivity under the relatively low preparation temperature. Here, the excellent sodium storage capability of this system is obtained by introducing the high-entropy doping to enhance the electronic and ionic conductivity. As designed high-entropy doping Na4 Fe2.85 (Ni,Co,Mn,Cu,Mg)0.03 (PO4 )2 P2 O7 (NFPP-HE) cathode can release 122 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, even 85 mAh g-1 at ultrahigh rate of 50 C, and keep a high retention of 82.3% after 1500 cycles at 10 C. Besides, the cathode also exhibits outstanding fast charge capacity in terms of the cyclability and capacity with 105 mAh g-1 at 5 C/1 C, corresponding 94.3% retention after 500 cycles. The combination of in situ X-ray diffraction, density functional theory, conductive-atomic force microscopy, and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique tests reveal that the reversible structure evolution with optimized Na+ migration path and energy barrier boost the Na+ kinetics and improve the interfacial electronic transfer, thus improving performance.",

        "title": "Dehydration Achieving the Iron Spin State Regulation of Prussian Blue for Boosted Sodium-Ion Storage Performance.",
        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) show promise as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries due to their notable cycle stability, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendly nature, yet the presence of interstitial water limits the specific capacity and obstructs Na+ mobility within the material. Although considerable experimental efforts are focused on dehydrating water for capacity enhancement, there is still a deficiency of a comprehensive understanding of the low capacity of low-spin Fe resulting from interstitial water, which holds significance in Na+ storage. This study introduces a novel gas-assisted heat treatment method to efficiently remove interstitial water from Fe-based PBA (NaFeHCF) electrodes and combines experiments and theoretical calculations to reveal the iron spin state regulation that is related to the capacity enhancement mechanism. This dehydration strategy significantly enhances battery capacity, especially the portion at higher voltages (3.4-4.0 V). The increase in capacity is attributed to the following factors: an enhanced proportion of Fe2+, reduced water content which facilitates faster charge transfer, and the activation of low spin Fe2+. The optimized NaFeHCF demonstrated impressive half-cell performance of retaining 87.3% capacity after 2000 cycles at a 5 C rate and achieving 100 mAh g-1 capacity over 200 cycles when being paired with hard carbon, exhibiting its practical potential.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by its high-active and open layered framework for fast Li+ extraction/insertion reactions, layered Ni-rich oxide is proposed as an outstanding Na-intercalated cathode for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.

Furthermore, the reaction mechanism of layered Ni-rich oxide during Na+ extraction/insertion is investigated in detail by combining ex situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy. As an excellent cathode for Na-ion batteries, O3-type Na0.75 Ni0.82 Co0.12 Mn0.06 O2 delivers a high reversible capacity of 171 mAh g-1 and a remarkably stable discharge voltage of 2.8 V during long-term cycling. In addition, the fast Na+ transport in the cathode enables high rate capability with 89 mAh g-1 at 9 C.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a candidate for the stationary energy storage systems because of the low cost and high abundance of sodium. However, the energy density and lifespan of SIBs suffer severely from the irreversible consumption of the Na-ions for the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and other side reactions on the electrodes. Here, Na3.5C6O6 is proposed as an air-stable high-efficiency sacrificial additive in the cathode to compensate for the lost sodium. It is characteristic of low desodiation (oxidation) potential (3.4-3.6 V vs. Na+/Na) and high irreversible desodiation capacity (theoretically 378 mAh g-1). The feasibility of using Na3.5C6O6 as a sodium compensation additive is verified with the improved electrochemical performances of a Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2ǀǀhard carbon cells and cells using other cathode materials. In addition, the structure of Na3.5C6O6 and its desodiation path are also clarified on the basis of comprehensive physical characterizations and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This additive decomposes completely to supply abundant Na ions during the initial charge without leaving any electrochemically inert species in the cathode. Its decomposition product C6O6 enters the carbonate electrolyte without bringing any detectable negative effects. These findings open a new avenue for elevating the energy density and/or prolonging the lifetime of the high-energy-density secondary batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-based cathode materials are of great interest due to their high specific capacities for sodium ion batteries. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and the inevitable phase transition are detrimental for achieving considerable cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, a P2-type manganese oxide nanoplate cathode material modified by Mo-substitution with oriented stacking structure and exposed {010} active facets is reported. The manganese oxide nanoplate cathode yields remarkable capacity retention of 87.8% after 1200 cycles at 10C (2000 mA g-1). The specific power density is estimated as high as 530 W Kg-1 with a specific discharge capacity 143.9 mA h g-1 at 1C and 89.6% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances can be attributed to the efficient chemical modification and the unique structural features of the present manganese oxide nanoplate. Mo-modification can endow manganese oxide cathode with enlarged lattice space and average oxidation state and thus favorable Na+ diffusion to inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and improve the structure stability, thereby achieving an extremely long cycling life. Multilayer oriented stacking nanoplate structure with exposed {010} active facets is also beneficial for providing more surface active sites and shortening the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better rate capability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising alternatives for large-scale energy storage owing to the rich resource and cost effectiveness. However, there are limitations of suitable low-cost, high-rate cathode materials for fast charging and high-power delivery in grid systems. Herein, a biphasic tunnel/layered 0.80Na0.44 MnO2 /0.20Na0.70 MnO2 (80T/20L) cathode delivering exceptional rate performance through subtly regulating the sodium and manganese stoichiometry is reported. It delivers a reversible capacity of 87 mAh g-1 at 4 A g-1 (33 C), much higher than that of tunnel Na0.44 MnO2 (72 mAh g-1 ) and layered Na0.70 MnO2 (36 mAh g-1 ). It proves that the one-pot synthesized 80T/20L is able to suppress the deactivation of L-Na0.70 MnO2 under air-exposure, which improves the specific capacity and cycling stability. Based on electrochemical kinetics analysis, the electrochemical storage of 80T/20L is mainly based on pseudocapacitive surface-controlled process. The thick film of 80T/20L cathode (a single-side mass loading over 10 mg cm-2 ) also has superior properties of pseudocapacitive response (over 83.5% at a low sweep rate of 1 mV s-1 ) and excellent rate performance. In this sense, the 80T/20L cathode with outstanding comprehensive performance could meet the requirements of high-performance SIBs.",

Herein, we report on the outstanding cathode performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP@C-ZIF67) wrapped by the ZIF-67-derived carbon, which was prepared by sol-gel method and solid-phase method. Electrochemical measurements show an initial discharge-specific capacity of 135 mA h g-1 at 1 C, and the discharge capacity maintains 82 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 10 C. The results indicate the improvement in electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance due to the Co doping from ZIF-67. Moreover, we calculate the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions by the cyclic voltammetry (CV, DNa+ = 1.521 × 10-11 and 2.3484 × 10-11 cm2 s-1 for charging and discharging, respectively) and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT, DNa+ ranges from 10-11-10-15 cm2 s-1).

        "abstract": "Enhancing the kinetics of lattice oxygen redox (LOR) in P2‐type layered sodium oxide cathodes is crucial for the advancement of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with superior energy and power densities. Electronic structure regulation stands out as a highly effective approach to address the inherent limitations of P2‐type layered oxides with LOR, including sluggish kinetics, phase transitions, voltage hysteresis, and local structural distortion. Herein, a strategy involving the introduction of CoO6 octahedra with π‐interaction into Na0.6Li0.1Fe0.3−xCoxMn0.6O2 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.3) cathodes to facilitate Na‐ion transport is proposed. Furthermore, the impact of FeO6 octahedra with σ‐interaction in P2‐type cathodes on electrochemical performance is comprehensively investigated. Through multimodal in‐situ and ex‐situ characterization techniques, it is revealed that Co─O with π‐interaction effectively mitigates P2‐OP4 phase transitions by strengthening Na─O, reduces voltage hysteresis, and stabilizes the local structure. Consequently, Na0.6Li0.1Co0.3Mn0.6O2 demonstrates enhanced Na‐ion diffusion kinetics, leading to improved rate performance and a reversible capacity of 55 mAh g−1 at 10 C, significantly outperforming cathodes with Fe─O σ‐interaction. Moreover, when coupled with hard carbon, the full cell achieves a remarkable energy density of 395 Wh kg−1 (on cathode) at 0.1 C, with a capacity retention of 75% over 100 cycles at 1 C.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) is attracting great interest due to its large capacity and high working voltage. However, the poor electronic conductivity limits the electrochemical performance of NVPOF. Herein, we fabricate N/P-dual-doped carbon coated NVPOF microspheres (labeled as NVPOF@P/N/C) via a hydrothermal process followed by heat treatment. This microsphere-structured NVPOF@P/N/C composite has a relatively high tap density of 1.22 g cm-3. TEM and XPS results reveal that the dual-doped carbon layer is tightly coated on the NVPOF surface due to the bridging effect of P and has a good protective effect on NVPOF. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that N/P-dual-doped carbon layer is advantageous to achieve higher electronic conductivity and lower migration activation energy than the undoped and single N- or P-doped carbon layer. As cathode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), the NVPOF@P/N/C exhibits high capacity (128 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 122 mAh g-1 at 2 C) and ultra-long cycle performance (only 0.037% capacity fading rate per cycle in 500 cycles at 2 C). We believe that the NVPOF@P/N/C composite is appealing for high-performance SIBs with large energy density.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been widely recognized as superior cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to numerous merits. However, originating from the rapid crystal growth, PBAs still suffer from considerable vacancy defects and interstitial water, making the preparation of long-cycle-life PBAs the greatest challenge for its practical application. Herein, a novel equilibrium chelation strategy is first proposed to synthesize a high crystallinity (94.7%) PBAs, which is realized by modulating the chelating potency of strong chelating agents via \"acid effect\" to achieve a moderate chelating effect, forcefully breaking through the bottleneck of poor cyclic stability for PBAs cathodes. Impressively, the as-prepared highly crystalline PBAs represent an unprecedented level of electrochemical performance including ultra-long lifespan (10000 cycles with 86.32% capacity maintenance at 6 A g-1), excellent rate capability (82.0 mAh g-1 at 6 A g-1). Meanwhile, by pairing with commercial hard carbon, the as-prepared PBAs-based SIBs exhibit high energy density (350 Wh kg-1) and excellent capacity retention (82.4% after 1500 cycles), highlighting its promising potential for large-scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic Na2FePO4F is one of the most important cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The orthorhombic β-Na2FePO4F material has been studied extensively and intensively since it was proposed. In this article, a novel monoclinic sodium phosphate fluoride α-Na2FePO4F is concerned. Kirsanova's experiment showed that Na and Fe ions in α-Na2FePO4F are prone to antisite, leading to strong antisite disorder. Through first-principle calculations, we show that the steric effect, the magnetic exchange and superexchange interactions between transition-metal cations are shown to be the main driving forces for Na+/Fe2+ antisite disorder. We first calculated the crystal structures, electronic properties, and cohesive energies of all the 10 antisite phases of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F. Then, we compared the difference charge densities, magnetism, binding energies, and electrostatic potentials of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F materials in the antisite and pristine phases. In α-Na2FePO4F, the binding energy of the antisite phase with the lowest binding energy is almost degenerate with that of the pristine phase. Moreover, only small differences of the electrostatic potential and the charge density distribution are found between the antisite (with lowest energy) and the pristine phases of α-Na2FePO4F, which also helped elaborate the facile formation of Na+/Fe2+ antisite in the α-Na2FePO4F material. Our research contributes to the understanding of the mechanism of Na+/Fe2+ antisite and the development of high-performance polyanionic cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "To mitigate the environmental impact of the improper disposal of spent LiFePO4 batteries and reduce resource waste, the development of LiFePO4 recycling technologies is of paramount importance. Meanwhile, olivine-structured NaFePO4 in sodium-ion batteries has received great attention, due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 154 mAh g-1 and excellent stability. However, olivine NaFePO4 only can be synthesized from olivine LiFePO4. Accordingly, in this proposal, developing the continuous flow electrochemical solid-liquid reactor-based metal ion insertion technology is to utilize the olivine FePO4, recycled from LiFePO4, and to synthesize NaFePO4. Additionally, by employing I- as the reducing agent, NaFePO4 is successfully synthesized with a discharge-specific capacity of 134 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a remarkable capacity retention rate of 86.5% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the reasons for sodium deficiency in the synthesized NFP are elucidated through first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the kinetics of the solid-solution reaction 2 (Na2/3+βPO4→ Na1-αFePO4) mechanism improve with cycling and are sensitive to temperature. Utilizing a minimal amount of reducing agent in the electrochemical reactor, NaFePO4 synthesis is successfully achieved. This innovative approach offers a new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly strategy for preparing NaFePO4 from recycling LiFePO4.",

        "abstract": "The P2-layered metal oxide cathode materials are crucial for constructing high-rate sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, its practical application is hindered by the high Na+ diffusion barrier resulting from Na+/vacancy ordering. Herein, a Li/Zn cosubstitution P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NLNZM) cathode was synthesized via a sol-gel method assisted with citric acid, which can induce the rearrangement of Na+ sites to disrupt ordered structures. The XRD Rietveld refinement confirms a higher occupancy of Na+ at Nae sites with low diffusion barriers through the Li/Zn cosubstitution. In addition, the highly reversible phase evolution of the NLNZM is confirmed through in situ XRD results, thereby ensuring the stability of the structure with low volume change rate (0.78%). Furthermore, Li and Zn can reduce the surface energy and increase the interlayered distance to achieve rapid interfacial kinetics. As a result, the NLNZM has exhibited a high reversible capacity of 152.8 mAh g-1 and an outstanding rate performance of 103.4 mAh g-1 at 5C. After 200 cycles at 5C, the capacity retention rate is 81.1%.

Nevertheless, the intricate phase transitions during the charging-discharging significantly impede its practical application. This paper proposes a strategy for successfully synthesizing NaNi0.5Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 (NNMT) by combining coprecipitation and a high-temperature solid-state method. This method introduces Ti elements while retaining the electrochemically active Ni2+ content, thus, the NNMT has a high initial specific capacity of 151.4 mAh g-1 at 1 C. It is demonstrated that introducing Ti4+ leads to the transition metal layers becoming disordered by ex situ XRD, thus mitigating the irreversible phase transition of the material. In addition, Ti4+ does not have an outer electron, which can reduce electron delocalization in the transition metal layer and improve the material's cyclic stability. The NNMT possesses a capacity retention rate of 60.66% after 150 cycles, much higher than the initial NNM's 18.96%. It also exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 86.8 mAh g-1 at 5 C. In conclusion, the cycling and rate performance of the Ti-substituted NNMT are greatly improved without capacity loss, which offers innovative concepts for the modification means of the SIBs layered oxide cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathodes are primarily limited by complex phase transitions and sluggish kinetics resulting in rapid capacity drop and poor rate capability. Even worse, its inherent air sensitivity leads to spontaneous extraction of lattice Na-ions and the deactivation of the cathode. Simultaneous modification of both the bulk phase and the surface structure is promising to offset the above deficiencies. A spinel@O3 type layered composite structure Na0.9Mn0.5Ni0.5Cu0.1O2+x (NMNCO-SL) was constructed for the design of cathodes with higher cycling, rate and air stability. The atomic-level Cu-rich spinel structure on the surface was identified by scanning transmission electron microscopy, elemental linear scanning analysis and Raman spectra. In situ charge-discharge X-ray diffraction results show that the phase transition of NMNCO-SL is significantly suppressed. Finally, the material maintains good electrochemical properties after exposure to stringent humidity environments. The results indicate that the spinel structure at the surface plays a significant role in improving ion-diffusion dynamics, enhancing structural integrity, and increasing air stability. 1 Ah pouch cell based on NMNCO-SL showed 92% capacity retention after 500 cycles of charge/discharge cycling at 1 C, demonstrating the potential prospects of customizing the surface phase structure for materials engineering applications.",

A group of P2-type cathodes containing various amounts of Ti is prepared using a facile synthetic method. These cathodes show different behaviors of the Na+/vacancy ordering. Na0.67CoO2 suffers severe capacity loss at high voltages due to irreversible structure changes causing serious polarization, while the Ti-substituted cathodes have long credible cycleability as well as high energy. In particular, Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 exhibits excellent capacity retention (115 mAh g-1) even after 100 cycles, whereas Na0.67CoO2 exhibits negligible capacity retention (<10 mAh g-1) at 4.5 V cutoff conditions.

The capacity of the cathode combined with that provided by the electrolyte redox reaction thus increases overall charge storage.

The capacity of DESIB with Na-FC electrolyte is twice that of a battery using a conventional (Na2 SO4 ) electrolyte.

        "abstract": "Layered oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacities. However, many of these layered materials experience severe capacity decay when operated at high voltage (>4.25 V), hindering their practical application. It is essential to design high-voltage layered cathodes with improved stability for high-energy-density operation. Herein, nano P2-Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 (NCM) materials are synthesized using a modified Pechini method as a prospective high-voltage sodium storage component without any modification. The changes in the local ionic state around Ni, Mn, and Co ions with respect to the calcination temperature are recorded using X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Among the electrodes, NCM fired at 850 °C (NCM-850) exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with an initial capacity and energy density of 148 mAh g–1 and 555 Wh kg–1, respectively, when cycled between 2 and 4.5 V at 160 mA g–1 along with improved cyclic stability after 100 charge/discharge cycles. In addition, the NCM-850 electrode is capable of maintaining a 75 mAh g–1 capacity even at a current density of 3200 mA g–1. In contrast, the cell fabricated with NCM obtained at 800 °C shows continuous capacity fading because of the formation of an impurity phase during the synthesis process. The obtained capacity, rate performance, and energy density along with prolonged cyclic life for the cell fabricated with the NCM-850 electrodes are some of the best reported values for sodium-ion batteries as compared to those of other p2-type sodium intercalating materials.",

Using a quenching process with various amounts of a Li dopant, the Mn oxidation state in β-Na0.7[Mn1-xLix]O2+y is carefully controlled without the inclusion of impurities. Through various in situ and ex situ analyses including X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, we clarify the dependence of (i) reaction mechanisms on disordered Li distribution in the Mn layer, (ii) reversible capacities on the initial Mn oxidation state, (iii) redox potentials on the Jahn-Teller distortion, (iv) capacity fading on phase transitions during charging and discharging, and (v) electrochemical performance on Li dopant vs Mn vacancy.

Herein, a comprehensive methodology to unveil an interplay mechanism among phase structures, interfacial microcrack, and thermal stability of the charged P2-Na0.8Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) and the P2-Na0.8Ni0.21Li0.12Mn0.67O2 (NNMO-Li) at elevated temperatures is established. Combining a series of crystallographic and thermodynamic characterization techniques, the specific chemical reactions occurring in the NNMO materials during thermal runaway are clarified first and solidly proved that Li doping effectively hinders the dissolution of transition metal ions, reduces oxygen release, and enhances thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Importantly, based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations, the kinetic triplet model is successfully constructed to in-depth elucidate the thermal decomposition reaction mechanism of P2-NaxTMO2, demonstrating that such thermodynamic assessment provides a new perspective for building high-safety SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion of Mn3+ always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials. Herein, we unveil the \"intrinsic distortion against J-T distortion\" mechanism to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of LMRO cathodes. The intrinsic distortion simply constructed by introducing bulk oxygen vacancies is systematically confirmed by advanced synchrotron X-ray techniques, atomic-scale imaging characterizations, and theoretical computations, which can counteract the J-T distortion during cycling due to their opposite deformation orientations. This greatly decreases and uniformizes the lattice strain within the ab plane and along the c axis of the material, thereby alleviating the P2-P'2 phase transition as well as suppressing the edge dislocation and intragranular crack formation upon repeated cycles. As a result, the tailored P2-Na0.72Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode featuring intrinsic distortion delivers a considerably enhanced cycling durability (91.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles) without sacrificing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox capacity (186.5 mAh g-1 at 0.3 C). This intrinsic distortion engineering paves a brand-new and prospective avenue toward achieving high-performance LMRO cathodes for SIBs.",

However, the challenge of developing efficient cathode materials remains significant. In this study, we present an economical synthesis method to stabilize Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3@C (NVPF@C) nanoparticles, which are encapsulated within a conductive reduced graphene oxide network (NVPF@C/rGO), serving as an advanced cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. The resulting structure features 50 nm nanoparticles encased in a carbon layer and intertwined with reduced graphene sheets, leading to improved electronic conductivity and better accommodation of volume changes during cycling. When used as a cathode in sodium-ion half-cells, the NVPF@C/rGO nanocomposite demonstrated an impressive reversible capacity of 130 mAh.g^−1 at a 0.5 C rate, along with exceptional cycling stability, maintaining 99% of its capacity after 500 cycles, and retaining a capacity of 115 mAh.g^−1 even at a high rate of 10 C. Detailed characterizations indicated that the graphene encapsulation not only supports efficient electron transport but also ensures reversible sodium storage by maintaining structural integrity. Moreover, the outstanding energy storage performance of the Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3@C/rGO cathode material in full sodium-ion cell tests underscores its potential for practical applications.",

The biphasic intergrowth structure of layered cathode materials is essential for improving the sodium storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two phases. However, the in-depth formation mechanism of biphasic intergrowth materials remains unclear. Herein, the layered/tunnel intergrowth Na0.6MnO2 (LT-NaMO) as a model material was successfully prepared, and their formation processes and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated. In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction displays the detailed evolution process and excellent thermal stability of the layered/tunnel intergrowth structure. Furthermore, severe structural strain and large lattice volume changes are significantly mitigated by the interlocking effect between the phase interfaces, which further enhances the structural stability of the cathode materials during the charging/discharging process. Consequently, the LT-NaMO cathode displays fast Na+ transport kinetics with a remarkable capacity retention of ∼70.5% over 300 cycles at 5C, and its assembled full cell with hard carbon also exhibits high energy density. These findings highlight the superior electrochemical performance of intergrowth materials due to interlocking effects between layered and tunnel structures and also provide unique insights into the construction of intergrowth cathode materials for SIBs.",

To address these issues, a new strategy is deployed through introducing Fe vacancies and Cu‐dopant into the PBAs frame structure, boosting the specific capacity and improving the cycling stability. On the one hand, the introduction of Fe vacancies in PBA (PBA□Fe) can provide additional storage sites and facilitate Na+ diffusion kinetics, yielding a high capacity of ≈164 mAh g−1 at a low current density which approaches the theoretical capacity. On the other hand, the Cu‐dopant is further helpful in stabilizing the structure of PBA□Fe, thus improving the cycling stability.

The feasible commercialization of sodium-ion batteries relies on the design and exploitation of suitable electrode materials. This study offers a new insight into material design to exploit high-performance P2-type cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The incorporation of Mg2+ into intrinsic Na+ vacancies in Na-ion layers can lead to a high-performance P2-type cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. The materials prepared by the coprecipitation approach show a well-defined morphology of secondary football-like hierarchical structures. Neutron power diffraction and refinement results demonstrate that the incorporation of Mg2+ into intrinsic vacancies can enlarge the space for Na-ion diffusion, which can increase the d-spacing of the (0 0 2) peak and the size of slabs but reduce the chemical bond length to result in an enhanced rate capability and cycling stability.

However, they face challenges such as rapid capacity loss and poor cycling stability, mainly attributed to irreversible phase transitions. To address these challenges, a novel cathode material, Li/Sn co-substituted O3-Na0.95Li0.07Sn0.01Ni0.22Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 (LSNFM), has been designed by regulating the electronic structure, in which Li+ activates more redox reactions of Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ above 2.5 V and suppresses the redox reactivity of Mn3+/4+ below 2.5 V, while Sn4+ can prevent the charge delocalization in the transition metal layer, contributing to structural stability. Due to this synergistic effect, the as-prepared LSNFM electrode with high structural reversibility displays a 27.2% capacity increase contributed by the high-voltage transition metal ion redox activity and exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability, an 84.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C and an 84.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C. The fundamental mechanism is fully investigated using systematic in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and density functional theory computations.

With the calculated volume change and the electrode–electrolyte interface after cycling, it can be concluded that the Na2VP phase reduces the lattice mismatch between Na3VP and NaV2(PO4)3 (NaVP), preventing structural collapse. Based on the density functional theory calculation (DFT), the Na+ ion migrates more rapidly in the Na2VP structure, which facilitates the desodiation and sodiation processes. The formation of Na2VP phase lowers the formation energy of NaVP. This study demonstrates the dynamic evolution of the Na3VP structure, paving the way for an in‐depth understanding of electrode materials for energy‐storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Na-based layered transition metal oxides with an O3-type structure are considered as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, wide two-dimensional ion channels and high theoretical specific capacity. However, during storage, exposure to moisture and carbon dioxide in the air results in the formation of increased residual sodium compounds. This degradation exacerbates side reactions with the electrolyte and induces structural collapse, ultimately impairing their electrochemical performance. In this study, two titanium sources (e.g., itanium dioxide nanopowders and tetrabutyl titanate ethanol solution) were applied separately to develop two kinds of Na2Ti3O7 coatings via the reactions between the titanium sources and the residual alkaline species on the O3-Na0.95Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 particle surface. Both two Na2Ti3O7 coatings could effectively enhance the electrolyte wettability and Na+ conductivity of the coated cathodes, along with reducing the dissolution of transition metals during cathode cycling. In particular, the tetrabutyl titanate-derived Na2Ti3O7 coatings (5-8 nm) on O3-Na0.95Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes realized excellent kinetics (101.9 mA h g-1 at 10C) and optimal cycling stability (85.66% retention over 200 cycles at 1C). These findings demonstrate that the ultrathin Na2Ti3O7 coating strategy effectively enhances layered oxide cathode performance through interface engineering, offering a promising approach for developing air-stable cathodes and emerging as a pivotal technology to advance sodium-ion battery applications.",

However, the immature synthetic routes, the tedious preparation process as well as high preparation cost restrict its promotion and application to some extent. In this work, the pure NVPOF was successfully prepared by liquid phase coordination chemistry combined with co-precipitation method based on theoretical speculation. The sodium storage performances are optimized by adjusting the key process parameters such as the pH value of solutions, the catalogue of pH regulators and the solution concentrations. When pH value of the solution is 4.50, oxovanadium sulfate solution concentration lies at c[v] = 1.5 mol L−1, the as-prepared NVPOF outperforms the optimal performances. The NVPOF cathode material synthesized under the optimized conditions boasts a perfect NASICON sodium-storage structure, spherical or quasi spherical morphology. In detail, the specific capacity is 110 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and the discharging voltage is 3.86 V. The first coulombic efficiency is 91.4 %, and the specific capacity decay from 97 mAh g−1 to 87 mAh g−1 with 91.3 % capacity retention after 300 cycles in the half-cell system. This large-scale co-precipitation synthesis of NVOPF will provide new guidance for the development and application of cathode materials for SIBs.",

In this study, we apply cold sintering to a model composite cathode system to study how low-temperature densification enables a degree of control over the mixed conducting properties of such systems. The model system contains the NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) active material, NASICON-structured solid electrolyte (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, NZSP), and electron-conducting carbon nanofiber (CNF). Pellets of varying weight fractions of components were cold-sintered to greater than 90% of the theoretical density at 350-375 °C, a 360 MPa uniaxial pressure, and with a 3 h dwell time using sodium hydroxide as the transient sintering aid. The bulk conductivity of the diphasic composites was measured with impedance spectroscopy; the total conductivities of the composites are increased from 3.8 × 10-8 S·cm-1 (pure NVP) to 5.81 × 10-6 S·cm-1 (60 wt % NZSP) and 1.31 × 10-5 S·cm-1 (5 wt % CNF). Complimentary direct current polarization experiments demonstrate a rational modulation in transference number (τ) of the composites; τ of pure NVP = 0.966, 60 wt % NZSP = 0.995, and 5 wt % CNF = 0.116. Finally, all three materials are combined into triphasic composites to serve as solid-state cathodes in a half-cell configuration with a liquid electrolyte.

However, to compete with mature energy storage technologies such as lithium ion batteries, further progress is needed, particularly regarding the energy density and operational lifetime. Considering these aspects as well as a circular economy perspective, the authors use biodegradable cellulose nanoparticles for the preparation of a gel polymer electrolyte that offers a high liquid electrolyte uptake of 2985%, an ionic conductivity of 2.32 mS cm-1 , and a Na+ transference number of 0.637. A balanced ratio of mechanically rigid cellulose nanocrystals and flexible cellulose nanofibers results in a mesoporous hierarchical structure that ensures close contact with metallic Na. This architecture offers stable Na plating/stripping at current densities up to ±500 µA cm-2 , outperforming conventional fossil-based NIBs containing separator-liquid electrolytes. Paired with an environmentally sustainable and economically attractive Na2 Fe2 (SO4 )3 cathode, the battery reaches an energy density of 240 Wh kg-1 , delivering 69.7 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 1C. In comparison, Celgard in liquid electrolyte delivers only 0.6 mAh g-1 at C/4.

Meanwhile, the O redox chemistry and subsequent structural evolution remain ambiguous so far. Here, we deliberate on the O redox mechanism in Na‐storage transition metal oxides.

Improved Na+ diffusion dynamics are demonstrated through GITT, CV, and EIS analyses. Additionally, in situ X-ray diffraction confirms reduced lattice strain during phase transitions. Full-cell evaluations using a hard carbon anode showcase excellent rate capability and durability, retaining approximately 73.2% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 2C.

However, the low cycle efficiency and poor rate capacity of cathode materials have hindered the commercialization of SIBs, prompting extensive research efforts to address these challenges. Ion doping into the material structure is considered to be an effective, simple, and scalable approach to enhancing the electrical performance of cathode materials. In this work, B and F elemental ions were selectively doped into the structure of sodium-lithium-manganese-cobalt oxide material via the sol–gel method combined with calcination. The effects of B and F ion doping on the properties of the obtained materials exhibited distinct variations, particularly in the electrochemical performance. While the B-doped material (B-NLMC) exhibited a specific capacity of up to 166.5 mAh g–1 at a current density of 10 mA g–1 and maintained 72.1% capacity after 100 cycles, the material simultaneously doped with B and F ions (BF-NLMC) demonstrated lower specific capacity and cycling efficiency compared to B-NLMC. However, the BF-NLMC material exhibited significantly improved rate capability, delivering a specific capacity of up to approximately 80 mAh g–1 at a high current density of 200 mA g–1.

The resulting π‐configurational oxygen occupies an anti‐bonding state just below the Fermi level, exhibiting high oxidation activity and stability. Additionally, the high covalency between Mn and O increases the strength of the Mn–O bond, mitigating the structural aberration of NNMMO.

        "abstract": "The authors manipulate two categories of cathodes for sodium-ion batteries for a rational design that combines high energy density with high power density and long cycling life. Sodium-ion batteries have not only garnered substantial attention for grid-scale energy storage owing to the higher abundance of sodium compared with lithium, but also present the possibility of fast charging because of the inherently higher sodium-ion mobility. However, it remains a phenomenal challenge to achieve a combination of these merits, given the complex structural chemistry of sodium-ion oxide materials. Here we show that O3-type sodium-ion layered cathodes (for example, Na_5/6Li_2/27Ni_8/27Mn_11/27Ti_6/27O_2) have the potential to attain high power density, high energy density (260 Wh kg^−1 at the electrode level) and long cycle life (capacity retention of 80% over 700 cycles in full cells). The design involves introduction of characteristic P3-structural motifs into an O3-type framework that serves to promote sodium-ion diffusivity and address detrimental transition metal migration and phase transition at a high state of charge. This study provides a principle for the rational design of sodium-ion layered oxide electrodes and advances the understanding of the composition–structure–property relationships of oxide cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The peak-loading shift function of sodium-ion batteries in large-grid energy store station poses a giant challenge on the account of poor rate performance of cathodes. NASICON type Na3V2(PO4)3 with a stable three-dimensional framework and fast ion diffusion channels has been regarded as one of the potential candidates and extensively studied. Nevertheless, a multilevel integrated tactic to boost the performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 in terms of crystal structure modulation, coated carbon graphitization regulation, and particle morphology design is rarely reported and deserves much attention. In this study, organic ferric was used to prepare Fe-doped Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode on the account of low cost, environmental friendliness, and catalytic function of Fe on carbon graphitization. The density functional theory calculation depicts that the most stable site for Fe atom is the V site and moderate replacement of Fe at V position would reduce the band gap energy from 2.19 by 0.43 eV and improve the electron transfer, which is crucial for the intrinsic poor conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3. The experimental results show that Fe element can be introduced into the bulk structure successfully, modulating relevant structural parameters. In addition, the coated carbon layer graphitization degree is also regulated due to the catalysis function of Fe. And, the decomposition of organic ferric would infuse the formation of porous structure, which can promote electrolyte permeation and shorten the electron/ion diffusion. Finally, the optimized Na3V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3@C could possess a high capacity of 103.69 mA h g-1 and retain 91.45% after 1200 cycles at 1.0C as well as 94.45 mA h g-1 at 20C. In addition, the excellent performance is comprehensively elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction and pseudocapacitance characterization. The multifunction contribution of Fe-doping may provide new clue for designing porous electrode materials and a new sight into Fe-doped carbon-coated material.",

Here, the NMCP was decorated through structurally integrated with the high conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) component via the sol-gel method. The CNTs additive was tightly implanted NMCP bulk, providing fast electron transfer rates, further reduced charge transfer resistance and ohmic resistance, and improving the electrochemical properties of NMCP during the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Na+. Finally, the as-prepared rambutan-like NMCP/C@CNTs could release a high reversible capability of 118.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and exhibit long durability over 500 cycles at a high rate of 10C. The pseudocapacitance contributions were investigated, and the Na storage mechanism was also demonstrated through in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The assembled NMCP/C@CNTs//HC full cell could deliver a high energy density of 364.4 Wh kg−1. The encouraging electrochemical performance of the full cell will promote the development of sodium ion secondary batteries for large-scale applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale electric energy storage is fundamental to the use of renewable energy. Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g-1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2-O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn) ions remain in their Mn4+ state. Interestingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) results reveal differences in electronic structures in the bulk and at the surface of electrochemically cycled particles. At the surface, transition metal ions (TM ions) are in a lower valence state than in the bulk, and the O K-edge prepeak disappears. On the basis of previous reports on related Li-excess LIB cathodes, it is proposed that part of the charge compensation mechanism during the first cycle takes place at the lattice oxygen site, resulting in a surface to bulk transition metal gradient. We believe that by optimizing and controlling oxygen activity, Na layered oxide materials with higher capacities can be designed.",

However, considering the perspective of environmental conservation, it is imperative to substitute vanadium with elements that are both cost-effective and non-toxic in order to further enhance its application in SIBs. Herein, Fe is utilized to replace the V site in the sodium vanadium phosphate structure and successfully prepared a pure phase sodium-deficient NASICON (sodium superionic conductor) Na3.15VFe0.86(PO4)3 (NVFP-650) cathode. It is found that the regulation of sintering temperature for Na3+ xVFe(PO4)3(NVFP) material can effectively mitigate the formation of secondary phases and enhance the electrochemical properties of the resulting product. The sodium-deficient cathode shows enhanced electrochemical performance and sodium ion diffusion kinetics. It exhibits a high capacity of 102.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, and exhibits a high-capacity retention of 95.7% after 2000 cycles at 20 C. The energy storage mechanism and structural evolution are further investigated through SEM, TEM, XPS, and in situ XRD characterizations.

        "abstract": "An intriguing mechanism for enabling fast Na kinetics during oxygen redox (OR) is proposed to produce high‐power‐density cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) based on the P2‐type oxide models, Na2/3[Mn6/9Ni3/9]O2 (NMNO) and Na2/3[Ti1/9Mn5/9Ni3/9]O2 (NTMNO) using the “potential pillar” effect. The critical structural parameter of NTMNO lowers the Na migration barrier in the desodiated state because the electrostatic repulsion of O(2p)O(2p) that occurs between transition metal layers is combined with the chemically stiff Ti4+(3d)O(2p) bond to locally retain the strong repulsion effect. The NTMNO interlayer distance moderately decreases upon charging with oxygen oxidation, whereas that of NMNO decreases at a much faster rate, which can be explained by the dependence of OR activity on the coordination environment. Fundamental electrochemical experiments clearly indicate that the Ti doping of the bare material significantly improves its rate capability during OR, and detailed electrochemical and structural analyses show much faster Na kinetics for NTMNO than for NMNO. A systematic comparison of the two cathode oxides based on experiments and first‐principles calculations establishes the “potential pillar” concept of not only improving the sluggish Na kinetics upon OR reaction but also harnessing the full potential of the anionic redox for high‐power‐density SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition‐metal (TM) oxides are ideal hosts for Li+ charge carriers largely due to the occurrence of oxygen charge compensation that stabilizes the layered structure at high voltage. Hence, enabling charge compensation in sodium layered oxides is a fascinating task for extending the cycle life of sodium‐ion batteries. Herein a Ti/Mg co‐doping strategy for a model P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode material is put forward to activate charge compensation through highly hybridized O2pTM3d covalent bonds. In this way, the interlayer OO electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2–O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid‐solution‐type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample. This study starts a perspective way of optimizing the sodium layered cathodes by rational structural design coupling electrochemical reactions, which can be extended to widespread battery researches.",

However, issues such as easy electrolyte solubility and low intrinsic conductivity contribute to high polarization and rapid capacity decay. Herein, we have designed a flexible self‐supporting cathode based on perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), interfacial engineering enhanced by polypyrrole (PPy), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), forming the interconnected and flexible PTCDA/PPy/CNTs using polymerization reaction and vacuum filtration methods, effectively curbing those challenges. When used as the cathode of sodium‐ion batteries, PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit excellent rate capability (105.7 mAh g−1 at 20 C), outstanding cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention at 5 C after 500 cycles), and remarkable wide temperature application capability (86.5 mAh g−1 at −30°C and 115.4 mAh g−1 at 60°C). The sodium storage mechanism was verified to be a reversible oxidation reaction between two Na+ ions and carbonyl groups by density functional theory calculations, in situ infrared Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the pouch cells based on PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit good mechanical flexibility in various mechanical states. This work inspires more rational designs of flexible and self‐supporting organic cathodes, promoting the development of high‐performance and wide‐temperature adaptable wearable electronic devices.",

Importantly, we identify a hierarchical thermal transport mechanism in NaVO3 and the significant contribution of diffusive thermal transport. With the combined two channels, we reveal that NaVO3 has the anisotropic and ultralow thermal conductivity κ, which is derived from the bonding heterogeneity with the coexistence of strong V-O bonds and weak Na-O bonds, implying the possibility of engineering the κ of SIBs by spatially tuning the sodium concentration distribution. Our work establishes a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic thermal transport of NaVO3 and provides guidance toward designing tunable thermal conductivity cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the effect of equimolar substitution of manganese by cobalt or nickel in hexacyanoferrate (HCF) open frameworks as electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. As the stability of Mn-N bonds is crucial to obtain long term stability and cyclability of manganese (Mn-HCF), the samples were analyzed thoroughly using several spectroscopic and structural methods. The XPS and infrared experiments reveal that the charge density around Fe is modulated by the presence of Co or Ni, which is associated with their high polarizing power, leading to decreased cell distortion as revealed by XRD. The Rietveld refinement demonstrated that the octahedra built by 3d metals and the cyanide nitrogen were distorted with the axial bond distances being larger than the equatorial distances. This octahedral distortion promotes the spin behavior of 3/2 for Mn2+ confirmed by magnetic experiments; the arising of this spin state is attributed to d orbital splitting determined by UV-Vis experiments. Therefore, the changes upon Mn substitution are related to the modification of the covalent character of Mn-N bonds, modulated by the effect of the Ni and Co polarizing power. All these properties improve the electrochemical stability of the Ni or Co substituted materials as Na-ion batteries, leading to higher capacity retention even at higher C-rates (5C) and good capacity recovery, in comparison with those obtained for Mn-HCF.",

        "abstract": "The currently prevailing single complexing agent-dominated sol-gel technologies for Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) always result in limited modification effects, especially in regards to the particle size of NVP and the quality of carbon coatings. Herein, we report a citric acid and glycine co-complexed strategy for fabricating carbon-coated NVP. It creates a favorable synergy for optimizing the microstructure and electrochemical performance of the NVP cathode. The introduction of glycine in citric acid not only decreases the solution viscosity for facilitated metal-ion diffusion, but also induces the self-construction of a 3D network through heteromolecular hydrogen bonds. The optimized carbon-coated NVP by co-complexing of citric acid and glycine (named as NVP/CG-5.0) presents distinctly decreased particle size, improved dispersity and moderate carbon coating thickness of ∼2 nm. It also features a large specific surface area of 44.4 m2 g−1 with rich mesopores. Impressively, the NVP/CG-5.0 electrode exhibits substantially improved electrochemical performance, such as the elevated specific capacity of 108.3 mAh g−1 with high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.2%), high capacity retention of 81.3% after 2000 cycles at 2 C and excellent rate performance (88.2 mAh g−1 at 20.0 C). Furthermore, the assembled NVP/CG-5.0║hard carbon full battery also exhibits superior electrochemical performance, suggesting the great potential of the co-complexed strategy for developing high-performance NVP cathodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries with cost-effectiveness and structural stability. However, its electrochemical behaviors are seriously hindered by its [P2O7] distortion at high voltage. To address this challenge, we introduce a distortion criterion and optimize the local crystal field environment by incorporating Cr3+ into Fe3 sites adjacent to [P2O7]. This substitution elongates Fe1-O bonds, enhances Fe1 activity, and suppresses [P2O7] distortion, facilitating fast Na+ diffusion and structural reversibility, as validated by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on c-axis changes during high-voltage operation, a quantitative method for assessing [P2O7] distortion is proposed and confirmed by operando X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimized NFPP-0.15Cr exhibits exceptional rate performance (91.74 mAh g-1 at 50C), long-term cycling stability (88.81% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 50C), and wide temperature tolerance (-40 to 60 °C). This study provides a strategic approach for designing high-performance iron-based mixed phosphate cathodes, advancing their practical application in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The inclusion of nickel and manganese in layered sodium metal oxide cathodes for sodium ion batteries is known to improve stability, but the redox behaviour at high voltage is poorly understood. Here in situ X-ray spectroscopy studies show that the redox behaviour of oxygen anions can account for an increase in specific capacity at high voltages. Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries have recently attracted renewed interest as an alternative to Li-ion batteries for electric energy storage applications, because of the low cost and wide availability of sodium resources. Thus, the electrochemical energy storage community has been devoting increased attention to designing new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Here we investigate P2- Na_0.78Co_1/2Mn_1/3Ni_1/6O_2 as a cathode material for sodium ion batteries. The main focus is to understand the mechanism of the electrochemical performance of this material, especially differences observed in redox reactions at high potentials. Between 4.2 V and 4.5 V, the material delivers a reversible capacity which is studied in detail using advanced analytical techniques. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals the reversibility of the P2-type structure of the material. Combined soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering demonstrates that Na deintercalation at high voltages is charge compensated by formation of localized electron holes on oxygen atoms.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) based on the multielectron reactions between V2+ and V5+ has been considered a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it still suffers from unsatisfactory stability, caused by the poor reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and structure evolution. Herein, we propos a strategy that combines high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization to boost the reversible multielectron reactions of NVP. The high reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and crystalline structure evolution are disclosed by in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the electrochemical reaction kinetics of high-entropy substitution NVP (HE-NVP) can be further improved in the diglyme-based electrolyte. These enable HE-NVP to deliver a superior electrochemical performance (capacity retention of 93.1% after 2000 cycles; a large reversible capacity of 120 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1). Besides, the long cycle life and high power density of the HE-NVP∥natural graphite full-cell configuration demonstrated the superiority of HE-NVP cathode in SIBs. This work highlights that the synergism of high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization is a powerful strategy to enhance the sodium-storage performance of polyanionic cathodes for SIBs.",

It is also found that a light change on the local electronic and structural states or phase change could be observed after the first cycle, resulting in the fast capacity fade at room temperature. We also showed that the irreversibility of the phase changes could be largely suppressed at low temperature, thus leading to a much improved electrochemical performance.",

This work reports the facile surface coating of Na_2Mn_3O_7 cathode material by electrochemically inert Al_2O_3 of different mass ratio for sodium ion batteries. The electrochemical test results indicate that the 5 wt% Na_2Mn_3O_7@Al_2O_3 material exhibits outstanding cyclic stability and rate capability.

A discharge-specific capacity of 52.7 mAh g^−1 is also obtained at a high current density of 4C, and most notably, a high discharge-specific capacity of 117.9 mAh g^−1 is still maintained when the current density returns to 0.1C.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of the most promising energy storage systems but still cannot replace the status of lithium-ion batteries. One challenge of commercialization of sodium-ion batteries is their cathode material. Inspired by layered LiTMO2 (TM = transition metal) as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, layered Nax\n                     TMO2 materials are investigated as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Although layered Nax\n                     TMO2 materials show high theoretical capacities and operating voltage windows, their cycling stability and rate capability still need to be improved. The electrochemical behavior of layered Nax\n                     TMO2 materials is correlated to the extraction and insertion of Na atoms during charge and discharge accompanied by structural changes, respectively. Understanding these structural changes during cycling of layered Nax\n                     TMO2 materials may initiate strategies to improve their electrochemical performance. Thus, the correlation between composition, structure and synthesis of layered Nax\n                     TMO2 materials is discussed in the present paper. Besides, the structural changes during cycling of layered Nax\n                     TMO2 materials are summarized according to their crystal structure accompanied by varied stacking of TMO2 and NaO2 layers.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are seen as an emerging force for future large-scale energy storage due to their cost-effective nature and high safety. Compared with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the energy density of SIBs is insufficient at present. Thus, the development of high-energy SIBs for realizing large-scale energy storage is extremely vital. The key factor determining the energy density in SIBs is the selection of cathodic materials, and the mainstream cathodic materials nowadays include transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds, and Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). The cathodic materials would greatly improve after targeted modulations that eliminate their shortcomings and step from the laboratory to practical applications. Before that, some remaining challenges in the application of cathode materials for large-scale energy storage SIBs need to be addressed, which are summarized at the end of this Outlook.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium-based Na superionic conductor (NASICON) type materials (NaxVM(PO4)3, M = transition metals) have attracted extensive attention when used as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) cathodes due to their stable structures and large Na+ diffusion channels. However, the materials have poor electrical conductivity and mediocre energy density, which hinder their practical applications. Activating the V4+/V5+ redox couple (V4+/V5+≈4.1 V vs Na+/Na) is an effective way to elevate the energy density of SIBs, whereas the irreversible phase transition of V4+/V5+ and severe structural distortion will inevitably result in fast capacity fading and unsatisfactory rate capability. Herein, a high entropy regulation strategy is proposed to optimize the detailed crystal structure and improve the reversibility of crystalline phase transformation and electrical conductivity of the material. With the activated reversible V4+/V5+ redox couple, stable structure, and fast electrochemical kinetics, the high entropy material Na3.2V1.5Fe0.1Al0.1Cr0.1Mn0.1Cu0.1(PO4)3 (NVMP-HE) exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance with highly reversible specific capacity of 120.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and excellent cycling stability (92.4% retention after 1000 cycles at 20 C). Besides, the in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement reveals that a smooth three-phase transition reaction is involved in this high-entropy cathode and the existence of mesophase facilitates a fast phase transition.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) super-ionic conductor structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) cathodes have garnered interest owing to their cost-effectiveness and high operating voltages. However, the voltage hysteresis phenomenon triggered by Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ anti-site defects ( Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ -ASD), namely, the occupation of Mn2+ in the Na2 vacancies in NMTP, leads to sluggish diffusion kinetics and low energy efficiency. This study employs an innovative electronic confinement-restrained strategy to achieve the regulation of Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ -ASD. Partial replacement of titanium (Ti) with electron-rich vanadium (V) favors strong electronic interactions with Mn2+, restraining Mn2+ migration.

As proof of this concept, an Na-rich Na3.5MnTi0.5V0.5(PO4)3 (NMTVP) material is designed, wherein the electronic interaction enhanced the redox activity and achieved more Na+ storage under high-voltage. The NMTVP cathode delivered a reversible specific capacity of up to 182.7 mAh g-1 and output an excellent specific energy of 513.8 Wh kg-1, corresponding to ≈3.2 electron transfer processes, wherein the energy efficiency increased by 35.5% at 30 C.

However, unsatisfying cyclic stability hinders its practical application, mainly resulting from harmful phase transition and irreversible oxygen redox, especially in high‐voltage regions.

Both suppressing the undesired phase transition over 4.1 V (vs Na/Na+) and reducing the anisotropic strain are achieved with the novel Na0.8Ni0.3Fe0.2Mn0.3Li0.1Mg0.02Ca0.05Sb0.03O2 (LMCS NFM). Moreover, restricted but highly reversible oxygen redox is observed due to strong attraction from Sb5+ and special “Li–O‐vacancy” and “Mg–O‐vacancy” configurations. The strategy brings about excellent high‐voltage cyclic stability with a reversible capacity of 130 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention of 85% after 250 cycles at 4.2 V, and less thermal runaway risk and moisture sensitivity, increasing the probability of O3‐type oxide cathode practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Vanadates are one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium ion batteries because of their multiple valences and high theoretical capacities. However, the low output voltage/practical capacity and less stable layered structure remain bottlenecks that limit their further development. Introducing electron-withdrawing groups such as redox-inactive PO4\n                     3− into vanadates is an effective strategy to improve working voltage but at the cost of decreasing theoretical capacity. In this work, we synthesized an oxygen-deficient Na+-preintercated vanadate formulated as Na0.49V2O5 (O-NaVO). The abundant oxygen vacancies in O-NaVO can act as electron-deficient groups with inductive effect due to the absence of lattice oxygen (O2−) with negative charges, which can raise the Fermi energy, enhance the d-p orbital coupling and facilitate the electron transfer from V 3d to O 2p. Electrochemical redox reactions generally involve the electron depletion/injection at the Fermi level in an applied electric field. Consequently, O-NaVO shows rich redox peaks in the higher voltage (2.5–3.5 V) with an unprecedented capacity (300 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability. That is also associated with the improved electron conductivity and the in situ formed thinner cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) induced by the richer oxygen defects in O-NaVO.",

Ether-based electrolytes are considered one of the most promising electrolyte systems for SIBs due to the advantages of high reduction stability and weakly desolvating power. However, conventional ether-based electrolytes are easy to decompose and deteriorate on the cathode/electrolyte interface under high voltage, which greatly restricts their practical application in SIBs. Herein, a novel and effective interfacial stabilization strategy is proposed and systemically investigated. A homogeneous and compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film rich in fluorides and borides can be successfully constructed on the cathode surface by pre-cycling of NVP@C cathode in the NaODFB-DEGDME electrolyte. The ODFB anion-derived CEI film can effectively inhibit the continuous oxidation decomposition of NaPF6-DEGDME electrolytes. As a result, the Na||NVP@C half-cell can stably cycle for 1500 cycles with high average Coulombic efficiency (CE, >99.7 %) at 5C. This work illustrates the significance of the composition and structure of CEI film for improving the interfacial stability of high-voltage SIBs with ether-based electrolytes.",

In this study, a series of NaxNi0.25Mn0.75O2 (x = 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80) cathode materials are prepared by the solid-phase method based on an orthogonal experiment. The optimum preparation process is investigated by optimizing factors such as Na content, calcination temperature, calcination time, and heating rate. The Nae/Naf ratio is adjusted, and the Na+ at different sites are rearranged to reduce the Na+/vacancy ordering by changing the Na content on the basis of process optimization. Owing to the fast migration kinetics of Nae sites, experimental results indicate that the P2-Na0.75Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode material, which has Na+ occupying more thermodynamically stable Nae sites, demonstrates superior battery performance. High initial discharge specific capacity (157.2 mAh g-1) along with favorable cycle performance of the Na0.75Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode material can be achieved by modifying the Nae site occupancy and optimizing the experimental conditions.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gaining global attention as next-generation energy storage systems. Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7 (NFPP) is promising due to its low cost, structural stability, non-toxicity, and moderate theoretical capacity. However, most existing synthesis methods rely on iron nitrate as a sole iron source, which not only generates nitrogen oxides, leading to air pollution, Excessive crystal water in the material further decreases its utilization efficiency. Developing low-cost electrode materials and efficient synthesis processes is crucial for advancing the commercialization of SIBs. This study introduces a green and efficient synthesis method using a dual iron source system—iron phosphate and ferrous oxalate. During high-temperature decomposition under an inert atmosphere, ferrous oxalate produces carbon monoxide that further reduces iron phosphate. The NFPP-C material demonstrates excellent rate and cycling performance, with impressive thermal stability at 60°C. Notably, pouch cells with NFPP-C cathodes and hard carbon anodes exhibit exceptional wide temperature operation and rate performance, maintaining 80.04% capacity at −40°C and 82.69% capacity after 3500 cycles, corresponding to a negligible decay of 0.00495 % per cycle.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is a representative cathode material of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high working voltage and high structural stability. However, its specific capacity is limited to the reversible inserting and extracting of two sodium ions per formula unit, which hampers the improvement of its energy density. In this study, we propose a new NASICON-type Na4MnCr(PO4)2F3 (NMCPF) cathode and systematically investigate its key properties using first-principles calculations. NMCPF exhibits the ability to extract/insert three sodium ions per formula unit, resulting in a high specific capacity of 180.34 mAh/g, and demonstrates three-electron redox reactions involving three redox couples of Mn2+/3+ (3.05 V), Mn3+/4+ (4.11 V), and Cr3+/4+ (4.64 V). Consequently, its energy density can reach 709.33 Wh/kg. In addition, NMCPF exhibits a small volume change of 8.2% during the charging/discharging process and sodium ion diffusion properties comparable to those of NVPF. This study demonstrates the potential of NMCPF as a promising cathode material with high energy density for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Based on the favorable ionic conductivity and structural stability, sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) materials especially utilizing multivalent redox reaction of vanadium are one of the most promising cathodes in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). To further boost their application in large‐scale energy storage production, a rational strategy is to tailor vanadium with earth‐abundant and cheap elements (such as Fe, Mn), reducing the cost and toxicity of vanadium‐based NASICON materials. Here, the Na3.05V1.03Fe0.97(PO4)3 (NVFP) is synthesized with highly conductive Ketjen Black (KB) by ball‐milling assisted sol‐gel method. The pearl‐like KB branch chains encircle the NVFP (p‐NVFP), the segregated particles possess promoted overall conductivity, balanced charge, and modulated crystal structure during electrochemical progress. The p‐NVFP obtains significantly enhanced ion diffusion ability and low volume change (2.99%). Meanwhile, it delivers a durable cycling performance (87.7% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 5 C) in half cells. Surprisingly, the full cells of p‐NVFP reveal a remarkable capability of 84.9 mAh g−1 at 20 C with good cycling performance (capacity decay rate is 0.016% per cycle at 2 C). The structure modulation of the p‐NVFP provides a rational design on the superiority of others to be put into practice.",

        "abstract": "The P2/O3 biphasic layered oxide (NaxMn1-yMyO2, M: doping elements) is a cathode family with great promise for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their tunable electrochemical performance and low cost. However, the ultrahigh initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and inferior cycling performance of P2/O3-NaxMn1-yMyO2 need to be improved for practical application. Herein, Ni/Cu co-doped P2/O3-Na0.75Mn1-yNiy-zCuzO2 materials are well-designed. The ultrahigh ICE can be restrained by altering the ratio of P2/O3 via adjusting Ni content, and the structural stability can be improved by Cu doping via enlarging parameter c of O3 phase and suppressing irreversible P2-O2 phase transformation. The optimal P2/O3-Na0.75Mn0.6Ni0.3Cu0.1O2 delivers a capacity of 142.4 with ICE of 107.8%, superior capacity retention in the temperature range of −40 ∼ 30 °C, and rate performance of 95.9 mAh g−1 at 1.2 A g−1. The overall storage mechanism of P2/O3-Na0.75Mn0.6Ni0.3Cu0.1O2 is revealed by the combination of electrochemical profiles, in situ X-ray diffraction, and first-principles calculations. The Na-ion full battery based on P2/O3-Na0.75Mn0.6Ni0.3Cu0.1O2 cathode can achieve a remarkable energy density of 306.9 Wh kg−1 with a power density of 695.5 W kg−1 at 200 mA g−1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting increasing attention and considered to be a low-cost complement or an alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), especially for large-scale energy storage. Their application, however, is limited because of the lack of suitable host materials to reversibly intercalate Na+ ions. Layered transition metal oxides (Nax MO2 , M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cr, Ti, V, and their combinations) appear to be promising cathode candidates for SIBs due to their simple structure, ease of synthesis, high operating potential, and feasibility for commercial production. In the present work, the structural evolution, electrochemical performance, and recent progress of Nax MO2 as cathode materials for SIBs are reviewed and summarized. Moreover, the existing drawbacks are discussed and several strategies are proposed to help alleviate these issues. In addition, the exploration of full cells based on Nax MO2 cathodes and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the future commercialization of such systems.",

        "abstract": "P2 layered oxides have attracted more and more attention as cathode materials of high-power sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). During the charging process, the release of sodium ions leads to layer slip, which leads to the transformation of P2 phase into O2 phase, resulting in a sharp decline in capacity. However, many cathode materials do not undergo P2 -O2 transition during charging and discharging, but form a \"Z\" phase. It is proved that the iron-containing compound Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 formed the \"Z\" phase of the symbiotic structure of the P phase and O phase during high-voltage charging through ex-XRD and HAADF-STEM. During the charging process, the cathode material undergoes a structural change of P2 -OP4 -O2 . With the increase of charging voltage, the O-type superposition mode increases to form an ordered OP4 phase, and the P2 -type superposition mode disappears after further charging to form a pure O2 phase. 57 Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that no migration of Fe ions is detected. The O-Ni-O-Mn-Fe-O bond formed in the transition metal MO6 (M = Ni, Mn, Fe) octahedron can inhibit the elongation of the Mn-O bond and improve the electrochemical activity so that P2-Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 has an excellent capacity of 172.4 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency close to 99% at 0.1C.",

        "abstract": "P2-type sodium nickel manganese oxide-based cathode materials with higher energy densities are prime candidates for applications in rechargeable sodium ion batteries. A systematic study combining in situ high energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), ex situ X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) techniques was carried out to gain a deep insight into the structural evolution of P2-Na0.66Ni0.33-xZnxMn0.67O2 (x = 0, 0.07) during cycling. In situ HEXRD and ex situ TEM measurements indicate that an irreversible phase transition occurs upon sodium insertion-extraction of Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Zinc doping of this system results in a high structural reversibility. XAFS measurements indicate that both materials are almost completely dependent on the Ni(4+)/Ni(3+)/Ni(2+) redox couple to provide charge/discharge capacity. SS-NMR measurements indicate that both reversible and irreversible migration of transition metal ions into the sodium layer occurs in the material at the fully charged state. The irreversible migration of transition metal ions triggers a structural distortion, leading to the observed capacity and voltage fading. Our results allow a new understanding of the importance of improving the stability of transition metal layers.",

Thus, an electrolyte that can address the present limitations and further facilitate the fabrication of highly reversible OSIBs must be developed. To address this gap in the literature, in this study, we demonstrate an acetonitrile (AN)-based highly concentrated electrolyte (HCE) with sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI). This electrolyte has an ionic conductivity of 12.1 mS cm-1, which is higher than those of previously reported HCEs. Moreover, the developed HCE (NaFSI:AN molar ratio of 1:2.7) exhibits a high Na+ transference number of 0.49. A full-cell OSIB bearing this electrolyte demonstrates high-power operation with improved capacity retention. The solvent-free electrolyte with the solvation structure of the [2Na+-FSI-] aggregate suppresses the dissolution of organic molecules, leading to their high performance.",

Graphene aerogel-based composite materials with lightweight, high surface area and 3-dimensional (3D) porous structure are prepared, and the properties are tried to be improved further. In this study, carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP/C) and graphene aerogel-carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (GA-NVP/C) composite have been synthesized. The produced samples have been analyzed using Field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum, Thermal Gravity Analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Transmission electron microscopy. Then, the effect of graphene aerogel additive on electrochemical performances as cathode materials has been investigated. Even though GA-NVP/C and NVP/C have similar discharge capacities in the first cycle, GA-NVP/C shows high cycle stability when compared to NVP/C after 250 cycles. The GA-NVP/C cathode also has a higher discharge capacity than the NVP/C cathode at different current rates. The diffusion coefficient calculated using the cyclic voltammetry curve of GA-NVP/C is also high, supporting the graphene aerogel's positive results. In conclusion, we show that adding GA with a 3-dimensional porous structure greatly improves the electrochemical properties of the cathode in Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) emerges as a promising cathode material with high-performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, its development has been limited by several challenges, including poor electronic conductivity, the Mn3+ Jahn-Teller effect, and the presence of a Na+/Mn2+ cation mixture. To address these issues, we have developed a cation/anion-dual regulation strategy to activate the redox reactions involving manganese, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of NMTP. This strategy simultaneously enhances the structural dynamics and facilitates rapid ion transport at high rates by inducing the formation of sodium vacancy. The combined effects of these modifications lead to a substantial improvement in specific capacity (79.1 mAh/g), outstanding high-rate capabilities (35.9 mAh/g at 10C), and an ultralong cycle life (only 0.040 % capacity attenuation per cycle over 250 cycles at 1C for Na3.34Mn1.2Ti0.8(PO3.98F0.02)3) when used as a cathode material in SIBs. Furthermore, its performance in full cell demonstrates impressive rate capability (44.4 mAh/g at 5C) and exceptional cycling stability (with only 0.116 % capacity decay per cycle after 150 cycles at 1C), suggesting its potential for practical applications.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lithium‐based batteries, driven by an ever‐growing demand for electricity storage systems. The present workproposes a cobalt‐free high‐capacity cathode for sodium‐ion batteries, synthesized using a high‐entropy approach. The high‐entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long‐term cycling. Supplement to this, lithium is introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and sodium vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g−1 (2–4 V) and 144 mAh g−1 (2–4.3 V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high‐entropy strategy successfully suppresses the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high‐entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries.",

Nuclear magnetic resonance and in-situ X-ray diffraction reveal that [Mg 1/7 Mn 5/14 ] superlattice units are beneficial to the structure and anion redox reversibility , where Li + reversibly shuttles between Na layers and transition-metal slabs in contrast to the absence of [Mg 1/7 Mn 5/14 ] units. Our findings underline the importance of multifunctional units and provide a path to advanced battery materials.",

        "abstract": "With the development of sodium ion battery which is considered as the alternative of lithium ion battery, better performance is required. However, its poor structure stability and rate capability due to the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ and poor charge transfer between transition metal and oxygen-ion limit its application. Here, Sm-doped P2-type layered oxide Na0.67Li0.1Mn0.62Fe0.18Cu0.09Sm0.01O2 with spherical secondary hierarchy was obtained through microwave-assisted method. Pure P2-shaped layered oxide is obtained. And the tiny shift of the diffraction spectrum indicates the effect of doping. The electrochemical performance of the doped oxide improves obviously. Even at a high current density of 1.0A g−1, the capacity is still as high as 60.3 mAh g−1, much higher than that of undoped one. The cycle stability is also improved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) are taken to further study the mechanism. It reveals that the doped samarium not only serves as the pillar to stable the structure of the layered oxide, but also makes faster charge transfer between transition metal ions and oxide ions due to the Multielectron structure of samarium. Thus, such Sm-doping strategy may offer a solution toward the application bottleneck of layered oxides for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on significantly enhancing sodium-ion battery cathode materials' cycling stability and rate performance. Addressing the structural instability and capacity fade issues of sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) due to Jahn-Teller distortion during charge-discharge cycles, an innovatively refined co-precipitation strategy was employed to precisely construct a sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) shell with excellent low strain characteristics on the core and periphery of MnHCF. This approach successfully built a unique FeHCF@MnHCF@FeHCF three-layered core-shell structured Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The FeHCF@MnHCF@FeHCF composite material demonstrated extraordinary performance in electrochemical tests: it achieved a high reversible capacity of 140.2 mAh g−1 at a low current density of 10 mA g−1; even at a high current density of 500 mA g−1, it maintained a stable specific capacity of 99.8 mAh g−1, showing excellent rate response capability. Particularly noteworthy is that after 500 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1, its capacity retention rate was as high as 81.8 %, highlighting its outstanding cycling stability. In this design strategy, the inner and outer FeHCF shells work in synergy to effectively suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of the MnHCF core. In contrast, the outer FeHCF shell acts as a robust barrier, significantly reducing the leaching of manganese ions, and thereby strengthening the overall structural stability and durability. This study not only paves a new way to design high-performance sodium-ion battery cathode materials but also provides a solid theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the further development of energy storage technology.",

In response to these issues, we have designed an oxide with co-doping of Cu and Al which can balance both cost and structural stability. The redox reaction of Cu2+/3+ can provide certain charge compensation, and the introduction of Al can further suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn, thereby achieving superior long-term cycling performance. The ex-situ XRD testing indicates that Cu/Al co-doping can effectively suppress the phase transition of P2-O2 at high voltage, thereby explaining the improvement in electrochemical performance. DFT calculations reveal a high chemical tolerance to moisture, with lower adsorption energy for H2O compared to pure Na0.67Cu0.25Mn0.75O2. A representative Na0.67Cu0.20Al0.05Mn0.75O2 cathode demonstrates impressive reversible capacities of 148.7 mAh/g at 0.2 C, along with a remarkable capacity retention of 79.1% (2 C, 500 cycles).",

However, the crystal water and vacancy in the Fe-PB structure will lead to poor capacity and cycle stability. In this work, a Cu-modified Fe-PB composite (FeCu-PB@CuO) is successfully prepared through regulating the Fe-PB structure by Cu doping and engineering the surface by CuO coating. The density functional theory calculation results confirm that Cu preferentially replaces FeHS in the Fe-PB lattice and Cu doping reduces the bandgap. Our experiment results reveal that CuO coating can provide more active sites, inhibit side reactions, and potentially enhance the activity of FeHS. Due to the synergistic effect of Cu doping and CuO coating, FeCu-PB@CuO has a considerable initial discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. In particular, at 2 A g-1, it delivers an impressive initial capacity of 84.3 mAh g-1, and the capacity decreasing rate of each cycle is only 0.02% over 1500 cycles. Therefore, the synergistic modification strategy of metal ion doping and metal oxide coating has tremendous application potential and can be extended to other electrode materials.",

Moreover, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 exhibits an excellent cycling stability, retaining 91% of the initial capacity after 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C rate. On the basis of structural analysis and density functional theory calculations, we have proposed a detailed desodiation pathway from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 where Mn and Zr are disordered within the structure.

The SnO2 coating layer endows the NLMO structure with stable ion transport interface to facilitate sodium-ion transfer and an isolated shielding layer to inhibit oxygen loss, thus contributing to stable cycling performance and high capacity even at a high rate. This surface-coating strategy is expected to be applicable to other layered metal oxides as cathode materials to achieve good cycling stability and high-rate capacity.

However, the Jahn-Teller effect caused by Mn3+ in the material results in poor capacity and cycling stability. The purpose of this experimental study is to partially replace Mn3+ with Fe3+, in order to reduce the Jahn-Teller effect of the material during charging and discharging process. The results of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the content of Mn3+ decreased after Fe3+ doping. Electrochemical studies show that the Na0.44Mn0.994Fe0.006O2 cathode has better rate performance (exhibits a reversible capacity of 87.9 mAh/g at 2 C) and cycle stability in sodium-ion batteries. The diffusion coefficient of sodium ions increases by Fe3+ doping. The excellent rate performance and capacity improvement are verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. After doping, the band gap decreases significantly, and the results show that the state density of O 2p increases near the Fermi level, which promotes the oxidation–reduction of oxygen. This work provides a straightforward approach to enhance the performance of Na0.44MnO2 nanorods, and this performance improvement has guiding significance for the design of other materials in the energy storage domain.",

The structural variations during (de)intercalation are closely correlated with stable cycleability. To determine the rational range of the anion-based redox reaction, the structural origins of Na1-xRu0.5O1.5 (0≤x≤1.0) were deduced from its vacancy(□)/Na atomic configurations, which trigger different coulombic interactions between the cations and anions. In the cation-based Ru4+/Ru5+ redox reaction, the □-solubility into fully sodiated Na2RuO3 predominantly depends on the crystallographic 4h-site when 0.0≤x≤0.25, and coulombic repulsion of the linear O2--□-O2- configuration is accompanied by increased volumetric strain. Further Na extraction (0.25≤x≤0.5) induces a compensation effect leading to Na2/3[Na□Ru2/3]O2 with the □-formation of 2b and 2c sites, which drastically reduce the volumetric strain. In the O2-/On- anionic redox region (0.5≤x≤0.75), Na removal at the 4h site generates a repulsive force in O2--□-O2- that increases the interlayer distance. Finally, in the 0.75≤x≤1.0 region, the anionic O charges are unprotected by repulsive forces and their consumption causes severe volumetric strain in Na1-xRu0.5O1.5. Coupling our mechanistic understanding of the structural origin with the □- and Na-site preferences and the coulombic interaction between lattice O and vacancies in Na1-xRu0.5O1.5, we determined the rational range of the anionic redox reaction in layered cathode materials for rechargeable battery research.",

Delivery of high energy density with stable retention remains a challenge in developing cathode candidates for rechargeable SIBs. Inspired by the concept of \"cationic potential\", here, we present a hierarchical crystalline domain in hexagonal particles with target chemical composition (Na0.8Li0.03Mg0.05Ni0.28Fe0.05Mn0.54Ti0.05O2) from the inner bulk O3 phase (71.1 wt %) to the outer P2-type shell (28.9 wt %) of the structure. Benefiting from the mitigated mechanical stress of the predominant bulk O3 phase under the protection of the surficial P2 crystalline domain at the microscale during Na+ (de)intercalation, the brittle fracture, plastic yielding, and structural damage of the bulk O3 phase are effectively prohibited during battery cycling, thereby achieving good structural integrity. As a consequence, the biphasic P2/O3-Na0.8Li0.03Mg0.05Ni0.28Fe0.05Mn0.54Ti0.05O2 material exhibits satisfactory electrochemical properties, with a high energy density of 506 Wh kg-1 and good capacity retention of 85.5% over 200 cycles. This work highlights the importance of tailoring the crystalline domain to mitigate the reaction-induced stress and particle fracture of layered biphasic cathode materials for high-energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the most advanced electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, the increasing demand for LIBs, coupled with problems related to availability and lack of manufacturing centers, has led to lithium market inflation. At this point, sodium‐ion batteries (SIB) represent an economically and environmentally attractive alternative for LIBs. Prussian Blue cathodes (PB) have been extensively studied as cost‐effective materials with volumetric variations that allow the accommodation of sodium ions in the structure. Herein, we present a quasi‐solid Na‐ion cell based on PB cathode and green gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). Nanometric and micrometric PB powders are synthesized and characterized using a wide variety of structural, compositional and electrochemical techniques. The effect of the PB particle size in combination with different electrolytes is investigated. Enhanced cell safety is obtained using a GPE prepared by following a novel green method that avoids using toxic organic solvents. All the tested cells report remarkable electrochemical performance, being the nanometric‐PB/ GPE/ Na cell configuration the one with the highest specific capacity and almost no capacity loss after 100 cycles, outperforming analogous cells assembled with liquid electrolyte. This electrochemical stability is triggered by a robust electrode‐electrolyte interphase.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) super ion conductor (NASICON) structure Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) is considered a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries due to its reversible three-electron reaction. However, the inferior electronic conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics limit its practical applications. Herein, we successfully constructed a three-dimensional cross-linked porous architecture NMTP material (AsN@NMTP/C) by a natural microbe of Aspergillus niger (AsN), and the structure of different NMTP cathodes was optimized by adjusting different transition metal Mn/Ti ratios. Both approaches effectively altered the three-dimensional NMTP structure, not only improving electronic conductivity and controlling Na+ diffusion pathways but also enhancing the electrochemical kinetics of the material. The resultant AsN@NMTP/C-650, sintered at 650 °C, exhibits better electrochemical performance with higher reversible three-electron reactions corresponding to the voltage platforms of Ti4+/3+, Mn3+/2+, and Mn4+/3+ around 2.1, 3.6, and 4.1 V (vs Na+/Na), respectively. The capacity retention rate is up to 89.3% after 1000 cycles at a 2C rate. Moreover, a series of results confirms that the Na3.4Mn1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 cathode has the most excellent electrochemical performance when the Mn/Ti ratio is 1.2/0.8, with a high capacity of 96.59 mAh g-1 and 97.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles.",

However, SIBs operating under elevated temperature aggravate the electrolyte decomposition with unstable cathode‐electrolyte interphase (CEI), causing a rapid capacity degradation. Herein, anion receptor tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) is selected as electrolyte additive to construct robust NaF‐rich CEI. The strong interactions between anion and TPFPB via the electron‐deficient boron atoms weaken ClO4− solvation and promote the coordination capability between solvents and Na+ cations, demonstrating greatly improved oxidative stability. Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in TPFPB‐containing electrolyte delivers long‐term stability with a capacity retention of 86.9% after 100 cycles at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) and a high temperature of 60 °C. Besides, TPFPB also works well with enhanced performance over a temperature range from −30 to 60 °C.

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxide with anion redox activity (SLO‐A) stands out as a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its impressive capacity and high voltage resulting from Mn‐ and O‐redox processes. However, the SLO‐A faces significant challenges in cycling stability and rate performance, primarily due to the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of the O‐redox. In this study,a novel Ti‐doped material, Na2/3Li2/9Mn53/72Ti1/24O2 (NLMTO), exhibiting remarkable characteristics such as a notable rate capacity (130 mAh g−1 at 3C, where 1C equals 200 mA g−1) and excellent cycling retention (85.4% after 100 cycles at 0.5C) is introduced. Employing electrochemical differential analyses, the contributions to the superior performance arising from the Mn‐ and O‐redox processes are quantitatively delineated. The optimized performance of NLMTO is attributed, in part, to the enhanced stability of both bulk and interface structures. The introduction of Ti through substitution not only contributes to this stability but also allows for the fine‐tuning of the material's electron configurations. This is achieved by augmenting the density of states near the Fermi energy level, as well as elevating the O 2p and Mn 3d orbits. This research advances sodium‐ion battery technology.",

        "abstract": "There are still many problems that hinder the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), including poor rate performance, short-term cycle lifespan, and inferior low-temperature property. Herein, excellent Na-storage performance in fluorophosphate (Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 F3 ) cathode is achieved by lattice regulation based on charge balance theory. Lattice regulation of aliovalent Mn2+ for V3+ increases both electronic conductivity and Na+ -migration kinetics. Because of the maintaining of electrical neutrality in the material, aliovalent Mn2+ -introduced leads to the coexistence of V3+ and V4+ from charge balance theory. It decreases the particle size and improves the structural stability, suppressing the large lattice distortion during cathode reaction processes. These multiple effects enhance the specific capacity (123.8 mAh g-1 ), outstanding high-rate (68% capacity retention at 20 C), ultralong cycle (only 0.018% capacity attenuation per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C) and low-temperature (96.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles at -25 °C) performances of Mn2+ -induced Na3 V1.98 Mn0.02 (PO4 )2 F3 when used as cathode in SIBs.

In this study, we investigate the origin of capacity fading in P2-type layered sodium cathode materials for SIBs using a micron-sized single-crystalline P2-Na x Mn 3/4 Ni 1/4 O 2 model cathode active material. Using various electrochemical techniques, we identify the following aging effects upon cycling: (i) a state of charge (SOC)- independent increase in polarization, (ii) a SOC-dependent increase in polarization at high voltage, and (iii) a loss of active material due to electronic disconnection after prolonged cycling. With high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we identify surface densification, resulting in 5 − 10 nm thick surface layers on cycled cathode active materials as the origin for SOC-independent increase of polarization. The corresponding oxygen loss is in accordance with gas evolution in differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements. Furthermore, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) electrode cross sections, we identify (partly) reversible cracking at a high SOC as the cause for increased polarization depending on SOC. Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) identifies significant anisotropic volume change, which suggests mechanical stress as the cause for cracking at a high SOC and loss of active material after prolonged cycling.

However, their synthesis requires harsh conditions such as high pressure and temperature, and the cathode materials exhibit poor electrical conductivity and sluggish kinetics, hindering SIBs from meeting the requirements for practical applications. In this study, a conversion-type Gr/FeSO4 nanocomposite based on earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements was developed using a high-energy mechanical ball-milling method. The conversion reaction in FeSO4 was triggered via a simple direct-contact pre-sodiation method, wherein the FeSO4 particles were reversibly converted to Fe0 and Na2SO4 and recovered in the next charging process. Meanwhile, graphene in Gr/FeSO4 acted as a conductive matrix that provided additional electron transfer paths, resulting in increased ionic and electronic conductivities and enhanced diffusion kinetics. Owing to these matrices, the as-prepared Gr/FeSO4 nanocomposite exhibited remarkable long-term cyclability.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have huge potential in large-scale energy storage applications. Layered Fe-based oxides are one of the desirable cathode materials due to abundance in the earth crust and high activity in electrochemical processes. However, Fe-ion migration to Na layers is one of the major hurdles leading to irreversible structural degradation. Herein, it is revealed that distinct Fe-ion migration in cycling NaFeO2 (NFO) should be mainly responsible for the strong local lattice strain and resulting particle cracks, all of which results in the deterioration of electrochemical performance. More importantly, a strategy of Ru doping could effectively suppress the Fe-ion migration and then reduce the local lattice strain and the particle cracks, finally to greatly enhance the sodium storage performance. Atomic-scale characterization shows that NFO electrode after cycling presents the intense lattice strain locally, accompanied by the remarkable particle cracks. Whereas, Ru-doped NFO electrode maintains the well-ordered layered structure by inhibiting the Fe-O distortion, so as to eliminate the resulting side effect. As a result, Ru-doped NFO could greatly improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance by delivering a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g-1 , about 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The findings provide new insights for designing high-performance electrodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

Among all the cathode materials, layered sodium transition-metal oxides are particularly attractive. However, undesired phase transitions are often reported and have detrimental effects on the structure stability and electrochemical performance. Cu substitution of zinc in the P2-type Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15-xCuxO2 (x = 0, 0.075, and 0.15) composites was investigated in this study for mitigating the biphase transition and enhancing the electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries. The coupling effect of Zn and Cu enables an excellent capacity retention of 96.4% of the initial discharge capacity after 150 cycles at 0.1 C in the Na/Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.075Cu0.075O2 cell. The biphase transition that occurred in the high voltage range has been significantly suppressed after the incorporation of Cu in Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15O2, which was confirmed by in situ X-ray diffraction studies. Moreover, the substitution of the inert element Zn with electrochemically active Cu leads to the suppression of anionic redox and the occurrence of Cu2+/3+ redox reaction, and the electrolyte decomposition is impeded after the introduction of electrochemically active Cu in the Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15-xCuxO2 composite cathode. The enhanced electrochemical performance in the Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.075Cu0.075O2 electrode can be ascribed to the coexistence of Zn and Cu and alleviated volumetric change as well as suppressed electrode/electrolyte side reaction after Cu substitution.",

The Pyr1,4FSI electrolyte demonstrated the best cycling stability with an unprecedented decay rate of only ∼0.023% per cycle after the initial stabilization and an average coulombic efficiency of ∼99.5% for over 1000 cycles at RT. The Pyr1,3FSI electrolyte demonstrated the best cycling stability with a capacity decay rate of only ∼0.25% per cycle at 60 °C. Cells using Pyr1,3FSI and EMIMFSI electrolytes also showed promising cycling stability with capacity decay rates of ∼0.039% and ∼0.030% per cycle over 1000 cycles, respectively. A protective and ionically conductive cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer is formed during cycling in ILs, diminishing side reactions that commonly lead to gassing and excessive CEI growth in organic electrolytes, especially at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the increased ionic conductivity and decreased viscosity of ILs at elevated temperatures help attain higher accessible capacity. The application of ILs sheds light on designing a protective CEI for its use in stable SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal (TM)-based layered oxides NaTMO2 (TM = Fe, Ni, Co, Mn etc.) have been intensively pursued as high-capacity cathode materials for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Nevertheless, they still suffer fast capacity loss and voltage decay, as a result of the layered structure instability upon extended electrochemical cycling. The mechanism underlying such instability remains poorly understood. Here we unravel the TM migrations and structural evolution of a quaternary NaNi0.3Co0.12Mn0.18Fe0.4O2 compound during electrochemical cycling using atomic resolution electron microscopy and associated spectroscopies. We discover successive migrations of TM ions to Na layers that account for structure and performance degradations. The Fe ions migrate into the interstices of both tetrahedra and octahedra of the layers, whereas the Ni ions dominantly in the octahedral ones, and the Mn and Co ions mostly remain in the TM layers. Direct atomic-level observations of the TM migration process upon cycling offer a deep insight into designing high capacity and high cycle lifespan cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Here, we take advantage of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the thermal stability of P2-type NaxCoO2 cathode materials for sodium ion batteries, which are promising candidates for next-generation lithium ion batteries. A double-tilt TEM heating holder was used to directly characterize the changes in the morphology and the crystallographic and electronic structures of the materials with increase in temperature. The electron diffraction patterns and the electron energy loss spectra demonstrated the presence of cobalt oxides (Co3O4, CoO) and even metallic cobalt (Co) at higher temperatures as a result of reduction of Co ions and loss of oxygen. The bright-field TEM images revealed that the surface of NaxCoO2 becomes porous at high temperatures. Higher cutoff voltages result in degrading thermal stability of NaxCoO2. The observations herein provide a valuable insight that thermal stability is one of the important factors to be considered in addition to the electrochemical properties when developing new electrode materials for novel battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal layered oxide materials with a general formula NaxMO2 (M=Ni, Mn, Co, Fe) are widely researched with various possible electrode configurations. A significant improvement in structural and electrochemical performance is required to broaden the future applications of sodium‐based layered oxide materials for Na‐ion batteries. In this work, O3‐type NaNi(1‐x)/2Mn(1‐x)/2MoxO2 (x=0, 0.05,0.1) layered oxide cathode materials were synthesized by solid‐state reaction method, and its structural, thermal and electrochemical performance in Sodium (Na) ion battery was investigated. The structural analysis reveals that a single phase highly crystalline O3‐type cathode material with irregular particle shape was formed. The introduction of molybdenum (Mo) improves the thermal stability of cathode materials, which can be attributed to the improved TMO2 layers that provide stability to the material. The addition of Mo to Na layered oxide cathode materials influences their electrochemical performance. In comparison, the developed cathode materials, the NaNi0.475Mn0.475Mo0.05O2, exhibited excellent specific discharge capacity (∽154mAh/g) at C/20 rate, (an increase of ∽20% when compared to the NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2) which can be attributed to the increased capacitance effect by the addition of Mo. The EIS study reveals that the diffusion of Na+ into/from the host structure is rapid during the first cycle and then gradually reduces with subsequent cycling due to the formation of the SEI layer, which hinders Na+ migration. This has a potential effect on the improved electrochemical performance of the material.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Currently, a major target in the development of Na-ion batteries is the concurrent attainment of high-rate capacity and long cycling stability. Herein, an advanced Na-ion battery with high-rate capability and long cycle stability based on Li/Ti co-doped P2-type Na0.67 Mn0.67 Ni0.33 O2 , a host material with high-voltage zero-phase transition behavior and fast Na+ migration/conductivity during dynamic de-embedding process, is constructed. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the two-element doping strategy promotes a mutually reinforcing effect, which greatly facilitates the transfer capability of Na+ . The cation Ti4+ doping is a dominant high voltage, significantly elevating the operation voltage to 4.4 V. Meanwhile, doping Li+ shows the function in charge transfer, improving the rate performance and prolonging cycling lifespan.

        "abstract": "As promising cathodes for Na-ion batteries (NIBs), layered transition metal (TM) oxides have attracted intense research activities due to high specific capacities, especially benefitting from the boosted capacity triggered by oxygen-related anionic redox reactions (ARRs). However, on the aspect of ARRs activity, the difference between typically O3 and P2-type structures has not been clearly clarified with the in-depth exploration. Herein, composed with similar composition, ARRs induced oxygen behaviors within O3-Na0.6Li0.2Fe0.4Ru0.4O2 and P2-Na0.6Li0.35Fe0.1Ru0.55O2 are systematically investigated by varying ex/in-situ spectroscopic characterizations. Conducted with lower charging cut-off voltage (4.0 V), P2-type cathode will be easier to trigger the reversible oxygen behaviors and delivers a larger capacity, better rate performance as well as stable cyclability, in contrast to the O3-type cathode. Moreover, within O3-type structure, increasing charging potential (beyond 4.3 V) would induce additional anionic oxidation capacity, but inevitably lead to the irreversible evolution of gaseous O2 and superoxo. With the unique feature, this work provides a promising strategy design for fabricating cathodes with optimal microstructural arrangement, which could further push forward the changes in macro/nano structure and even the ideal performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting comparable electrochemical performance while capitalizing on the abundant availability of sodium resources. In SIBs, P2/O3 biphasic cathodes, despite their high energy, require furthur improvements in stability to meet current energy demands. This study introduces a systematic methodology that leverages the meta-heuristically assisted NSGA-II algorithm to optimize multi-element doping in electrode materials, aiming to transcend conventional trial-and-error methods and enhance cathode capacity by the synergistic integration of P2 and O3 phases. A comprehensive phase analysis of the meta-heuristically designed cathode material Na0.76Ni0.20Mn0.42Fe0.30Mg0.04Ti0.015Zr0.025O2 (D-NFMO) is presented, showcasing its remarkable initial reversible capacity of 175.5 mAh g-1 and exceptional long-term cyclic stability in sodium cells. The investigation of structural composition and the stabilizing mechanisms is performed through the integration of multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, the irreversible phase transition of P2→OP4 in D-NFMO is observed to be dramatically suppressed, leading to a substantial enhancement in cycling stability. The comparison with the pristine cathode (P-NFMO) offers profound insights into the long-term electrochemical stability of D-NFMO, highlighting its potential as a high-voltage cathode material utilizing abundant earth elements in SIBs. This study opens up new possibilities for future advancements in sodium-ion battery technology.",

However, the phase transformations during repeated (dis)charge steps lead to rapid capacity decay and deteriorated Na+ diffusion kinetics. Moreover, the electrode manufacturing based on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder system has been reported with severely defluorination issue as well as the energy intensive and expensive process due to the use of toxic and volatile N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent.

In this work, we investigated inorganic sodium metasilicate (SMS) as a viable binder in conjunction with P2-Na0.67Mn0.55Ni0.25Fe0.1Ti0.1O2 (NMNFT) cathode material for SIBs. The NMNFT-SMS electrode delivered a superior electrochemical performance compared to carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) and PVDF based electrodes with a reversible capacity of ~161 mAh/g and retaining ~83% after 200 cycles. Lower cell impedance and faster Na+ diffusion was also observed in this binder system. With these findings, SMS binder can be proposed as a powerful multifunctional binder to enable positive electrode manufacturing of SIBs and to overall reduce battery manufacturing costs.",

Nevertheless, it undergoes complicated phase transitions and pronounced structural degradation during the cycling of charge/discharge process, rendering severe volumetric strain and poor cycling performance. Herein, a zero‐strain high‐entropy NaNi0.2Fe0.2Mn0.35Cu0.05Zn0.1Sn0.1O2 cathode for SIBs is presented by high‐entropy phase stabilization engineering. It is verified that this low‐nickel cobalt‐free high‐entropy cathode can deliver a highly reversible phase evolution, zero volumetric strain, and a significantly improved cycling performance in full cells (87% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 3.0 C). Combining X‐ray absorption spectra and first‐principles calculations, the varied elemental functions in the high‐entropy framework are clearly elucidated, namely, Ni/Fe/Cu acts as charge compensators, while Mn/Zn/Sn serve as interlayer slipping inhibitors through enhanced charge localization besides their stable valence states. By addressing the volumetric strain and cycling instability concerns for O3‐type cathode materials, this work presents a promising strategy for inhibiting irreversible phase transitions and structural degradation in intercalation electrodes, which significantly boosts the development of commercially feasible cathodes for high‐performance SIBs.",

The resulting conductive network serves to accelerate the diffusion of Na+ ions across the interface as well as in the bulk. The strong binding force of the CMC and stable solid permeable interface protect the electrode from degradation, leading to an excellent capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 70 C (1 C = 128 mA g−1) and a long lifespan of 3500 cycles at 30 C while sustaining 79% of the initial capacity value.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are promising cathode materials but suffer from phase transitions during cycling. Compared to monophasic LTMOs, P2/O3-type LTMOs mitigate these transitions while benefiting from the synergistic interaction of two monophasic structures. However, the lack of precise atomic configurations for P2/O3 LTMOs limits their detailed analysis. To address this, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate how dopants inhibit phase transitions in biphasic LTMOs. P2/O3-type Na0.85Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 (NFMO) is constructed by merging two monophasic structures. Doping strategies generated three variants (Na0.85Fe0.4Mn0.4D0.2O2, D = dopants), which are analyzed using DFT to assess the effects of doping. Among the three dopants considered, only Ti-doped NFMO maintained its P2/O3 phase even with 88 % desodiation, showing enhanced structural stability with a 4.0 % reduced volume variation compared to undoped NFMO. To uncover the origin of phase transitions in biphasic LTMOs, factors such as interlayer thickness, atomic charge, and bond length are analyzed. Sodium layer spacing emerges as the critical factor. This study provides valuable structural insights into biphasic LTMOs and highlights strategies for designing materials with suppressed phase transitions, offering a pathway to advancing sodium-ion battery performance.",

        "title": "A Review of Degradation Mechanisms and Recent Achievements for Na‐Ion Layered Transition Metal Oxides",
        "abstract": "Due to the low price and high specific capacity, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have become a crucial candidate for the future large‐scale energy storage power station, providing strong support for energy transition. Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs), as one of the most promising cathode materials for SIBs, are usually accompanied by the sodiation/de‐sodiation during charging/discharging, which leads to the slippage and deformation of the layered structure, and consequently causes to the degradation of electrochemical performance. The degradation mechanisms of LTMOs attributed to the structural change are important references for improving the electrochemical performance of cathode materials. Here, this paper presents the main degradation mechanisms such as irreversible anion redox reaction, Na+/vacancy ordering transition and poor air stability as well as the corresponding modification means. It also summarizes the challenges faced by sodium‐ion LTMOs cathode materials, and gives an outlook on the key issues that need to be solved for future development.",

        "title": "Leveraging High-Entropy Substitution to Achieve V4+/V5+ Redox Couple and Superior Na+ Storage in Na3V2(PO4)3-based Cathodes for Sodium-Ion Battery",
        "abstract": "Sodium super ionic conductor-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has garnered considerable attention owing to its excellent operational voltage and 3D framework, but the limited ionic conductivity and substantial volume fluctuation impede its practical application. In this work, high-performance Na3V1.45(Fe,Al,Cr,Mn,Ni)0.5Mo0.02Zr0.03(PO4)3 (HE-NVP) is designed by the partial substitution of V3+ by seven metal ions in the NVP using high-entropy substitution. Due to the profound effect of high-entropy substitution, the M-O bond length in the HE-NVP is finely tuned, effectively reducing the distortion of MO6 octahedron. Simultaneously, high entropy substitution suppresses adverse phase transitions in the high voltage range above 4.0 V (vs Na+/Na) and enhances structural stability. The activated V4+/5+ elevates energy density to an impressive 394.2 Wh kg-1 at 0.5 C within the voltage range of 2.2-4.3 V, while the specific capacity remains 80.2 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles at 5 C, exhibiting capacity attenuation per cycle at only 0.025 %. Ex-situ XRD reveals that the sodium storage process of HE-NVP undergoes a single solid solution phase reaction with a small volume change rate of 0.91 %. This study offers a promising avenue for the development of advanced polyanionic phosphate cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract O3‐type NaNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NaNMC811) cathode active materials for sodium–ion batteries (SIBs), with a theoretical high specific capacity (∼ 187 mAh g−1), are in the preliminary exploration stage. This study comprehensively investigates NaNMC811 from multiple perspectives. For the first time, the phase evolution (P3¯m1 ‐ Fm3¯m ‐ R3¯m) during the solid‐state synthesis is systemically investigated, which elucidates in‐depth the mechanisms of the thermal sodiation process. Furthermore, an Al‐gradient doping of NaNMC811 was successfully implemented through Al2O3 coating on the cathode active material (CAM) precursor. The modified Al−NaNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (Al‐NaNMC811) exhibits excellent electrochemical dynamics and performance, maintaining a specific capacity above 100 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C (1.5–4.1 V) while providing a promising capacity retention of 63%. Additionally, the material demonstrates excellent rate capabilities, retaining a specific capacity of 107 mAh g−1 at 5 C. Compared to pristine NaNMC811, the modified Al‐NaNMC811 is proven to have improved electrochemical kinetics with a higher Na+ diffusion coefficient due to dilated (003) interplanar spacing, and a more stable structure during the electrochemical charge–discharge processes, which is attributed to stronger Al–O bond energy. Understanding phase formations during the synthesis and comprehensive insight in the gradient doping for O3‐type NaNMC811 CAMs guides further development of next‐generation SIBs materials.",

        "abstract": "Na4VMn(PO4)3 (NVMP) is a prospective cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and extraordinary structural stability. However, poor conductivity restricts the electrochemical performance of NVMP, which limits its development and application. Herein, carbon-encapsulated NVMP porous nanorods are prepared via a convenient electrospinning method. The prepared one-dimensional (1D) structure can effectively accelerate the transmission rate of electrons, and the porous structure of NVMP/C nanorods can increase the contact area between the electrolyte and electrode material, which can enhance the diffusion rate of sodium ions. Owing to this advantageous nanoarchitecture, the obtained NVMP/C porous nanorods delivered an initial reversible capacity of 90.9 mA h·g-1 at 0.2 C and a discharge capacity of 68.0 mA h g-1 at 5.0 C. NVMP/C can also achieve a good cycling stability with ideal capacity retentions of 90.4% and 89.8% after 800 cycles at 1 and 3 C, respectively. Moreover, even at a temperature of -30 °C at 0.3 C, the discharge capability was up to 40.1% of that at 20 °C, suggesting an impressive low-temperature tolerance. In situ X-ray diffraction demonstrated that there was no crystal distortion of the NVMP/C electrode during charge and discharge. This work can provide a high-performance strategy on modification of polyanion-positive electrode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 (NVP) is a widely studied cathode material for sodium-ion batteries because of its high ionic conductivity and attractive charge/discharge plateau (3.4 V vs. Na/Na + ). However, its poor electronic conductivity and severe volume expansion during sodium storage need to be addressed before its intensive application could be realized. Herein, we synthesize boron-doped NVP through a facile electrospinning method. By adding boric acid into the reaction mixture during electrospinning followed by carbonization, boron could be directly inserted into the carbon matrix, giving rise to B-doped carbon nanofiber wrapped NVP. By tuning the doping amount, the boron-containing configurations can be facilely manipulated which play different roles in promoting the sodium storage properties of the composite. Based on the calculation results, BC 2 O enhances sodium diffusion by lowering the energy barrier, while BCO 2 improves the structural stability. Due to these specific functionalities of the configurations, the as-prepared composite with a balanced amount of BC 2 O and BCO 2 demonstrates superior sodium storage capacity of 113 mA h g -1 at 1 C, outstanding long cycling performance of 103 mA h g -1 at 10 C and retains 91 mA h g -1 after 1500 cycles. This gives rise to a capacity loss of only 0.08‰ per cycle, much better than the undoped counterpart.",

        "abstract": "Copper Sulfide (CuS) semiconductors have garnered interest, but the effect of transition metal doping on charge carrier kinetics and bandgap remains unclear. In this study, the interactions between dopant atoms (Nickel, Cobalt, and Manganese) and the CuS lattice using spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis are explored. The findings show that sp-d exchange interactions between band electrons and the dopant ions, which replace Cu2+, are key to altering the material's properties. Specifically, these interactions result in a reduced bandgap by shifting the conduction and valence band edges and increasing carrier concentration. It is observed that undoped CuS nanoflowers exhibit a carrier lifetime of 2.16 ns, whereas Mn-doped CuS shows an extended lifetime of 2.62 ns. This increase is attributed to longer carrier scattering times (84 ± 5 fs for Mn-CuS compared to 53 ± 14 fs for CuS) and slower trapping (∼1.5 ps) with prolonged de-trapping (∼100 ps) rates. These dopant-induced energy levels enhance mobility and carrier lifetime by reducing recombination rates. This study highlights the potential of doped CuS as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries and emphasizes the applicability of metal sulfides in energy solutions.",

        "abstract": "Layered P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 has been considered an attractive cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it is still burdened with hazardous phase transformation of P2-O2 under high voltage and harmful reactions at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. These result in unfavorable structural degradation and rapid capacity decay. Herein, a gradient Mg2+ doping approach is proposed to trigger a structural transformation. During the annealing process, the bulk-diffused Mg2+ and surface residual Mg2+ induce the formation of the P2/P3@MgO structure. Consequently, this method combines the merits of the composite phases, bulk doping, and surface modification. In consequence, Na+ diffusion kinetics and electrochemical performances are remarkably enhanced. The cells using P2/P3@MgO show 69.7% capacity retention at 0.2 C within a voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V for 100 cycles, compared with the 42.6% for P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides with high initial sodium content are promising cathode candidates for Na-ion batteries. However, affected by the undesired transition metal slab sliding and reaction with H2O/CO2, their further application is typically hindered by unsatisfactory cycling stability upon charging to high voltage and poor storage stability under humid air. Herein, we demonstrate a Fe/Ti cosubstitution strategy to simultaneously enhance the electrochemical performance and storage stability of pristine O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode material, via employing high redox potential and inactive stabilized dopants. The resultant Fe/Ti cosubstituted Na0.95Ni0.40Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2 undergoes highly reversible O3-P3-OP2 phase transitions with a small cell volume change of 2.8%, instead of complex O3-O'3-P3-P'3-P3'-O1 phase transitions in NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2. Consequently, the cathode displays a high specific capacity of 161.6 mAh g-1 with an average working voltage of 3.28 V and 81.8% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the cathode material remains very stable after exposure to air for 7 days and even after soaking in water for 1 h, owing to the prohibition of sodium losing by elevating redox potential and contracting sodium layer spacing. This work proposes an effective method to enhance the electrochemical performance and storage stability of O3-type layered oxide cathodes and promises advancing Na-ion batteries toward large-scale industrialization.",

The materials have a composite structure containing layered NaMnO2 and Li2MnO3 components, where oxygen anionic redox can be triggered at high voltage by forming Na–O–Li configurations. The samples synthesized via MnCO3‐based precursors form the Li2MnO3 phase at evaluated temperature and perform better than those through MnO2‐based precursors.

        "abstract": "Co shows excellent performance in the high voltage range for layered oxide cathode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, its high cost and toxicity are signiﬁcant disadvantages.Co-free cathodes with high performance are urgently needed for development. Herein, cheap Mg and Ti elements are preferred to replace Co elements. A P2-Na 0.67 Mn 0.53 Ni 0.30 Mg 0.085 Ti 0.085 O 2 (Ni30MgTi) cathode shows a high reversible speciﬁc capacity of 118 mA h g − 1 at a current density of 50 mA g − 1 in 2.0–4.25 V, which is even higher than that in the base sample with Co. Moreover, Mg and Ti raise the median discharge voltage from 3.21 to 3.59 V, which raises the energy density from 325 to 410 Wh kg − 1 . On the other hand, ex situ XPS and in situ diﬀerential electrochemical mass spectrometry tests indicate that Ni30MgTi has a stable anionic redox reaction with reversible capacity in the high voltage range. The concept of bimetallic co-substitution oﬀers a simple and eﬀective Co-free strategy to reduce the cost and increase the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials simultaneously for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries show promise for large-scale energy storage, yet face challenges due to water decomposition, limiting their energy density and lifespan. Here, the authors report a cathode surface coating strategy in an alkaline electrolyte to enhance the stability of both electrolyte and battery. Aqueous sodium-ion batteries are practically promising for large-scale energy storage, however energy density and lifespan are limited by water decomposition. Current methods to boost water stability include, expensive fluorine-containing salts to create a solid electrolyte interface and addition of potentially-flammable co-solvents to the electrolyte to reduce water activity. However, these methods significantly increase costs and safety risks. Shifting electrolytes from near neutrality to alkalinity can suppress hydrogen evolution while also initiating oxygen evolution and cathode dissolution. Here, we present an alkaline-type aqueous sodium-ion batteries with Mn-based Prussian blue analogue cathode that exhibits a lifespan of 13,000 cycles at 10 C and high energy density of 88.9 Wh kg^−1 at 0.5 C. This is achieved by building a nickel/carbon layer to induce a H_3O^+-rich local environment near the cathode surface, thereby suppressing oxygen evolution. Concurrently Ni atoms are in-situ embedded into the cathode to boost the durability of batteries.",

In this work, Li/Ni/Ti co-doping Na0.72Li0.16Ni0.12Ti0.1Mn0.62O2 (NLNTMO) cathode was successfully synthesized and it revealed that the structure design not only effectively inhibits Jahn-Teller distortion to improve cycling stability but also enhances its resistance to air and moisture degradation. Besides, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ti can slightly adjust the energy level of isolated O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals. The in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals the inhibition of the repulsive phase transition from P2–OP4/O2 and the occurrence of a solid solution reaction instead. As a result, NLNTMO cathode presents a high specific capacity of 198.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2C, 70 mAh g−1 at 20C (4 A g−1) and a high capacity retention of 80 % in 2.0–4.4 V after 200 cycles at 1C.",

        "abstract": "The widespread interest in Na4MnCr(PO4)3 (NMCP) for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) derives from its high energy density and earth abundance. Nevertheless, the poor rate capability and unsatisfactory cycle performance restrict the application of NMCP cathodes in commercialized SIBs. Herein, we designed and prepared the dual-modified NMCP cathode materials by combining doping Sc3+ and hybrid coating with RuO2/C. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of two approaches, the structural stability and the Na+ diffusion as well as the electronic conductivity have been elevated synchronously. Therefore, the optimized Na4MnCr0.95Sc0.05(PO4)3@RuO2/C composite (NMCSP@RC) presents a superior rate capability (163.4 mAh/g at 50 mA g−1 and 87.6 mAh/g at 1000 mA g−1) and extended cycle stability (capacity retention of 66.3 % after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g−1) compared to pure NMCP. Moreover, a full SIB cell with NMCSP@RC cathode demonstrates a praiseworthy energy density of 469.8 Wh kg−1. This study proves the effectiveness of the dual modification strategy on NMCP, which could provide a fresh idea to optimizing the performance for NMCP cathode materials and contribute to the final fulfillment of their commercialized application.",

        "abstract": "The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium‐based polyanions in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard‐to‐access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron‐transfer process (≈2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440 Wh kg−1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high‐performance cathodes in SIBs.",

All of the microstructure, phase components, particle size, and specific surface of NaFePO_4/C cathode materials were well controlled by this one-step method. Among them, the NaFePO_4/C with amorphous and maricite phases calcined at 450 °C had an excellent electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity maintained at 123.6 mAh g^−1 after 10 cycles and becomes stable, and the capacity decay rate was only 4.00% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C at room temperature, Na^+ diffusion coefficient of 1.026 × 10^–17 cm^2 s^−1, and charge transfer resistance of 998.6 Ω.",

The versatile carbon quantum dots that are vastly flexible for surface engineering serve the function of protecting the nanowire surface and play an important role in the diffusion of electrons. Also, the three-dimensional carbon cloth coated with VO2 interwoven nanowires assisted in the diffusion of ions through the inner and the outer surface. With this unique architecture, the carbon quantum dot nanosurface engineered VO2 electrode exhibited capacities of 420 and 328 mAh g(-1) at current density rate of 0.3 C for lithium and sodium storage, respectively.

However, the cyclic stability of NaCrO2 needs to be further improved in order to compete with other state-of-the-art NIB cathodes. In this study, we show that Cr2O3-coated and Al-doped NaCrO2, which is synthesized through a simple one-pot synthesis, can achieve unprecedented cyclic stability. We confirm the preferential formation of a Cr2O3 shell and a Na(Cr1-2xAl2x)O2 core, rather than xAl2O3/NaCrO2 or Na1/1+2x(Cr1/1+2xAl2x/1+2x)O2, through spectroscopic and microscopic methods. The core/shell compounds exhibit superior electrochemical properties compared to either Cr2O3-coated NaCrO2 without Al dopants or Al-doped NaCrO2 without shells because of their synergistic contributions. As a result, Na(Cr0.98Al0.02)O2 with a thin Cr2O3 layer (5 nm) shows no capacity fading during 1000 charge/discharge cycles while maintaining the rate capability of pristine NaCrO2. In addition, the compound is inert against humid air and water. We also discuss the reasons for the excellent performance of Cr2O3-coated Na(Cr1-2xAl2x)O2.",

        "abstract": "As a promising alternative for lithium ion batteries, room-temperature sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have become one significant research frontier of energy storage devices although there are still many difficulties to be overcome. For the moment, the studies still concentrate on the preparation of new electrode materials for SIBs to meet the applicability. Herein, one new P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn5/9Al1/9O2 (NMA) cathode material is successfully prepared via a simple and facile liquid-state method. The prepared NMA is layered transition metal oxide, which can keep stable crystal structure during sodiation/desodiation as demonstrated by the ex situ X-ray diffraction, and its electrochemical properties can be further enhanced by connecting the cake-like NMA microparticles with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using a ball milling method. Electrochemical tests show that the formed RGO-connected NMA (NMA/RGO) can deliver a higher reversible capacity of up to 138 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and also exhibit a superior high-rate capabilities and cycling stability in comparison to pure NMA. The much improved properties should be attributed to the reduced particle size and improvement of electrical conductivity and apparent Na(+) diffusion due to RGO incorporation, which is comprehensively verified by the electrochemical technologies of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at various scan rate as well as ex-situ X-ray diffraction studies.",

        "abstract": "Activating multielectron reactions of sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type cathodes toward higher energy density remains imperative to boost their application feasibility. However, multisodium storage with high stability is difficult to achieve due to the sluggish reaction kinetics, irreversible phase transitions, and negative structural degradation. Herein, a kind of NASICON-type Na2.5V1.5Ti0.5(PO4)3/C (NVTP-0.5) hierarchical microsphere consisting of abundant primary nanoparticles is designed, realizing a reversible 3.2-electron reaction with high stability. The optimized NVTP-0.5 cathode demonstrates an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 192.42 mAh g-1, energy density of up to 497.3 Wh kg-1 at 20 mA g-1, and capacity retention ratio of 94.1% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. Additionally, the NVTP-0.5 cathode delivers excellent tolerance to extreme temperatures while also achieving a high-energy density of 400 Wh kg-1 (based on the cathode mass) in a full-cell configuration. Systematic in situ/ex situ analysis results confirm the multisodium storage processes of NVTP-0.5 involving successive redox reactions (V2+/V3+, Ti3+/Ti4+, and V3+/V4+ redox couples) and reversible structure evolution (solid-solution and biphasic mechanisms), which contribute to the high capacity and excellent cycling stability. This work indicates that the rational regulation of components with different functions can unlock more possibilities for the development of NASICON-type cathodes.",

        "title": "Achieving complete solid-solution reaction in layered cathodes with reversible oxygen redox for high-stable sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "P2-type layered Mn-based oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but it is still challenging to achieve both high capacity and stability because of complex phase transitions and irreversible oxygen release at high voltage. To address these challenges, an optimal P2-type Na0.67Mn0.8Cu0.15Ti0.05O2 (NMCT) cathode with a complete solid-solution reaction and reversible oxygen redox reaction over a wide voltage range was developed. The introduction of the Na–O–Ti configuration leads to fewer delocalized electrons on oxygen and thus enhances oxygen redox activity, while the high energetic overlap between O 2p and Cu 3d states and the increased Mn–O hybridization strengthen the rigidity of oxygen framework to achieve reversible and stable oxygen redox reaction. In addition, the reinforced TM–O interaction, combined with the ameliorated Mn3+ Jahn-Teller distortion and disrupted Na+/vacancy ordering, synergistically eliminate the undesired P2–OP4 phase transition and lead to a complete solid-solution reaction, which greatly facilitates Na+ transport kinetics and stabilizes structural integrity. As a consequence, improved rate performance and cycling stability are achieved for NMCT. Our present study provides a promising avenue for simultaneously utilizing the reversible oxygen redox activity and maintaining the structural integrity to accomplish the capacity-stability trade-off of Mn-based oxide cathodes for constructing practical SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Lattice‐oxygen redox in layered metal oxide cathodes offers a promising way to exploit high‐energy density sodium‐ion batteries. However, oxidation and reduction of lattice‐oxygen are always asymmetric, showing poor reversibility upon charging and discharging due to the activated oxygen loss and subsequent structural rearrangement. Here, a layered Na0.7[Li0.2Mn0.7Co0.1]O2 (NLMCO) is developed by balancing lattice‐oxygen activity and reversibility, which can deliver a record energy density of 729.7 Wh kg−1, further exceeding the state‐of‐the‐art Na0.75[Li0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NLMO, 638.4 Wh kg−1). In light of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, and electrochemical testing results, the highly activated lattice‐oxygen is effectively stabilized in NLMCO without oxygen molecule release while obvious oxygen release is detected in the highly activated NLMO. Benefiting from the enhanced transition metal‐oxygen covalency and reduced band energy gap, the NLMCO electrode demonstrates simultaneously high lattice‐oxygen activity and reversibility, thus resulting in excellent rate and cycling performance, as well as ultra‐high energy density. The findings highlight the critical association of energy density and lattice‐oxygen redox reversibility, which will inspire more interest in anionic redox‐based high‐energy batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low-temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium-ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self-adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock-and-release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically \"locks\" and \"releases\" vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously \"locking\" H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self-adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real-time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (ΔG). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high-crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 °C within just 3 hours. The as-prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra-stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram-scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Using first‐principles calculations, biaxial tensile (ϵ=2 and 4 %) and compressive (ϵ=−2 and −4 %) straining of Na2MnSiO4 lattices resulted into radial distance cut offs of 1.65 and 2 Å, respectively, in the first and second nearest neighbors shell from the center. The Si−O and Mn−O bonds with prominent probability density peaks validated structural stability. Wide‐band gap of 2.35 (ϵ=0 %) and 2.54 eV (ϵ=−4 %), and narrow bandgap of 2.24 eV (ϵ=+4 %) estimated with stronger coupling of p–d σ bond than that of the p–d π bond, mainly contributed from the oxygen p‐state and manganese d‐state. Na+‐ion diffusivity was found to be enhanced by three orders of magnitude as the applied biaxial strain changed from compressive to tensile. According to the findings, the rational design of biaxial strain would improve the ionic and electronic conductivity of Na2MnSiO4 cathode materials for advanced rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries.",

Two important factors that influence the rate capability of this ASSB were optimised. First, the particle size of the precursor glass powder from which the NFP crystals are formed was decreased. Consequently, the onset temperature of crystallisation shifts to a lower temperature, which enables the softening of NFP crystals and their integration with β″-alumina at a low temperature, without the interdiffusion of different crystal phases or atoms. Second, the interface between the β″-alumina solid electrolyte and cathode active materials which consisted of the NFP-crystallised glass and acetylene black used as a conductive additive, is increased to increase the insertion/release of ions and electrons from the active material during charge/discharge processes. Thus, the internal resistance of the battery is reduced considerably to 120 Ω. Thus, an ASSB capable of rapid charge/discharge that can operate not only at room temperature (30 °C) but also at −20 °C is obtained. This technology is an innovative breakthrough in oxide-based ASSBs, considering that the internal resistance of liquid electrolyte-based Li-ion batteries and sulphide-based ASSBs is ~10 Ω.",

The recycled Na1.46Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.85·□0.15 shows low vacancies and excellent cycling stability over 300 cycles (89% capacity retention at 50 mA g-1). In operando, evidence indicates that high-quality Prussian blue allows fast sodium-ion mobility and a high degree of reversibility over the course of cycling, although with a three-phase-transition mechanism.

        "abstract": "The P2‐type layered transition metal oxide cathodes confront formidable challenges, including irreversible deleterious phase transitions, transition metals migration, and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, which hamper their rapid commercial application in sodium ion batteries (SIB). In this work, an entropy tuning with dual‐site substitution strategy is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. In the tailored [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.22Cu0.06Mn0.66Ti0.01O2 (NZNCMTO) cathodes, the strategic incorporation of Zn ions serves to occupy Na sites, intentionally disrupting the Na/vacancy ordering and establishing a reinforcing “pillar” effect within the layered framework. Furthermore, the substitution of Cu and Ti for Ni and Mn bolsters covalent bonding with the lattice oxygen, thereby impeding the migration of the transition metal ions and leading to a near‐zero strain structural evolution during charge and discharge process. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that entropy‐tuned NZNCMTO substantially lowered the migration energy barrier for Na+ ions diffusion and improved electronic conductivity. Consequently, the NZNCMTO cathode exhibits an impressive high practical capacity of 91.54 mAh g−1 at a high discharge rate of 10 C, along with outstanding cycling stability, maintaining near 100% capacity retention over 500 cycles at a current density of 10 C.

Herein, B substituted Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as stable cathode materials for Na‐ion battery is presented. A combined experimental and theoretical investigations on Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) are undertaken to reveal the evolution of crystal and electronic structures and Na storage properties associated with various concentration of B. X‐ray diffraction results indicate that the crystal structure of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) consisted of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 with tiny shrinkage of crystal lattice. X‐ray absorption spectra and the calculated crystal structures all suggest that the detailed local structural distortion of substituted materials originates from the slight reduction of V–O distances. Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 significantly enhances the structural stability and electrochemical performance, giving remarkable enhanced capacity of 100 and 70 mAh g−1 when the C‐rate increases to 5 C and 10 C. Spin‐polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that, as compared with the pristine Na3V2(PO4)3, the superior electrochemical performance of the substituted materials can be attributed to the emergence of new boundary states near the band gap, lower Na+ diffusion energy barriers, and higher structure stability.",

Synchrotron operando X‐ray diffraction demonstrates that Te substitution can suppress the O3−P3−O1‐phase transition during charge and discharge processes effectively, benefited from the strong TeO covalent bonds. The resulted Na2.2Ni2Sb0.2Te0.8O6 cathode exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.9% after 1000 cycles at 1C, with an elevated operating voltage of ≈3.8 V.

        "abstract": "The cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention not only because of their abundant natural reserves and chemical properties similar to those of lithium-ion batteries but also their great potential in energy storage and conversion technologies. However, their low capacity and high diffusion barrier remain unsolved problems. In this work, we systematically studied the theoretical capacity and sodium ion diffusion barrier in a new family of layered transition metal compounds, named MX2 (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe; X = C, N, and O), as the cathode materials of SIBs. The results indicate that all 2H-phase MX2 materials possess a high theoretical capacity of over 300 mA h g−1. Moreover, it is found that the 2H-phase CrN2 exhibits a desirable sodium ion diffusion barrier, indicating high mobility of sodium ions. In addition, the layered CrN2 has a remarkable voltage window (3.1–3.8 V) and outstanding electrochemical performance arising from the charge transfer between Na and N atoms, which is induced by the large electronegativity of nitrogen. Our research provides a promising candidate for application in SIB cathode materials in the future.",

This novel electrode shows excellent sodium-ion half/full battery performance due to the synergistic effects of its triphase intergrowth structure and cation substitution strategy. Based on combined analyses by scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution, as well as ex-situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectra and in-situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction patterns, the inherent layered P2@P3 integrated spinel structure, charge compensation mechanism, structural evolution, and phase transition are clearly articulated and confirmed. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the structure-performance relationship in this special structure and opens up a novel field via manipulating structural evolution for the design of high-performance battery cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7@C (NFPP) has attracted widespread attention from researchers due to its excellent structural stability, low cost, and non-toxic nature, making it one of the most promising energy storage materials for the future. The inherently poor electrical conductivity of NFPP, its actual specific capacity (around 100 mAh g−1) is often lower than its theoretical capacity (129 mAh g−1), which has been a key issue of concern for researchers. In this study, we adopted a mixed enhancement approach, where polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and a carbon source were appropriately combined. The PVA uniformly adhered to the surface, and during high-temperature pyrolysis, its decomposition resulted in the formation of carbon layers with pores, creating a porous carbon framework network. The presence of a porous carbon framework allows for sufficient electrolyte infiltration, significantly increasing the reaction surface area. As a result, we successfully synthesized NFPPx (with some PVA added) material with a porous carbon framework network. The surface of NFPPx was coated by a porous carbon layer, which provides the provision of a rapid conductive network and abundant sodium-ion transport pathways. NFPP2 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, with an outstanding reversible specific capacity of 118 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, which corresponds to 91.5% of its theoretical capacity. Additionally, NFPP2 demonstrates remarkable long-term cycling stability and excellent rate performance. After 6,000 cycles at 20C, it retains 90.6% of its capacity with a reversible specific capacity of 78 mAh g−1. Even at a high current rate of 40C, NFPP2 achieves a specific capacity of 69 mAh g−1. This simple method of mixing and enhancing materials has significantly advanced the development of sodium-ion batteries, providing a promising pathway for the future production of porous carbon framework materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium vanadate NaV6O15 (NVO) is one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of its low cost and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, NVO suffers from fast capacity fading and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel free-standing NVO/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite film cathode was synthesized and designed by a simple hydrothermal method followed by a dispersion technique with high safety and low cost. The kinetics analysis based on cyclic voltammetry measurements reveals that the intimate integration of the MWCNT 3D porous conductive network with the 3D pillaring tunnel structure of NVO nanorods enhances the Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior, thus leading to exceptional rate capability and long lifespan. Furthermore, the NVO/MWCNT composite exhibits excellent structural stability during the charge/discharge process. With these benefits, the composite delivers a high discharge capacity of 217.2 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in a potential region of 1.5-4.0 V. It demonstrates a superior rate capability of 123.7 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1. More encouragingly, it displays long lifespan; impressively, 96% of the initial capacity is retained at 5 A g-1 for over 500 cycles. Our work presents a promising strategy for developing electrode materials with a high rate capability and a long cycle life.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Layered oxides of sodium‐ion batteries suffer from severe side reactions on the electrode/electrolyte interface, leading to fast capacity degradation. Although surface reconstruction strategies are widely used to solve the above issues, the utilization of the low‐cost wet chemical method is extremely challenging for moisture‐sensitive Na‐based oxide materials. Here, the solvation tuning strategy is proposed to overcome the deterioration of NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 in water‐based solution and conduct the surface reconstruction. When capturing the water molecules by the solvation structure of cations, here is Li+, the structural collapse and degradation of layered oxides in water‐based solvents are greatly mitigated. Furthermore, Li(H2O)3EA+ promotes the profitable Li+/Na+ exchange to build a robust surface, which hampers the decomposition of electrolytes and the structural evolution upon cycling. Accordingly, the lifespan of Li‐reinforced materials is prolonged to three times that of the pristine one. This work represents a step forward in understanding the surface reconstruction operated in a water‐based solution for high‐performance sodium layered oxide cathodes.",

In this work, a novel conjugated poly(3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide) (PPI) with superior thermal stability and lower solubility was prepared successfully by a green facile mechanical ball milling strategy. The PPI exhibits enhanced electrochemical dynamics performance, preferable rate capability, higher discharge capacity, and excellent cycling stability of 450 cycles at 0.2 C with higher capacity retention of 85.7% when used as cathode material for sodium-ion battery. Furthermore, the in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ Raman investigations combined with the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out to investigate the sodium storage mechanism. The results indicate that only two sodium ions are bound to two opposite carbonyl groups of PPI monomer to form sodium enolates during normal charging and discharging and to deliver available reversible capacity.",

However, concerns remain over its long-term electrochemical performance and structural factors which impact sources of resistance in the material and subsequently rate performance. Refined control of the [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and water content could help in realizing its market potential. In this context, we have studied a low-defect Berlin green (BG) Na0.30(5)Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.94(2)·nH2O with varied water content corresponding to 10, 8, 6, and 2 wt%. The impact of water on the electrochemical properties of BG was systematically investigated. The electrodes were cycled within a narrow voltage window of 3.15-3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ to avoid undesired phase transitions and side reactions while preserving the cubic structure. We demonstrate that thermal dehydration leads to a significantly improved cycling stability of over 300 cycles at 15 mA g-1 with coulombic efficiency of >99.9%. In particular, the electrode with the lowest water content exhibited the fastest Na+-ion insertion/extraction as evidenced by the larger CV peak currents during successive scans compared to hydrated samples.

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their high energy density and appropriate operating potential. However, the poor structural stability is a major drawback to their widespread application. To address this issue, B3+ is successfully introduced into the tetrahedral site of Na0.67 Fe0.5 Mn0.5 O2 , demonstrating the effectiveness of small-radius ion doping in improving electrochemical performance. The obtained Na0.67 Fe0.5 Mn0.5 B0.04 O2 exhibits excellent cycling performance with 88.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C and prominent rate performance. The structure-property relationship is constructed subsequently by neutron powder diffraction, in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which reveal that the Jahn-Teller distortion and the consequent P2-P2' phase transformation are effectively mitigated because of the occupancy of B3+ at the interstitial site. Furthermore, it is found that the transition metal layers are stabilized and the transition metal dissolution are suppressed, resulting in excellent cycling performance. Besides, the prominent rate performance is attributed to the enhanced diffusion kinetics associated with the rearrangement of Na+ . This work provides novel insight into the action mechanism of interstitial site doping and demonstrates a universal approach to improve the electrochemical properties of P2-type manganese-based sodium cathode materials.",

Triggering the anionic redox reaction (ARR) can exceed the capacity limitation determined by conventional cationic redox. However, the unstable ARR charge compensation and Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ ions readily result in structural degradation and rapid capacity fade. Here, we report a P2-type Na0.8Li0.2Mn0.7Cu0.1O2 cathode that shows a capacity retention of 84.5% at 200 mA/g after 200 cycles. Combining in situ X-ray diffraction and multi other ex situ characterizations, we reveal that the enhanced cycling stability is ascribed to a slow release of cationic redox activity which can well suppress the Jahn-Teller distortion and favor the ARR reversibility. Furthermore, density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the inhibited interlayer migration and reduced band gap facilitate the stability and kinetic behavior of ARR. These findings provide a perspective for designing high-energy-density cathode materials with ARR activity.",

Additional cost cutbacks are achievable by employing natural materials as active cathode materials for NIBs. In this work, we report the use of natural pyrolusite (β-MnO2) as a precursor for the synthesis of a NaMnO blend (a mixture of layered P2-Na0.67Mn0.85Al0.15O2 without any doping technique combined with a post-spinel NaMn2O4 without any high-pressure synthesis). The synthesized powder was characterized by XRD, evidencing these two phases, along with two additional phases. Tests for Na-ion insertion registered a reversible discharge capacity of 104 mA h/g after 10 cycles with a well-defined plateau at 2.25 V. After 500 cycles at a C/4 current density, a high Coulombic efficiency between 96 and 99% was achieved, with an overall 25% capacity retention loss. These pilot tests are encouraging; they provide economic relief since the natural material is abundant (low-cost). Desirable, energetic assurances and ecological confirmations are obtainable if these materials are implemented in large-scale stationary applications. The synthesis technique does not use any toxic metals or toxic solvents and has limited side product formation.",

        "title": "Enhanced conductivity and stability of Prussian blue cathodes in sodium-ion batteries by surface vapor-phase molecular self-assembly",
        "abstract": "With many merits such as facile synthesis, economy, and relatively high theoretical capacity, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical applications still suffer from a low actual specific capacity and inferior stability owing to the imperfect crystallinity, irreversible phase transition, and low intrinsic conductivity. Herein, a surface-modification technique for vapor-phase molecular self-assembly was developed to prepare Fe-based PBAs, specifically sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (NaFeHCF), with a uniform conductive polymer protective layer of polypyrrole (PPy) on the surface, resulting in NaFeHCF@PPy. The incorporation of a PPy protective layer not only improves the electronic conductivity of NaFeHCF@PPy, but also effectively mitigates the dissolution of Fe-ions during cycling. Specifically, this advanced vapor-phase technique avoids Fe^2+ oxidation and Na^+ loss during liquid-phase surface modification. The NaFeHCF@PPy exhibited a remarkably enhanced cycling performance, with capacity retentions of 85.6% and 69.1% over 500 and 1000 cycles, respectively, at 200 mA/g, along with a superior rate performance up to 5 A/g (fast kinetics). Additionally, by adopting this strategy for Mn-based PBAs (NaMnHCF@PPy), we further demonstrated the universality of this method for PBA cathodes in SIBs.",

        "title": "Surface Engineering through In Situ Construction of CoxB‐Spinel Dual Coating Layers for High‐Voltage Stable Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Transition metal layered oxides (NaxTMO2), boasting a high theoretical specific capacity and affordability, have emerged as prominent cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Their potential, however, is hindered when operating at higher voltage range (4.0–4.3 V) due to irreversible phase transition, heterogeneous surface reconstruction, and side reaction. Herein, using a straightforward room‐temperature liquid‐phase reductive method, a dual conformal protective layer is in situ constructed on the surface of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2(NFM). This layer comprises both a spinel structure and an amorphous CoxB coating, thereby achieving a layered‐spinel‐CoxB configuration. The spinel structure provides 3D Na+ transport channels and works as a pillar to anchor the intrinsic layered structure. Simultaneously, the external CoxB layer effectively mitigates O loss, transition metal ion dissolution, and undesired side reactions on the surface. Benefiting from the synergistic effects on both the material's bulk and surface, the 1wt% CoxB coated cathode displays superior stability. After 300 cycles, the capacity retention is 79.6% between 2 and 4 V, significantly outperforming pristine‐NFM's(p‐NFM) 51.4%. When charged to 4.3 V, its capacity retention stands at 70%, much higher than that of p‐NFM (51.2%). This work provides new insights into exploiting high‐voltage stable cathode through constructing a dual conformal protective layer for high energy density SIBs.",

Then a specific P2/O3 composite is investigated and compared with its monophasic counterparts. A highly reversible structural evolution of P2/O3-P2/O3/P3-P2/P3-P2/Z/O3¢-Z/O3¢ based on the Ni 2+ /Ni 3.5+ , Fe 3+ /Fe 4+ and Mn 3.8+ /Mn 4+ redox couples upon sequential Na extraction/insertion is revealed. The reduced structural strain at the phase boundary alleviates the phase transition and decreases the lattice mismatch during cycling, endowing the biphasic electrode a large reversible capacity of 144 mAh g -1 with the energy density approaching 514 Wh kg -1 .",

However, the highly active free solvent molecules in the liquid electrolyte trigger continuous interfacial side reactions between electrodes and electrolyte, which degrades the cycling performance of SIBs. Herein, a Cu‐based metal‐organic framework (MOF) with a uniform nanoporous channel of 1.1 nm is exploited to confine the electrolyte. Benefiting from the highly‐aggregated solvation configuration, the MOF‐confined electrolyte possesses superior chemical/electrochemical and thermal stability, which guarantees its interface compatibility and flame retardancy. As a result, the batteries with the nano‐confined electrolyte and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode show an ultra‐long lifetime of 3000 cycles with 93% capacity retention and decent high‐temperature performance (600 cycles with 90% capacity retention). This work presents a viable method for fabricating sustainable SIBs and also provides guidance for solving the side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes in electrochemical energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "As a high-capacity, high-voltage, and low-cost cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), Na/Mn-based hexacyanoferrates (NaxMn[Fe(CN)6]1−y·□y·nH2O) typically exhibit poor structural reversibility and interfacial stability during cycling. In this study, we report the in-situ construction of a triphasic intergrowth Na/Mn/Zn-based hexacyanoferrate (mcr-Zn0.2Mn0.8) with concentration-gradient Zn distribution by an anion-controlled fractional precipitation route. Density functional theory calculations verify that the unique heterostructure arises from the different binding energies between cations and anions. A small amount of Zn2+ doping in the inner cubic/monoclinic phases enhances their structural reversibility during cycling by impeding lattice deformation induced by the Jahn–Teller effect of Mn3+. Meanwhile, the rhombohedral Zn-based hexacyanoferrate epitaxially grown on the surface diminishes the particle size of mcr-Zn0.2Mn0.8 resulting in short Na+ diffusion distance, and provides interface protection that suppresses detrimental electrolyte decomposition. Consequently, mcr-Zn0.2Mn0.8 exhibits a high discharge capacity of 121.1 mAh/g at 15 mA g−1, improved cycling stability at 750 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 65.0 % after 2000 cycles, and enhanced rate capability with a discharge capacity of 71.4 mAh/g at 6000 mA g−1. The successful implementation of simultaneous surface and bulk modifications through a one-step reaction opens new possibilities for developing high-performance hexacyanoferrate cathode materials for SIBs.",

Here we develop a robust CEI for O3-type cathode via DME solvent, which enables a long-term stability of full SIBs. The results indicate that unique decomposition process of DME yields favorable organic component (e.g. RCH2ONa) and high content of inorganic components (e.g. NaF and Na2CO3) in the CEI, which is quite different from ester electrolyte, improving Na+ diffusion kinetic and interfacial stability.

Furthermore, the full cell exhibits remarkable cycling performance with a capacity retention of 85 % over 200 cycles.

Here, a strategy to substitute the Fe3+ in NaNi0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25O2 with Al3+ is adopted to address these issues. The substitution of Fe3+ with Al3+ enhances the framework stability and phase transition reversibility of the parent NaNi0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25O2 material by forming a stronger TM-O bond, which improves the cycling stability. Moreover, partial Al3+ substitution increases the interslab distance, providing a spacious path for Na+ diffusion and resulting in fast diffusion kinetics, which lead to improved rate capability. Consequently, the target NaNi0.25Fe0.5-xAlxMn0.25O2 sample with optimal x = 0.045 exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance in a Na-ion cell with a large reversible capacity of 131.7 mA h g-1, a stable retention of approximately 81.6% after cycling at 1C for 100 cycles, and a rate performance of 81.3 mA h g-1 at 10C.

Zinc ions located within the transition metal layers stabilize the surrounding structure, while those at the sodium sites further reduce the electrostatic repulsion of O2−−O2− in the transition metal layer, obstructing the exchange between water molecules and sodium ions.

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) with stable framework structures are ideal cathodes for rechargeable Na-ion batteries (SIBs). The chelating-agent-assisted co-precipitate method is an effective way to obtain low-defect PBAs that can limit the appearance of too many vacancies and water molecules and achieve an optimized Na-storage performance. However, for this method, the mechanism of chelating-agent-assisted synthesis is still unclear. Herein, the synthesis process of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) has been investigated by in-situ infrared spectroscopy detection, with the results showing that the chelating agent oxalate makes the nucleation process slows down and effectively inhibits the formation of the Fe-C≡N-Ni frame in the aging process, producing highly-crystallized and low-defect NiHCF samples. The high-quality NiHCF presents high specific capacity as 86.3 mAh g-1 (the theoretical value ~85 mAh g-1), an ultra-stable cyclic retention of 90% over 800 cycles, and a remarkable high capacity retention as 74.6% at a current density of 4250 mA g-1 (50 C). Particularly, the NiHCF//hard carbon full cell presents high specific energy density over 210 Wh kg-1, and an outstanding cyclic stability without obvious capacity attenuation over 1,000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high-performance sodium-ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence-type superstructure (2a × 3a type supercell) into O3-type layered cathode material Na0.9Li0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3Ti0.3O2 and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4 V. The fence-type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out-of-plane Li migration and in-plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d-spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545 Wh kg-1, a high rate capability (112.8 mAh g-1 at 5C) and a high cycling stability (85.8%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6 mAh g-1 at 1C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5%@200 cycles). This strategy provides a distinct spacing effect of superstructure to design stable high-voltage layered cathode materials for Na-ion batteries.",

Its unique oriented stacking nanosheet constructed hierarchical book-like structure is the origin of the high electrochemical performance, which is able to shorten the diffusion distances of Na+ and electrons, and a certain gap between the nanosheets can also relieve the stress and strain of volume generated during the cycle. In addition, the exposed (100) active crystal facets can provide more channels for the efficient transfer of Na+.

However, inconsistencies caused by cell manufacturing or long-term use can lead to overcharging in some batteries. Overcharging not only poses safety risks but also threatens battery performance. This study investigates the degradation behavior of sodium-ion batteries with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 as the cathode material under different overcharging conditions. Firstly, overcharge induced thermal runaway experiments are performed to determine safe overcharge limit state of charge (SOC) of the battery. Results demonstrate that battery capacity hardly degrades before overcharging to 120 % SOC, while significant capacity degradation is overserved with overcharge exceeding 140 % SOC. In addition, electrochemical characterization methods are used to investigate electrochemical behavior changes of the battery under different overcharging conditions, it is found that with overcharging exceeding 130 % SOC, the electrode will show significant irreversible loss of sodium inventory, conductivity loss and active material loss. Finally, the electrode materials are recovered from the overcharged batteries, and advanced material characterization techniques are used to find that after overcharging more than 120 % SOC, the cathode began to appear particle breakage and structural collapse, the anode began to grow sodium plating.",

It is reported that utilizing both cationic and anionic redox reactions is a promising method for higher energy density cathodes.

Hence, a Li-Mg cosubstituted P2-Na0.67Li0.07Mg0.07Ni0.28Mn0.58O2 material with a honeycomb-ordered superstructure was designed. The Ni3+/Ni4+ redox couple and the anionic redox reaction are proven to have a competitive relationship. Density functional theory calculations reveal the effect of O 2p nonbonding states from Li and prove that Mg-O bonds can stabilize the Ni-O eg states. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and galvanostatic charging/discharging derived dV/dQ, representing resistance changes with time, are obtained to reveal the mechanism of the anionic redox reaction.

More importantly, their capacity degradation mechanism remains to be established. In this paper, we introduce an O3-type Ni-rich AlF3-coated nanorod gradient Na[Ni0.65Co0.08Mn0.27]O2 cathode with enhanced electrochemical performance in both half-cells and full cells. AlF3-coated nanorod gradient Na[Ni0.65Co0.08Mn0.27]O2 particles were synthesized through a combination of dry ball-mill coating and columnar composition gradient design and deliver a discharge capacity of 168 mAh g-1 with 90% capacity retention in half cells (50 cycles) and 132 mAh g-1 with 90% capacity retention in full cells (200 cycles) at 75 mA g-1 (0.5C, 1.5-4.1 V). Through analysis of the cycled electrodes, the capacity-degradation mechanism was unraveled in O3-type Ni-rich Na[Ni xCo yMn z]O2 from a structural perspective with emphasis on high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, providing valuable information on improving O3-type Na[Ni xCo yMn z]O2 cathode performance.",

        "abstract": "Anionic redox is an effective way to increase the capacity of the cathode materials. Na2Mn3O7 [Na4/7[Mn6/7□1/7]O2, □ for the transition metal (TM) vacancies] with native and ordered TM vacancies can conduct a reversible oxygen redox and be a promising high-energy cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its phase transition at low potentials (∼1.5 V vs Na+/Na) induces potential decays. Herein, magnesium (Mg) is doped on the TM vacancies to form a disordered Mn/Mg/□ arrangement in the TM layer. The Mg substitution suppresses the oxygen oxidation at ∼4.2 V by reducing the number of the Na-O-□ configurations. Meanwhile, this flexible disordering structure inhibits the generation of the dissolvable Mn2+ ions and mitigates the phase transition at ∼1.6 V. Therefore, the Mg doping improves the structural stability and its cycling performance in 1.5-4.5 V. The disordering arrangement endows Na0.49Mn0.86Mg0.06□0.08O2 with a higher Na+ diffusivity and improved rate performance. Our study reveals that oxygen oxidation is highly dependent on the ordering/disordering arrangements in the cathode materials. This work provides insights into the balance of anionic and cationic redox for enhancing the structural stability and electrochemical performance in the SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The key to development of high-voltage P2-type Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is the modification methods that can effectively improve its electrochemical reversibility. Herein, a doping-integrated coating strategy based on zinc element is proposed to modify P2-type Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, which can be achieved by a facile one-step solid-state reaction. The formation mechanism of Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2@0.06ZnO (NNZM@0.06ZnO) is investigated, revealing that the spinel and P3 intermediate phases appear prior to the formation of the P2 phase. Ni2+ can be preferentially incorporated into the P2 structure in competition with Zn2+ at high temperature, resulting in a uniform enrichment of ZnO on the surface. A small amount of Zn2+ doping significantly suppresses the Na+/vacancy ordering effect and improves the structural reversibility. Furthermore, the electrolyte decomposition is effectively reduced because of the presence of the ZnO coating layer, leading to the formation of a thin cathode electrolyte interphase film that is favorable to fast Na+ diffusion. In virtue of the Zn2+ doping and in situ formed ZnO coating, NNZM@0.06ZnO exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 83.7% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and rate performance with a discharge capacity of 56.4 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1, which significantly outperforms the uncoated Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 and the Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2/0.06ZnO with the coating layer introduced by mechanical milling.

However, the FePO4 cathode has the problem of low ionic conductivity and electronic conductivity, which limits its application in sodium-ion batteries. The phase composition and microstructure of FePO4 are crucial to ensure the excellent electrochemical properties. Therefore, in this paper, the nano-sized amorphous FePO4·2H2O/C with a particle size of only 50 nm was prepared by ultrasonic-assisted precipitation. The carbon black oxidized can be uniformly dispersed in samples and form a spatial network structure. Four kinds of crystalline cathode materials were successfully prepared by further treatment of FePO4·2H2O/C, including amorphous FePO4/C, hexagonal FePO4/C, monoclinic FePO4·2H2O/C and monoclinic/orthogonal FePO4·2H2O/C. The microstructure, phase composition, particle size distribution and specific surface area of the samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, Raman, and BET. The results show that the amorphous FePO4/C particle size is smaller, and the specific surface area is larger. The electrochemical properties of samples were analyzed by CV and EIS. The results show that the crystal structure affects the specific charge–discharge capacity, Na+ diffusion coefficient, and charge transfer resistance of the materials. The amorphous FePO4/C has excellent electrochemical performance, the specific discharge capacity is 149.8 mA h g−1, the Na+ diffusion coefficient is 2.71 × 10−16 cm2 s−1, and the charge transfer resistance is 139 Ω.

Nondestructive analysis was made through the electrode/electrolyte interface of the first electrochemical cycle to ensure access to information not only on the active material, but also on the passivation layer formed at the electrode surface and referred to as the solid permeable interface (SPI). This investigation clearly shows the role of the SPI and the complexity of the redox reactions. Cobalt, nickel, and manganese are all electrochemically active upon cycling between 4.5 and 2.0 V; all are in the 4+ state at the end of charging. Reduction to Co(3+), Ni(3+), and Mn(3+) occurs upon discharging and, at low potential, there is partial reversible reduction to Co(2+) and Ni(2+). A thin layer of Na2 CO3 and NaF covers the pristine electrode and reversible dissolution/reformation of these compounds is observed during the first cycle. The salt degradation products in the SPI show a dependence on potential. Phosphates mainly form at the end of the charging cycle (4.5 V), whereas fluorophosphates are produced at the end of discharging (2.0 V).",

Hence, sodium citrate is used to compete with [Fe(CN)6]4- to slow down the coordination rates of Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions with ferrous cyanide ions. The feasibility of the experiment is also confirmed by theoretical analysis. Benefiting from stable crystal structure and the removal of interstitial water, the as-prepared Na2NixMnyFe(CN)6 sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g-1. In addition, a high rate performance of 77 mA h g-1 is achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g-1. Most noteworthy, the Coulombic efficiency and specific capacity gradually increase in the first few cycles, which can be ascribed to the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the electrode. Continuous testing in an electrolyte solution of 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in sulfone reveals that the presence of a passivation film is very important for the stability of the electrode.",

Promisingly, the NaCrO2 NWs exhibit extraordinary high-rate capacities of ∼108.8 and ∼87.2 mAh g-1 at 10 and 50 C rates at 25 °C, and even 94.6 (55 °C) and ∼60.1 (-15 °C) mAh g-1 at 10 C, along with outstanding cyclic stabilities with capacity retentions of ∼80.6% (-15 °C), 88.4% (25 °C), and ∼86.9% (55 °C). The overall performance of our NaCrO2 is superior to other reported NaCrO2-based cathodes, even with conductive nanocarbon coating. Encouragingly, a competitive energy density of ∼161 Wh kg-1 can be obtained by the NaCrO2 NWs-based full cell. Therefore, our NaCrO2 NWs can be highly anticipated as advanced cathode for commercial wide-temperature-tolerance SIBs.",

Herein, we report a facile synthesis method for nanosized V2O5/C composite cathodes and their electrochemical performance as well as energy storage mechanism. The composite exhibits a discharge capacity of 255 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.05 C, which surpasses that of previously reported layered oxide materials. Furthermore, the electrode shows good rate capability; discharge capacity of 160 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 C. The reaction mechanism of V2O5 upon sodium insertion/extraction is investigated using ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and synchrotron based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Ex situ XRD result of the fully discharged state reveals the appearance of NaV2O5 as a major phase with minor Na2V2O5 phase. Upon insertion of sodium into the array of parallel ladders of V2O5, it was confirmed that lattice parameter of c is increased by 9.09%, corresponding to the increase in the unit-cell volume of 9.2%. NEXAFS results suggest that the charge compensation during de/sodiation process accompanied by the reversible changes in the oxidation state of vanadium (V(4+) ↔ V(5+)).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large-scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode-electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra-stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM-CS-GMg) cathode material in which a Mg-free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg-hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered-to-rock-salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high-valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode-electrolyte interface. The as-prepared NCM-CS-GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000 cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127 mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "P2-type cathode has received extensive attention due to its faster Na+ diffusion and a high theoretical capacity in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, undesirable phase transformations have induced dramatic capacity decay of SIBs during the cycling process. In this study, heteroatom anchoring through Cu/Mg dual doping is introduced into P2-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode to enhance high-voltage electrochemical reversibility and modulate interfacial Na+ kinetics. The as-prepared Na0.67Ni0.23Mg0.05Cu0.05Mn0.67O2 exhibits an outstanding capacity retention (83.4 % after 2000 cycles at 10 C) and rate performance (73 mAh g−1 at 10 C, accounting for 58.7 % of that at 0.1 C) over the voltage range of 2.5–4.4 V. Intensive explorations further manifest that the modified mechanism of dual-ion doping strategy is attributed to the synergistic coupling effect of a substantial change in Na occupancy distribution and an increase in oxygen vacancy buffer. Thus, the optimized cathode expedites Na+ diffusion and reduces detrimental phase transformation, which favors high-rate performance and long-term cycling stability. This study develops a route to rationally design high-voltage cathode materials for SIBs.",

Large oligomers of organosulfur can be formed during charging, and they are readily blocked by the nanosized ion‐conducting clusters in the Nafion membrane. In addition, large organosulfur monomers can also be blocked. Only 5.4% of TBBT diffuses through the Nafion membrane after 800 h. The Na|TBBT cell sustains 77% of the theoretical capacity after 300 cycles (2420 h). Moreover, the Na|TBBT redox flow cell shows promising rechargeability. Due to the medium molecular size, the organosulfur oligomers are expected to provide a new avenue to develop high‐capacity chalcogen cathodes, besides inorganic S and S‐containing polymers.",

        "abstract": "Room‐temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are potential candidate for sustainable large‐scale energy storage systems due to their high energy density and low cost. However, the shuttling effect of high‐order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 < n ≤ 8) usually leads to rapid capacity fading, while the reaction kinetics of low‐order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 1 ≤ n ≤ 4) are slow. In this work, microporous‐mesoporous carbon derived from mangosteen peels is reported as cathode materials for RT Na–S batteries. The designed micro‐mesoporous structure not only effectively suppresses the shuttling effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS), but also has high electrical conductivity and porosity, which facilitates electron/ion diffusion. Oxygen functional groups on the surface provide high catalytic activity for efficient low‐order NaPS conversion. The obtained Na–S battery exhibits high reversible capacity with excellent long‐term cycle performance (526.1 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 1000 cycles) and outstanding rate performance (676.59 mAh g−1 at 16 A g−1).

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxide cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries have garnered extensive attention for their high theoretical capacity and high initial coulombic efficiency. However, the surface stability of these materials still requires further improvement. In this paper, the effects of different Al_2O_3 coating levels on the properties of NaNi_1/3Fe_1/3Mn_1/3O_2 (NMF) were investigated. An innovative method is proposed to address the problems of dry coating nanomaterial particles that are easily agglomerated and difficult to be dispersed homogeneously, as well as the high cost of wet coating. We dispersed Al_2O_3 in a small amount of ethanol and added an appropriate amount of PVP as a dispersant to form a suspension, which was added to the high-speed rotating NMF reference material powder by spraying, and then heated at high temperature to obtain uniformly coated cathode materials. Our findings reveal that NMF cathodes coated with 0.3 wt.% Al_2O_3 and subjected to thermal treatment at 900°C exhibit higher initial discharge capacity of approximately 145 mAh/g at 0.1C in 2–4 V, with a sustained discharge capacity of nearly 120 mAh/g even at 5C.

However, the practical application of PW is hindered by its poor air stability. The metal-oxide coating has been proven to be an effective way to improve the air stability of electrode materials. Whereas, the target electrode materials conventionally need to be dissolved in the aqueous solution to obtain precursor composites and subsequently calcined at a high temperature during the metal-oxide coating process, which could destroy the phase structure of PW as a result of the sodium leaching into the water and thermal decomposition at the high temperature. In this work, we propose a facile method to construct a ZnO surface layer on PW by utilizing ethanol as a solvent and a mild post-treatment temperature. The ZnO coating layer effectively enhances the air stability of PW and induces the formation of the stable interface on PW. The PW-5 wt % ZnO-E (exposed in 60% humidity air after 30 days) cathode demonstrates a much higher capacity retention (94.1%) at 1 C after 200 cycles than that of PW-E (54%).

Inspired by these structural features, we examined the electrochemical performances versus sodium and showed that Na3FeB5O10 is active at an average potential of 2.5 V vs Na+/Na0, correlated to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple as deduced from ex situ Mössbauer measurements. This contrasts with the case for Na3CoB5O10, which is electrochemically inactive.

In situ X-ray diffraction reveals that the HEO cathode has highly reversible phase transitions and small volume change (ΔV=3.28 %).

Notably, the full-cell battery based on the high-entropy cathode and hard carbon anode delivers a specific capacity of 134.3 mAh g\n                     −1 and an energy density of 390.8 Wh kg−1. This work provides valuable insights into the design of novel high-performance high-entropy cathodes for SIBs, highlighting a promising avenue for advancing rechargeable battery technology.",

        "abstract": "O'3-Na3Ni2SbO6 with a honeycomb cation order, as a potential cathode, presents simplified phase-transition steps and a high average voltage. To mitigate the intrinsic phase irreversibility, Mg, Zn, and Co have been introduced to displace part of the Ni, which inevitably reduces the theoretical capacity related to the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction. In this work, an unusual dual-site substitution is carried out to increase the P'3-O'3 structure reversibility without sacrificing the practical capacity. In addition, it is found that special stacking faults along the c-axis direction can be induced by doping to result in incomplete Sb/Ni disorder, though the honeycomb order remains in every TM (transition-metal) layer. The codoped Na2.85Cs0.15Ni1.9Mg0.1SbO6 has a high degree of disorder, which breaks the ideal monoclinic symmetry (C2/m) and partly upgrades its structure to higher-symmetry models. Profiting from the influence of stacking disorder and doping ions on the coordination environment around Na, more gradual and smaller variations of the lattice parameters appear upon Na-ion extraction/insertion. Consequently, this cathode displays a high initial discharge capacity (120 mAh g-1), long-term cycling stability, and excellent rate performance (66 mAh g-1 under 10 C). These findings reveal that not only a full TM-disordered arrangement but also this incomplete stacking disorder can effectively improve the performance of a layered cathode.",

The cycling performance of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is tested at 0.5 C after pre-activation at 0.1 C. During the electrochemical testing, a kind of side reaction products are found on the surface of the electrode piece.

The protective layers are constructed on the surface of Al foil to effectively avoid the occurrence of side reactions. The prepared half cells have excellent stability and rate performance by the modified current collector. After 100 cycles at 0.5 C, the specific discharge capacity is 106 mA h g−1. The specific discharge capacity at 5 C is 107.2 mA h g−1.

        "abstract": "The application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) requires a suitable cathode material with low cost, nontoxic, high safety, and high energy density, which is still a big challenge; thus, a basic research on exploring new types of materials is imperative. In this work, a manganic pyrophosphate and carbon compound Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2/C has been synthesized through a feasible sol-gel method. Rietveld refinement reveals that Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2 adopts a triclinic structure ( P1̅ space group), which possesses spacious ion diffusion channels for facile sodium migration. The off-stoichiometric phase is able to offer more reversible Na+, delivering an enhanced reversible capacity of 114 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, and because of the strong \"inductive effect\" that (P2O7)4- groups imposing on the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple, Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2/C presents high platforms above 3.6 V, contributing a remarkable energy density of 376 W h kg-1, which is among the highest Fe-/Mn-based polyanion-type cathode materials. Furthermore, the off-stoichiometric compound also presents satisfactory rate capability and long-cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at 5 C. Ex situ X-ray diffraction demonstrates a single-phase reaction mechanism, and the density functional theory calculations display two one-dimensional sodium migration paths with low energy barriers in Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2, which is vital for the facile sodium storage. We believe that this compound will be a competitive cathode material for large-scale SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Fierce phase transformation and limited sodium ion diffusion dynamics are critical obstacles that hinder the practical energy storage applications of P2-type layered sodium transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2). Herein, a synergistic strategy of electronic state tailoring and pillar effect was carefully implemented by substituting divalent Mg2+ into Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material with unique oriented hollow rodlike structures. Mg2+substitution can not only facilitate the anionic oxygen redox reactions and electronic conductivity through increasing the electronic states at Femi energy but also act as pillars within TMO2 layers to alleviate the severe phase transformation to improve structure stability. Moreover, the oriented hollow structure incorporating sufficient buffer spaces and rationally exposed electrochemically active facets effectively alleviates the stresses induced by low volume changes of 8% and provides more open channels for Na+ ion diffusion without crossing multiple grain boundaries. Hence, the Na0.67Mg0.08Ni0.25Mn0.67O2 cathode showed a superior rate capability with high energy density and cycling stability for sodium-ion storage. The underlying mechanisms of these achievements were deciphered through diversified dynamic analysis and the first principle calculations, providing new insights into P2-type NaxTMO2 cathodes for the infinite prospect as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries.",

However, the issues of intrinsic poor electronic conductivity and difficult high-purity preparation may impede its practical application. Herein, the pivotal role of Cu doping in strengthening the polyanion structure and improving its electrochemical properties is comprehensively investigated. It is found that trace Cu doping not only expands the lattice volume of NFPP but also suppresses the formation of the inactive NaFePO4 impurity phase. In addition, Cu doping can effectively reduce the structural variations of NFPP during sodiation/desodiation processes (2.02%) while decreasing the band gap and lowering the ion mobility energy barrier (from 0.46 to 0.426 eV). Consequently, the Cu-doped NFPP electrode exhibits superior rate capability and long-term cycling performance. The computational simulations reveal a strong electronic interaction between Fe and Cu that tunes the electron localization and distribution, and additional Na+ transport channels can be created in NFPP by distorting the [PO4] units adjacent to the doping site, which provides a reference to enhance the performance of NFPP and reveals the great application potential of NFPP materials.",

        "abstract": "Rapid capacity fading and structural collapse, along with other deep‐rooted challenges in the high‐voltage region, are insufficient to meet the requirements for commercial applications of O3‐type layered cathodes. Hereby, rare earth metal (RE) within the IIIB group are utilized as the robust dopants for O3‐NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) to achieve the purpose of reconstructing the crystal lattice and regulating the interlayer structure. The inactive RE3+ acts as a pillar, reinforces the TMO6 octahedron, and broadens the Na+ diffusion layer in the configuration of O‐Na‐O‐TM (RE)‐O‐Na‐O, giving rise to the enhanced crystal stability and accelerating the transmission of sodium ions. More impressively, the scandium incorporation is working as a “vitamin” that improves Ni/Fe redox reversibility, alleviating the irreversible P3‐O3’‐P3’ phase transformation and further restraining the disordered Fe migration into the neighboring Na layer, which is firmly validated by in situ X‐ray diffraction coupled with the synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. Consequently, the as‐designed NFM‐Sc exhibits impressive rate capability (82.5 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and excellent cycle stability with 80.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles at the high voltage of 4.2 V. Given this, the elaborate work may shed new insight into the operational mechanism of rare metal through strategically regulating the structure for sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The Mn-based polyanion compound Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) with a Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structure has attracted incremental attention as a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, the occupation of Mn2+ on Na+ vacancies usually leads to severe voltage hysteresis, which in turn results in significant capacity loss, slow Na+ diffusion kinetics, and poor cycling stability. Herein, anion-substituted compounds Na3MnTi(PO4)3-x(SiO4)x (x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) are synthesized. It reveals that the SiO44- substitution could induce partial oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+, and the latter has a lower occupancy preference on Na+ vacancies. By the proposed charge compensation strategy, the Mn2+ occupation on Na+ vacancies can be significantly suppressed. As a result, the voltage hysteresis is substantially inhibited, and greatly improved electrochemical performance is achieved. This study offers an alternative strategy to address the voltage hysteresis associated with NMTP and other Mn-based NASICON cathode materials.",

Herein, the key role of electronegativity‐difference configuration on the activation of OAR is find out, and further tune electronegativity‐difference configuration with La incorporation to construct non‐bonded O 2p orbitals and achieve the reversible anionic redox in O3‐type NaMn1/3Fe1/3Ni1/3O2. Owing to the special extranuclear electronic structure of La3+ [Xe], the La electron cloud is difficult to be disturbed by the O electron cloud, and some O electrons do not participate in the formation of ionic bonds, thus retaining the non‐bonded electrons of O 2p and activating OAR. Moreover, La3+ doping also decreases the Coulomb force between Na+ and O2− favoring Na+ migration as well as strengthening the La─O bonds inhibiting the irreversible phase transition. La2O3 coating layer also plays a role on inhibiting the reaction between molecular oxygen and the electrolyte, and making OAR reversible. After modification, the cycling stability is significantly improved (86.9% vs 27.3%@2C@200cycles; 90.8% vs 52.9%@5C@300 cycles).

The high temperature performance of bare PBM was very poor the capacity retention was only 35.7% after 40 cycles due to serious Mn/Fe dissolution which caused structural deterioration of PBM. NVOPF coating protected the PBM from suffering corrosion in the electrolyte thus ensured the framework stability of PBM during long term cycling and contributed to the excellent electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "O3-Type layered oxides are widely studied as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities. However, their rate capability and durability are limited by tortuous Na+ diffusion channels and complicated phase evolution during Na+ extraction/insertion. Here we report our findings in unravelling the mechanism for dramatically enhancing the stability and rate capability of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5-xSbxO2 (NaNMS) by substitutional Sb doping, which can alter the coordination environment and chemical bonds of the transition metal (TM) ions in the structure, resulting in a more stable structure with wider Na+ transport channels. Furthermore, NaNMS nanoparticles are obtained by surface energy regulation during grain growth. The synergistic effect of Sb doping and nanostructuring greatly reduces the ionic migration energy barrier while increasing the reversibility of the structural evolution during repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. An optimized NaNMS-1 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 212.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and 74.5 mAh g-1 at 50 C with minimal capacity loss after 100 cycles at a low temperature of -20 °C. Such electrochemical performance is superior to most of the reported layered oxide cathodes used in rechargeable SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium based sodium superionic conductors (NASICON) have attracted unpreceded attention owing to their high structural stability and excellent Na+ ion diffusion. However, Na4VM(PO4)3 suffer from low‐rate capability and capacity decay at high voltage (≈4.0 V) due to low electronic conductivity and irreversible phase transition of V4+/V5+. Herein, a high entropy Na4VFe0.6Mn0.2Cr0.1(CoMgAl)0.1(PO4)3 (NVFP‐HE) NASICON material is designed, which allows the intrinsic effect of multi‐metal to achieve the excellent rate capability at high voltage, good ionic as well as electronic conductivity. This NVFP‐HE cathode not only delivers a high discharge capacity of 141.98 mAh g−1 at 1C, but also presents an exceptional capacity of 85.77 mAh g−1 at as high as 50C current rate. Additionally, NVFP‐HE can also retain 66.7% of initial capacity after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles at 50C. It is important to highlight that the high entropy mitigates the performance decay that arises from the irreversible phase change at 4 V. Interestingly, NVFP‐HE//HC full cell delivers 81 mAh g−1 at 0.2C. This high entropy effect and its proof of concept can allow to look for unique combinations and rationally designed advanced cathode materials for wide applications.",

Now, the long- and short-range structural evolution of Na2 FePO4 F during cycling is studied by in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and first-principles DFT calculations. DFT calculations suggest that the intermediate phase, Na1.5 FePO4 F, adopts the space group of P21 /c, which is a subgroup (P21 /b11, No. 14) of Pbcn (No. 60), the space group of the starting phase, Na2 FePO4 F, and this space group provides a good fit to the experimental XRD and NMR results. The two crystallographically unique Na sites in the structure of Na2 FePO4 F behave differently during cycling, where the Na ions on the Na2 site are electrochemically active while those on the Na1 site are inert.

        "abstract": "As global energy storage demand increases, sodium‐ion batteries are often considered as an alternative to lithium‐ion batteries. Hexacyanoferrate cathodes, commonly referred to as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), are of particular interest due their low‐cost synthesis and promising electrochemical response. However, because they consist of ~50 wt% cyanide anions, a possible release of highly toxic cyanide gases poses a significant safety risk. Previously, we observed the evolution of (CN)2 during cycling via differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), but were unable to determine a root cause or mechanism. In this work, we present a systematical investigation of the gas evolution of Prussian white (PW) with different water content via DEMS. While H2 is the main gas detected, especially in hydrated PW and during overcharge (4.6 V vs. Na+/Na), the evolution of CO2 and (CN)2 depends on the electrolyte conductive salt. The use of oxidative NaClO4 instead of NaPF6 is the leading cause for the formation of (CN)2. Mass spectrometric evidence of trace amounts of HCN is also found, but to a much lower extent than (CN)2, which is the dominant safety risk when using NaClO4‐containing electrolyte. Despite being a good model salt, it is not a viable option for commercial applications.",

Construction of chemical bonding is a highly effective way to solve interface problems. Herein, NVPOF with interfacial V-F-C bonding (CB-NVPOF) is developed.

Furthermore, it shows impressive electrochemical performance at temperatures as low as -40 °C, delivering a capacity of 56 mA h g-1 at 10C and a capacity retention of ∼80% after 500 cycles at 2C. The interfacial V-F-C bond engineering significantly advances the electronic conductivity, Na+ diffusion, as well as interface compatibility at -40 °C.

The commonly used inactive-element-doped strategies can effectively trigger the O redox activity in several layered cathode materials. However, the anionic redox reaction process is usually accompanied by unfavorable structural changes, large voltage hysteresis, and irreversible O2 loss, which hinders its practical application to a large extent. In the present work, we take the doping of Li elements into Mn-based oxide as an example and reveal the local charge trap around the Li dopant will severely impede O charge transfer upon cycling. To overcome this obstacle, additional Zn2+ codoping is introduced into the system. Theoretical and experimental studies show that Zn2+ doping can effectively release the charge around Li+ and homogeneously distribute it on Mn and O atoms, thus reducing the overoxidation of O and improving the stability of the structure. Furthermore, this change in the microstructure makes the phase transition more reversible. This study aimed to provide a theoretical framework for further improve the electrochemical performance of similar anionic redox systems and provide insights into the activation mechanism of the anionic redox reaction.",

        "abstract": "Ni/Mn-based oxide cathode materials have drawn great attention due to their high discharge voltage and large capacity, but structural instability at high potential causes rapid capacity decay. How to moderate the capacity loss while maintaining the advantages of high discharge voltage remains challenging. Herein, the replacement of Mn ions by Ga ions is proposed in the P2-Na2/3 Ni0.2 Mn0.8 O2 cathode for improving their cycling performances without sacrificing the high discharge voltage. With the introduction of Ga ions, the relative movement between the transition metal ions is restricted and more Na ions are retained in the lattice at high voltage, leading to an enhanced redox activity of Ni ions, validated by ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Additionally, the P2-O2 phase transition is replaced by a P2-OP4 phase transition with a smaller volume change, reducing the lattice strain in the c-axis direction, as detected by operando/ex situ X-ray diffraction. Consequently, the Na2/3 Ni0.21 Mn0.74 Ga0.05 O2 electrode exhibits a high discharge voltage close to that of the undoped materials, while increasing voltage retention from 79% to 93% after 50 cycles.

        "abstract": "With the increasing demand for clean energy sources, the need for large-scale energy storage systems to ensure the stable output of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, has also increased. Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a potential solution for these storage systems owing to their high energy density, abundance in the Earth's crust, and low cost. However, the larger atomic radius of sodium ions results in higher energy barriers for ion migration in cathode materials, which can affect the cycle life and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, developing a suitable structure that facilitates rapid sodiation and desodiation and maintains good cycling stability remains a significant challenge. This study aimed to reduce the content of trivalent manganese ions and minimize the impact of the Jahn-Teller effect to enhance the capacity retention of manganese-based layered oxides. Additionally, a series of P2-type Na0.78Li0.1ZnxNi0.15-xMn0.75O2 compounds were successfully synthesized through doping with divalent zinc ions. Structural analyses of the doped material indicated that Zn doping did not alter the crystal structure but increased the interlayer distance of the transition metals. Electrochemical performance tests revealed that appropriate Zn2+ doping promoted sodium-ion diffusion and improved the reversible capacity of the battery.

However, due to the orbital properties of Mn3+, the Jahn-Teller effect occurs frequently during the electrode reaction, leading to irreversible phase transition of the structure with capacity degradation. Here, we mitigated this critical issue by a theory-guided synthesis of aluminium-doped manganese-based NASICON-type phosphate cathode Na4MnAl(PO4)3. Using density functional theory, we have predicted its electrode properties, including the phase stability, voltage plateau and ionic diffusion properties, which results supported favor physicochemical properties and fast kinetics behavior. Moreover, Na4MnAl(PO4)3 exhibited structural stability and small volume change (6.2 %) during theoretical cycling process, and the detrimental Jahn-Teller effect was effectively suppressed analyzed by Bader charge. With two effective redox pairs, i.e., Mn4+/Mn3+ (4.1 V) and Mn3+/Mn2+ (3.6 V), Na4MnAl(PO4)3 achieved a capacity retention of 85.08 % after 500 cycles at 5C. Moreover, this cathode was well compatible to hard carbon and achieved 81.8 % capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C. This work suggests its high energy density and excellent cycling stability, which provides a critical reference from theoretical design to experimental study for the manganese-based phosphate cathode for high-performance SIBs.",

Nevertheless, the conventionally prepared PBAs inevitably suffer from inferior crystallinity and lattice defects, leading to low specific capacity, poor rate capability, and unsatisfied long-term stability. As the Na+ migration within PBAs is directly dependent on the periodic lattice arrangement, it is of essential significance to improve the crystallinity of PBAs and hence ensure long-range lattice periodicity. Herein, a chemical inhibition strategy is developed to prepare a highly crystallized Prussian blue (Na2Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3), which displays an outstanding rate performance (78 mAh g-1 at 100 C) and long life-span properties (62% capacity retention after 2000 cycles) in sodium storage. Experimental results and kinetic analyses demonstrate the efficient electron transfer and smooth ion diffusion within the bulk phase of highly crystallized Prussian blue. Moreover, in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ Raman spectroscopy results demonstrate the robust crystalline framework and reversible phase transformation between cubic and rhombohedral within the charge-discharge process. This research provides an innovative way to optimize PBAs for advanced rechargeable batteries from the perspective of crystallinity.",

        "abstract": "There is growing interest in 2D conjugated metal–organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) for batteries due to their reversible redox chemistry. Nevertheless, currently reported 2D c-MOFs based on n-type ligands are mostly focused on the storage of cations for batteries. Herein, we successfully synthesize nitrogen-rich and electron-deficient p-type ligand-based Ni3(HATQ)2 assembled from 2,3,7,8,12,13-hexaaminotricycloquinazoline (HATQ), and the ion co-storage feature of cations and anions in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is demonstrated for 2D c-MOFs for the first time. The redox chemistry from the p-type ligand and π–d hybridization center endows the Ni3(HATQ)2 cathode with high capacity and good rate performance, especially excellent capacity retention of 95% after 1000 cycles. These findings provide a promising avenue for the exploration of other p-type multidentate chelating ligands toward new 2D c-MOFs and expand the application of 2D c-MOFs in energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are commonly used as the cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries due to their low cost and easy manufacturing. However, the application is hindered by poor rate performance and complex phase transitions. To address these challenges, a new seven-component high-entropy layered oxide cathode material, O3-NaNi0.25Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.1Sn0.05Co0.05Li0.1O2 (HEO) has been developed. The entropy stabilization effect plays a crucial role in improving the performance of electrochemical systems and the stability of structures. The HEO exhibits a specific discharge capacity of 154.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and 94.5 mA h g-1 at 7 C. In-situ and ex-situ XRD results demonstrate that the HEO effectively retards complex phase transitions. This work provides a high-entropy design for the storage materials with a high energy density. Meanwhile, it eliminates industry doubts about the performance of sodium ion layered oxide cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Residual alkali is one of the biggest challenges for the commercialization of sodium-based layered transition metal oxide cathode materials since it can even inevitably appear during the production process. Herein, taking O3-type Na0.9Ni0.25Mn0.4Fe0.2Mg0.1Ti0.05O2 as an example, an active strategy is proposed to reduce residual alkali by slowing the cooling rate, which can be achieved in one-step preparation method. It is suggested that slow cooling can significantly enhance the internal uniformity of the material, facilitating the reintegration of Na+ into the bulk material during the calcination cooling phase, therefore substantially reducing residual alkali. The strategy can remarkably suppress the slurry gelation and gas evolution and enhance the structural stability. Compared to naturally cooled cathode materials, the capacity retention of the slowly cooled electrode material increases from 76.2% to 85.7% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This work offers a versatile approach to the development of advanced cathode materials toward practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Architecting Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes with optimized synergistic bimetallic reaction centers is a paradigmatic strategy for devising high-energy sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, these cathodes usually suffer from fast capacity fading and sluggish reaction kinetics. To alleviate the above problems, herein, a series of early transition metal (ETM)-late transition metal (LTM)-based PBA (Fe-VO, Fe-TiO, Fe-ZrO, Co-VO, and Fe-Co-VO) cathode materials have been conveniently fabricated via an \"acid-assisted synthesis\" strategy. As a paradigm, the FeVO-PBA (FV) delivers a superb rate capability (148.9 and 56.1 mAh/g under 0.5 and 100 C, respectively), remarkable cycling stability over 30,000 cycles, high energy density (259.7 Wh/kg for the full cell), and a wide operation-temperature range (-60-80 °C). In situ/ex situ techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal the quasi-zero-strain and multielectron redox mechanisms of the FeVO-PBA cathode during cycling, supporting its higher specific capacity and stable cycling. It is considered that the d-d electron compensation effect between Fe and V enhanced the reversibility and kinetics of redox reactions and simultaneously improved the electronic conductivity and structural stability of the FeVO-PBA cathode. This work may pave a new way for the rational design of high-performance cathode materials with bimetallic reaction centers for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The iron-based fluorophosphate Na2FePO4F (NFPF) is considered as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries due to the low-cost, non-toxicity and appropriate working voltage. However, the inferior intrinsic electronic conductivity and the restrained active Na sites bring the limits for full realization of electrochemical properties. Herein, Mg2+ with d\n                     0 orbital was introduced in FeO4F2 structure, aimed at activating the Na+ at Na1 site and enhancing the electronic conductivity. Different from the 3d transition metal (TM) elements that form 3d-O2p orbital interactions in the FeO4F2 structure, the Mg with d° contributes p and s orbitals mainly in Mg-O bonds, which corresponds to more stable orbital interaction and lattice structure. The electron distribution of bridge O due to the Mg-doping leads to the wooden barrel effect near the Mg site, thus activating Na+ at Na1 site by lowering the energy barrier of Na+ migration from Na1 to Na2 site. Hence, the obtained NFMPF electrode delivers high specific capacity (121.4 vs. 108.7 mAh g\n                     −1 at 0.1 C) and better cycling stability (73.8% vs. 54.2 % after 1000 cycles at 20 C). Overall, regulating the electronic structure and activating Na+ at inactive site is the key to break the bottleneck of low activity, which can be an effective strategy to design cathode materials with excellent electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low-cost and high-capacity cathodes for Na-ion batteries. However, they usually form P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn-rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn-rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ~220 mAh/g. It delivers ~160 mAh/g specific capacity between 2-3.8V with >86% retention over 250 cycles. Systematic characterizations and computational studies revealed that the TM and oxygen vacancies pre-formed in the sodiated material enables a \"reversible\" migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de-sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3-P3 phase transition, hence stabilizing the structure and battery performance. This work provides a critical insight on the role of vacancies in TM migration and stabilization of phase transition, and sheds light on the future development of high performance and stable cathode materials for Na-ion batteries and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Though considerable Mg-doped layered cathodes have been exploited, some new differences relative to previous reports can be concluded by doping a heavy dose of Mg via two rational strategies. Unlike the common unit cell of the P63/mmc group by X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction reveals a large supercell of the P63 group and enhanced ordering for Na11/18Mg1/18[Ni1/4Mg1/9Mn11/18]O2 with Mg occupying both the Na and Mn sites. Compared with only one obvious voltage plateau of Na0.5[Ni0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NNM), Na11/18Mg1/18[Ni1/4Mg1/9Mn11/18]O2 (NMNMM) shows more severe voltage plateaus but with excellent electrochemical performance. Na0.5[Mg0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NMM) with Mg only occupying the Ni site displays a highly reversible whole-voltage-range oxygen redox chemistry and smooth voltage curves without any voltage hysteresis. Cationic Ni2+/Ni4+ couples are responsible for the charge compensations of NNM and NMNMM, while only the oxygen anionic reaction accounts for the capacity of NMM between 2.5 and 4.3 V. Interestingly, the Mn3+/Mn4+ pair contributes all capacity for all cathodes between 1.5 and 2.5 V. All cathodes undergo a double-phase mechanism: an irreversible P2-O2 phase transition for NNM, an enhanced reversible P2-O2 phase transition for NMNMM, and a highly reversible P2-OP4 phase transition for NMM. In addition, the designed cathodes display excellent rate capability and long-term cycling stability but with a large difference in the various voltage ranges of 2.5-4.3 and 1.5-2.5 V, respectively. This work provides a good understanding of ion doping and some new insights into exploiting high-performance materials.",

In this study, iron element is used to replace part of vanadium in Na3V2(PO4)3 to reduce its expense, and pine pollen is applied for the first time as a very effective carbon source to improve the performance of Na4FeV(PO4)3. The fabricated composite material achieves a capacity of 105 mA h g−1 under 0.2 C and fascinating cycling stability over 94 % under 2 C for 500 cycles and 98 % under 10 C for 1000 cycles. The excellent cycle performance is caused by the involvement of pine pollen that acts as a carbon matrix to enhance the electron conductivity and block the agglomeration of active material effectively, thus the well-dispersed nano sized Na4FeV(PO4)3 shortens the diffusion path of sodium ion and gains a remarkable rate capability. Moreover, the distinguished reversibility during the charge and discharge procedures is ascribed also to the robust structure of Na4FeV(PO4)3. This work provides an efficient route to realize the economic cathode material of SIBs with good performance.",

X-ray photoelectron spectra, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra show that the P2-structure and the oxidation state of cobalt and manganese of the pristine oxide are not affected by CeO2 surface modification, and a small amount of Ce4+ ions have been reduced to Ce3+ ions, and a few Ce ions have entered the crystal lattice of the P2-oxide surface during modification with CeO2. In a voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at a current density of 20 mA g−1, 2.00 wt% CeO2-modified Na0.67Co0.25Mn0.75O2 delivers a maximum discharge capacity of 135.93 mA h g−1, and the capacity retentions are 91.96% and 83.38% after 50 and 100 cycles, respectively. However, the pristine oxide presents a low discharge capacity of 116.14 mA h g−1, and very low retentions of 39.83% and 25.96% after 50 and 100 cycles, respectively.

        "abstract": "NASICON‐type cathode with remarkable ionic conductivity is perspective candidate for fast‐charging sodium‐ion battery. However, severely restricted by low electrical conductivity and poor interfacial kinetics, it usually delivers poor charge transfer kinetics. Different from traditional carbon compositing with high carbon contents, herein, a trace carbon incorporation tactic is proposed based on a typical NASICON‐structured Na3V2(PO4)3. First, particle‐growth process of Na3V2(PO4)3 is regulated via incorporating carbon dot, significantly reducing its particle size to shorten charge diffusion path. Second, electrical conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 is improved without sacrificing its high electrochemical activity due to the incorporated trace carbon content (0.76 wt.%). Third, Na3V2(PO4)3‐electrolyte interface structure is optimized by abundant functional groups from the incorporated carbon dot, enabling a thin and stable NaF‐rich CEI layer to boost interface kinetics. As a result, carbon dot endows Na3V2(PO4)3 with ultrastable cyclability up to 20 k cycles (capacity retention of 98.4%) and excellent rate capability (up to 200 C) in half cell, as well as high energy density (368.7 Wh kg−1) and fast charging property (≈110.2 s per charging with 250.8 Wh kg−1 input) in full cell.

        "abstract": "Biochemistry-directed synthesis of functional nanomaterials has attracted great interest in energy storage, catalysis and other applications. The unique ability of biological systems to guide molecule self-assembling facilitates the construction of distinctive architectures with desirable physicochemical characteristics. Herein, we report a biochemistry-directed \"bottom-up\" approach to construct hollow porous microspheres of polyanion materials for sodium ion batteries. Two kinds of polyanions, i.e. Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2, are employed as cases in this study. The microalgae cell realizes the formation of a spherical \"bottom\" bio-precursor. Its tiny core is subjected to destruction and its tough shell tends to carbonize upon calcination, resulting in the hollow porous microspheres for the \"top\" product. The nanoscale crystals of the polyanion materials are tightly enwrapped by the highly-conductive framework in the hollow microsphere, resulting in the hierarchical nano-microstructure. The whole formation process is disclosed as a \"bottom-up\" mechanism. Moreover, the biochemistry-directed self-assembly process is confirmed to play a crucial role in the construction of the final architecture. Taking advantage of the well-defined hollow-microsphere architecture, the abundant interior voids and the highly-conductive framework, polyanion materials show favourable sodium-intercalation kinetics. Both materials are capable of high-rate long-term cycling. After five hundred cycles at 20 C and 10 C, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na(3.12)Fe2.44(P2O7)2 retain 96.2% and 93.1% of the initial capacity, respectively. Therefore, the biochemistry-directed technique provides a low-cost, highly-efficient and widely applicable strategy to produce high-performance polyanion-based cathodes for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Polymer cathode materials are promising alternatives to inorganic counterparts for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, adjustable molecular structure, and strong adaptability to different counterions in batteries, etc. However, they suffer from poor practical capacity and low rate capability because of their intrinsically poor conductivity. Herein, we report the synthesis of self-assembled graphene/poly(anthraquinonyl sufide) (PAQS) composite aerogel (GPA) with efficient integration of a three-dimensional (3D) graphene framework with electroactive PAQS particles via a novel dispersion-assembly strategy which can be used as a free-standing flexible cathode upon mechanical pressing. The entire GPA cathode can deliver the highest capacity of 156 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 225 mAh g-1) with an ultrahigh utilization (94.9%) of PAQS and exhibits an excellent rate performance with 102 mAh g-1 at 20 C in LIBs. Furthermore, the flexible GPA film was also tested as cathode for SIBs and demonstrated a high-rate capability with 72 mAh g-1 at 5 C and an ultralong cycling stability (71.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C) which has rarely been achieved before. Such excellent electrochemical performance of GPA as cathode for both LIBs and SIBs could be ascribed to the fast redox kinetics and electron transportation within GPA, resulting from the interconnected conductive framework of graphene and the intimate interaction between graphene and PAQS through an efficient wrapping structure. This approach opens a universal way to develop cathode materials for powerful batteries with different metal-based counter electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Traditional polycrystalline P2 layered oxides face challenges such as irreversible phase transitions, poor air stability, and structural distortion, which negatively impact their electrochemical performance. In this study, a single-crystal material, P2-Na2/3Ni1/4Mn2/3Mg1/12O2 (SC-NMM), was synthesized using co-precipitation coupled with the molten salt method. Owing to the strong integrity and high thermal stability of the main (001) planes of the large-sized single crystal, SC-NMM exhibits a high reversible specific capacity (173.5 mAh/g at 20 mA/g) and stable cycle performance (93.38% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA/g) at high voltage. Additionally, the Na-ion full cell constructed with the SC-NMM cathode and hard carbon anode demonstrates a cathode energy density of 397.4 Wh/kg. The excellent electrochemical performance of SC-NMM originates from the reversible anion redox and single-phase solid solution reaction mechanism. This work provides a reference for synthesizing single-crystal layered transition metal oxides with high electrochemical performance by eliminating irreversible phase transitions through crystal orientation modulation.",

        "title": "Insights into unrevealing the effects of the monovalent cation substituted tunnel-type cathode for high-performance sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Tunnel-type Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) has attracted extensive concern as a prospective cathode for sodium-ion batteries due to the advantages of facile synthesis and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, the low capacity, unsatisfactory rate performance, and sluggish kinetics of NMO impede its further development for commercial application. Herein, a series of Li-substituted Na0.44Mn1-xLixO2 samples are synthesized to address the abovementioned issues. Results demonstrate that Li substitution can not only stabilize the crystal structure but also facilitate the Na+ diffusion behavior during the charging/discharging process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Li introduction can effectively strengthen the metallicity of NMO, which is conducive to electron transferability. Accordingly, the optimized Na0.44Mn0.94Li0.06O2 (NMOL0.06) can exhibit an improved reversible capacity of 106.1mAh g−1 at 5C, accompanying extraordinary cycling durability with 80.6 % capacity retention after 700 cycles at 10C. More importantly, the full cell combined with the NMOL0.06 cathode and the commercial hard carbon anode displays a high energy density of 257.2Wh kg−1, and superior capacity retention of 83.6 % after 300 cycles at 1C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications. This work not only provides some insights into the influence of Li substitution on tunnel-type materials but also elucidates the construction of ultra-stable and high-performance cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The development of solid‐state sodium‐ion batteries (SSSBs) heavily hinges on the development of an superionic Na+ conductor (SSC) that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. The construction of heterogeneous structures offers a promising approach to comprehensively enhancing these properties in a way that differs from traditional structural optimization. Here, this work exploits the structural variance between high‐ and low‐coordination halide frameworks to develop a new class of halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes (HSEs). The halide HSEs incorporating a UCl3‐type high‐coordination framework and amorphous low‐coordination phase achieves the highest Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm−1 at room temperature, RT) among halide SSCs so far. By discerning the individual contribution of the crystalline bulk, amorphous region, and interface, this work unravels the synergistic ion conduction within halide HSEs and provides a comprehensive explanation of the amorphization effect. More importantly, the excellent deformability, high‐voltage stability, and expandability of HSEs enable effective SSSB integration. Using a cold‐pressed cathode electrode composite of uncoated Na0.85Mn0.5Ni0.4Fe0.1O2 and HSEs, the SSSBs present stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 91.0% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.",

        "abstract": "Iron-based Prussian blue (FeHCF) has great application potential in the large-scale production of sodium-ion (Na+) batteries because of its high theoretical capacity and abundant Fe ore resources. However, the Fe(CN)6 vacancies and crystal water seriously affect the electrochemical performance. Herein, a Cu-doped FeHCF (Cu-FeHCF) cathode material is successfully prepared directly by a coprecipitation method. After Cu doping, the monoclinic structure and the quasi-cubic morphology are retained, but the electrochemical performance is significantly improved. In addition to few Fe(CN)6 vacancies and low crystal water, the improved performance is also related to the enhanced electrochemical activity of low-spin Fe and the stabilizing effect of Cu on the crystal structure. Moreover, Cu doping also controls the side reaction to a certain extent. As a result, after Cu doping, the initial discharge capacity is enhanced from 107.9 to 127.4 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, especially the capacities contributed by low-spin Fe increase from 30.0, 21.7, and 16.7 mA h g-1 to 48.8, 45.4, and 43.7 mA h g-1 for the first three cycles, respectively. Even at 2 A g-1, Cu-FeHCF still has a promising initial capacity of 82.3 mA h g-1 and only a 0.047% capacity decay rate for each cycle over 500 cycles. Therefore, Cu-FeHCF shows excellent application potential in the field of Na+ energy storage batteries.",

On the basis of a comprehensive comparison with the Cu-free material, both the over-oxidation of O2- to trapped molecular O2 and Mn-related Jahn-Teller distortion have been effectively inhibited by restraining both the oxygen activity and participation of Mn4+/Mn3+ redox activity. Not limited to discovering stable cycling behavior at high voltages after Cu substitution, our findings also highlight an effective strategy to stabilize the anionic redox activity and elucidate the stabilization mechanism of Cu substitution, thus paving the way for further improvement of layered oxide cathode materials for high-energy Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "A detailed study of the intercalation/de‐intercalation mechanisms of PF6‐ anions in a graphite cathode of sodium dual‐ion batteries is carried out by cyclic voltammetry. The influence of the continuous anion intercalation/de‐intercalation on the graphite structure is investigated by ex‐situ XRD after cycling. It was concluded that the intercalation/de‐intercalation occurs through a combination of diffusion‐controlled and pseudocapacitive mechanisms. Initially, the contribution of the diffusion‐controlled is significant, specifically at the highest voltage and at the lowest scan rates which agrees with the slow kinetic of this mechanism and its usual prevalence in carbon materials with a graphitic structure. However, the continuous anion intercalation/de‐intercalation causes some deterioration of the graphite structural order, even from the initial cycles, as it was demonstrated by the evolution of the crystalline parameters, interlayer spacing, d002, and crystallite size, Lc. This deterioration hinders the diffusion‐controlled anion intercalation/de‐intercalation and, as a consequence, the pseudocapacitive becomes the main mechanism along cycling. Therefore, since graphite is capable of intercalating PF6‐ anions at high voltages through a capacitive mechanism, with its consequent rapid kinetics, this carbon material is an excellent candidate for using as cathode in high power sodium dual‐ion batteries, in which, kinetically fast mechanisms are required.",

Herein, a selective replacement of O elements in PO4 group by Cl anions in the NMCP system was developed to significantly enhance its electrochemical performance. The results affirm that the enhanced performance of Cl doped samples can be attributed to the enlargement of cell size, the creation of Na vacancies and the weakness of Na2O bond after Cl doping.

        "abstract": "All-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) are attractive alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage due to their high safety and ubiquitous distribution of Na sources. A critical component for ASSSB is sodium-ion conducting solid-state electrolyte (SSE). Here, we report a high-performance sodium-ion SSE with the recently developed bulk interfacial superionic conductor (BISC) concept. The ionic conductivity and areal conductance of the Na+ BISC at 25 °C reaches 6.5 × 10-4 S cm-1 and 260 mS cm-2, respectively. Using NaxCo0.7Mn0.3O2 (x ≈ 1.0, NaCMO) as the cathode active material, all-solid-state Na||NaCMO batteries exhibiting small overpotential and ∼180 cycle life are demonstrated under room temperature. This approach may also be used to prepare other metal ion, such as Mg2+, Al3+, and K+, based all-solid-state batteries.",

        "abstract": "O3-type cathodes hold considerable promise in achieving rapid commercialization due to high energy density. However, severe structural/interfacial deterioration, along with kinetic hindrance, typically resulting in rapid capacity fading and serious safety risk at elevated cut-off voltages. Herein, inspired from solubility limitation of hetero-elements, synchronous surface-to-bulk multifunctionally full-scale modified O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is proposed to maintain its state of health (SOH). The perovskite-type CaZrO3 protective layer in-situ formed on the surface of primary particles, helps to construct a stable cathode-electrolyte-interphase architecture, mitigate the unexpected interfacial side reactions and prevent transition metal dissolution. Simultaneously, Ca2+ pillars, robust Zr-O bonds and the highly electronegative F- are adequately anchored into ternary lattice sites of Na-TM-O, respectively, thereby reinforcing the TMO6 octahedra and facilitating Na+ diffusion. Notably, the intrinsic lattice strain is effectively alleviated due to an additional intergrowth phase transition of P3-OP2. More impressively, migration of Jahn-Teller distorted Fe4+O6 is further restrained, originating from the strengthened coordination environment under deep-desodiation state. Consequently, as-designed NFM-CZF achieves an impressive rate capability and a remarkable capacity retention of 83.8% after 300 cycles at 2 C. This elaborate work shed valuable insight into mechanism of regulating internal full Wyckoff-site and external surface structure for sodium-ion batteries with enhanced durability.",

Even though layered oxides (classified as two-dimensional oxides) demonstrate excellent promise in the high discharge capacity, their poor oxygen transformation via redox reactions is limited by crystal instability. Therefore, a doping strategy was conceived to tackle this issue and increase redox efficiency. K doping was applied to transform the two-dimensional Na_1.3Mn_0.7O_2 (NMO) to three-dimensional K_0.2Na_1.3Mn_0.5O_2 (KNMO), preventing the irreversible phase shift and preserving the crystal structure’s stability while cycling. With this modification treatment, KNMO features manganese and oxygen reactive sites, delivering a promising energy density of 190 mAh·g^−1 at 5 mA·g^−1 in the 2.0–4.5 V voltage range (vs. 71.4 mAh·g^−1 for the pristine NMO). Moreover, it displays improved capacity retention of more than 83.5% after 50 cycles at 50 mA·g^−1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundance and low price of sodium. Until recently, the low theoretical capacities of intercalation-type cathodes less than 250 mAh g-1 have limited the energy density of SIBs. On the other hand, iron oxyfluoride (FeOF) has a high theoretical capacity of ≈885 mAh g-1 as a conversion-type cathode material for SIBs. However, FeOF suffers from poor cycling stability, rate capability, and low initial Coulombic efficiency caused by its low electrical conductivity and slow ionic diffusion kinetics. To solve these problems, doping aliovalent Ni2+ on FeOF electrodes is attempted to improve the electronic conductivity without using a carbon matrix. The ionic conductivity of FeOF is also enhanced due to the formation of oxygen defects in the FeOF crystal structure. The FeOF-Ni1 electrode shows an excellent cycling performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 450.4 mAh g-1 at 100 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles with a fading rate of 0.20% per cycle.

        "abstract": "Ultrafast-charging is the focus of next-generation rechargeable batteries for widespread economic success by reducing the time cost. However, the poor ion diffusion rate, intrinsic electronic conductivity and structural stability of cathode materials seriously hinder the development of ultrafast-charging technology. To overcome these challenges, an interfacial dynamics and thermodynamics synergistic strategy is proposed to synchronously enhance the fast-charging capability and structural stability of polyanion cathode materials. As a case study, a Na3V2(PO4)3 composite (NVP/NSC) is successfully obtained by introducing an interface layer derived from N/S co-doped carbon dots. Density functional theory calculations validate that the interfacial bonding effect of V–N/S–C significantly reduces the Na+ transport energy barrier. D-band center theory analysis confirms the downward shift of the V d-band center enhances the strength of the V–O bond and considerably inhibits irreversible phase transformation. Benefitting from this interfacial synergistic strategy, NVP/NSC achieves a high capability and excellent cycling stability with a surprisingly low carbon content (2.23%) at an extremely high rate of 100C for 10 000 cycles (87.2 mA h g−1, 0.0028% capacity decay per cycle). Furthermore, a superior performance at 5C (115.3 mA h g−1, 92.1% capacity retention after 800 cycles) is exhibited by the NVP/NSC‖HC full cell. These findings provide timely new insights for the systematic design of ultrafast-charging cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for large-scale energy storage has driven the prosperous investigation of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). As a promising cathode candidate for NIBs, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NaNMO), a prototype sodium layered oxide, has attracted extensive attention because of its high operating voltage and high capacity density. Although its electrochemical properties have been extensively investigated, the fundamental charge compensation mechanism, i.e., the cationic and anionic redox reactions, is still elusive. In this report, we have systematically investigated the transition metal and oxygen redox reactions of NaNMO nanoflakes using bulk-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and full-range mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) from an atomic-level view. We show that the bulk Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple emerges from the first discharge process with the increment of inactive Mn3+ upon cycling, which may have a negative effect on the cyclability. In contrast, the bulk Ni redox mainly stems from the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple, in contrast to the conventional wisdom of the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple. The quantitative analysis provides unambiguous evidence for the continuous reduction of the average valence state of Mn and Ni over extended cycles, leading to the voltage fading. In addition, we reveal that the oxygen anions also participate in the charge compensation process mainly through irreversible oxygen release rather than reversible lattice oxygen redox. Such understanding is vital for the precise design and optimization of NaNMO electrodes for rechargeable NIBs with outstanding performance.",

However, whether it is a base station power source, an energy storage power station, or a start-stop power supply, long energy cycle life (more than 5000 cycles), high stability, and safety performance are application prerequisites. Regrettably, currently, few sodium-ion batteries can meet this requirement, mainly due to shortcomings in positive electrode performance. We report a sufficiently stable sodium-ion battery cathode material, Na2Fe0.95P2O7, that retains 97.5% capacity after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The use of nonstoichiometry in the lattice enables simultaneous modification of the crystal and electronic structure, promoting Na2Fe0.95P2O7 to be extremely stable while still being able to achieve a capacity of 92 mAh g-1 and stable cycling at high temperatures up to 60 °C.

The high capacity is associated to the redox reaction of oxygen, which is confirmed here by a combined experimental and theoretical study. The present work therefore shows that materials beyond mainstream layered oxides and polyanion compounds should be considered as candidate high-performance cathodes for Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of high-capacity Na-ion batteries (NIBs) has propelled great forward the O3-type Ni-rich NaNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) cathodes. However, the inborn chemo-mechanical instabilities caused by complex phase transitions and anisotropic lattice stress have severely delayed its widespread application. In the contribution, a cooperative surface-to-bulk modification strategy, i.e., in situ surface NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) coating and bulk Ti/F co-doping, is first proposed to engineer an advanced NCM cathode (denoted as TF-NCM@NTP). The NTP protective layer with high thermodynamic stability and ionic conductivity endows TF-NCM@NTP with a highly stable interface and expedited de-/sodiated kinetics. The robust Ni/Co/Mn─F bond and concurrent Ti─O bond greatly strengthen the bulk lattice oxygen and mitigate the internal strain self-reproduction. Benefiting from these synergistic merits, the designed TF-NCM@NTP cathode demonstrates exceptional sodium-storage performance in terms of high-rate capacities and long-duration cycle life in both half and full cells. Particularly, the TF-NCM@NTP-based quasi-solid-state NIBs deliver an applicable material-level energy density of 285 Wh kg-1 at 25 °C, and exhibit wide-temperature-tolerant Na-storage behaviors ranging from -20 to 50 °C. More essentially, the multi-level engineering strategy from surface to bulk developed here definitely makes enormous progress for rationally designing advanced cathode materials toward multi-scenario applicable NIBs.",

However, the air sensitivity of this material limits practical application and is not well understood. Here, we present a detailed study of NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 powders stored in different atmospheres (oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide), either dry or wet. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared measurements were used to characterize the materials and their surface species before and after controlled-atmosphere storage. It was determined that the exposure of untreated NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 powders to moisture results in desodiation and material degradation, leading to poor cycling. This effect was found to be caused by reactive surface species. From these results, a simple ethanol washing method was found to significantly reduce the air-reactivity and improve the electrochemical performance of NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 by removing surface impurities formed by air exposure.",

Analogous to LIBs, the high‐capacity electrodes in SIBs always suffer from rapid capacity decay upon long‐term cycling due to the particle pulverization induced by a large volume change. Circumventing particle pulverization plays a critical role in developing high‐energy and long‐life SIBs. Herein, tetrahydroxy‐1,4‐benzoquinone disodium salt (TBDS) that can self‐heal the cracks by hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl group and carbonyl group is employed as a cathode for sustainable and stable SIBs. The self‐healing TBDS exhibits long cycle life of 1000 cycles with a high rate capability up to 2 A g−1 due to the fast Na‐ion diffusion reaction in the TBDS cathode. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding has been comprehensively characterized to understand the self‐healing mechanism. The hydrogen bonding‐enabled self‐healing organic materials are promising for developing high‐energy and long‐cycle‐life SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, and the key to their widespread use lies in finding efficient and cost-effective cathode materials. Ferricyanides have emerged as promising candidates for SIBs cathodes due to their low cost and open channel structure allowing for favorable ion and electron transport. However, traditional ferricyanides such as Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBAs) have a limited two-electron transfer capacity, which hampers their practical application. Bi-based ferricyanide materials with multiple valence states, low toxicity and abundant resources are attractive for electrochemical reactions and enable multiple electron transfers to develop high-capacity cathode materials. In this study, we synthesized a rod-like BiHCF·4H2O sample using a simple coprecipitation method. After dehydration, the rod-like BiHCF compounds with a robust framework and reduced lattice water defects demonstrated good electrochemical performance in SIBs. The rod-like BiHCF electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 221 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1 based on a three-electron transfer of Bi3+/Bi0. A full SIBs composed of a BiHCF cathode and Bi anode demonstrated acceptable performance, indicating potential for practical applications. This work provides valuable insights into the development of redox-active site substitution strategies for high performance positive electrode materials in SIBs.",

Using X-ray computed tomography, we confirm the uniform low-tortuosity channels present along the thickness of the scaffold. We infiltrated the porous NATP scaffolds with sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP) cathode nanoparticles achieving mass loadings of ∼3-4 mg cm-2, which enables short sodium ion diffusion path lengths. For the resulting hybrid cell, we achieved a capacity of ∼90 mAh g-1 at a specific current of 50 mA g-1 (∼300 Wh kg-1) for over 100 cycles with ∼94% capacity retention.

All the samples were thoroughly characterized and the changes in the crystal structure and particle size distribution were investigated using a Rietveld refinement method. NVP calcined at 850 °C exhibits the best battery performance with a discharge capacity of 94 mA h g−1 and retention up to 90% after 250 cycles at 2C. It also exhibits remarkable cycling stability with 94% (63 mA h g−1) retention after 2000 cycles at high-rate endurance (10C).

As a promising polyanionic cathode material of sodium-ion batteries, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) belonging to NASICON exhibits large gap space and excellent structural stability, leading to a high energy density and ultralong cycle lifespan. To improve its stability and Na ion mobility, K+ cations are introduced into NVPF crystal as in situ partial substitution for Na+. The influence of K+ in situ substitution on crystal structure, electronic properties, kinetic properties, and electrochemical performance of NVPF are investigated. Through ex situ examination, it turns out that K+ occupied Na1 ion, in which the K+ does not participate in the charge-discharge process and plays a pillar role in improving the mobility of Na+. Moreover, the doping of K+ cation can reduce the bandgap energy and improve the electronic conductivity. Besides, the optimal K+ doping concentration in N0.92K0.08VPF/C is found so as to achieve rapid Na+ migration and reversible phase transition. The specific capacity of N0.92K0.08VPF/C is as high as 128.8 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, and at 10 C its rate performance is excellent, which shows a capacity of 113.3 mAh g-1.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathode exhibits great application potential for practical sodium-ion batteries, due to its cost-effectiveness, abundant sodium and manganese resources, and high theoretical capacity. However, the irreversible phase transition, coupled with rapid capacity decay, which is primarily attributed to the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+, remains a significant bottleneck for commercial application. Additionally, the sluggish kinetics during the (de)sodiation process require urgent improvement. Herein, an electronic structure regulation strategy is proposed by low-valence Li/Cu co-substitution to address these issues. The roles of Li/Cu on the electronic structure, structural evolution, and electrochemical properties in the Na0.96Ni0.22Fe0.2Mn0.5Li0.04Cu0.04O2 (NFMLC) cathode are comprehensively explored through systematic in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations. The results reveal that this strategy effectively activates more Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ redox reactions above 2.5 V, while suppressing Mn3+/4+ redox activity below 2.5 V, thereby achieving highly structural reversibility. Therefore, the NFMLC electrode displays excellent long-term cycling stability (81.5% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C), and significantly enhanced rate performance (from 45.5% to 80.4% under a ratio of 5 C to 0.5 C).

In this work, we aim to form thin films of sodium manganese oxide (NMO) cathode materials for NIBs using atomic layer deposition (ALD) with the vision to isolate and study these interfacial processes in the absence of bulk NMO. We combine established chemistries for ALD of manganese oxide (MnOx) using Mn(thd)3/O3 and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) using NaOtBu/H2O and adjust the sequence and ratios of these two chemistries to form NaxMnyO alloy films. We identify that increasing the O3 exposure during Mn(thd)3/O3 ALD beyond previously reported values increases the growth rate of MnOx from 0.23 to 0.62 Å per cycle and provides improved uniformity, yielding predominantly Mn5O8. Furthermore, alloying Mn(thd)3/O3 with NaOtBu/H2O mutually enhances the growth rate of both ALD chemistries, yielding a growth rate of ∼9 Å per supercycle for a 1 : 1 cycle ratio. This enhancement in growth arises from sub-surface reactions, including the reaction of NaOtBu to a depth of ∼1.3 nm into bulk MnOx to form Na2MnOx. By tuning cycle ratios and growth conditions, we demonstrate control over the NaxMnyO composition and measure different electrochemical properties depending on the composition. The formation of NMO thin films with controlled thickness and composition established in this work provides a means to systematically study interfacial processes occurring in NMO cathode materials for NIBs.",

However, it has P2-O2 phase transition, which leads to fast capacity decay. This paper investigates the effect of Zn/Al co-substitution on their chemical-electrical properties. The experimental results show that this strategy successfully transforms the unfavorable P2-O2 phase transition that occurs in the material during cycling into a reversible P2-OP4 phase transition, and the reversible capacity and capacity retention of the P2-type cathode material are significantly improved.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the sufficient sodium element reserve on the earth; however, the electrochemical performance of SIBs cannot achieve the requirements so far, especially, the limitation of cathode materials. Here, a kilogram-scale route to synthesize Na2 FePO4 F/carbon/multi-walled carbon nanotubes microspheres (NFPF@C@MCNTs) composite with a high tap density of 1.2 g cm-3 is reported. The NFPF@C@MCNTs cathode exhibits a reversible specific capacity of 118.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C. Even under 5 C with high mass loading (10 mg cm-2 ), the specific capacity still maintains at 56.4 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 97% after 700 cycles. In addition, a hard carbon||NFPF@C@MCNTs pouch cell is assembled and tested, which exhibits a volumetric energy density of 325 Wh L-1 and gravimetrical energy density of 210 Wh kg-1 (base on electrode massing), and it provides more than 200 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 92%. Furthermore, the pouch cell can operate in an all-climate environment ranging from -40 to 80 °C. These results demonstrate that the NFPF@C@MCNTs microspheres are a promising candidate cathode for SIBs and facilitate its practical application in sodium cells.",

        "abstract": "Iron phosphorus triselenide (FePSe3) is attractive for energy applications owing to its interesting layered geometry, electronic structure, and physiochemical property, while it is limited in actual application because of a very long fabrication time of over 7 days. Herein, we report a new synthetic route to a high-quality sheetlike hybrid of iron phosphorus triselenide nanocrystals coated with graphitic carbon (FePSe3/C) as an alternative kind of van der Waals heterostructures for the first time via a pyrolytic process at 600 °C from the precursors of ferrocene, red phosphorus, and selenium in a quartz tube with a significantly shortened reaction time of 24 h and even down to 30 min. Investigations demonstrated that the component phase of FePSe3 in the layered FePSe3/C hybrid nanosheets is the rhombohedral phase, and the hybrid nanosheets other than bulk crystals are about 15 nm in thickness. Acting as a cathode in fabricating half-cell sodium-ion batteries, the layered FePSe3/C hybrid nanosheets exhibited remarkable performance. Typically, when current density was set as 50 mA g-1, the hybrid nanosheet-assembled battery exhibited a capacity of 182.7 mA h g-1 after performing over 50 cycles, and the nanosheet battery exhibited a capacity of 142 mA h g-1 after performing for 200 cycling trials at 1 A g-1 in the 0.8-2.2 V voltage window. Meanwhile, the layered FePSe3/C hybrid nanosheets also exhibited very high rate capabilities at a relatively large current density in the present study, that is, 172 and 95 mA h g-1 under typical performing conditions at 0.5 and 5 A g-1, respectively.",

Herein, we propose a surfactant-assisted molding strategy to regulate the pore-forming process in NVP/C composite cathode materials. More precisely, the forming process of the pores in NVP could be easily controlled by utilizing the huge difference in critical micelle concentration of a surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) in water and ethanol. By reasonably modulating the ratio of water and ethanol in the solution, the as-synthesized NVP/C sample exhibited a three-dimensional interconnected structure with hierarchical micro/meso/macro-pores. Benefiting from these hierarchical porous structures in NVP/C, the structural stability, contact surface with the electrolyte, and electronic/ionic conductivity were improved simultaneously; whereby the optimized porous NVP/C sample exhibited an excellent high-rate performance (61.3 mA h g-1 at 10 C) and superior cycling stability (90.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 10 C).",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted widespread attention for large‐scale energy storage, but one major drawback, i.e., the limited capacity of cathode materials, impedes their practical applications. Oxygen redox reactions in layered oxide cathodes are proven to contribute additionally high specific capacity, while such cathodes often suffer from irreversible structural transitions, causing serious capacity fading and voltage decay upon cycling, and the formation process of the oxidized oxygen species remains elusive. Herein, a series of Al‐doped P2‐type Na0.6Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 cathode materials for SIBs are reported and the corresponding charge compensation mechanisms are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. The combined analyses reveal that Al doping boosts the reversible oxygen redox reactions through the reductive coupling reactions between orphaned O 2p states in NaOAl local configurations and Ni4+ ions, as directly evidenced by X‐ray absorption fine structure results. Additionally, Al doping also induces an increased interlayer spacing and inhibits the unfavorable P2 to O2 phase transition upon desodiation/sodiation, which is common in P2‐type Mn‐based cathode materials, leading to the great improvement in capacity retention and rate capability. This work provides deeper insights into the development of structurally stable and high‐capacity layered cathode materials for SIBs with anion–cation synergetic contributions.",

This feature minimizes performance degradation during the charging and discharging processes, improving the efficiency and stability of the battery. Here, we have developed a novel healing conductive two-dimensional sulfur iodide (SI4) composite cathode. This process integrates both sulfur and iodine compounds into carbon nanocages, forming a SI4@C core-shell structure. This cathode design improves electrical conductivity and repairability, facilitates rapid activation, and ensures structural integrity, resulting in a typical Na-SI4 battery with high capacity and an exceptionally long cycle life. At 10.0 A g-1, the capacity of the Na-SI4 battery can still reach 217.4 mAh g-1 after more than 500 cycles, and the capacity decay rate per cycle is only 0.06%. In addition, the cathode exhibits a cascade redox reaction involving S and I, contributing to its high capacity. The in situ growth of a carbon shell further enhances the conductivity and structural robustness of the entire cathode. The flexibility and bendability of SI4@C-carbon cloth make it applicable for flexible electronic devices, providing more possibilities for battery design. The strategy of engineering a two-dimensional self-healing structure to construct a superior cathode is expected to be widely applied to other electrode materials. This study provides a new pathway for designing novel binary-conversion-type sodium-ion batteries with excellent long-term cycling performance.",

Moreover, ex situ ICP-OES suggests interesting mixed-ions migration processes: In the initial two cycles, only Li(+) can intercalate into the LNCM cathode, whereas both Li(+) and Na(+) work together as the electrochemical cycles increase. Also the structural evolution of LNCM is examined in terms of ex situ XRD pattern at the end of various charge-discharge scans. The strong insight obtained from this study could be beneficial to the design of new layered cathode materials for future rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based NASICON-type Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NVMP) is used as an alternative material to the cathode materials (Na3V2(PO4)3) for sodium-ion battery (SIBs). By selecting the cheap and easily available and environmentally non-polluting Mn element to replace part of the highly toxic and expensive V element, it has the advantages of higher voltage platform, lower cost and weaker toxicity. However, the low intrinsic conductivity and poor cycling stability of NVMP severely limit its application in SIBs. In this paper, N-doped double carbon layer-coated NVMP composites (NVMP/NC@CNTs) are prepared by adding additional urea as a nitrogen source and CNTs as a carbon source using a simple and feasible sol-gel synthesis method, which improves their electronic conductivity and structural stability. On this basis, the effects of calcination temperature on the lattice structure, specific surface area, carbon disorder, Na+ diffusion coefficient (DNa+) and electrochemical properties of NVMP/NC@CNTs composites are mainly investigated. The results show that the optimal annealing temperature is 650 °C, and the NVMP/NC@CNTs material has the highest discharge capacity (105.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1C), the best rate performance (75.7 mAh g−1 at 5C), and the most stable cycling stability (79.4 %/89.3 % for 500 cycles at 1C / 5C, respectively). Even at high rate of 10C, an impressive cycling stability (77.5 % capacity retention over 1500 cycles). The sodium storage mechanism, electrochemical performance and pseudo-capacitance contribution of NVMP/NC@CNTs-650 are further investigated by kinetic analysis, GITT test, ex-situ XPS, XRD and EIS characterization. Finally, the assembled NVMP/NC@CNTs-650 || hard carbon (HC) full cell manifests a high capacity of 87.2 mAh g−1 with capacity retention of 92.5 % over 50 cycles at 1C. The results reveal that the appropriate annealing temperature can help to prepare electrochemically excellent and structurally stable NVMP composites, while the co-modification of N-doped dual-nanocarbon can produce a large number of defects and active sites, which is expected to facilitate the commercialization of SIBs.",

Layered transition-metal oxides have attracted intensive interest for cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries. However, they are hindered by the limited capacity and inferior phase transition due to the gliding of transition-metal layers upon Na^+ extraction and insertion in the cathode materials.

The Mn-O bonds are reinforced to reduce phase transition during charge and discharge. 0.901 Na^+ per formula are reversibly extracted and inserted, in which only the two-phase transition of P2 ↔ P’2 occurs at low voltages.

        "abstract": "P2-type Mn-based layered oxides have emerged as one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owing to their advantages of facile preparation and high theoretical capacity. However, challenges such as phase transition and irreversible oxygen release during cycling often lead to rapid structural distortion and the formation of oxygen vacancies, ultimately resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, a covalency modulation strategy is adopted to address these challenges and successfully achieved a stable P2-type Mn-based layered oxide by introducing strong covalent Ni─O bonds. The robust Ni─O motif plays a crucial role in maintaining the rigidity of transition metal (TM) layered frameworks, which efficiently alleviates the structural distortion and degradation of the coordination environments of local TM sites, thereby achieving durable structural stiffness over extended cycles. In addition, the strong covalent Ni─O bonds can also stabilize the local oxygen environment, effectively suppressing the irreversible oxygen release. Benefiting from these advancements, the as-designed Na0.6Mg0.15Mn0.7Ni0.15O2 cathode displays a full solid-solution behavior with a low volume change of only 0.9% and an enhanced reversibility of lattice oxygen redox (OR) reaction.

It is also observed that the complex of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Na+ (PEG-Na+) exists on the VHCF surface which facilitates the stability of VHCF and promotes the alkali ion transfer at a high current density. The results of ssNMR study offer new insights into the intercalation chemistry of Prussian blue analogues with open-framework-structured compounds, which can greatly broaden our horizons for battery research.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition-metal oxides are one kind of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In this study, we propose a strategy to enhance the electrochemical properties of P3-type manganese-based layered oxide cathode by introducing a small amount of layered P2 and Li-O'3 phases. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) structural refinement and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are performed to confirm the microstructures of different samples. PXRD refinement results show that the elevated annealing temperature leads to a partial conversion of the P3 phase to the P2 phase and the addition of lithium results in the formation of a new O'3 phase in the P3/P2-layered matrix. STEM results identify the intergrowth of P3/P2 and P3/P2/O'3 in biphasic and triphasic materials, respectively. Electron energy loss spectroscopy verifies that the alkali metal layer in the O'3 phase is occupied by the lithium ion. The intergrowth of biphasic and triphasic materials in these layered P3/P2 and P3/P2/O'3 hybrid structures brings forth a positive effect on the electrochemical properties. In particular, the formation of P3/P2/O'3-intergrown hybrid structures greatly improves the cycling stability of the P3 phase that the capacity retention of P3/P2/O'3 hybrid structures remains 78%, while capacity retention of the pure P3 phase is only 54.1% after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C, and the rate performance of the P3 phase has also been enhanced.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) has been considered as one of the most promising candidates for cathodes in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, presence of vanadium makes the material costly. Besides, its electrochemical properties are hampered due to its low electronic conductivity. Herein, carbon coated Fe, Cr co-doped Na3V2(PO4)2F3 has been synthesized using rota-tumbler assisted sol–gel method. The effects of co-doping on structure, morphology and electrochemical performances are systematically studied. It is confirmed that co-doping of Fe and Cr can enhance the electrochemical performances of NVPF. Among all, Na3V1.9Fe0.095Cr0.005(PO4)2F3 shows a high initial capacity of 119.85 mAhg−1 at 0.1C and maintains a capacity retention of 88.58 % after 500 cycles at 1C. Increase in the size of the saddle point, planes of monocapped trigonal prisms and the hexagonal cavities help in decreasing the ion diffusion activation energy, thus improving the diffusivity of the doped material. The improved electrochemical performances can be attributed to the increase in the electronic conductivity of the material. Besides, vanadium reduction in the cathode aids in manufacturing cost reduction. Our work demonstrates that carbon coated Na3V1.9Fe0.095Cr0.005(PO4)2F3 can be considered as a potential cathode candidate for practical applications in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "To address the challenges of air stability and slurry processability in layered transition metal oxide O3-type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), we have designed an innovative 500 °C reheating strategy. This method improves the surface properties of NFM without the need for additional coating layers, making it more efficient and suitable for large-scale applications. Pristine NFM (NFM-P) was first synthesized through a high-temperature solid-state method and then modified using this reheating approach (NFM-HT). This strategy significantly enhances air stability and electrochemical performance, yielding an initial discharge specific capacity of 151.46 mAh/g at 0.1C, with a remarkable capacity retention of 95.04% after 100 cycles at 0.5C. Additionally, a 1.7 Ah NFM||HC (hard carbon) pouch cell demonstrates excellent long-term cycling stability (94.64% retention after 500 cycles at 1C), superior rate capability (86.48% retention at 9C), and strong low-temperature performance (77% retention at − 25 °C, continuing power supply at − 40 °C). Notably, even when overcharged to 8.29 V, the pouch cell remained safe without combustion or explosion. This reheating strategy, which eliminates the need for a coating layer, offers a simpler, more scalable solution for industrial production while maintaining outstanding electrochemical performance. These results pave the way for broader commercial adoption of NFM materials.",

Furthermore, the assembled pouch battery with NaNFMO-TW retains 58.2% capacity after 300 cycles at RT&0.5C, being conspicuously superior to the 46.1% achieved by the NaNFMO||HC battery. In particular, adiabatic thermal tests and infrared thermal imaging tests reveal a marked improvement in the thermal safety of the modified battery, with a reduction in surface temperature of ∼1.3 and ∼2.2 °C during 3C charging and discharging, respectively. Moreover, the results confirmed the performance enhancement mechanism of NaNFMO by addition of TiN and WO3. Such electrode modulation strategy provides a practical method for improving battery performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a reasonable alternative to lithium-ion battery (LIB) in the field of grid-scale energy storage systems. Unfortunately, the development of appropriate cathode material is a bottleneck in the field of SIB. In the present work, (p-TQ)-VO, formulated as (p-TQ)0.2V2O5·0.38H2O, was synthesized based on a facile hydrothermal reaction of V2O5 and methylhydroquinone (p-HTQ). And when V2O5 was replaced by VN, (p-TQ)-VN, formulated as (p-TQ)0.22V2(O/N)5, was prepared instead. The (p-TQ)-VO sample displays good electrochemical performance as the SIB cathode. And (p-TQ)-VN shows a much higher capacity at a small current density, and it can maintain structural integrity with partial topotactic phase transformation into NaxV2O5 during the discharge/charge process. A series of characterizations of (p-TQ)-VO and (p-TQ)-VN reveals the successful intercalation of p-TQ into the layered V2O5 with a (001) lattice spacing of 13.7 and 10.7 Å, respectively. In (p-TQ)-VN, partial terminal oxygen (Ot) atoms from the V-O-V layer have been substituted by N atoms, which can boost the orbital hybridization of V 3d and Ot 2p, shorten the V-Ot bonds in the c-axial direction, and elongate the V-O bonds in the ab plane with compressed {VO4N2} octahedra, giving rise to mixed-anion coordination effect. As a result, the enhanced electron densities around the Ot atoms of the V-O-V layer can facilitate the affinity toward the inserted Na+ ions, leading to partial phase conversion into NaNO2/NaNO3. Moreover, density functional density (DFT) calculations reveal that the N-incorporation can improve electron conductivity with richer molecular orbital energy levels, resulting in multistep redox reactions and enhanced capacity.",

Among many cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, polyanion materials are favored for their high operating voltage, stable cycling performance, and good safety. However, the low electronic conductivity and low energy density of polyanionic materials limit their potential for large-scale commercial applications. To overcome this challenge, various strategies have been explored to improve their electrochemical performance. Among them, fluorine doping has been proven to be an effective means. In this study, we have systematically explored the effects of trace fluorine doping and mass fluorine substitution on the structure, dynamics, and electrochemistry of polyanionic cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries and deeply analyzed their reaction mechanisms. The analysis results show that trace fluorine doping can effectively improve the electronic conductivity of the material, thus enhancing its electrochemical performance. A large amount of fluorine substitution can effectively improve the voltage plateau of the material, thus enhancing its energy density. However, the environmental and safety challenges associated with the introduction of fluorine should also be addressed. Overall, the introduction of fluorine in polyanionic cathode materials can further optimize the electronic structure and electrochemical performance, thus realizing the wide application of high-performance sodium-ion batteries and making them a competitive battery technology.",

        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, with the advantages of strong structural stability, suitable voltage window, low cost and green pollution-free, is considered as a highly researchable cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, the low conductivity of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 and the inevitable electrochemical inertia from maricite-NaFePO4 impurity during the preparation process lead to the low reversible capacity and poor cycling stability. In this work, a new bimetallic-polyanion cathode material Na4Fe2.82Ni0.18(PO4)2P2O7 capped with an in-situ nitrogen-doped carbon layer is proposed. Ni-substituting inhibits the generation of electrochemical inert maricite-NaFePO4 impurity and enhances the Na+ ion conductivity. Meanwhile, a lower volume-change during the charging/discharging process can be achieved in Na4Fe2.82Ni0.18(PO4)2P2O7 electrode compared with conventional Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode. With the synergistic effect of in-situ N-doping and Ni-substituting, an ultra-high initial discharge capacity (128.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2C), superior rate performance (62.5 mAh g−1 at 50C) and significant long-term cycle life (capacity retention rate of about 83 % after 3000 cycles at 10C) can be achieved in the optimal Na4Fe2.82Ni0.18(PO4)2P2O7@C-N (Ni6-NFPP@C-N) cathode.

However, the representative P2-type Mn-based layered oxide cathode usually suffers from a limited specific capacity and a poor cycle life in Na-ion intercalation and deintercalation processes because of the unavoidable phase transition at a high voltage. Herein, we developed Ru-substituted P2-Na0.6MnO2 as a promising sodium host with a high reversible capacity and cycle life. The multiple characterization investigations reveal that Ru substitution could improve the electronic and ionic conductions and particularly suppress the phase transition of P2-OP4, resulting in the extension of the single-phase reaction region. Ru substitution not only enhances the specific capacity (209.3 mA h g-1) but also improves the rate capability (∼100 mA h g-1 at 50 C) and cycling stability. This work may open a new avenue for designing and fabricating SIBs by using Mn-based cathodes with high capacity and stability.",

However, the charge/discharge profiles exhibit significant voltage hysteresis, which leads to a limited reversible capacity, thereby preventing their application. Here, we demonstrate that the voltage hysteresis in manganese-rich NASICON-type cathodes (Na_3MnTi(PO_4)_3) is closely related to the intrinsic anti-site defect (IASD), which forms during synthesis and is captured in our characterizations. Combining electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques, we draw a comprehensive picture of sluggish Na^+ diffusion behaviours in the IASD-affected structure during cycling, and rationalize the relationship of voltage hysteresis, phase separation and delayed charge compensation. Furthermore, a Mo-doping strategy is developed to decrease the defect concentration, which enhances the initial Coulombic efficiency from 76.2% to 85.9%. Overall, this work sheds light on the voltage hysteresis in NASICON-type cathodes and provides guidelines for designing high-performance polyanionic electrodes. Manganese-rich NASICON-type compounds are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, but they suffer from severe voltage hysteresis.

Multicomponent design is considered an effective method to optimize the conductivity of NVP electrodes. Therefore, Cr and Si are added in NVP to form a multielement component of Na3V1.9Cr0.1(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 (NVP-CS). It is confirmed that 3d electrons of Cr are beneficial for improving the conductivity and increasing the average potential by activating V4+/V5+. Theoretical calculations show that the introduction of Si changes the electronic structure of V and O, thus promoting the electrochemical reaction of V3+/V4+ to exert higher capacity. Due to the coordination of the two elements, a lower migration barrier is obtained in NVP-CS. Specifically, NVP-CS retains the advantages of single-doped electrodes very well (capacity retention of 90% after 300 cycles at 1 C and a high capacity of 94.1 mA h g-1 at 5 C, compared to NVP with only 82.6% capacity retention at 1 C and 59.4 mA h g-1 at 5 C).

The development of a new O2-type cathode in SIBs is very challenging in that this compound is only stable as an intermediate product of P2-type oxides during redox reactions. Here, we report a thermodynamically stable O2-type cathode obtained by Na/Li ion exchange from P2-type oxide in a binary molten salt system. It is demonstrated that the as-prepared O2-type cathode exhibits a highly reversible O2–P2 phase transition during Na+ de-intercalation. The unusual O2–P2 transition has a low volume change of ∼11%, much lower than that of 23.2% for P2–O2 transformation in the P2-type cathode. The lowered lattice volume change of this O2-type cathode gives rise to superior structural stability upon cycling. Therefore, the O2-type cathode possesses a reversible capacity of about 100 mAh/g with a good capacity retention of 87.3% even after 300 cycles at 1C, indicating outstanding long-term cycling stability. These achievements will promote the development new class of cathode materials with high capacity and structural stability for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide serves as dominant components in sodium ion batteries; however, the unstable electronic structure between transition metal and oxygen inevitably induces framework instability and severe kinetic hindrance. In this study, a two-in-one approach to synergistically modulate the local electronic and interfacial structure of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 by Ce modification is proposed. We present an in-depth study to reveal the strong-covalent Ce–O bonds, which make local charge around oxygen more negative, enhance O 2p-Mn 3d hybridization, and preserve the octahedral structural integrity. This modification tailors local electronic structure between the octahedral metal center and oxygen, thus enhancing reversibility of O3-P3-O3 phase transition and expanding Na+ octahedral-tetrahedral-octahedral transport channel. Additionally, the nanoscale perovskite layer induced by Ce element is in favor of minimizing interfacial side reaction as well as enhancing Na+ diffusivity. As a result, the designed O3-NaNi0.305Fe0.33Mn0.33Ce0.025O2 material delivers an exceptionally low volume variation, an ultrahigh rate capacity of 76.9 mA h g−1 at 10 C, and remarkable cycling life over 250 cycles with capacity retention of 80% at 5 C.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides are promising candidates for sodium-ion batteries. However, structural instability and sluggish Na⁺ diffusion kinetics hinder their further commercialization. In this study, NaAlO2, which possesses a similar α-NaFeO2 layer structure, is coated onto the surface of P2-Na0.67Ni0.3Mn0.6Co0.1O2 (NNMC) to enhance its electrochemical performance as a novel cathode for sodium-ion batteries. A variety of experimental results and characterizations reveal that the thin NaAlO2 coating layer significantly reduces side reactions and facilitates the diffusion of Na⁺ at the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte. Moreover, the introduction of partial Al ions into the transition-metal layers enlarge the interlayer spacing, and decrease the content of Mn3+. As a result, the NNMC cathode material, modified with 3 wt% NaAlO2, demonstrated remarkable electrochemical performance. The initial specific discharge capacity was recorded at 137.7 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, and an impressive discharge capacity of 38.2 mA h g−1 was attained at 20 C.

However, it still suffers from the toxicity and high cost of vanadium elements, coupled with low electronic conductivity. In this study, we partially substituted V with the environmentally friendly and cost-effective transition element Fe and doped K into the Na site to fabricate a series of Na4-x\n                     K\n                        x\n                     FeV(PO4)3@C composites using a facile sol-gel method. The structural stability, Na+ mobility and electronic conductivity can significant improved by replacing Na+ with K+ and applying a carbon coating. Consequently, the Na3.9K0.1FeV(PO4)3@C electrode delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 83.85 mAh g−1 at 5C after 3000 cycles, with a capacity retention of 91.7 %. It also exhibits an outstanding rate performance with a specific discharge capacity of 83.88 mAh g−1 even at 20.0C. The kinetic analyses and ex-situ characterizations confirm that a small volume change, the pseudocapacitive- dominated sodium storage behavior and highly reversible redox reaction (Fe2+/3+ and V3+/4+) occur during the electrochemical reaction process. Finally, the optimized K-doped NFVP cathode also demonstrates great potential in practical utilization through the evaluation of electrochemical performance for full cells.",

        "abstract": "This research highlights the efficacy of NaNbO3 as a coating for P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathodes in sodium-ion batteries. The coating enhances the kinetic behavior and cyclability of the electrochemical cells, as shown by electrochemical measurements. XRD analysis indicates that Nb does not incorporate into the cathode structure, implying a physical interaction between the coating and the cathode material. XRF analysis and EDX mapping confirm the actual composition and uniform dispersion of elements throughout the sample, while the electron micrographs evidence the occurrence of NaNbO3 particles modifying the surface of the layered oxide. The Ni4+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ redox pairs, along with the partially reversible oxidation of oxide to peroxide anions, contribute significantly to cell capacity, as revealed by XPS spectra. This last effect and the appearance of a co-intercalated phase at high voltage are positive factors to provide fast kinetics. Cyclic voltammograms show that samples coated with 2–3% NaNbO3 have superior rate capability, with high capacitive response and apparent diffusion coefficients. These samples also have low impedance at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which helps deliver a high capacity at 5C. Further cycling at 1C shows improved cyclability in the bare and 3% coated samples, due to their higher diffusion coefficients on charging. Notably, the 3% NaNbO3-coated sample exhibits excellent cyclability below 0 °C, making it a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues possess numerous advantages as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, including high energy density, low cost, sustainability, and straightforward synthesis processes, making them highly promising for practical applications. However, during the synthesis, crystal defects such as vacancies and the incorporation of crystal water can lead to issues such as diminished capacity and suboptimal cycling stability. In the current study, a Y-tube assisted coprecipitation method was used to synthesize iron-based Prussian blue analogues, and the optimized feed flow rate during synthesis contributed to the successful preparation of the material with a formula of Na1.56Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.90□0.10·2.42H2O, representing a low-defect cathode material. This approach cleverly utilizes the Y-tube component to enhance the micro-mixing of materials in the co-precipitation reaction, featuring simplicity, low cost, user-friendly, and the ability to be used in continuous production. Electrochemical performance tests show that the sample retains 69.8% of its capacity after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5C (1C = 140 mA g−1) and delivers a capacity of 71.9 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 10C.

It is found that at different stage of the electrochemical process, it undergoes different phase reaction process with different redox couples. A single-phase reaction occurs when the first sodium-ion extracted from Na4MnV(PO4)3 with a V3+/V4+ redox, while a two-phase reaction takes place when the second sodium-ion extracted with a Mn2+/Mn3+ redox. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, GITT, indicates the single-phase reaction process shows a faster kinetic compared to the two-phase reaction process.

        "abstract": "Layered oxides are the most commonly used cathode materials in sodium ion batteries, typically presented in two structure variations: the sodium-poor P2 and the sodium-rich O3. The P2 structure is generally more stable in comparison to the O3 structure; however, it has lower capacity and initial coulombic efficiency owing to the low content of Na+. Conversely, the O3 structure offers higher operating voltage and capacity, but it is not practical due to its structural instability. To amalgamate the properties of both structures, in our work, we prepared NaxNi0.2Mn0.55Cu0.14TiyZnzO2 (x = 0.67,0.9,1, y + z = 0.11) as the cathode material by a straightforward sol-gel method.

After 500 cycles, the specific capacity is maintained at 65.4 mAh·g−1 with a capacity retention rate of 78.9%. Besides, the material shows a strong pseudo-capacitance effect (89.72%, 90.67%, 93.14%, 93.51%, 94.98% and 96.86%).

To address two existing issues facing the system, here the authors show that a simple zinc doping can suppress both Jahn–Teller distortion and phase separation, enabling enhanced cycling performance. Manganese based layered oxides have received increasing attention as cathode materials for sodium ion batteries due to their high theoretical capacities and good sodium ion conductivities. However, the Jahn–Teller distortion arising from the manganese (III) centers destabilizes the host structure and deteriorates the cycling life. Herein, we report that zinc-doped Na_0.833[Li_0.25Mn_0.75]O_2 can not only suppress the Jahn–Teller effect but also reduce the inherent phase separations. The reduction of manganese (III) amount in the zinc-doped sample, as predicted by first-principles calculations, has been confirmed by its high binding energies and the reduced octahedral structural variations. In the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the zinc-doped sample has lower formation energy, more stable ground states, and fewer spinodal decomposition regions than those of the undoped sample, all of which make it charge or discharge without any phase transition. Hence, the zinc-doped sample shows superior cycling performance, demonstrating that zinc doping is an effective strategy for developing high-performance layered cathode materials.",

However, this type of cathode often suffers from intricate phase transition and structural degradation at high voltages (i.e., >4.0 V vs Na+/Na), resulting in rapid capacity decay. Here, we present a Li/Ti cosubstitution strategy to modify the electronic configuration of oxygen elements in the O3-type layered oxide cathode. This deliberate modulation simultaneously mitigates the phase transitions and counteracts the weakening of the shielding effect resulting from the extraction of sodium ions, thus enhancing the electrostatic bonding within the TM layer and inducing and optimizing the O3-OP2 phase transition occurring in the voltage range of 2.0-4.3 V. Consequently, the cosubstituted NaLi1/9Ni1/3Mn4/9Ti1/9O2 exhibits an astounding capacity of 161.2 mAh g-1 in the voltage range of 2.0-4.3 V at 1C, and stable cycling up to 100 cycles has been achieved.

(1) The substitution of Mg for Mn enlarges the interlayer spacing, which not only enhances Na+ diffusion and the rate capability but also alleviates the lattice strains induced by Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. (2) The substitution of Mg by Mn also shrinks TM-O bond and TMO2 slabs, which enhances the layered structure stability. (3) The Mg substitution also mitigates the structure distortion or volume change of the crystal lattices and suppresses the irreversible phase transitions. (4) The substitution of low-valence Mg2+ for Mn3+ reduces Mn3+ and minimizes Jahn-Teller effect, which also further alleviates the irreversible phase transformations and improves the layered structure stability.

Therefore, it is quite necessary to reveal the underlying structural evolution mechanism and diffusion kinetics to improve the structural/electrochemical stability for application in SIBs. Here, we synthesize a P2 type Na0.78Al0.05Ni0.33Mn0.60O2 material by small dose of Al replacing the Mn, aiming at enhancing the structural stability without sacrificing the average discharge voltage and theoretical capacity. The etching XPS and EDX mapping/line scan results indicate that the Al doping induces the dual effects of the Al2O3 surface coating and the bulk lattice doping, which efficiently suppress the accumulation of structural irreversible changes from P2 to O2, the volume changes and surface reactions at high voltage. Obvious improvements are further found on the diffusion kinetics of Na ions as well as the decrease of overall voltage polarization. Interestingly, the dual effects of Al doping lead to the significant increase of capacity retention after 50 cycles and improvement of rate capability compared with the undoped counterpart between 2.0 - 4.5 V. Hence, this work sheds new light on stabilizing the P2-Na-Ni-Mn-O materials, which provides a rewarding avenue to develop better SIBs.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered metal oxides hold great promise for sodium-ion batteries cathodes owing to their energy density advantage. However, the severe irreversible phase transition and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics pose significant challenges to achieve high-performance layered cathodes. Herein, a boron-doped O3-type high entropy oxide Na(Fe0.2Co0.15Cu0.05Ni0.2Mn0.2Ti0.2)B0.02O2 (NFCCNMT-B0.02) is designed and the covalent B–O bonds with high entropy configuration ensure a robust layered structure. The obtained cathode NFCCNMT-B0.02 exhibits impressive cycling performance (capacity retention of 95% and 82% after 100 cycles and 300 cycles at 1 and 10 C, respectively) and outstanding rate capability (capacity of 83 mAh g−1 at 10 C). Furthermore, the NFCCNMT-B0.02 demonstrates a superior wide-temperature performance, maintaining the same capacity level (113.4 mAh g−1@−20 °C, 121 mAh g−1@25 °C, and 119 mAh g−1@60 °C) and superior cycle stability (90% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C at −20 °C). The high-entropy configuration design with boron doping strategy contributes to the excellent sodium-ion storage performance. The high-entropy configuration design effectively suppresses irreversible phase transitions accompanied by small volume changes (ΔV = 0.65  Å3). B ions doping expands the Na layer distance and enlarges the P3 phase region, thereby enhancing Na+ diffusion kinetics. This work offers valuable insights into design of high-performance layered cathodes for sodium-ion batteries operating across a wide temperature.",

        "title": "A Cross-Linked Polymer Coating Strategy to Enhance the Performance of NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2 Cathode for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide materials are regarded as optimal cathode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) on account of their exceptional energy density. Nevertheless, the rapid decline in capacity resulting from the instability of the interface structure represents a significant challenge to the practical implementation of these materials. In this study, we propose an innovative method to modify the O3-type NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2 (NFM) cathode material by applying a cross-linked polymer (CLP) coating. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis demonstrates that the CLP coating effectively inhibits the decomposition of the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) membrane in the course of cycling, leading to a substantial improvement in the stability of the electrode material's interface. Moreover, the oxygen-containing groups within the coating can compete with propylene carbonate (PC) solvent molecules in the electrolyte for Na+ coordination, reducing the coordination between Na+ and PC molecules. This process facilitates more efficient diffusion of Na+, thereby enhancing the rate performance. Consequently, CLP-coated NFM (NFM@CLP) materials exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance. After 300 cycles at 25 °C, NFM@CLP retains 72.36% of its capacity, compared to 62.59% for pristine NFM. Even at elevated temperatures (65 °C), the capacity retention of NFM@CLP remains high at 63.84% after 200 cycles, whereas pristine NFM drops to 3.65%. In full-cell tests (vs hard carbon), the NFM@CLP also exhibits better capacity retention (85.07% after 150 cycles). This study offers an effective and simple approach to enhancing the capacity retention and rate performance of O3-type layered materials in SIBs, providing unique insights into advanced energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Superior sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) greatly need cathode materials with higher capacity and better durability. Herein, the anion group substitution strategy is proposed to design a cathode material with extraordinary Na+ storage performance, NASICON-Na4Fe3(PO4)1.9(SiO4)0.1P2O7 (NFPP-Si0.1). The experimental and theoretical research revealed that modification in the local structure by anion substitution significantly boosts the ionic/electronic transfer kinetics via optimizing the electronic conductivity and reducing the Na+ diffusion energy barrier. Furthermore, the SiO44- substitution generates a slight expansion of the crystal lattice to broaden the Na+ diffusion channel. Specifically, the custom-designed NFPP-Si0.1 could deliver a high rate capability of 77.6 mAh g-1 at constant 50 C charge-discharge and excellent recyclability of 79.4% retention rate after 7000 cycles at 10 C. Besides, it also possesses outstanding low temperature reversible capacity of 95.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and long-term cyclability of 93.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 C in -10 °C. This strategy of heterogeneous and isostructural anion group substitution provides a method for unlocking high-rate and long-life-span mixed polyanionic cathodes.",

The NVP@C produced has rhombohedral NASICON crystal structure and exhibit 3D interlink microstructure with porous morphology and carbon network. The NVP@C prepared at 900 °C display an initial discharge capacity of 99 mAhg−1 at a current density of 1C and ultralong lifespan of 1400 cycles at 10C (73 mAhg−1) with 93 % capacity retention.

This provides a high contact area between electrode/electrolyte, better electronic conductivity, and high mechanical strength. Additionally, this will also responsible for easy diffusion of electrolyte and speedy transport of ions which ultimately helps to accelerate the electrochemical performance. It is noteworthy that the prepared NVP@C shows highly stable electrochemical performance at higher current density (10C) with 100 % columbic efficiency.

        "abstract": "The sodium super ion conductor (NASICON) structure materials have attracted extensive attention because of its open three-dimensional crystal network framework and fast sodium ion migration rate. However, the poor electronic conductivity due to the presence of phosphate groups and the consequent high cost have been a barrier to commercialization. In this work, Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) with three-dimensional porous structure is synthesized in situ using Aspergillus niger as a biological template (noted as NMVP/ANDC). The cell wall of Aspergillus niger is rich in hydroxyl groups, which can adsorb metal ions well, so that NMVP particles can be synthesized on Aspergillus niger without stacking and agglomeration. NMVP grows along Aspergillus niger mycelium has a spongy-like three-dimensional porous network structure, which helps the contact between active materials and electrolyte, reduces the migration distance of sodium ions, and improves the conductivity of active materials. Therefore, NMVP/ANDC has good rate performance and cycle stability. It can provide 109 mAh g\n                     −1 at 0.5 C and 79.6% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5 C. The biological template method is proposed in this paper opens up a simple way for the preparation of other three-dimensional porous network structural materials.",

        "abstract": "Achieving multi‐sodium storage and high operating voltage is key to boosting energy density of NASICON‐type materials. However, the activation of more redox couples is usually accompanied by asymmetric and irreversible electrochemical reactions, thus causing fast capacity fading. To address this issue, a medium‐entropy concept is proposed, and a novel medium‐entropy Na3Mn2/3V2/3Ti2/3(PO4)3/C@CNTs (ME‐NMVTP) cathode is designed. The as‐prepared ME‐NMVTP achieves a successive redox reaction, delivering a highly reversible specific capacity of 147.9 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 together with a long‐term lifespan of 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1 (capacity retention of 88.3%), which is superior to low‐entropy cathodes such as Na4MnV(PO4)3/C@CNTs (LE‐NMVP) and Na3MnTi(PO4)3/C@CNTs (LE‐NMTP). Moreover, benefiting from the entropy effect, solid‐solution and biphasic reactions with reversible structure evolution and small volume change are achieved during the multi‐sodium storage process. First‐principles calculation and kinetic analysis results affirm the enhanced electronic conductivity and facilitated Na+ migration of the ME‐NMVTP cathode derived from the synergistic effect of the three transition‐metal elementals in a medium‐entropy crystalline state. The strategy of engineering medium‐entropy to construct cathodes with superior performance is expected to be widely applicable to other electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) materials have emerged as a promising cathode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, NVP is successfully optimized by dual-doping K/Co and enwrapping carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through a sol-gel method. Naturally, the occupation of K and Co in the Na1 sites and V sites can efficiently stabilize the crystal cell and provide the expanded Na+ transport channels. The existence of tubular CNTs could restrict the crystal grain growth and effectively downsize the particle size and provide a shorter pathway for the migration of electrons and ions. Moreover, the amorphous carbon layers combined with the conductive CNTs form a favorable network for the accelerated electronic transportation. Furthermore, the ex situ XPS characterization reveals that an extra redox reaction pair of Co2+/Co3+ is successfully activated at the high voltage range, resulting in superior capacity and energy density property for KC0.05/CNTs composites. Comprehensively, the optimized KC0.05/CNTs electrode exhibits a distinctive electrochemical property. It delivers an initial reversible capacity of 119.4 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, surpassing the theoretic value for the NVP system (117.6 mA h g-1). Moreover, the KC0.05/CNT electrode exhibits the initial capacity of 113.2 mA h g-1 at 5 C and 105.8 mA h g-1 at 10 C, and the maintained capacities at 500 cycles are 105.8 and 100.8 mA h g-1 with outstanding retention values of 96.6 and 95.3%. Notably, it releases capacities of 99.8 and 84.5 mA h g-1 at 50 and 100 C, and the capacity retention values at 2500 cycles are 66.2 and 58.8 mA h g-1, respectively. What is more, the KC0.05/CNTs//Bi2Se3 asymmetric full cell exhibits a high capacity of 191.4 mA h g-1 at 2.65 V, with the energy density being as high as 507 W h kg-1, demonstrating the eminent practical application potential of KC0.05/CNTs in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the hydrated and dehydrated phases of cubic and monoclinic Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6], focusing on the impact of crystal water on their electrochemical, structural, and volumetric properties. Interstitial and coordination water impact these materials differently. Removing water increases the coulombic attraction between Na+ and N−, reducing ∠Mn-N-C and ∠Fe-C-N angles and decreasing volume. The densification effect is more pronounced in the monoclinic sample due to its higher sodium content. The dehydrated cubic sample (PW-DH-C) has better cycling stability than the monoclinic sample (PW-DH-MC). The reduced cycling stability in PW-DH-MC is due to its denser rhombohedral structure, resulting from its higher sodium content, which affects the ∠Mn-N-C and ∠Fe-C-N angles. Dehydration triggers Jahn-Teller distortion in Mn3+ ions, inducing reversible rhombohedral-to-tetragonal phase transitions during cycling. After 200 cycles, the capacity retention of the dehydrated cubic sample improves to 59 % when exposed to air and reabsorbing moisture, compared to 50 % in its dehydrated state. Similarly, the dehydrated monoclinic sample shows an increase in retention to 28 %, up from 20 % in its dry condition. Additionally, PW-DH-C experiences lower volumetric changes during cycling, attributed to fewer sodium ions and more Fe(CN)6\n                     4− vacancies. These findings highlight water's crucial role in optimizing Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] performance for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides have been widely applied in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, these materials exhibit superlattice structures at specific sodium-ion concentrations and undergo irreversible phase transitions. This work proposes a universal element substitution strategy based on the “diagonal rule”. The two elements located on the diagonal in the periodic table have similar chemical properties and polarization degrees, which can improve the disorder of the atoms, enter specific substitution sites, and obtain pure phases more easily. By adopting the diagonal rule strategy for the Mn element, a Ru-substituted P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material is developed. The disorder in the transition metal layer is enhanced after replacing Mn with its diagonal element Ru. Comprehensive characterizations demonstrate that Ru substitution improves the electrochemical properties of the material, inhibiting irreversible phase transitions. This leads to an increased specific capacity of 168.7 mAh g−1 and enhances the capacity retention from 28.55 % to 73.43 % after 200 cycles at 0.5C. A comparison with materials modified by non-diagonal elements around Mn element further analyzes the advantages of diagonal element substitution. This work provides a universal selection principle of substitution elements based on the diagonal rule, hoping to promote the design of high-stability layered oxides for SIBs.",

In this study, a thin, island-like NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer (∼15 nm) is constructed on the surface of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 through an in situ reaction involving nano-TiO2, Na2CO3 and NH4H2PO4. During the high-temperature calcination process, partial Ti-atom diffusion into the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 lattice results in the expansion of the interslab of the sodium layer and a reduction in lattice oxygen vacancies. Benefitting from the stable NaTi2(PO4)3-modified interface and enhanced structural stability, the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 coated with 2 wt% NaTi2(PO4)3 exhibits optimal cycle stability at high temperature. It retains 90.3% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5C (1C = 130 mA g-1, 45 °C).

As the lithium is replaced with sodium due to the cost motive, a cheap processing method is needed to maintain the cell price as low as possible. We report an ultra-fast synthesis method that utilizes the high microwave absorbance of silicon carbide content in rice straw ash. Amorphous/maricite mixtures of sodium iron phosphates-carbon composites (NaFePO_4-C) are synthesized, crystallized, and carbon coated using one-step microwave heating. The sodium ion electroactive composites are prepared using different microwave heating durations ranging from 30 to 100 s. High purity inert gases are not needed during synthesis, processing, and even at cell assembly. The materials are characterized by elemental analysis techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/transmission electron microscope (SEM/TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized nanocomposites is examined as sodium ion battery cathode and as symmetric supercapacitors. The optimum synthesis time is 60 s for the application as sodium ion batteries and as a supercapacitor. The maximum specific capacity is 108.4 mA h g^−1 at 0.2 C in the case of using it as a battery cathode. While the capacitance is 86 F g^−1 at 0.5 A g^−1 as a supercapacitor.

        "abstract": "Porous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li–S and Na–S batteries. However, for these sub‐nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high‐ionic‐conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na‐ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon‐hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of ≈90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g−1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) for room‐temperature sodium–sulfur batteries.",

First-principles calculations reveal its well-interconnected three-dimensional Na diffusion pathways with low energy barriers, and the two-sodium-extracted intermediate NaTi 0.5 V 0.5 (PO 3 ) 3 N is also a stable phase according to the formation energy calculations.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is recognized as a promising cathode for high energy density sodium-ion batteries due to its high average potential of ∼3.95 V (vs Na/Na+). A high-voltage-resistant electrolyte is of high importance due to the long duration of 4.2 V (vs Na/Na+) when improving cyclability. Herein, a targeted electrolyte containing additives with two -C≡N groups like succinonitrile has been designed. In this design, one -C≡N group is accessible to the solvation sheath and enables the other -C≡N in dinitrile being exposed and subsequently squeezed into the electric double layer. Then, the squeezed -C≡N group is prone to a preferential adsorption on the electrode surface prior to the exposed -CH2/-CH3 in Na+-solvent and oxidized to construct a stable and electrically insulating interface enriched CN-/NCO-/Na3N. The Na3V2(PO4)2F3-based sodium-ion batteries within a high-voltage of 2-4.3 V (vs Na/Na+) can accordingly achieve an excellent cycling stability (e.g., 95.07% reversible capacity at 1 C for 1,5-dicyanopentane and 98.4% at 2 C and 93.0% reversible capacity at 5 C for succinonitrile after 1000 cycles).

The interlayer space between the nanoflakes can provide facile access path for intercalation of sodium ions. The synthesized TiS_2 nanoflakes have been implemented for the fabrication of sodium-ion battery cathode electrode, using a 8:1:1 weight ratio of active material:C65: PVDF for slurry preparation, followed by coating on an aluminum current collector. The prepared electrode exhibits an initial reversible capacity (2nd cycle) of 114 mAh g^−1 at current density of 66.7 mAg^−1. It also showed remarkable coulombic efficiency of 99% after 100 cycles. It also showed superb cycling stability by only 7% decay after 100 cycles. These nanosheets are proposed as a high-performance cathode material for sodium-ion battery.",

        "abstract": "Elemental 2D materials with fascinating characteristics are regarded as an influential portion of the 2D family. Iodine is as a typical monoelemental molecular crystal and exhibits great prospects of applications. To realize 2D iodine, not only is it required to separate the weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, but also to reserve the weak intramolecular halogen bonds; thus, 2D iodine is still unexploited until now. Herein, atomically thin iodine nanosheets (termed “iodinene”) with the thickness around 1.0 nm and lateral sizes up to hundreds of nanometers are successfully fabricated by a liquid‐phase exfoliation strategy. When used for the cathode of rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries, the ultrathin iodinene exhibits superb rate properties with a high specific capacity of 109.5 mA h g−1 at the high rate of 10 A g−1 owing to its unique 2D ultrathin architecture with remarkably enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior. First‐principles calculations reveal that the diffusion of sodium ions in few‐layered iodinene changes from the original horizontal direction in bulk to the vertical with a small energy barrier of 0.07 eV because of the size effect. The successful preparation and intensive structural investigation of iodinene paves the way for the development of novel iodine‐based science and technologies.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as a promising candidate for large-scale renewable energy storage system. Layered manganese oxide cathode possesses the advantages of high energy density, low cost and natural abundance while suffering from limited cycling life and poor rate capacity. To overcome these weaknesses, layer-tunnel hybrid material was developed and served as the cathode of SIB, which integrated high capacity, superior cycle ability, and rate performance. In the current work, the doping of copper was adopted to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and to affect relevant structural parameters. Multifunctions of the Cu2+ doping were carefully investigated. It was found that the structure component ratio is varied with the Cu2+ doping amount. Results demonstrated that Na+/vacancy rearrangement and phase transitions were suppressed during cycling without sacrificing the reversible capacity and enhanced electrochemical performances evidenced with 96 mA h g-1 retained after 250 cycles at 4 C and 85 mA h g-1 at 8 C. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction has demonstrated high reversibility of the Na0.6Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 cathode during Na+ extraction/insertion processes and superior air stability that results in better storage properties. This study reveals that the Cu2+ doping could be an effective strategy to tune the properties and related performances of Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid cathode.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted tremendous attention due to its much lower cost and similar working principle compared with lithium-ion batteries, which have been placed great expectation as energy storage devices in grid-level applications. Sodium superionic conductor structured Na3V2(PO4)3 has been considered as a promising cathode candidate while its intrinsic low electronic conductivity results in poor rate performance and unsatisfactory cycling performance, which severely impedes its potential for practical applications. Herein, we developed a facile one-pot strategy to construct dual carbon protected hybrid structure composed of carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles embedded with carbon matrix with excellent rate performance, superior cycling stability and ultralong lifespan. Specifically, it can deliver an outstanding rate performance with a 51.5% capacity retention from 0.5 to 100 C and extraordinary cycling stability of 80.86% capacity retention after 6000 cycles at the high rate of 20 C. The possible reasons for the enhanced performance could be understood as the synergistic effects of the strengthened structural robust, facilitated charge transfer kinetics and mesoporous feature of the Na3V2(PO4)3 hybrid structure. This work provides a cost-effective strategy to effectively optimize electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, which could contribute to push forward the advance of its practical applications.",

The elimination of diffusion effects in electrochemical measurements enables the assessment of interaction energies from simple cyclic voltammetry experiments through the theoretical work of Laviron and Tokuda. In this work, the two N-substituted perylenes, N,N′-dimethyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (Me2PTCDI) and N,N′-diphenyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (Ph2PTCDI), as well as the parent molecule 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (H2PTCDI) are investigated as thin-film composite electrodes on carbon fibers for sodium-ion batteries. The composite electrodes are analyzed with Raman spectroscopy. Interaction parameters are extracted from cyclic voltammetry measurements. The stability and rate capability of the three PTCDI derivatives are examined through galvanostatic measurements in sodium-ion half-cell batteries and the influence of the interactions on those parameters is evaluated. In addition, self-consistent charge density function tight binding calculations of the different PTCDI systems interacting with graphite have been carried out. The results show that the binding motif displays notable deviations from an ideal ABA stacking, especially for the neutral state. In addition, data obtained for the electron-transfer integrals show that the difference in performance between different PTCDI thin-film batteries cannot be solely explained by the electron-transfer properties and other factors such as H-bonding have to be considered.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxide (NaxTMO2), being one of the most promising cathode candidates for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), have attracted intensive interest because of their nontoxicity, high theoretical capacities, and easy manufacturability. However, their physical and electrochemical properties of water sensitivity, sluggish Na+ transport kinetics, and irreversible multiple‐phase translations hinder the practical application. Here, a concept of surface lattice‐matched engineering is proposed based on in situ spinel interfacial reconstruction to design a spinel coating P2/P3 heterostructure cathode material with enhanced air stability, rate, and cycle performance. The novel structure and its formation process are verified by transmission electron microscopy and in situ high‐temperature X‐ray diffraction. The electrode exhibits an excellent rate performance with the highly reversible phase transformation demonstrated by in situ charging/discharging X‐ray diffraction. Additionally, even after a rigorous water sensitivity test, the electrode materials still retain almost the same superior electrochemical performance as the fresh sample. The results show that the surface spinel phase can play a vital role in preventing the ingress of water molecules, improving transport kinetics, and enhancing structural integrity for NaxTMO2 cathodes. The concept of surface lattice‐matched engineering based on in situ spinel interfacial reconstruction will be helpful for designing new ultra‐stable cathode materials for high‐performance SIBs.",

Herein, we develop an efficient method to fabricate in situ carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanosheets by using cost-effective amylopectin. The amylopectin not only could induce the nucleation of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 along its backbone to form a 2D nanostructure, but also act as a source of amorphous carbon for in situ coating on the active material surface. The composite exhibits extraordinary rate capability (104 mA h g-1 at 40 C, 51 mA h g-1 at 150 C) and desirable cycling stability. Such satisfactory achievements, especially the superior rate performance, should be ascribed to its unique 2D nanostructure which shortens the Na+ diffusion length, and the in situ carbon coating endows the composites with effective electron transport. Even applied to full cells, the obtained devices still display an exceptionally high energy density (94.8 W h kg-1), high power density (7295 W kg-1), and excellent cyclic stability.",

Furthermore, the full-cell achieves an impressive energy density of 440 Wh kg-\n                     1 (for cathode) at 0.2C.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have shown great superiority for grid-scale storage applications because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium. P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode materials have attracted much attention for their high capacities and operating voltages as well as their simple synthesis processes. However, Na+/vacancy ordering and the P2-O2 phase transition are unavoidable during Na+ insertion/extraction, leading to undesired voltage plateaus and deficient battery performances. We show that this defect can be effectually eliminated by coating a moderate Na+ conductor Na2Ti3O7 with a smart in situ coating approach and a concomitant doping of Ti4+ into the bulk structure. Based on the combined analysis of ex situ X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical performance tests, and electrochemical kinetic analyses, Na2Ti3O7 coating and Ti4+ doping effectively refrain Na+/vacancy ordering and P2-O2 phase transition during cycling. Additionally, the Na2Ti3O7 coating layer suppresses particle exfoliation and accelerates Na+ diffusion at the cathode and electrolyte interface. Hence, Na2Ti3O7-coated Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 exhibits excellent cycling stability (almost no capacity decay after 200 cycles at 5 C) and outstanding rate capability (31.1% of the initial capacity at a high rate of 5 C compared to only 10.4% for the pristine electrode). This coating strategy can provide a new guide for the design of prominent cathode materials for SIBs that are suitable for practical applications.",

Besides, the enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and thermodynamics in the modified sample are associated with the enlarged lattice parameters. As a result, the proposed cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 142.6 mAh g-1 at 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.3 V and excellent performance at a high mass loading of 8 mg cm3 with a specific capacity of 131 mAh g-1 at 0.2C.

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries are attractive as an alternative to Li-ion batteries because of their lower cost. Organic compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials due to their environmental friendliness and molecular diversity. Herein, aluminum-coordinated poly(tetrahydroxybenzoquinone) (P(THBQ-Al)), one of the coordination polymers, is introduced for the first time as a promising cathode for Na-ion batteries. P(THBQ-Al) is synthesized through a facile coordination reaction between benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate (C6O6H22-) and Al3+ as ligands and complex metal ions, respectively. Tetrahydroxybenzoquinone is environmentally sustainable, because it can be obtained from natural resources such as orange peels. Benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate also contributes to delivering high reversible capacity, because each benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate unit is capable of two electron reactions through the sodiation of its conjugated carbonyl groups. Electrochemically inactive Al3+ improves the structural stability of P(THBQ-Al) during cycling because of a lack of a change in its oxidation state. Moreover, P(THBQ-Al) is thermally stable and insoluble in nonaqueous electrolytes. These result in excellent electrochemical performance including a high reversible capacity of 113 mA h g-1 and stable cycle performance with negligible capacity fading over 100 cycles. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of P(THBQ-Al) is clarified through ex situ XPS and IR analyses, in which the reversible sodiation of C═O into C-O-Na is observed.",

        "abstract": "The phase transition and lattice parameter evolution of O3 structure commonly occurs in O3-type sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes, which might enlarge the voltage hysteresis and lower the energy efficiency. Given that the cost is one of the issues discouraging the application of SIBs in large-scale energy storage, here we focus on Co/Ni-free NaxCu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 (x = 0.8, 0.85, 0.9) and propose a convenient strategy to reduce the voltage hysteresis. It is found that when the Na content is 0.8, the highest energy efficiency of 95.4% after activation is achieved (2.5-4.0 V, 50 mA g-1, the 50th cycle), in addition to a satisfactory capacity retention (about 0.056% decay per cycle). The further characterizations reveal that Na0.8Cu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 owns a gentle O3-P3 phase transition process and does not undergo O3 phase lattice parameter evolution. The key point lies in the attainability of the O3/P3 composite of the material. This work will provide a simple strategy for the rational design of O3-type cathodes with a high energy efficiency and might offer inspiration to search for layered oxides with a higher O3/P3 critical Na content through element adjustments.",

Herein, a \"water-in-salt\" nanoreactor is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs with decreased defects and water, which show both superior specific capacity and rate capability in SIBs. The air-stability, all-climate, and full-cell properties of our PBA have also been evaluated, and it exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and higher volume yield than its counterpart synthesized via the water-based co-precipitation method. Furthermore, their highly reversible sodium-ion storage behavior has been measured and identified via multiple in situ techniques.

X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy studies established the presence of Na3V2(PO4)3 and Ni2P, respectively, in the NVP-NP/C composite. As a cathode material, the obtained NVP-NP/C composite electrode exhibits higher discharge capacities (100.8 mAhg-1 at 10.8 C and 73.9 mAhg-1 at 34 C) than the NVP/C counterpart electrode (62.7 mAhg-1 at 10.8 C and 4.7 mAhg-1 at 34 C), and the composite electrode retained 95.3% of the initial capacity even after 1500 cycles at 16 C. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the synergetic effect of the Ni2P phase and nanoscale NVP particles, which ultimately results in noticeably enhancing the electrical conductivity of the composite. The present study thus demonstrates that the Na3V2(PO4)3-Ni2P/C nanocomposite is a prospective candidate for NIB with a high power/energy density.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have aroused intense research and academic interest due to the natural abundance and cost-effectiveness of sodium resources. Presently, cathode materials based on the Na3(VO1-xPO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, NVPF1+2x) polyanionic framework show intriguing electrochemical performances toward practical and advanced SIBs due to its high operating voltage (>3.9 V) and high energy density (>500 Wh kg-1). Different from conventional approaches focusing on delicate morphology design, metal ion substitution, and the conductive matrix's incorporation to overcome the low intrinsic electrical conductivity, here we adopt a one-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach to optimize the electrochemical performances of NVPF1+2x via manipulating its phase compositions with different vanadium sources and distinguishing the tetragonal (I4/mmm) symmetry of the Na3(VOPO4)2F phase from the orthorhombic symmetry (Amam) of the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 phase. The introduction of the conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO) framework and its impacts on the phase compositions were systematically investigated. The rGO framework with different calcination temperature can alter the phase composition and the electrical conductivity of NVPF1+2x cathodes significantly, thus having a great impact on their electrochemical performances. Galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique are adopted to compare their electrode polarization and kinetics difference and show that NVPF@rGO-600 °C possesses a high rate, small polarization, and fast kinetics electrochemical properties. This work provides new insights into manipulating phase compositions of the NVPF1+2x cathode by modulating the synthesis conditions and revealing their synergistic effect with a rGO conductive framework toward a superior rate capability and more realistic practical applications for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The growing need to store an increasing amount of renewable energy in a sustainable way has rekindled interest for sodium-ion battery technology, owing to the natural abundance of sodium. Presently, sodium-ion batteries based on Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3/C are the subject of intense research focused on improving the energy density by harnessing the third sodium, which has so far been reported to be electrochemically inaccessible. Here, we are able to trigger the activity of the third sodium electrochemically via the formation of a disordered Na_ x V_2(PO_4)_2F_3 phase of tetragonal symmetry ( I 4 /mmm space group). This phase can reversibly uptake 3 sodium ions per formula unit over the 1 to 4.8 V voltage range, with the last one being re-inserted at 1.6 V vs Na^+/Na^0. We track the sodium-driven structural/charge compensation mechanism associated to the new phase and find that it remains disordered on cycling while its average vanadium oxidation state varies from 3 to 4.5. Full sodium-ion cells based on this phase as positive electrode and carbon as negative electrode show a 10–20% increase in the overall energy density. Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3 is a promising cathode material for Na-ion batteries, although its third sodium is usually not accessible electrochemically. Here the authors realize a disordered tetragonal NVPF phase, which can reversibly uptake 3 Na-ions and enables improved energy density for the NVPF/C full cell.",

In this report, a chemical approach is presented to partially replace Mn2+ of the NVMP framework by Mg2+ and Al3+ substitutions. The Mg- and Al-substituted NVMP cathodes present smoother voltage profiles, facile sodium (de)intercalation, enhanced rate performances (80 mA h g-1 at 5C rate) and capacity retention (≈96% after 100 cycles) in comparison with the unsubstituted sample. Their enhanced performances are attributed to suppressed Jahn-Teller effect, increased covalent character and sodium ion vacancies of the NASICON framework.

Here, we challenge to minimize the effect of the Jahn-Teller distortion caused by Mn3+ in the structure, via substitution of Mn3+ by Co3+ in P2-Na2/3[Mn1-xCox]O2 (x = 0 - 0.3). P2-Na2/3[Mn0.8Co0.2]O2 compound substantializes electrochemical performance with a capacity of about 175 mAh g-1 (26 mA g-1), and retained over 90 % of its initial capacity for 300 cycles at 0.1C (26 mA g-1) and 10C (2.6 A g-1). Operando X-ray diffraction study indicates that a single-phase reaction is associated with the insertion of sodium ions into the structure, accompanied by a small volume change approximately 3%. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that crystal structure remained after continuous 300 cycles. It is believed that such good electrode performances attribute to the structural stabilization assisted by the presence of Co3+ in the crystal structure.

        "abstract": "Regulating redox kinetics is able to spur the great‐leap‐forward development of room‐temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries, especially on propelling their Na‐ion storage capability. Here, an innovative metal oxide kinetics accelerator, orthorhombic Nb2O5 Na‐ion conductor, is proposed to functionalize porous carbon nanoreactors (CNR) for S cathodes. The Nb2O5 is shown to chemically immobilize sodium polysulfides via strong affinity. Theoretical and experimental evidence reveals that the Nb2O5 can bidirectionally regulate redox behaviors of S cathodes, which accelerates reduction conversions from polysulfides to sulfides as well as promotes oxidation reactions from sulfides to S. In situ and ex situ characterization techniques further verify its electrochemical lasting endurance in catalyzing S conversions. The well‐designed S cathode demonstrates a high specific capacity of 1377 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, outstanding rate capability of 405 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, and stable cyclability with a capacity retention of 617 mA h g−1 over 600 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. An ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0193% per cycle is successfully realized, superior to those of current state‐of‐the‐art RT Na–S batteries. This design also suits emerging Na–Se batteries, which contribute to outstanding electrochemical performance as well.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted extensive attention due to their inherently sufficient Na content, which have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for practical applications. However, influenced by the irreversible oxygen loss and the phase transition of O3-P3, the O3-type cathodes are always limited by low cutoff voltages (typically <4.2 V), restraining the full release of the capacity. In this study, we originally propose a dual-reductive coupling mechanism in a novel O3-type Na0.8Li0.2Fe0.2Ru0.6O2 cathode with the suppressed O3-P3 phase transition, aiming at improving the reversibility of oxygen redox at high voltage regions. Consequently, thanks to the formation of the strong covalent Fe/Ru-(O-O) bonding and inhibited slab gliding from the O to P phase, the cathode delivers the preeminent cyclic stability among the numerous O3-type cathodes within a high voltage of 4.5 V (a capacity retention of 95.4% after 100 cycles within 1.5-4.5 V). More importantly, HAADF-STEM and 7Li solid-state NMR results reveal the absence of transition metal migration and the presence of reversible Li migration during cycling, which further contributes to the improved structural robustness of the cathode. This study proposes an innovative strategy to boost the reversibility of anionic redox and to achieve stable high-voltage O3-type layered oxides, promoting the further development of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode is deemed to be a promising candidate for sodium ion batteries due to its strong structural stability and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, its poor intrinsic conductivity restricts further development. To overcome these shortcomings, a dual modification strategy of Mn2+/Ti4+ co-substitution is proposed for the first time. Significantly, Mn doping can efficiently accelerate the transmission speed of electrons by introducing beneficial holes derived from the low valence state of +2, presenting the classical p-type doping modification. Moreover, the presence of Mn2+ with a larger ionic radius can support the crystal to stabilize the Na superionic conductor (NASICON) framework of the NVP system. Ti4+ is introduced for perfect charge compensation. Accordingly, the addition of Ti4+ can generate excess electrons due to the n-type substitution, which contributes to the favorable electronic conductivity. In addition, conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are utilized to construct an efficient network to improve the rate capability of the NVP composite. Meanwhile, CNTs can inhibit particle growth and thus reduce particle size, shortening the transport path of Na+ and promoting the diffusion of Na+. Comprehensively, the optimized Na3V2-xMnxTix(PO4)3/C@CNTs (x = 0.15) deliver high capacities of 70.3 and 68.2 mA h g-1 at 90C and 180C, maintaining 58 and 53.8 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles with high capacity retention of 82.5% and 78.9%.",

Herein, we propose a highly-scalable strategy for the facile synthesis of a freestanding alluaudite Na2+2xFe2-x(SO4)3@porous carbon-nanofiber hybrid film, which is used as a self-supported and flexible electrode for sodium ion batteries. By the combined use of electrospinning and electrospraying, the freestanding hybrid film is constructed in the form of sulfate nanoparticles enwrapped in highly porous graphitic-like carbon-nanofibers. The multimodal porous architecture of the freestanding hybrid film ensures its superiority in mechanical flexibility and structural stability during repeated electrochemical processes, which meets the long-standing challenge of practical application. Moreover, both the highly conductive and porous framework and the nanoscale particles are favorable for promoting fast electron/ion transport capability. Compared with other carbon based supports such as graphene (GA), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active carbons (ACs), the flexible carbon nanofiber shows better interaction with electrochemical active materials and superior electrochemical properties. It retains over 95% of the capacity after five hundred cycles at alternate rates of 40C and 5C, which demonstrates the superior ultralong time and high-rate cycling capability.

        "abstract": "P2‐phase layered cathode materials with distinguished electrochemical performance for sodium‐ion batteries have attracted extensive attention, but they face critical challenges of transition metal layer sliding and unfavorable formation of hydration phase upon cycling, thus showing inferior long cycle life. Herein, a new approach is reported to modulate the local structure of P2 material by constructing a state‐of‐the‐art in‐plane BO3 triangle configuration ((Na0.67Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6O1.94(BO3)0.02). Both are unveiled experimentally and theoretically that such a structure can serve as a robust pillar to hold up the entire structure, by inhibiting the H2O insertion upon Na (de)intercalation and preventing the structure from deformation, which significantly boost the long cycle capability of P2‐materials. Meanwhile, more Na ions in the architecture are enabled to site on the edge sharing octahedrons (Nae), thus benefiting the Na+ transportation. Consequently, the as produced material demonstrates an ultralow volume variation (1.8%), and an outstanding capacity retention of 80.1% after 1000 cycles at 2 C. This work sheds light on efficient architecture modulation of layered oxides through proper nonmetallic element doping.",

        "abstract": "Cubic-framework sodium cobalt-based metaphosphate NaCo(PO3)3 was recently demonstrated to be an attractive Na+ cationic conductor. It can be potentially used in the next-generation rechargeable Na ion batteries. The crystal structure and electrical conductivity were studied and found to have a three-dimensional framework with interconnecting tunnels for Na+ migration ( J. Solid State Electrochem. , 2016 , 20 , 1241 ). This inspired us to study the electrochemical (de)intercalation behavior of Na+ in the NaCo(PO3)3 assuming a cubic Pa3̅ framework. Herein, synergizing experimental and computational tools, we present the first report on the electrochemical activity and Na+ diffusion pathway analysis of cubic NaCo(PO3)3 prepared via conventional solid-state route. The electrochemical analyses reveal NaCo(PO3)3 to be an active sodium insertion material with well-defined reversible Co3+/Co2+ redox activity centered at 3.3 V (vs Na/Na+). Involving a solid-solution redox mechanism, close to 0.7 Na+ per formula unit can be reversibly extracted. This experimental finding is augmented with bond valence site energy (BVSE) modeling to clarify Na+ migration in cubic NaCo(PO3)3. BVSE analyses suggest feasible Na+ migration with moderate energy barrier of 0.68 eV. Cubic NaCo(PO3)3 forms a 3.3 V sodium insertion material.",

Herein, negative lattice expansion is observed in an O3 type Ni-based layered cathode of Na0.9Ni0.32Zn0.08Fe0.1Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 upon Na+ extraction. It is attributed to the weak Zn2+-O2- orbital hybridization and increased electron density of the surrounding oxygen for reinforced interlayer O-O repulsive force. This enables gliding of TMO slabs for the intergrowth phase transition of P3→OP2 to alleviate lattice strain with moderate lattice shrinkage, which exhibits general interslab spacings and volume changes as low as 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively. The strong Ti-O bonds accommodate the internal distortion of TMO6 octahedra due to the flexibility of TiO6 octahedra during cycling.

Detailed structural, morphological, and electrochemical investigations were carried out using X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, and some new insights are proposed. Rietveld refinement confirmed that Al doping caused TMO6 octahedra (TM = transition metal) shrinkage, resulting in wider interlayer spacing. After optimizing the aluminum concentration, the cathode exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance, with better stability and improved rate performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at various states of charge to probe the surface and bulk effects of Al doping. The material presented here exhibits exceptional stability over 100 cycles within a 1.5-4.3 V window and outperforms several other Mn-Co-based cathodes for SIBs.

        "abstract": "Prussian blue and its analogues (PB/PBAs) are promising sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to their easy synthesis and excellent discharge capacity. However, their low structural stability poses a challenge. One critical factor affecting stability is the charge cutoff voltage. Increasing this voltage can enhance lithium-ion battery capacity but may reduce cycle retention due to intensified electrode-electrolyte interface reactions. This study investigates whether this phenomenon also applies to sodium-ion batteries and proposes an optimal voltage to improve both the capacity and stability. By cycling between 3.8 and 4.2 V, the charge/discharge profiles and redox reaction intensity were analyzed. The correlation between structural stability and charge cutoff voltage was re-evaluated based on these findings. An optimal charge cutoff voltage of 4.1 V was identified, creating an additional plateau during initial charging and altering Na+ ion positioning to enhance capacity. Enhanced mobility of ions and electrons was observed through a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed reversible phase transitions and excellent structural stability. This study underscores the strategic use of charge cutoff voltage to enhance both discharge capacity and structural stability, offering insights for advancing PB/PBA cathode materials with improved stability and capacity.",

        "abstract": "Na-rich manganese-based layered oxide cathodes have presented potential applications in high energy–density sodium-ion batteries due to their cost-effectiveness and large theoretical specific capacity. However, the low kinetics of anionic redox reaction and lattice distortion caused by the Mn3+ Jahn-teller effect greatly hindered the actual capacity, rate, and cycling performances of these cathodes. Herein, a Li+ substitution induced O3/O′3 biphasic tailoring strategy has been proposed for constructing the Na-rich NaLi0.2Mn0.8O2 (NLMO) cathode. Compared with conventional O′3-Na1.2Mn0.8O2 (NMO) cathode, the O3/O′3-NLMO cathode enabled to provide an ultrahigh capacity of 233 mAh g−1, superior capacity retention of 86 % after 50 cycles, and outstanding rate performance with the recorded-up capacity of 165 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 200 mA g−1. In addition, NLMO also displayed rapid Na+-diffusion and more structural reversibility of O3/O′3-P3-O1-P3-O3/O′3 during the entire charging and discharging processes. The above excellent performances of NLMO cathode could be attributed to the well-designed O3/O′3 biphasic structure that provides the synergistic function of drastically enhancing reaction kinetics of anionic (O−/O2–) couple and efficiently alleviating multiphase transitions caused by Mn4+/Mn3+ cationic couple. This unique finding of Li+ substitution induced biphasic structure provides an insight for developing economical and high-performance Na-rich oxide cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxide cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries often experience irreversible phase transitions and structural instability. Now researchers have developed a P2-type oxide containing earth-abundant elements, featuring an intergrowth phase structure that enables long-cycle, high-energy sodium-ion batteries. In P2-type layered transition metal (TM) oxides, which are typical cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, the presence of Li within the TM layer could lead to the formation of specific Na–O–Li configurations that trigger additional oxygen redox at high charging voltages. However, the prismatic-type (P-type) to octahedral-type (O-type) phase transition and irreversible TM migration could be simultaneously aggravated in high state of charge, resulting in structural distortion. Here we demonstrate that excessive desodiation of P2-Na_0.67Li_0.1Fe_0.37Mn_0.53O_2 (NLFMO) induces the formation of neighbouring O-type stacking faults with an intergrowth structure (that is, interlacing of O- and P-type layers), which leads to out-of-lattice Li migration and irreversible oxygen loss. We show that, by controlling the depth of charge to tailor the intergrowth structure, a P-type stacking state can be uniformly interspersed between the O-type stacking state, thereby avoiding neighbouring O-type stacking faults. Adjusting the O/P intergrowth structure leads to both reversible migration of Li/TM ions and reversible anionic redox in the NLFMO cathode. We thereby achieve a high-performance pouch cell (with an energy density of 165 W h kg^−1 based on the entire weight of the cell) with both cationic and anionic redox activities.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides, in particular P2-type ones, are considered as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries on account of their high specific capacity and rate capability. Nevertheless, conventional layered compounds involve detrimental phase transformation throughout repeated cycles, which results in electrochemical performance degradation. Therefore, finding structurally stable layered compounds, featuring minimal phase transition has been a key theme of the sodium-ion battery research. Here lithium substituted Fe/Mn-based P2/O3 layered oxide-Na0.67 Li0.2 Fe0.2 Mn0.6 O2 -that overcomes the inherited structural instability, is reported. In situ synchrotron-based diffraction measurements and DFT calculations are utilized, in order to identify the association between P2/O3 biphasic structure and electrochemical performances. The lithium honeycomb ordering within the P2/O3 biphasic layered compound effectively constrains the undesirable phase transitions; more specifically, both P2-Z phase transition and Jahn-Teller distortion are suppressed throughout wide potential range of 1.5-4.5 V. The DFT calculation further discovers that the presence of honeycomb ordering is crucial for achieving the structural stability by forming Na-vac-Li and Na-Li-Na pairing at highly charged state. The results highlight that the synergetic effect of P2/O3 biphasic structure and lithium substitution can provide an effective strategy toward achieving electrochemically stable layered cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the strong basicity and reactivity, residual sodium compounds (RSCs) on the surface of Na-based layered oxides for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) cause the deterioration of the electrochemical performance and processability of the oxide cathode materials. Herein, considering P2-type Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 as the model material, the water-washing treatment is proven to be a facile, economic, and highly efficient method to improve the electrochemical performance of P2-type Ni/Mn-based layered oxides. Experimental results show that RSCs on material surfaces can be effectively removed by water washing without causing severe damage to the bulk structure. Notably, water washing triggers the formation of an ultrathin (2-3 nm thick) Na-poor disordered interfacial layer on the surface of Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2. This layer plays a passivating role in further enhancing the material's resistance to water and reduces the reactivity of the material surface with the electrolyte. These compositional and structural optimizations for P2-type Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 effectively suppress the release of gaseous CO2, formation of thick cathode-electrolyte interphase films, and consumption of active Na+, enabling good Na+ transport kinetics during cycling. The water-washed Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 exhibits significantly improved cycling stability with a capacity retention of 89.1% at 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles and rate capability with a discharge capacity of 76.3 mA g-1 at 2000 mA g-1; these values are higher than those of the unwashed Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 (83.3%, 71.4 mA h g-1).

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are widely used as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their stable framework structure, simple synthesis method, and low fabrication cost. However, during the synthesis process, a large number of [Fe(CN)6]4− vacancies are easily caused, which leads to the destruction of crystal structure and the rapid decay of discharge capacity. In this work, the effect of sodium salts on lattice defects and electrochemical properties of iron hexacyanoferrates (FeHCF) was studied by adding different sodium salts (Na2SO4, NaCl, C6H5Na3O7, and EDTA-2Na) in the room-temperature coprecipitation method. It was found that the synthesis of FeHCF by adding Na2SO4 based on the chelating agent can not only increase the atomic ratio of Na+ but also effectively reduce [Fe(CN)6]4− vacancy defects and significantly increase the capacity contribution of low-spin Fe redox reaction. Due to the reduction of [Fe(CN)6]4− vacancy defects, the crystal structure is not easy to be destroyed during the cycle process, and the cycle stability of FeHCF is significantly improved. The sample shows good electrochemical performance, with a discharge capacity of 130.8 mAh g−1 in the first cycle and 114.3 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. This work provides a new way to synthesize PBAs with low [Fe(CN)6]4− vacancy defects.",

The implementation of the high-entropy concept exhibits crucial selectivity toward the intrinsic crystal structure. Specifically, while the overall cycling stability of both cathode systems is significantly improved, the synergistic interplay of crystal structure engineering and entropy proves particularly significant.

The microspheres were covered and embedded by CNTs, the surfaces of which were also covered by amorphous carbon layers. Thus, a carbon network composed of CNTs and amorphous carbon layers formed in the materials. The polarization of a 10 wt % CNT-decorated NVP (NVP/C10) electrode was much less compared with that of the electrode with pristine NVP without CNTs. The capacity of the NVP/C10 electrode only decreased from 103.2 to 76.2 mAh g-1 when the current rates increased from 0.2 to 60 C. Even when cycled at a rate of 20 C, the initial discharge capacity of the NVP/C10 electrode was as high as 91.2 mAh g-1, and the discharge capacity was 76.9 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles. The charge-transfer resistance and ohmic resistance became smaller because of CNT decorating. Meanwhile, the addition of CNTs can tune the size of the NVP particles and increase the contact area between NVP and the electrolyte. Consequently, the resulted NVP had a larger sodium ion diffusion coefficient than that of the pristine NVP.",

The achieved NNMMO cathode exhibits a high-rate capability with a reversible capacity of 77.2 mAh/g at 10 C and a long cycle life with a capacity retention of 75% at 2 C after 1000 cycles. In addition, in situ X-ray diffraction and ex-situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy characterizations verify that the presence of Mo6+ also stabilizes the desodiated structure through a pinning effect, achieving an extremely low volume change of 1.04% upon Na+ extraction. The quantified diffusional analysis and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Mo6+ doping improves the Na+ diffusion kinetics, optimizes the energy band structure and enhances the TM-O bond strength. Additionally, the as-fabricated pouch cells by paring NNMMO cathode and hard carbon anode show impressive cycling stability with an energy density of 296.7 Wh/kg.

In this work, a double design host and guest strategy (i.e., implantation of a polar V2O3 adsorbent into a carbon substrate and selenium doping of a sulfur guest) is proposed to synergistically reinforce the electrochemical properties of sulfur electrodes in sodium ion storage. The V2O3 adsorbent efficiently immobilizes sulfur species via strong polar–polar interactions, while the selenium dopant improves the electronic conductivity of sulfur cathodes and accelerates the redox conversion of sulfur cathodes. The synergistic effect between the V2O3 adsorbent and selenium dopant is shown to inhibit the shuttle effect and improve the redox kinetics, thus realizing greatly enhanced Na-ion storage properties of sulfur cathodes. The as-designed sulfur cathode delivers a superior rate capability of 663 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1 and demonstrates excellent cyclability of 405 mA h g−1 over 700 cycles at 1.0 A g−1.",

        "abstract": "In P2-type layered oxide cathodes, Na site-regulation strategies are proposed to modulate the Na+ distribution and structural stability. However, their impact on the oxygen redox reactions remains poorly understood. Herein, the incorporation of K+ in the Na layer of Na0.67Ni0.11Cu0.22Mn0.67O2 is successfully applied. The effects of partial substitution of Na+ with K+ on electrochemical properties, structural stability, and oxygen redox reactions have been extensively studied. Improved Na+ diffusion kinetics of the cathode is observed from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and rate performance. The valence states and local structural environment of the transition metals (TMs) are elucidated via operando synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). It is revealed that the TMO2 slabs tend to be strengthened by K-doping, which efficiently facilitates reversible local structural change. Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) further confirms more reversible phase changes during the charge/discharge for the cathode after K-doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that oxygen redox reaction in Na0.62K0.03Ni0.11Cu0.22Mn0.67O2 cathode has been remarkably suppressed as the nonbonding O 2p states shift down in the energy. This is further corroborated experimentally by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy, ultimately proving the role of K+ incorporated in the Na layer.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are attractive cathode candidates for high energy density, including long life-cycle rechargeable batteries, due to their non-toxicity, facile synthesis techniques and low cost. Nevertheless, traditionally synthesized PBAs tend to have a flawed crystal structure with a large amount of [Fe(CN)6]4− openings and the presence of crystal water in the framework; therefore the specific capacity achieved has continuously been low with poor cycling stability. Herein, we demonstrate low-defect and sodium-enriched nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocrystals synthesized by a facile low-speed co-precipitation technique assisted by a chelating agent to overcome these problems. As a consequence, the prepared high-quality nickel hexacyanoferrate (HQ-NiHCF) exhibited a high specific capacity of 80 mA h g−1 at 15 mA g−1 (with a theoretical capacity of ∼85 mA h g−1), maintaining a notable cycling stability (78 mA h g−1 at 170 mA g−1 current density) without noticeable fading in capacity retention after 1200 cycles. This low-speed synthesis strategy for PBA-based electrode materials could be also extended to other energy storage materials to fabricate high-performance rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "We reported a rhombohedral Na-rich nickel hexacyanoferrate (r-NiHCF) with high discharge voltage, which also possesses long cycle stability and excellent rate capability when serving as the cathode material of Na-ion batteries. First-principles calculations suggest that the high working voltage of r-NiHCF is correlated to the asymmetric residence of Na+ ions in the rhombohedral framework in parallel with the low charge density at the Fe2+ ions. In both aqueous and ether-based electrolytes, r-NiHCF exhibits higher voltage than that of cubic NiHCF. Rate and cycle experiments indicate that r-NiHCF delivers a specific capacity of 66.8 mAh g-1 at the current density of 80 mA g-1, which is approximate to the theoretical capacity of r-NiHCF. A capacity retention of 96% can be achieved after 200 cycles. The excellent stability of r-NiHCF can be assigned to the absence of rhombohedral-cubic phase transition and negligible volume variation during electrochemical redox, as proven by the ex situ XRD patterns at different depths of charge/discharge and the DFT calculations, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Engineering high-performance layered oxide cathode materials is crucial for promoting the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). One highly effective method by biphasic hybridization (such as P2/O3) is typically used to enhance reversible capacity and cycling stability.

Here, an insight into thermodynamics origin is unveiled within P2/O3 Na2/3Li1/18Ni5/18Mn5/18Ti5/18Fe2/18O2 (NLNMTF) biphasic layered cathodes, in which thermodynamics and crystal structure are designed to improve reversible capacity and cycling performance. The NLNMTF3 cathode optimized upon 15 h of calcination, which is the most thermodynamically favorable as revealed by density functional theory calculations, exhibits both the maximum O3-phase content (70.27%) and the enlarged Na interlayer distance. Significantly, the NLNMTF3 cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 97.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, superior rate capability of 78.8 mAh g−1 at 5C, and excellent capacity retention of 85.5% after 500 cycles at 1C.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐based layered oxide cathodes are competitive candidates for commercial sodium‐ion batteries owing to their high theoretical capacities, low costs, and simple synthesis. P3‐type layered oxides with large open channels enable fast Na+ transport and hence good rate performance. However, the lower crystal symmetry of P3‐type oxides and variation of Na+ contents in the Na layer during desodiation/sodiation lead to large electrostatic repulsion changes between TMO2 slabs (TM=Transition Metal), resulting in irreversible phase transitions, and fast performance degradation. Herein, a potential Na+ conductor Na2SeO4 is first found that it can be easily in situ grown on P3‐Na0.45Ni0.2Mn0.8O2 to form a novel heterostructure P3‐Na0.45Ni0.2Mn0.8O2/Na2SeO4. The synergy between P3‐Na0.45Ni0.2Mn0.8O2 and Na2SeO4 functions in promoting Na+ diffusion and suppressing P3‐O3 phase transitions upon deep sodiation, which results in recorded high‐rate capability (68.2% capacity retention with retained 83.9 mAh g−1 capacity at 6400 mA g−1) and superior cycling stability (capacity retention 75% after 1000 cycles) among all reported P3‐type cathodes.

        "abstract": "Recently, NASICON-type Na4VMn(PO4)3, as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), has received widespread attention owing to its high working voltage, high theoretical capacity, and fast Na+ migration kinetics. Unfortunately, serious structural deformation issue, caused by the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+, is still inevitable during repetitive charge/discharge processes, resulting in fast capacity fade. Therefore, designing a stable structure is crucial for developing practical vanadium manganese-based NASICON-type electrode materials. Herein, Zn2+-doped NASICON-type Na4VMn1−xZnx(PO4)3 can reduce Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and expand the migration pathways of mobile Na+ ions. When being used as cathode materials for SIBs, Na4VMn0.9Zn0.1(PO4)3/C can provide 77.6% capacity retention at 1100 mA g−1 after the 500th cycle, which is much higher than that (67.6%) of Zn-undoped Na4VMn(PO4)3/C. Moreover, the reversible reactions of Mn3+/Mn2+ and V4+/V3+ redox couples are validated by ex-situ Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of electrode materials cycled at different charge and discharge voltages. The fast reaction kinetics of the Na4VMn0.9Zn0.1(PO4)3/C electrode is confirmed via Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). This research work offers an effective approach for devising high operation stability NASICON-type cathode materials for SIBs by pinning effect.",

Here we address this issue by introducing high-entropy doping regulation strategies, a series of NaNi0.4Mn0.3-xFe0.1Ti0.1SnxLi0.05Sb0.05O2 cathodes exhibit an excellent rate performance (>60 mAh g−1 at 6 A g−1) and prolonged cycle performance (capacity retention >80 % after 300 cycles, at 120 mA g−1).

These studies revealed a P3-phase dominated solid-solution reaction during the charge/discharge process that boosts the sodium ions migration in the structure. This study provides a model for effective simultaneous electrochemical evaluation and structure evolution analysis of the multi-elements high-entropy metal oxide cathodes.

Many of these materials, however, are plagued with voltage fade, voltage hysteresis and O2 loss, the origins of which can be traced back to changes in their electronic and chemical structures on cycling. Developing a detailed understanding of these changes is critical to mitigating these cathodes’ poor performance. In this work, we present an analysis of the redox mechanism of P2–Na0.67[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2, a layered NIB cathode whose high capacity has previously been attributed to trapped O2 molecules. We examine a variety of charge compensation scenarios, calculate their corresponding densities of states and spectroscopic properties, and systematically compare the results to experimental data: 25Mg and 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, operando X-band and ex situ high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), ex situ magnetometry, and O and Mn K-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES). Via a process of elimination, we suggest that the mechanism for O redox in this material is dominated by a process that involves the formation of strongly antiferromagnetic, delocalized Mn–O states which form after Mg2+ migration at high voltages. Our results primarily rely on noninvasive techniques that are vital to understanding the electronic structure of metastable cycled cathode samples.",

However, the rigid pre‐intercalated ions hardly keep stable during repeated charging/discharging process and their sizes limit the extent of interlayer spacing expansion, which inevitably lead to poor rate capability and cycle stability. In this work, aliphatic diamines are adopted as pre‐intercalated guests to elastically modulate the interlayer spacing of VO layers by tuning the chain length of the organic diamine molecules. Benefiting from the strong interaction between the terminal doubly protonated amine and the polar negative oxygen bridge of the VO layers, the aliphatic diamine molecules can act as a structural stabilizer between the layers and boost fast Na ion diffusion (10−8 to 10−10 cm2 s−1). The sodium ion battery based on the first synthesized 1,6‐hexanediamine pre‐intercalated vanadium oxide supported on nickel foam hybrid cathode achieves a large specific capacity of 597 mAh g−1 at 0.09 A g−1, as well as superior rate performance and cycling stability.

        "title": "Quasi‐Zero Volume Strain Cathode Materials for Sodium Ion Battery through Synergetic Substitution Effect of Li and Mg",
        "abstract": "P2‐type layered oxide material Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is a competitive candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it suffers from the strong P2–O2 phase transition during charging to the high voltage regime, rendering drastic volume variations and poor cycling performance. Here, a Quasi‐zero strain P2‐Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 cathode is synthesized, which reflects the vanishing P2–O2 transition with a volume change as low as 0.49%, thus resulting in the material an excellent cycling performance (83.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C). The low‐volume strain can be attributed to two aspects: (1) the Mg2+ riveted in the Na layer can act as a “pillar” to stabilize the crystal structure under the condition of sodium removal, thus restricting the structural changes under high voltage. (2) The entry of Li+ into the transition metal (TM) layer can mitigate the electron localization in the highly desodiation state and can effectively immobilize the coordination oxygen atoms, thus suppressing the slip of P2–O2 transition. This study not only provides a new insight of Li and Mg synergetic substitution effect on the structural stability of P2‐type cathode, but also an efficient avenue for developing cathode materials of SIBs with ultralow bulk strain.",

        "abstract": "The Mn-based Natrium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type materials are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their environmental friendliness and cost-effectiveness. However, the practical application of Mn-based materials is hindered by their poor cycle performance, arising from intrinsic kinetic limitation and negative structural degradation caused byMn. Herein, a Mn-based ternary NASICON-type Na3.5MnTi0.5Cr0.5(PO4)3/C (NMTCP-50) is designed featuring multi-metal synergy with enhanced effect from each component, which contributes to breaking through the bottleneck of inferior cycle performance for Mn-based NASICON-type materials. The results of ex-situ X-ray diffraction corroborate that both solid-solution and bi-phase electrochemical reactions are involved in the sodiation/desodiation processes, and the volume variation is only 2.55 %. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique tests and density functional theory calculations further demonstrate the fast reaction kinetics of the NMTCP-50 electrode. NMTCP-50 can deliver an excellent cycling durability of 75 % after 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1 and a high reversible capacity of 137.6 mAh g−1. The availability of NMTCP-50 has been evaluated by a full cell assembled with hard carbon. This work offers theoretical support for understanding the multi-metal synergistic effect in NASICON materials and provides a blueprint for designing low-cost NASICON cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) materials have emerged as prospective cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its weak intrinsic conductivity has limited deeper research. Herein, we adopt the strategy of simultaneous K/Co co-substitution and Ti3C2Tx MXene (MX) introduction to optimize NVP. The K/Co co-substitution brings about the synergetic effect of NVP framework stabilization. Doping Co2+ generates beneficial holes and accelerating electronic conductivity. The MX plates are stacked at random to form a porous construction, increasing the contact areas to provide more active sites for Na+ shuttling and buffering the volume change. Furthermore, the lamellar MX and the carbon layers form efficient conductive networks that increase electron migration. Notably, K0.1Na2.95V1.95Co0.05(PO4)3@MX (KC05@MX) exhibited an initial capacity of 116 mA h g-1 under 1 C with an extraordinary retention of 86.8% at the 400th cycle.

        "abstract": "NaTFSI/SUL:OTE:FEC facilitates the formation of S, N-rich, dense and robust cathode–electrolyte interphase on NaNMF cathode, which improves the cycling stability under high voltage. By utilizing NaTFSI/SUL:OTE:FEC, the Na||NaNMF batteries achieved an impressive retention of 81.15% after 400 cycles at 2 C with the cutoff voltage of 4.2 V. The study offers a reference for the utilization of sulfolane-based electrolytes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), while the nonflammability of the NaTFSI/SUL:OTE:FEC enhances the safety of SIBs. Sodium-ion batteries hold great promise as next-generation energy storage systems. However, the high instability of the electrode/electrolyte interphase during cycling has seriously hindered the development of SIBs. In particular, an unstable cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) leads to successive electrolyte side reactions, transition metal leaching and rapid capacity decay, which tends to be exacerbated under high-voltage conditions. Therefore, constructing dense and stable CEIs are crucial for high-performance SIBs. This work reports localized high-concentration electrolyte by incorporating a highly oxidation-resistant sulfolane solvent with non-solvent diluent 1H, 1H, 5H-octafluoropentyl-1, 1, 2, 2-tetrafluoroethyl ether, which exhibited excellent oxidative stability and was able to form thin, dense and homogeneous CEI. The excellent CEI enabled the O3-type layered oxide cathode NaNi_1/3Mn_1/3Fe_1/3O_2 (NaNMF) to achieve stable cycling, with a capacity retention of 79.48% after 300 cycles at 1 C and 81.15% after 400 cycles at 2 C with a high charging voltage of 4.2 V. In addition, its nonflammable nature enhances the safety of SIBs. This work provides a viable pathway for the application of sulfolane-based electrolytes on SIBs and the design of next-generation high-voltage electrolytes.",

Herein, we meticulously analyzed the evolution of the morphology, crystal structure, and bonding states of the cathode material during the cycling process. We observed that capacity degradation is closely related to the shedding of the active material from the collector caused by HF corrosion. Meanwhile, HF is produced through F anion dissolution from Na3V2(PO4)2F3 induced by trace H2O during the cycling process. The F- dissolution-induced degradation mechanism based on fluorine-containing cathode materials is proposed for the first time, providing a new insight for the understanding, modification, and performance improvement for fluorophosphate-based cathode materials.",

The synthesis process involved a liquid-phase method to create an amorphous (MnFeCoNiZnAl)1/6B compound supported by carbon nanotubes (CNTs), resulting in improved electrochemical performance. Characterization data confirmed successful formation of the high-entropy boride and indicated a higher specific surface area and broader pore size distribution for the CNT-supported version. Computational models suggested that the high-entropy modification broadened the voltage window, enabling better matching with negative electrodes. Theoretical calculations estimated the maximum theoretical sodium-ion adsorption capacity and specific capacities, with (MnFeCoNiZnAl)1/6B achieving the highest value of 827.69 mAh g-1. The study demonstrates the successful fabrication of an innovative high-entropy boride-based cathode with excellent specific capacity and long-term cycling stability under high current loads, offering promise for large-scale energy storage applications as a cost-effective and safe alternative to lithium-ion batteries.",

Using ex situ X-ray diffraction, Mn K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and 23Na NMR spectroscopy, we identify the bulk phase changes along the first electrochemical charge–discharge cycle—including the formation of a high-voltage “Z phase”, an intergrowth of the OP4 and O2 phases. Our ab initio transition state searches reveal that reversible Mg2+ migration in the Z phase is both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable at high voltages. We propose that Mg2+ migration is a significant contributor to the observed voltage hysteresis in Na0.67[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 and identify qualitative changes in the Na+ ion mobility.",

Herein, to address these drawbacks, an etching-agent free method is developed to synthesize Prussian blue with a hollow structure, and the synthesis mechanism is revealed. Owing to the stability of divalent iron ions, the shorter electron/ion diffusion pathway and fewer defect sites of the hollow structure, the obtained Prussian blue exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (specific capacity of 133.6 mA h g−1 at 1C, 1C = 170 mA g−1), which can put forward a new avenue to engineer advanced electrode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

Herein, a Mg/Zr modified Na0.67Ni0.25Mg0.08Mn0.64Zr0.03O2 cathode is proposed with good structural stability and excellent cycling performance, showing reversible capacity of 123.2 mAh g−1 (0.1 C) and capacity retention of 99.1% after 100 cycles. The cycling stability is outstanding among P2‐type cathodes reported so far. In situ XRD analyses reveal a suppressed P2‐O2 phase transition after Mg modification, further incorporation of Zr greatly stabilizes the layered structure as some Zr ions reside in the Na layer providing a pinning effect to reduce the slide of TMO2 layer. First‐principles calculations suggest that oxygen loss in Na0.67Ni0.25Mg0.08Mn0.64Zr0.03O2 cathode is suppressed as Zr incorporation prevents the formation of oxygen vacancies. XPS analyses verify a Zr─O protective layer self‐segregated on particle surface during material synthesis. The expanded Na+ transport channel confirmed by the XRD analysis well explains the favored Na‐ion mobility verified by a high reversible capacity of 105.5 mAh/g at 20 C.

In this study, we successfully synthesized N/S dual-atom doped carbon coatings in situ through a simple one-step solid-state sintering method. The uniformly coated carbon layer can inhibit the agglomeration and growth of active materials during the sintering process, shorten the Na+ migration path, and increase the contact area with the electrolyte, thus facilitating rapid Na+ migration. Notably, the doping of N elements can alter the electron distribution of carbon coating, enhancing electron conductivity. Furthermore, the introduction of S elements in the carbon layer can induce the formation of stable C-S-C bonds in the molecular layer, expanding the interlayer spacing, which is beneficial for Na+ transport and storage. Therefore, the modified NVP@NSC composite provides a high specific capacity of 90.3 mAh g-1 at a rate of 20 C, with a capacity retention rate of 94.4% after 8000 cycles, demonstrating excellent stability at high current densities.

Using synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, we discover a new strain-accommodation mechanism wherein a third, amorphous phase forms to buffer the large lattice mismatch between primary phases. The amorphous phase has short-range order over ∼1nm domains that is characterized by a and b parameters matching one crystalline end-member phase and a c parameter matching the other, but is not detectable by powder diffraction alone.

        "abstract": "Confining the particle-electrolyte interactions to the particle surface in electrode materials is vital to develop sustainable and safe batteries. Micron-sized single-crystal particles offer such opportunities. Owing to the reduced surface area and grain boundary-free core, particle-electrolyte interactions in micron-sized single-crystal particles will be confined to the particle surface. Here, we reveal the potential of such materials in sodium-ion batteries. We synthesized and investigated the chemical, electrochemical, and thermal properties of single-crystalline P2-type Na0.7Mn0.9Mg0.1O2 as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. Single-crystalline Na0.7Mn0.9Mg0.1O2 with a mean particle size of 8.1 μm exhibited high cycling and voltage stability. In addition, the exothermic heat released by the charged single-crystal Na0.7Mn0.9Mg0.1O2 cathodes was four times lower than that of the corresponding polycrystalline Na0.7Mn0.9Mg0.1O2. This significantly enhances the thermal stability of electrode materials and possibly mitigates thermal runaways in batteries. Surprisingly, single crystals of Na0.7Mn0.9Mg0.1O2 were relatively stable in water and ambient atmosphere.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based Prussian Blue, Na2-δMn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is an auspicious candidate for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn-Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. In this work, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel-based Prussian Blue (Na2-δNi[Fe(CN)6]). The one-pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core-shell materials, which traditionally require several steps. The resulting material has an electrochemical capacity of 93 mA h g-1, of which it retains 96% after 500 charge-discharge cycles (vs 37% for MnPB). The material's rate capability is also remarkable: at 4 A g-1 (ca. 55 C) it can reversibly store 70 mA h g-1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ~10-8 cm2 s-1. The epitaxial nature of the outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, which may prevent the Jahn-Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de-sodiation.",

In this study, we unveil a layer delamination phenomenon of Na0.67Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 (NNM) within the 2.0–4.3 V voltage, attributed to considerable volumetric fluctuations along the c-axis and lattice oxygen reactions induced by the simultaneous Ni3+/Ni4+ and anion redox reactions. By introducing Mg doping to diminished Ni–O antibonding, the anion oxidation-reduction reactions are effectively mitigated, and the structural integrity of the P2 phase remains firmly intact, safeguarding active sites and precluding the formation of novel interfaces. The Na0.67Mg0.05Ni0.25Mn0.7O2 (NMNM-5) exhibits a specific capacity of 100.7 mA h g−1, signifying an 83% improvement compared to the NNM material within the voltage of 2.0–4.3 V.

However, inherent properties of NASICON presents poor electrical conductivity and low energy density. Herein, non-stoichiometric synthesized strategy is used for acquiring N3.5MTP, effectively suppressing voltage hysteresis. Besides, as-fabricated N3.5MTP grains in-situ grow on MXene-rGO aerogels by sol–gel synthesis approach obtaining N3.5MTP@MXene-rGO. MXene-rGO aerogel as an excellent conductive matrix can effectively avoid agglomeration of Na3.5MnTi(PO4)3 particles and alleviate volume change of the lattice during sodium ion intercalation/deintercalation. Moreover, cross-linked network of N3.5MTP@MXene-rGO provides fast electron transfer and ion transport rates. The above synergistic effect and contribution of pseudocapacitance make it an excellent discharge capacity of 189 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 for N3.5MTP@MXene-rGO, long cycles of 5000 cycles, as well as 98 mA g−1 at −30 °C (50 mA g−1).

        "abstract": "As one of the most promising sodium-ion cathodes, O3-type transition metal layered oxides (NaxTMO2) with high specific capacity and low cost have received intensive attention. However, they still face the issues of slow Na+ transfer kinetics and undesirable phase transitions. In this study, we report a novel Al and Cu dual substitution strategy to prepare a NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode using a spray drying method. Specifically, Al serves to stabilize the TM-O layer structure, mitigating adverse phase transitions, while Cu contributes additional capacity and enhances air stability. Consequently, the NaNi0.32Fe0.32Mn0.32Al0.02Cu0.02O2 cathode exhibits enlarged Na+ transfer channels, modulated particle morphology and strengthened layer framework. With the enhanced structure, the John-Teller distortion, adverse phase transitions of O'3 and OP2, and intragranular fatigue cracks are effectively suppressed, leading to improved cycle and air stability. The NaNi0.32Fe0.32Mn0.32Al0.02Cu0.02O2 cathode can maintain 81% of its initial specific capacity at 1C rate after 200 cycles and can obtain a specific capacity of 113 mAh/g even at 5C rate. Furthermore, we find that strengthened Na+ transport kinetics promote homogenous Na+ distribution, which can reduce the formation of unstable interphases to achieve more reversible phase transition. This work helps to better unveil the relationship between Na+ transfer kinetics and phase transition, provides new insight for designing high-performance sodium-ion cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been proved as one of the most alternative to Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by the virtue of the abundant resources of Na. Among the cathodes, layered oxides stand out owing to their high energy density. The Jahn–Teller distortion, structural phase transition and oxygen release are main drawbacks of Mn/Ni based layered oxides. Hence, Li-Ni-Cu co-substituted Na0.67Li0.1(Mn0.7Ni0.2Cu0.1)0.9O2 (NLMNC) sample was prepared. The NLMNC sample exhibits the honeycomb-ordered superstructure at about 22° which is ascribed to cation ordering. By virtue of the Li-Ni-Cu co-substitute, the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn is suppressed. Attributed to Li+ migrating from the metal oxide layer to the interlayer and the Li+ can play the part of pillar in the interlayer, NLMNC cathode displays the capacity retention rate of 82.5 % at 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. The anionic redox reaction of NLMNC is related to the addition of Li ions and O 2p non-bonding which is different from the anionic redox reaction of electrons removing from O 2p in the eg* (Ni–O) states of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. During charge process, peroxo O\n                     − emerges with the oxidation of lattice oxygen. During discharge process, the intensity of peroxo O\n                     − gradually decreases. DFT calculations were also carried out to reveal the reaction mechanism of NLMNC. The DFT results showed that the anionic redox reaction occurs near Mn ions, while the Ni ions are stable which is corresponding with our results. It is proven that such Li-Ni-Cu co-substituted NLMNC presents a promising cathode material for SIBs.",

This paper reports a new NLMO modification strategy, which effectively improves the cycling stability of NLMO by substituting Zr4+ for Mn4+ in the bulk phase to suppress the O2−/On− redox couple activity and stabilize the ZrO2 second phase lattice. Under the combined action of substitution and second phase, the capacity retention rate of NLMO@Zr0.15 was 85.4 % after 100 cycles at a rate of 5 C. The results show that Zr4+ changes the coordination environment and electronic structure of O in the crystal lattice, prompting further splitting of Mn t2 g, thereby increasing the proportion of Mn 3d orbitals near the Fermi level. During the first discharge process, due to the charge balancing effect, Mn3+/Mn4+ replaced the electrochemical activity of O2−/On−, obtaining a specific capacity of up to 161 mAh g−1.

More importantly, even after 80 days of exposure to air, although the material experienced a certain degree of specific capacity attenuation (about 30%), after secondary annealing treatment, its specific capacity almost completely returned to the initial level (81.9%), and the initial Coulombic efficiency was significantly increased to 95.9%. This discovery is strong proof that the material has extraordinary air resistance and self-healing properties. Through a precise element selection strategy, this study systematically explored the influence of structure-stabilization element proportion change on the stability of cathode materials, and deeply analyzed the complex and profound internal relationship between it and configurational entropy. This research not only greatly enriches and deepens the theoretical foundation of high-entropy material design but also provides a feasible path and solid scientific basis for the innovative development of customized high-entropy materials.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) as cathode material for sodium-ion batteries have attracted widespread attention due to their affordability, simple synthesis, and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, the oxidation of Fe2+ and sodium loss lead to poor electrochemical properties which restrict the practical use of PBAs. Herein, a simple coprecipitation approach based on sodium salt-reduction-assisted synthesis was proposed to construct high-sodium PBAs. The sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) not only effectively inhibits the oxidation of Fe2+ but also increases the mole ratio of Na+ in the resulting products. The optimized sample exhibits excellent specific capacity (131.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1C), high rate performance (103.9 mAh g-1 at 10C), and good cyclic performance (94.8% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Experimental results reveal that the sample synthesized with sodium bisulfite possesses improved sodium-ion diffusion kinetics and stable crystal structure. In this study, a scalable method is introduced for the synthesis of PBAs with excellent electrochemical properties and further applications.",

        "abstract": "P2-type Fe-Mn-based oxides offer excellent discharge specific capacity and are as affordable as typical layered oxide cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). After Cu modification, though they can improve the cycling performance and air stability, the discharge specific capacity will be reduced. Considering the complementary nature of biphasic phases in electrochemistry, hybridizing P2/O3 hybrid phases can enhance both the storage performance of the battery and specific capacity. Herein, a hybrid phase composite with high capacity and good cycle performance is deliberately designed and successfully prepared by controlling the amount of Mg doping in the layered oxide. It has been found that the introduction of Mg can activate anion redox in the oxide layer, resulting in a significant increase in the specific discharge capacity of the material. Meanwhile, the dual-phase structure can produce an interlocking effect, thus effectively alleviating structure strain. The degradation of cycling performance caused by structural damage during the high-voltage charging and discharging process is clearly mitigated. The results show that the specific discharge capacity of Na0.67Cu0.2Mg0.1Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 is as high as 212.0 mAh g-1 at 0.1C rate and 186.2 mAh g-1 at 0.2C rate. After 80 cycles, the capacity can still maintain 88.1%. Moreover, the capacity and cycle performance as well as the stability can still remain stable even in the high-voltage window. Therefore, this work offers an insightful exploration for the development of composite cathode materials for SIBs.",

To comprehend the role of cobalt substitution in the structure and electrochemical performance of Na0.67MnO2, the solid solutions of P2-Na0.67MnxCo1-xO2 (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) are synthesized and characterized. The XRD-Rietveld analysis revealed that the Co-substitution in Na0.67MnO2 decreases lattice parameters 'a' and 'c' resulting in the contraction of MO6 octahedra and the enlargement of inter-layer 'd' spacing. XPS indicates that the isovalent cobalt substitution in Na0.67MnO2 results in the partial/complete replacement of Jahn-Teller active trivalent manganese to form low-spin complexes of better structural stability. The Na-ion diffusion coefficient, DNa+, derived from cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, confirmed the enhanced mass transport in Co-rich phases compared to Mn-rich phases. Furthermore, higher diffusion coefficient values are observed for Co3+/Co4+ than for their Mn3+/Mn4+ redox processes. In addition, Co-rich phases exhibit a high structural stability and superior capacity retention, whereas Mn-rich phases discharge higher capacities.",

        "abstract": "Potassium manganese-based Prussian blue analogs (KMn-HCF) hold great potential as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the rapid synthesis process often results in excessively small particle sizes, increasing surface area and thereby intensifying side reactions with the electrolyte, which can damage the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) and diminish cycling stability. Herein, we designed a topological phase transition strategy to assemble small KMn-HCF particles into a 600 nm cubic superstructure. Structurally, the assembled structure in KMn-HCF significantly improves the cycling stability and durability of KMn-HCF as a SIB cathode by reducing defects, enhancing the uniformity and stability of the CEI layer, minimizing contact with the electrolyte, and reinforcing structural integrity. From a compositional perspective, KMn-HCF exhibits lower Jahn-Teller distortion, reducing overall lattice distortion while allowing larger K+ to act as pillars, supporting the Mn-HCF framework and preventing capacity degradation caused by structural deterioration. The robust CEI layer formed in the KMn-HCF cubic superstructure delivered stable charge-discharge voltage profiles and reversible plateaus, achieving a capacity retention of 88.4%/89.1% after 1000 cycles at current densities of 0.1 and 0.5 A g-1, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue and its analogues (PBA) are promising cathode materials for economical large-scale sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Manganese-based PBA, abbreviated as “PW”, offers advantages such as high voltage, high capacity, and good cost-effectiveness but faces challenges with manganese dissolution and structural distortion during cycling. In contrast, iron-based PBA, abbreviated as “PB”, maintains more stable structural integrity but exhibits relatively lower capacity. In this study, we introduce an ion-exchange technique to create core-shell structural cathode materials with PW as the main active ingredient and PB as the protective shell (PW@PB). This approach achieves more than doubled capacity retention after 500 cycles compared to naked PW. Furthermore, PW@PB demonstrates notable rate capability enhancements, retaining 80 % of its capacity at 0.1C when subjected to a high rate of 10C, proving its potential for use in fast-charging SIBs. The improved performance is primarily attributed to the reduced lattice and bound water in the structure of PW@PB. Additionally, the stable outer layer of PB inhibits the leaching of Mn and Fe, minimizing lattice distortion during the charge-discharge process.",

        "abstract": "The cathode material of sodium-ion batteries, Na3V2(PO4)2F3-yOz (NVPFO), with its NASICON structure, exhibits greater stability and a higher average discharge potential compared with sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP). Owing to its low intrinsic conductivity, the electrochemical performance and cycle stability of NVPFO is unsatisfactory. In this study, a sol–gel method was implemented, by using melamine-cyanic acid-lignin supermolecule precursor (MCL) and citric acid (CA) as carbon sources in the preparation of NVPFO process, in which a double-carbon coating structure was established. The distinctiveness of this dual carbon source can result in the tremendous pyrolysis gases, created by the MCL during the calcination process, exploding the outer CA layer, through which sodium vanadium oxyfluorophosphate (NVPFO/MCLC@C) was produced with a dual carbon coating containing an outer coral-like carbon layer and an interior nitrogen-doped carbon layer. Nitrogen doping enables MCLC to adsorb Na+ with a pseudocapacitive behavior. The specific capacity of the NVPFO is 117.3 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g, and 52.8 mAh/g at a current density of 10.0 A/g. The capacity retention rate was 80.0 % after 1100 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A/g. In this work, a dual carbon coating strategy has been proposed to enhance the rate performance and long cycle stability of NVPFO cathode materials, which could be a potential approach for the cathode coating engineering of sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Fe‐based Prussian blue (Fe‐PB) cathode material shows great application potential in sodium (Na)‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, long cycle life, low cost, and simple preparation process. However, the crystalline water and vacancies of Fe‐PB lattice, the low electrical conductivity, and the dissolution of metal ions lead to limited capacity and poor cycling stability. In this work, a perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride amine (PTCDA) coating layer is successfully fabricated on the surface of Fe‐PB by a liquid‐phase method. The aminated PTCDA (PTCA) coating not only increases the specific surface area and electronic conductivity but also effectively reduces the crystalline water and vacancies, which avoids the erosion of Fe‐PB by electrolyte. Consequently, the PTCA layer reduces the charge transfer resistance, enhances the Na‐ion diffusion coefficient, and improves the structure stability. The PTCA‐coated Fe‐PB exhibits superior Na storage performance with a first discharge capacity of 145.2 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Long cycling tests exhibit minimal capacity decay of 0.027% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Therefore, this PTCA coating strategy has shown promising competence in enhancing the electrochemical performance of Fe‐PB, which can potentially serve as a universal electrode coating strategy for Na‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) is promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity and fast Na+ diffusion rate. Nonetheless, the irreversible P2-O2 phase transformation, Na+/vacancy ordering, and transition metal (TM) dissolution seriously damage its cycling stability and restrict its commercialization process. Herein, Na occupation manipulation and interface stabilization are proposed to strengthen the phase structure of NNMO by synergistic Zn/Ti co-doping and introducing lithium difluorophosp (LiPO2F2) film-forming electrolyte additive. The Zn/Ti co-doping regulates the occupancy ratio of Nae/Naf at Na sites and disorganizes the Na+/vacancy ordering, resulting in a faster Na+ diffusion kinetics and reversible P2-Z phase transition for P2-Na0.67Ni0.28Zn0.05Mn0.62Ti0.05O2 (NNZMTO). Meanwhile, the LiPO2F2 additive can form homogeneous and ultrathin cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) on NNZMTO surface, which can stabilize the NNZMTO-electrolyte interface to prevent TM dissolution, surface structure transformation, and micro-crack generation. Combination studies of in situ and ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations were used to elucidate the storage mechanism of NNZMTO with LiPO2F2 additive. As a result, the NNZMTO displays outstanding capacity retention of 94.44% after 500 cycles at 1C with 0.3 wt% LiPO2F2, excellent rate performance of 92.5 mA h g−1 at 8C with 0.1 wt% LiPO2F2, and remarkable full cell capability.

        "abstract": "Na2FeSiO4, as one of the promising cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries, has attracted great interests. However, studies on the kinetic behaviours of Na ions insertion/extraction in Na2FeSiO4 composite electrode have been barely considered, until now. Importantly, the specific capacity and rate capability of Na2FeSiO4 cathode material are greatly correlated with the kinetics of Na+ transfer in the host material. Herein, based on the characterizations of microstructure and morphologies (i.e. Rietveld refinement, FESEM, HRTEM, etc.), the electrochemical kinetics of Na ions extraction in Na2FeSiO4/C electrode are firstly studied in detail via two electrochemical techniques (EIS and GITT), establishing the rate-controlling steps of Na+ transport in Na2FeSiO4/C, evaluating series of kinetic parameters as well as calculating the Na+ diffusion coefficient at various state-of-desodiation. Changes of impedance response of Na2FeSiO4/C electrode depending on the different levels of desodiation show that a serial features of electrode process for Na ions migration have tremendous discrepancies, indicating that the kinetics of Na+ extraction from Na2FeSiO4/C electrode are largely influenced by different electrode reaction processes. These results provide useful insight into the inner properties of Na2FeSiO4/C electrode, and it is significant to optimize the electrochemical performance of Na2FeSiO4/C. Moreover, two models of equivalent circuits are also constructed to simulate the electrode process and describe the behaviours of Na ions transfer in Na2FeSiO4/C.",

        "abstract": "Li-substituted, manganese-based, layered oxides NaxLi0.18Mn0.66Co0.17Ni0.17O2+ (x=0.54, 0.66, 0.78 and 0.90) have been investigated as one kind of high-performance cathode materials for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). Phase compositions and local structures of the cathode materials with varying sodium content were elucidated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and atomic-scale high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM), which demonstrates that a Li2MnO3-like (Li-O'3) phase was aroused in P2-type sodium layered oxide matrix forming a Na-P2/Li-O'3 hybrid structure. More importantly, the effect of sodium content on the preferential exposure of (102) and (104) facets and surface morphology of the cathode particles has been comprehensively studied, as well as their relationship with electrochemical performance. It reveals that, in addition to the preferential growth of (102) and (104) facets that has been proved to improve the capacity and rate capability of the cathode materials, the smooth surface finish of the particles also plays a key role in determining the performance. The layered sodium cathode material with a sodium content of 0.66 possesses sufficient exposure of (102) and (104) facets and smooth side surface, resulting in the superior capacities under various C rates (187 mAh/g at 0.2 C and 114 mAh/g at 5 C) comparing to the cathode materials with all other sodium contents. The mechanism has also been proposed in this study. These findings presented herein open up new strategies to design high performance layered oxide cathode for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The iron/manganese‐based mixed phosphates (Na4Fe3‐zMnz(PO4)2(P2O7)) have become focal points in the realm of cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries due to their high voltage plateau and sturdy open framework architecture. However, their electrochemical performance is hindered by surface manganese enrichment, inert phases, Jahn‐Teller distortion, etc. In this work, a Ni(inner)‐B(interface) synergistic modification strategy is proposed to overcome these issues. By facilitating charge redistribution around Mn atoms via Ni doping, the structural damage by Mn Jahn‐Teller distortion is significantly mitigated. Furthermore, the redistribution can enhance the redox activity of Mn2+/Mn3+, alleviating the voltage hysteresis. Meanwhile, the interface engineering induced by B‐doping activates sodium ion active sites and eliminates surface manganese enrichment, thus impeding the dissolution of Mn and fortifying the structural steadiness. Besides, the synergistic effect of Ni‐B doping promotes the homogenization of internal elements, effectively inhibiting the spontaneous generation of inert phases. As anticipated, the optimal Na4Fe2Mn0.9Ni0.1(PO4)2(P2O7)/C‐B0.1 demonstrates an impressive initial specific capacity (147.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1C), outstanding rate performance (72.5 mAh g−1 at 20C) and superior cycling stability (80.1% retention after 11000 cycles). This work successfully addresses the challenges through the implementation of multifunctional modification, providing valuable insights into the structure design for iron/manganese‐based cathode materials.",

Remarkably, such cells provide a capacity retention of about 85% after 1,000 cycles at 0.2C thanks to the very high Coulombic efficiency (99.9%), resulting from an excellent interfacial stability towards sodium metal and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.",

Fe defects originating from La doping eliminate the maricite-NaFePO4 inert impurities and Na defects stemming from Br doping optimize the microchemical valence states and ion transport kinetics. The density functional theory demonstrates that Fe/Na dual-site defects in the lattice of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 reduce band gap and facilitate Na+ migration passageway, thereby leading to a superior rate capability and stable sodium storage performance. Moreover, the sodium storage mechanism of the dual-site defects engineered Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode material is revealed. The optimal dual-site defects engineered cathode sample delivers excellent rate performance (55.2 mAh g-1 at 50 C) and long cycling stability (capacity retention of 93 % after 2000 cycles at 10 C). This study provides a promising strategy for engineering dual-site defects to synthesize impurities-free Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode material with superior electrochemical performance.",

Recently, various special structures are constructed to improve the electrochemical properties of these materials. In this study, a novel architecture of Prussian blue analogs with large cavity and multilayer shells is investigated as cathode material for SIBs. Because the hollow structure can relieve volume expansion and core-shell heterostructure can optimize interfacial properties, the complex structure materials exhibited a highly initial capacity of 123 mA h g-1 and a long cycle life. After 600 cycles, the reversible capacity of the electrode still maintains at 102 mA h g-1 without significant voltage decay, indicating a superior structure stability and sodium storage kinetics. Even at high current density of 3200 mA g-1 , the electrode still delivers a considerable capacity above 52 mA h g-1 .

        "abstract": "The sodium super ion conductor (NASICON) structure materials are essential for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their robust crystal structure, excellent ionic conductivity, and flexibility to regulate element and valence. However, the poor electronic conductivity and inferior energy density caused by the nature of these materials have always been obstacles to commercialization. Herein, using yeast as a template to derive NASICON structure Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) materials (noted as Yeast@NMTP/C) is presented. The Yeast@NMTP/C material retains the microsphere morphology of the yeast template and not only controls the particle size (around 2 μm) to shorten the Na+ diffusion pathways but also improves the electronic conductivity to optimize the electrochemical kinetics. The Yeast@NMTP/C cathode delivers reversible multielectron redox reactions including Ti4+/3+, Mn3+/2+, and Mn4+/3+ and exhibits a high capacity of 108.5 mAh g-1 with a 79.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at a 2C rate. The sodium storage mechanism of Yeast@NMTP/C reveals that the addition of Ti4+/3+ redox plays a key role in improving the Na+ diffusion kinetics, and both solid-solution and two-phase reactions take place during the desodiation and sodiation process. Additionally, the high-rate and long-span cycle performance of Yeast@NMTP/C at 10C is ascribed to contribute to pseudocapacitance.",

However, achieving stable cycling for NNM under this condition remains challenging owing to an unfavorable phase transition and a large lattice-volume change. Herein, a dual-site doping strategy is used to simultaneously realize a pinning effect at the Na and transition metal sites. Incorporating pinned K+ and Zn2+ ions considerably enhances the structural stability of NNM, affording a complete single-phase reaction with ultralow strain (only 0.54 % variation in volume) during Na+ insertion/extraction. The synergistic contributions of dual-site doping to the enhanced electronic conductivity, lowered Na+ migration barrier, and increased Na+ diffusion coefficients are confirmed via theoretical calculations. Consequently, the K+/Zn2+ dual-site-doped Na0.63K0.03Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 delivers satisfactory discharge capacities of 118.6 and 63.2 mAh g−1 at 10 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively, and achieves an excellent capacity retention of 81.2 % after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1.

Among the various layered compounds, Fe-substituted O3-type Na(Ni1/2Mn1/2)1-xFexO2 materials have emerged as a promising option for high-performance and low-cost cathodes. While previous reports have noted the decent air-storage stability of these materials, the role and origin of Fe substitution in improving storage stability remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the air-resistant effect of Fe substitution in O3-Na(Ni1/2Mn1/2)1-xFexO2 cathode materials by performing systematic surface and structural characterizations. We find that the improved storage stability can be attributed to the multifunctional effect of Fe substitution, which forms a surface protective layer containing an Fe-incorporated spinel phase and decreases the thermodynamical driving force for bulk chemical sodium extraction. With these mechanisms, Fe-containing cathodes can suppress the cascades of cathode degradation processes and better retain the electrochemical performance after air storage.",

In this work, we investigate the failure of Fe-rich Na-NFM materials through X-ray absorption spectroscopy methods.

Exposure of MoSe2 to light drives the Na+ extraction, prompted by photogenerated holes, and accelerates the charge transfer kinetics with improved ion diffusion, which leads to an increased capacity.

Herein, a new bipolar polymer cathode material PQPZ is designed and synthesized. The electron‐donating phenazine group undergoes a two‐electron redox reaction which can store anions, the electron‐withdrawing phenanthraquinone can store sodium‐ions through a two‐electron redox reaction. Notably, as a bipolar cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries, PQPZ exhibits a reversible specific capacity of up to 270 mAh g−1 in the voltage range of 1.0–4.0 V (vs. Na+/Na) and achieves a high energy density of 696 Wh kg−1 in a half‐cell. A capacity retention rate of 90% is obtained after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.5C. More excitingly, even after being cycled for 10000 cycles at 10C, the PQPZ electrode shows an average decay rate as low as 0.0036% per cycle, manifesting a very stable cycling performance. In addition, PQPZ also shows excellent performances when tested at −10 °C, making it promising in practical applications. Considering the bipolar character of PQPZ, symmetric batteries are also successfully constructed, fulfilling the “ready‐to‐charge” property without a pre‐activation process.

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of wearable electronic devices demands high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathode materials, particularly in terms of stability and electrochemical performance. Sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 (NVP) has attracted significant attention due to its unique framework structure and high theoretical capacity. However, the inherently low electrical conductivity of NVP limits large-scale application. To address this issue, a novel NVP@C-rGO composite was synthesized using metal–organic frameworks (MOF) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The structures of these two forms of carbon enhance the charge transfer kinetics of NVP and provide two stress-buffering layers, thereby improving the structural stability of the material while significantly facilitating charge transport. Electrochemical testing confirmed the effectiveness of this strategy: at a current density of 500 mA g⁻^1, the NVP@C-rGO composite retained 71.1% of capacity after 600 cycles, compared to only 21.2% for unmodified NVP. Furthermore, due to the synergistic effect between rGO and MOF-derived NVP, the composite achieved a high specific capacity of 89.9 mAh g⁻^1 under the same conditions, while NVP reached only 62.7 mAh g⁻^1. This significant improvement in performance, combined with the exceptional cycling stability and rate capability of the NVP@C-rGO||HC-rGO full cell, highlights the potential of the composite as a next-generation energy storage material for flexible and wearable electronic devices.",

        "title": "Entropy-Tailored Fast-Charging Sodium Layered Cathodes.",
        "abstract": "O3-type layered transition metal (TM) oxides are widely used as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries due to their high energy density potential, enabled by the state of charge (SoC)-dependent transition from octahedral (O-type) to prismatic (P-type) structures during Na-ion (de)sodiation. However, the O-P transition is often criticized for compromising the Na-ion mobility and limiting the cycle life. Herein, we reveal the intrinsic correlation between O-P transitions, oxygen behaviors, and Na-ion kinetics. We demonstrate that a compositionally versatile, entropy-tailored approach can promote preferred transitions (characterized by large lattice parameter deviations in the O-type region and rapid O-P biphasic reactions), enhancing Na-ion migration, as revealed by in situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). Additionally, irreversible oxygen loss at high SoC is effectively mitigated, while TM migration and surface reconstruction are greatly suppressed, further accelerating Na-ion transport and stabilizing the structure, as confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical analyses. The result is an exceptionally high rate capability of 88.7 mAh g-1 at 20 C (2.4 A g-1) with a superior normalized retention of 72.6%, accompanied by a prolonged lifetime with 74.3% retention after 1000 cycles. This work advances the understanding of the chemistry-property relationships in O3-type layered cathodes and broadens the prospects for fabricating high-power-density electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Low-cost and stable sodium-layered oxides (such as P2- and O3-phases) are suggested as highly promising cathode materials for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Biphasic hybridization, mainly involving P2/O3 and P2/P3 biphases, is typically used to boost their electrochemical performances. Herein, a P3/O3 intergrown layered oxide (Na2/3 Ni1/3 Mn1/3 Ti1/3 O2 ) as high-rate and long-life cathode for NIBs via tuning the amounts of Ti substitution in Na2/3 Ni1/3 Mn2/3- x Tix O2 (x = 0, 1/6, 1/3, 2/3) is demonstrated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) Rietveld refinement and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy show the co-existence of P3 and O3 phases, and density functional theory calculation corroborates the appearance of the anomalous O3 phase at the Ti substitution amount of 1/3. The P3/O3 biphasic cathode delivers an unexpected rate capability (≈88.7% of the initial capacity at a high rate of 5 C) and cycling stability (≈68.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 C), superior to those of the sing phases P3-Na2/3 Ni1/3 Mn2/3 O2 , P3-Na2/3 Ni1/3 Mn1/2 Ti1/6 O2 , and O3-Na2/3 Ni1/3 Ti2/3 O2 . The highly reversible structural evolution of the P3/O3 integrated cathode observed by ex situ XRD, ex situ X-ray absorption spectra, and the rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics, underpin the enhancement. These results show the important role of P3/O3 biphasic hybridization in designing and engineering layered oxide cathodes for NIBs.",

A pivotal aspect of SIB advancement is the development of advanced electrolytes, which remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a facile and scalable synthesis method for low‐cost sodium‐difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) is reported and explored its application as a standalone electrolyte salt for SIBs. The NaDFOB‐based ether electrolyte demonstrates exceptional electrochemical stability, solvent compatibility, and the unique capacity to form a dense, robust solid‐electrolyte interphase layer on electrode surfaces. As a result, the Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) cathode with NaDFOB‐based electrolyte exhibits ultrahigh cycling stability with a remarkable capacity retention of 98.7% after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, an Ah‐level hard carbon (HC)//NFPP pouch cell using NaDFOB‐based ether electrolyte shows an impressive cycle life of 500 cycles, coupled with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. The pouch cells also maintain superior electrochemical performance across a broad temperature range from −40 to 60 °C, showcasing the electrolyte's versatility.

        "abstract": "Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium-ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na-free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.",

Sodium-ion batteries are promising new-generation energy storage devices due to the low cost and rich resource of sodium. Among various cathodes, tunnel-type Na_0.44MnO_2 with large S-shaped Na^+ transport tunnels is considered an appropriate cathode for fast-charging batteries, yet still suffering from sluggish Na^+ kinetics. Herein, a novel ion-exchange method is developed for the first time to synthesize Na_0.44MnO_2 from K_0.5MnO_2 precursor. By precisely adjusting the synthesis condition, the amount of residual K^+ and the size of Na_0.44MnO_2 are well controlled. The presence of trace K^+ in the Na_0.44MnO_2 structure is demonstrated to broaden the Na^+ transport tunnels while the minimized size shortens the Na^+ migration distance. Besides, band-like defects with distorted polyhedrons further promote Na^+ transport. The as-prepared Na_0.44MnO_2 with intrinsic pseudo-capacitance characteristic exhibits excellent rate performance of 79.0 mA h g^−1 at 20 C between 2 and 4 V. Long-term cycling tests present superior stability of 98.1% retention after 1000 cycles at 20 C and 96.3% retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C.

In this study, a one-pot strategy is proposed for the synthesis of MnFe PBA open cages. The materials are subsequently employed as cathode electrode in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The simultaneous evolution of structure, morphology, and performance during the synthesis process is investigated. The findings reveal substantial structural modifications as the reaction time is prolonged. The manganese content in the samples diminishes considerably, while the potassium content experiences an increase. This compositional variation is accompanied by a significant change in the spin state of the transition metal ions. These structural transformations trigger the occurrence of the Kirkendall effect and Oswald ripening, culminating in a profound alteration of the morphology of MnFe PBA. Moreover, the shifts in spin states give rise to distinct changes in their charge-discharge profiles and redox potentials. Furthermore, an exploration of the formation conditions of the samples and their variations before and after cycling is conducted. This study offers valuable insights into the intricate relationship between the structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance of MnFe PBA, paving the way for further optimizations in this promising class of materials for energy storage applications.",

And Na3V2(PO4)3 is regarded as the most promising cathode material because of their high capacity and larger interstitial channels for fast Na ion migration. However, the disadvantage of low conductivity suppresses its practical applications. To increase electrochemical properties of the cathode, reduced graphene oxide-supported Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C-G) composite has been prepared, in which the graphene is used to accelerate movement of the electronics and Na ions. XRD characterizations show that the synthesized material is well corresponding to NASICON structure, and SEM image show that the graphene sheets are uniformly dispersed on surface of the composite. The initial capacity of the material is up to 103.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, and 92.3 % and 92.1 % of capacities are maintained with discharge ratios of 0.5 C and 2 C over 500 cycles, proving a much better cycling stability compared with the Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) particles. The enhanced discharge capacities and retention rate of the NVP/C-G could be ascribed to the tight contact between NVP/C and RGO sheets, which is beneficial to fast electron transport and better intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ through the nanoparticles. Therefore, the synthesized NVP/C-G displays highly potential for practical use in sodium-ion batteries.",

In-situ XRD, diffusion kinetics results together with microstructure and phase characterization before and after cycling indicate that high entropy doping enhances structural stability of layered oxides, suppresses irreversible phase transitions, stabilizes Na+ diffusion paths, ensures reversible anionic redox reactions, inhibits crack generation after cycling, prevents transition metal dissolution, and improves humid air stability.

        "abstract": "Currently, the exploitation of robust cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is of critical urgency. Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) owns a decent energy density of 425 Wh kg−1 which has been regarded as a research hotspot in SIBs. Nonetheless, the performance of NMVP is greatly hindered by structural degradation due to Jahn-Teller distortions of Mn3+ and intrinsically limited electronic conductivity. In view of this, a series of Na4Mn1-xNixV(PO4)3@NC (x = 0.04, 0.1 or 0.12) denoted as NMVP, 0.04Ni-NMVP, 0.1Ni-NMVP and 0.12Ni-NMVP are facilely envisaged via the scalable spray-drying approach in this work. Notably, the optimized mesoporous 0.1Ni-NMVP reveals the most excellent cycling durability at high current rate (a capacity of 67.8 mAh g−1 at 5C over 1500 cycles with a capacity retention ratio of 73.7 %). Especially, the full cell based on 0.1Ni-NMVP cathode and commercial hard carbon (HC) anode manifests a satisfied energy density of 295 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 105.6 W kg−1. It is proved that the appropriate Ni-doping could extremely mitigate the Jahn-Teller distortion in MnO6 during cycling and significantly favor the electron/ion transportation. Besides, the N-doped carbon coating could also avoid the aggregation of NMVP microspheres and ameliorate the electronic conductivity. A reversible structural evolution including two-phase and solid-solution reactions during cycling are validated for the 0.1Ni-NMVP upon (de)sodiation based on the in-situ XRD patterns. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the Ni-modification for NMVP leads to the reduced bandgap and boosted electron transfer, which is much beneficial to the expedited electron/ion transportation. This innovative Ni-modification protocol serves an explicit direction for engineering advanced NMVP cathode in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The vital challenge of layered manganese oxide cathode for sodium-ion batteries is its severe capacity degradation and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics caused by irreversible phase transitions. In response to this problem, the spinel-layered manganese-based composite with intergrowth structure is ingeniously designed by virtue of an interesting spinel-to-layered transformation in the delithiated LiMn2O4 under Na+ insertion. This unique spinel-layered intergrowth structure is strongly confirmed by combining multiple structure analysis techniques. The layered component can provide more reversible capacity, while the spinel component is crucial for stabilized the crystal structure and accelerated ions diffusion kinetics. As an appealing cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the layered-spinel composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 180.9 mAh g-1, excellent cycling stability, and superior rate capability with 55.7 mAh g-1 at 12 C. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism upon Na+ extraction/insertion is revealed in detail by ex-situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicating that Na+ ions can be accommodated by the layered structure at a low voltage and by spinel at a high voltage.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) employ P2‐type layered transition metal oxides as promising cathode materials, primarily due to their abundant natural reserves and environmentally friendly characteristics. However, structural instability and complex phase transitions during electrochemical cycling pose significant challenges to their practical applications. Employing cation substitution serves as a straightforward yet effective strategy for stabilizing the structure and improving the kinetics of the active material. In this study, we introduce a Ni‐rich honeycomb‐layered Na2+xNi2TeO6 (NNTO) cathode material with variable sodium content (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.10). Physicochemical characterizations reveal that excess sodium content at the atomic scale modifies the surface and suppresses phase transitions, while preserving the crystal structure. This results in enhanced cyclic performance and improved electrochemical kinetics at room temperature. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the NNTO cathode material containing 10% excess sodium at a relatively high temperature of 60°C, where it exhibits 71.6% capacity retention compared to 60% for the pristine. Overall, our results confirm that a preconstructed surface layer (induced by excess sodium) effectively safeguards the Ni‐based cathode material from surface degradation and phase transitions during the electrochemical processes, thus exhibiting superior capacity retention relative to the pristine NNTO cathode. This study of the correlation between structure and performance can potentially be applied to the commercialization of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from severe capacity decay as the harmful substances caused by the violent decomposition of electrolyte under high voltages continue to erode the cathodes. Therefore, the design of high‐voltage electrolyte and construction of robust cathode–electrolyte interface (CEI) are critical for long‐life SIBs. Herein, an electrically coupled composite electrolyte that takes the merits of cross‐linked gel polymers and s well‐tuned antioxidant additive (4‐trifluoromethylphenylboronic acid, TFPBA) is proposed. Through an electrical coupling effect, TFPBA can be anchored by the cross‐linked polymer framework to immobilize the PF6− anion and adsorb onto cathode surface spontaneously, both of which promote the formation of a robust CEI layer to facilitate Na+ transportation and suppress subsequent side reactions and corrosive cracking. As a result, the cells integrating high‐voltage P2/O3 cathode and well‐tailored gel polymer electrolyte achieve stable cycling over 550 cycles within 1.8–4.2 V with a capacity retention of 71.0% and a high‐rate discharge capacity of 77.4 mAh g−1 at 5 C.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides have garnered great attention as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their abundant reserves and high theoretical capacity. However, challenges persist in the form of uncontrollable phase transitions and intricate Na+ diffusion pathways during cycling, resulting in compromised structural stability and reduced capacity over cycles. This study introduces a special approach employing site-specific Ca/F co-substitution within the layered structure of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 to effectively address these issues. Herein, the strategically site-specific doping of Ca into Na sites and F into O sites not only expands the Na+ diffusion pathways but also orchestrates a mild phase transition by suppressing the Na+/vacancy ordering and providing strong metal–oxygen bonding strength, respectively. The as-synthesized Na0.95Ca0.05Ni0.5Mn0.5O1.95F0.05 (NNMO-CaF) exhibits a mild O3 → O3 + O'3 → P3 phase transition with minimized interlayer distance variation, leading to enhanced structural integrity and stability over extended cycles. As a result, NNMO-CaF delivers a high specific capacity of 119.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 120 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 87.1% after 100 cycles. This study presents a promising strategy to mitigate the challenges posed by multiple phase transitions and augment Na+ diffusion kinetics, thus paving the way for high-performance layered cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

We examined and compared the structural, electronic, cathodic, and transport properties of NaScX_2 layered materials. We continued our investigation into the stability of these cathode materials for the charge–discharge process. Among the chalcogenide materials, NaScSe_2 exhibited the lowest estimated energy barrier for Na-ion diffusion, with values of 0.57 eV via a single vacancy mechanism and 0.21 eV for a divacancy mechanism. As we go to the higher ionic radii of divalent anions, it shows higher electric polarizability. Hence, layered selenide has a higher capability to deform the electron charge density of anion by the nearby Na cations. This influences the mobility of diffusing alkali metal cations.

        "abstract": "Activating anionic redox is an effective strategy for enhancing the capacity of cathode materials in both lithium‐ion and sodium‐ion batteries. However, the fundamental mechanisms of O3‐type sodium anionic redox cathodes remain poorly understood due to the limited availability of such materials, despite their inherent advantages such as high initial sodium content and high reversible capacity. Herein, we employ multiple characterization methods to elucidate the structural and electrochemical properties of O3‐Na[Li1/3Mn2/3]O2, a promising sodium anionic redox cathode developed recently, with a particular focus on the effect of cutoff voltages during electrochemical aging. Our synchrotron powder X‐ray diffraction results indicate that charging the material to voltages above 4.1 V induces substantial structural changes, which compromise the structural and electrochemical reversibility of the material. This is corroborated by more rapid capacity decay and increased impedance, attributed to severe degradation on both the surface and in the bulk, as evidenced by the formation of lower valence manganese compounds. Furthermore, increasing the lower cutoff voltage for the discharge process effectively suppresses surface degradation, thereby improving cycling stability. This work offers a comprehensive understanding of a pivotal sodium anionic redox cathode material, providing valuable insights that can drive the development of advanced materials for sodium‐ion batteries.",

However, the gigantic challenge lies in achieving super dynamic performance and stability of cathode materials. Herein, the defect configuration entropy (DCE) is conceptualized in Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon composite (NVP/C) cathode by manipulating heteroatoms and vacancies in the surface carbon layer. It is found that the bonding energy between the carbon layer and NVP interface increases with the DCE. Accompanying, the Na+ migration energy barrier is reduced and the electronic conductivity is enhanced, which are pivotal factors underpinning the low-temperature performance. Furthermore, the increase of DCE engenders the formation of a NaF-rich cathode-electrolyte interface, furnishing support for high-temperature stability. As a result, the DCE-strengthened NVP/carbon composite cathode exhibits a high capacity of ∼88 mAh g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 200 C (13 s per charge process). Moreover, the superior electrochemical performance in the wide temperature range of −30–60 °C is achieved with 0.101 % capacity decay per cycle at −20 ℃, and 0.0047 % capacity decay per cycle at 60 ℃.",

The decent electrochemical properties induced in NNMF during the microwave-assisted sol–gel synthesis technique can be attributed to the efficient diffusion of Na\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              +\n                           \n                        \n                      ions into/from the host structure during the intercalation/de-intercalation process as indicated by the high value of sodium diffusion coefficient (1 × 109-3.58 × 109\n                     m2\n                     s\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                              −\n                              1\n                           \n                        \n                     ).

        "abstract": "Sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (Fe-HCF) has been proposed as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its desirable advantages, including high theoretical capacity (∼170 mAh g-1), eco-friendliness, and low cost of worldwide rich sodium and iron resources. Nonetheless, its application faces a number of obstacles due to poor electronic conductivity and structural instability. In this work, Fe-HCF nanospheres (NSs) were first synthesized and fabricated by an in situ graphene rolls (GRs) wrapping method, forming a 1D tubular hierarchical structure of Fe-HCF NSs@GRs. GRs not only provide fast electronic conduction path for Fe-HCF NSs but also effectively prevent organic electrolyte from reaching active materials and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. The Fe-HCF NSs@GRs composite has been used as a binder-free cathode with a capacity of ∼110 mAh g-1 at a current density of 150 mA g-1 (∼1C), the capacity retention of ∼90% after 500 cycles. Moreover, the Fe-HCF NSs@GRs cathode displays a super high rate capability with ∼95 mAh g-1 at 1500 mA g-1 (∼10C). The results suggest that the 1D tubular structure of 2D GRs-wrapped Fe-HCF NSs is promising as a high-performance cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Most P2-type layered oxides suffer from multiple voltage plateaus, due to Na+/vacancy-order superstructures caused by strong interplay between Na-Na electrostatic interactions and charge ordering in the transition metal layers. Here, Mg ions are successfully introduced into Na sites in addition to the conventional transition metal sites in P2-type Na0.7[Mn0.6Ni0.4]O2 as new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Mg ions in the Na layer serve as \"pillars\" to stabilize the layered structure, especially for high-voltage charging, meanwhile Mg ions in the transition metal layer can destroy charge ordering. More importantly, Mg ion occupation in both sodium and transition metal layers will be able to create \"Na-O-Mg\" and \"Mg-O-Mg\" configurations in layered structures, resulting in ionic O 2p character, which allocates these O 2p states on top of those interacting with transition metals in the O-valence band, thus promoting reversible oxygen redox. This innovative design contributes smooth voltage profiles and high structural stability. Na0.7Mg0.05[Mn0.6Ni0.2Mg0.15]O2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance, especially good capacity retention at high current rate under a high cutoff voltage (4.2 V). A new P2 phase is formed after charge, rather than an O2 phase for the unsubstituted material. Besides, multiple intermediate phases are observed during high-rate charging. Na-ion transport kinetics are mainly affected by elemental-related redox couples and structural reorganization. These findings will open new opportunities for designing and optimizing layer-structured cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium layered transition metal oxides have been considered as promising cathode materials for sodium ion batteries due to their large capacity and high operating voltage. However, mechanism investigations of chemical evolution and capacity failure at high voltage are inadequate. As a representative cathode, Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, the capacity contribution at a 4.2 V plateau has long been assigned to the redox of the Ni3+/Ni4+ couple, while at the same time it suffers large irreversible capacity loss during the initial discharging process. In this work, we prove that the capacity at the 4.2 V plateau is contributed to the irreversible O2–/O2n–/O2 evolution based on in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculation results. Besides, a phenomenon of oxygen release and subsequent surface lattice densification is observed, which is responsible for the large irreversible capacity loss during the initial cycle. Furthermore, the oxygen release is successfully suppressed by Fe substitution due to the formation of a unique Fe-(O–O) species, which effectively stabilizes the reversibility of the O2–/O2n– redox at high operating voltage. Our findings provide a new understanding of the chemical evolution in layered transition metal oxides at high operating voltage. Increasing the covalency of the TM–O bond has been proven to be effective in suppressing the oxygen release and hence improving the electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Conjugated quinones are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, the contemporary primary conjugated quinones cathodes still hold to limited capacity, poor rate performance and low cyclability, due to the poor electronic and ionic conductivity. Herein, a series of high-performance conjugated-quinones@MXene hybrid cathodes is constructed by an in situ polymerization-assembly strategy based on the hydrogen bond and S-Ti interaction. The PAQS@Ti3C2Tx MXene hybrid, as a typical example, exhibits sandwiched structure with intimate PAQS@MXene contact, resulting in efficient interfacial mass transfer. The assembled MXene is able to build interconnected conductive channels in the hybrid cathodes for continuous and fast electrons/ions transport, which is verified by both the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, the optimal PAQS@MXene hybrid electrode delivers excellent electrochemical performances with high capacity (∼242 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1), superior fast-charge/discharge ability (∼148 and 121 mA h g-1 at 5 and 10 A g-1, respectively), and ultralong cycle life (capacity as high as 57 mA h g-1 after 9000 cycles at 5 A g-1), which are more superior to that of the pure PAQS electrodes. Besides, the analogous PPTS@Ti3C2Tx MXene hybrid cathode also shows better performances compared to the pure materials.",

        "abstract": "The cathode material Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has shown great potential for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its cost-effectiveness, prolonged cycle life, and high theoretical capacity. However, the practical large-scale production of NFPP is hindered by its poor intrinsic electron conductivity and the presence of a NaFePO4 impurity. In this study, we propose a mutually reinforcing approach involving Ti doping, mechanical nano treatment, and in situ carbon coating to produce Ti-NFPP via the solid-state methods of synthesis. Ti doping strengthens the covalent Fe-O interaction, hence accelerating the electron transfer and the redox reactions Fe2+/Fe3+. In situ carbon coating improves electrical conductivity and allows for accommodating the volumetric variation. Nanosized treatment promotes the uniform progression of solid-state reactions. The synthesized Na4Fe2.98Ti0.01(PO4)2P2O7 material (Ti-NFPP) exhibits promising electrochemical properties with an initial discharge specific capacity of 112.5 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C. A volumetric change of only 2.98% was observed during the de/sodiation process, indicating an enhanced reversibility of the crystal lattice. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional cycling stability with a capacity retention rate of 97.2 mA h g-1 at 10 C over 5000 cycles. These findings offer a promising pathway for the large-scale production of Ti-NFPP in SIBs.",

The coating facilitates higher mobility of the ion through the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and enables higher capacity during cycling. The TiO2 @NVPF exhibit discharge capacity of >120 mAhg-1 , even at 1C rates, and show lower irreversible capacity in the first cycle. Further, nearly 100% capacity retention after rate performance in high current densities and 99.9% coulombic efficiency after prolonged cycling in high current density is reported. The improved performance in TiO2 @NVPF is ascribed to the passivation behavior of TiO2  coating which protects the surface of NVPF from volume expansion, significantly less formation of carbonates, and decomposition of electrolyte, which is also validated through post cycling analysis. The study shows the importance of ultrathin surface protection artificial CEI for advanced sodium-ion battery cathodes. The protection layer is diminishing parasitic reaction, which eventually enhances the Na ion participation in reaction and stabilizes the cathode structure.",

Nonetheless, the conventional solid-state reaction synthesis of NVP suffers from limitations such as a small surface area, irregular shape, and suboptimal electrochemical properties. To address these challenges, a two-step approach is masterfully designed in this study, commencing with the modulation of the morphology of vanadium-based precursor through chemical precipitation. Subsequently, the uniform carbon-coated porous NVP@C composite with a significantly enhanced specific surface area of 83.22 m2 g−1 is devised through the solid-state reaction. Compared to traditional precipitation methods producing VO(OH)2 from VOSO4 solution, which have low efficiency and uneven precursor formation, adding cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant enhanced vanadium precipitation (99.9 %) and yielded uniform nanoflower-shaped precursor with a large surface area. Remarkably, the synthesized NVP@C composite achieved an impressive reversible capacity of 87.7 mA h g−1 at a challenging 5C rate, with 80.0 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

However, their further development is seriously limited due to the complex phase transition, sluggish kinetics of Na+, and intrinsic air instability. Herein, an interlayer substituted NFM (IS-NFM) is constructed by a simple solid-state method with the introduction of alkaline-earth metal. The interlayer substitution will lead to the increase of oxygen content in the internal lattice, which will effectively suppress the irreversible phase transition during cycling and exposure to the air. In addition, the interlayer substitution effectively activated the charge compensation, leading to the mobilized cationic redox process and boosted de-/sodiated kinetic. Consequently, IS-NFM exhibits excellent capacity retention of 83.44 % at 1 C after 200 cycles and remarkable stability even at high voltage. After 15 days of exposure to the air, IS-NFM also delivers superior capacity retention (86.53 %, compared with 0.1 C) and cycling performance (82.70 % at 1 C after 200 cycles). Undoubtedly, the interlayer substitution strategy will expand a novel avenue for constructing air-stable and long-life O3-type oxides for commercial application.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are on the verge of achieving practical applications, and the key is to find suitable electrode materials. The polyanionic iron-based material Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 (NFPO) possesses an open three-dimensional framework structure with good thermal stability and is regarded as an outstanding cathode material for SIBs. Nevertheless, its poor electrical conductivity, problems with erosion of electrolytes, and structural deterioration during cycling still need to be urgently addressed. Here, we first design a Mg2+-doped NFPO (NFPO-Mg) material with a dual-action effect. On the one hand, Mg2+ improves the intrinsic conductivity of the NFPO material, and on the other hand, Mg2+ promotes the formation of a homogeneous and stable cathode-electrolyte interphase film during the cycling process, which results in a superior rate performance and cycling stability. A capacity of 68.6 mAh g-1 was achieved at 50C (1C = 117.4 mAh g-1), and a capacity retention of 79.1% was maintained after 3000 cycles at 20C. More impressively, NFPO-Mg exhibits outstanding high-temperature electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 95.3% after 400 cycles at 10C at 60 °C (much higher than the 54.2% for the NFPO). This paper explores an effective method for improving the electrochemical performance of cathode materials, which may prove instrumental in guiding the design of more high-performance cathode materials in the future.",

Ex situ X-ray diffraction combined with diffusion kinetics tests and microstructural characterizations demonstrate that high-entropy enhanced structural stability effectively prevents the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+, stabilizes the Na+ diffusion channels, and enables the smooth transfer of more working Na+.

        "title": "Comparative study of Na0.67Ni0.25Co0.17Mn0.58O2 P-Type cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries: Combustion synthesis and combined analysis of structural, electrical, and dielectric properties",
        "abstract": "In this study, we present a promising sodium-ion cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.25Co0.17Mn0.58O2, which was synthesized by combustion method, and subsequent heat treatment at various calcination temperatures (700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C). The samples underwent analysis using various techniques, including Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDS), Specific Surface Area Measurements (BET), and Impedance Spectroscopy Measurements (EIS). The XRD pattern of the sample prepared at 700 °C reveals that the lower annealing temperature induces the formation of a new phase, P3. Indeed, the phase transition from the rhombohedral P3-phase to hexagonal P2-phase at 900 °C via mixed phases (P3/P2) yielded at 800 °C. Furthermore, Rietveld refinement using the hexagonal unit cell leads the calculation of the network parameters and the structural stacking, showing that the P2-phase exhibits a more pronounced two-dimensional character compared to the P3-phase. FT-IR spectra reveal that the lattice structures of the samples consist of NaO6 and MeO6 (Me = Ni, Co, Mn) octahedra. SEM-EDS analysis shows a homogeneous surface morphology in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental proportions of the elements constituting the three P-type phases. Subsequently, we extensively investigated the effect of our P-type materials on the electrical and dielectric properties of the cathodes using EIS measurements. Our findings suggest that the low-cost and eco-friendly P2–Na0.67Ni0.25Co0.17Mn0.58O2 phase shows promise as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries and represents a competitive alternative to the P3/P2- and P3–Na0.67Ni0.25Co0.17Mn0.58O2 phases.",

        "abstract": "This research work focuses on the synthesis and performance evaluation of NaFexCr1−X(SO4)2 (X = 0, 0.8 and 1.0) cathode materials in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The novel materials having a primary particle size of around 100–200 nm were synthesized through a sol–gel process by reacting stoichiometric amounts of the precursor materials. The structural analysis confirms the formation of crystalline, phase pure materials that adopt a monoclinic crystal structure. Thermal analysis indicates the superior thermal stability of NaFe0.8Cr0.2(SO4)2 when compared to NaFe(SO4)2 and NaCr(SO4)2. Galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis indicates that the intercalation/de-intercalation of a sodium ion (Na+) into/from NaFe(SO4)2 ensues at about 3.2 V due to the Fe2+/Fe3+ active redox couple. Moreover, ex situ XRD analysis confirms that the insertion/de-insertion of sodium into/from the host structure during charging/discharging is accompanied by a reversible single-phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction. A similar sodium intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism has been noticed in NaFe0.8Cr0.2(SO4)2which has not been reported earlier. The galvanostatic measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirm that the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox couple is inactive in NaFexCr1−X(SO4)2 (X = 0, 0.8) and thus does not contribute to capacity augmentation. However, suitable carbon coating may lead to activation of the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox couple in these inactive materials.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) offer significant advantages for energy storage on a large scale, attributed to their economical cost, secure operation, and eco-friendly nature. Among the leading cathode materials for ASIBs, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) exhibits excellent structural stability and a high Na+ diffusion coefficient, making it a promising option. However, the high solubility of vanadium-based materials in aqueous electrolytes engenders suboptimal cycling stability for Na3V2(PO4)3, constraining its application in ASIBs. Herein, the Cr-substituted Na3V1.3Cr0.7(PO4)3@C (NV1.3Cr0.7P) cathode material was synthesized via a simple sol-gel method. It is found that Cr substitution reduces the cell parameters of NV1.3Cr0.7P, effectively reinforcing the crystal structure. Furthermore, NV1.3Cr0.7P alters the Na+ insertion/extraction mechanism, transforming the typical two-phase reaction between Na1V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 into continuous solid-solution reactions with stable intermediates. The Cr substitution diminishes the sodium-ion diffusion energy barrier in NV1.3Cr0.7P, leading to smoother Na+ insertion and extraction processes. Consequently, NV1.3Cr0.7P exhibits impressive cycling stability, retaining 74.8% of its capacity after 5,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, along with an outstanding rate performance of 79.2% at 10 A g−1. This work elucidates the stable Na+ insertion/extraction processes in Cr-substituted NV1.3Cr0.7P, offering insights into the application of vanadium-based materials in aqueous sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Revealing the effect of morphology engineering in boosting the structural stability of P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathodes for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxide materials are regarded as one of the leading candidates for sodium-ion cathode materials, due to their stable structure. However, there demonstrate poor cycling stability and unsatisfactory rate performance, which can be improved or overcome by morphological engineering, cation doping, etc. Reasonable morphology modulation is beneficial to improve the reactivity of materials, enhance Na+ kinetics, and stabilize the structure. Herein, we utilized the metal-organic framework (MOFs) as a sacrificial template to achieve morphological engineering of P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMOX). Due to the morphology adjustability of MOFs, the NNMOX exhibited various morphologies. Among them, the NNMO1 material derived from Ni-Mn-BDC (H2BDC = 1,4-dicarboxybenzene) is a flower-like structure with an enlarged d-spacing and the length of the Na–O bond in the Na+ diffusion layer. Benefiting from this, the NNMO1 demonstrated the most cycling stability (≈89 % capacity retention after 250 cycles) and good rate capability (112.5 mA h g−1 at 5 C). This study provides new insights into the rational morphological engineering for P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 by revealing the influence between morphology, microstructure, and electrochemical performance, which may contribute to the creation of improved cathode materials in the future.",

        "title": "Role of the voltage window on the capacity retention of P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 cathode material for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "P2-Na_2/3[Fe_1/2Mn_1/2]O_2 layered oxide is a promising high energy density cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, one of its drawbacks is the poor long-term stability in the operating voltage window of 1.5–4.25 V vs Na^+/Na that prevents its commercialization. In this work, additional light is shed on the origin of capacity fading, which has been analyzed using a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical methods. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been performed on P2-Na_2/3[Fe_1/2Mn_1/2]O_2 half-cells operating in two different working voltage windows, one allowing and one preventing the high voltage phase transition occurring in P2-Na_2/3[Fe_1/2Mn_1/2]O_2 above 4.0 V vs Na^+/Na; so as to unveil the transport properties at different states of charge and correlate them with the existing phases in P2-Na_2/3[Fe_1/2Mn_1/2]O_2. Supporting X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments to elucidate the surface properties along with theoretical calculations have concluded that the formed electrode-electrolyte interphase is very thin and stable, mainly composed by inorganic species, and reveal that the structural phase transition at high voltage from P2- to “Z”/OP4-oxygen stacking is associated with a drastic increased in the bulk electronic resistance of P2-Na_2/3[Fe_1/2Mn_1/2]O_2 electrodes which is one of the causes of the observed capacity fading. P2-Na_2/3[Fe_1/2Mn_1/2]O_2 is a promising high energy density cathode material for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries, but its poor long-term stability in the operating voltage window of 1.5–4.25 V vs Na^+/Na hinders its commercial application. Here, the authors use a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and DFT calculations to investigate the origin of the capacity fading, which is attributed to an increase in bulk electronic resistance at high voltage that, among other factors, is nested in a structural phase transition.",

        "abstract": "Due to the ability to form more open structures, glass and glass-ceramic materials can accommodate larger Na+ ions and enable rapid solid-state diffusion of Na+ at room temperature (RT). Regardless of the larger ionic radius of Na, iron-based mixed-vanadium-phosphate ceramics show promising potential as cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical applicability is significantly hindered by slow Na+ diffusion and low intrinsic electrical conductivity. In the present study, a ceramic sample with the composition of 5Na2O–45Fe2O3–10V2O5–40P2O5, denoted as (5NFVP), was synthesized before (BHT) and after heat treatment (HT) at 500, 600, and 700 °C for 2h to be used as a cathode material in SIBs. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the 5NFVP ceramic is attributed to improved electronic and ionic conductivity and enhanced structural stability during Na+ insertion/de-insertion. This is supported by various analyses, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). All prepared samples show two doublets, with the first doublet associated with Fe3+(T\n                     d), confirming the XRD results that indicate the main crystalline phase of FePO4. The second doublet observed in the 5NFVP-HT500 and 600°C is related to Fe3+(O\n                     h), while 5NFVP-BHT exhibits a large δ value of 1.19 mm s−1, indicating the presence of Fe2+(O\n                     h) due to NaFePO4 crystalline phase. The Fe–K absorption edge analysis reveals that 5NFVP-HT600°C ceramics predominantly consist of Fe3+, whereas 5NFVP-BHT has the most abundant Fe2+ compared with HT samples. The largest DC conductivity is achieved by the 5NFVP-HT600°C ceramic, reaching 5.08 × 10−9 S cm−1 at RT. The initial capacity of 5NFVP-HT ceramics is approximately doubled compared to 5NFVP-BHT. The 5NFVP-HT600°C ceramic as a cathode demonstrates excellent long-cycling stability, retaining 60 % of its capacity over 100 cycles under a current rate of 50 mA g−1. These findings underscore the significant potential of 5NFVP-HT600°C for advanced energy storage systems, given its affordability and robust cyclability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) can use elements that are abundantly present in Earth’s crust and are technologically feasible for replacing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Hence, NIBs are essential components for sustainable energy storage applications. All-solid-state sodium batteries are among the most capable substitutes to LIBs because of their potential to have low price, great energy density, and consistent safety. Nevertheless, more advancements are needed to improve the electrochemical performance of the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode for NIBs, especially with regard to rate performance and operational lifespan. Herein, a core–shell NVP/C structure is accomplished by adopting a solid-state method. The initial reversible capacity of the NVP/C cathode is 106.6 mAh/g (current rate of C/10), which approaches the theoretical value (117.6 mAh/g). It also exhibits outstanding electrochemical characteristics with a reversible capacity of 85.3 mAh/g at 10C and a cyclic retention of roughly 94.2% after 1100 cycles. Using synchrotron-based operando X-ray diffraction, we present a complete examination of phase transitions during sodium extraction and intercalation in NVP/C. To improve safety and given its excellent ionic conductivity and broad electrochemical window, a Na superionic conductor (NASICON) solid electrolyte (Na3.16Zr1.84Y0.16Si2PO12) has been integrated to obtain an all-solid-state NVP/C||Na battery, which provides an exceptional reversible capacity (95 mAh/g at C/10) and long-term cycling stability (retention of 78.3% after 1100 cycles).",

The combination of theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveals that LiTM creates Na-O-Li electronic configurations to boost the capacity derived from the oxygen anionic redox, while LiAM serves as LiO6 prismatic pillars to stabilize the layered structure through suppressing the detrimental phase transitions. As a result, NMLMO delivers a high specific capacity of 266 mAh g-1 and simultaneously exhibits the nearly zero-strain characteristic within a wide voltage range of 1.5-4.6 V.

        "abstract": "The sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnPB) has drawn widely attention as a remarkable cathode material for sodium-ions batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity (∼170 mAh g–1), environmental-friendly and low cost. However, it suffers from serious capacity fading and inferior cycling stability caused by the inevitable Jahn-Teller distortion and significant volume change during Na+insertion/extraction process. Herein, we propose a simple one-pot method for constructing a multi-shelled Mn-based Prussian blue through sequentially epitaxial growth CoPB and NiPB on the surface of MnPB (NiCoMnPB). The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the unequal affinities of different metal ions with various chelating agents (citrate and ferrocyanide), leading to the dissociation and recombination of metal ions and chelating agents in a certain order. Effectively inheriting merits of CoPB and NiPB, the NiCoMnPB reveals enhanced charge transfer kinetics, suppressed volume change and alleviative Jahn-Teller distortion during cycling, thereby exhibiting superior rate capacity (∼54.2 mAh g–1 at 3200 mA/g), long-term cyclic stability and capacity retention (∼76 % over 1000 cycles at 800 mA/g). This work provides a simple method to construct multi-shelled PBAs, which can integrate the virtues of different materials to ameliorate the electrochemical properties of initial materials.",

These excellent electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of Cr and Fe in the NVP structure, as verified experimentally and theoretically.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can develop cost-effective and safe energy storage technology for substantial energy storage demands. In this work, we have developed manganese oxide (α-MnO2) nanorods for SIB applications. The crystal structure, which is crucial for high-performance energy storage, is examined systematically for the metal oxide cathode. The intercalation of sodium into the α-MnO2 matrix was studied using the theoretical density functional theory (DFT) studies. The DFT studies predict Na ions’ facile diffusion kinetics through the MnO2 lattice with an attractively low diffusion barrier (0.21 eV). When employed as a cathode material for SIBs, MnO2 showed a moderate capacity (109 mAh·g–1 at C/20 current rate) and superior life cyclability (58.6% after 800 cycles) in NaPF6/EC+DMC (5% FEC) electrolyte. It shows a much higher capacity of 181 mAh·g–1 (C/20 current rate) in NaClO4/PC (5% FEC) electrolyte, though it suffers fast capacity fading (11.5% after 800 cycles). Our findings show that high crystallinity and hierarchical nanorod morphology of the MnO2 are responsible for better cycling performance in conjunction with fast and sustained charge-discharge behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have currently garnered increasing attention due to their promising applications and potential advantages. Despite the cost and performance advantages, the Co/Ni-free Fe-Mn-based cathode materials tends to undergo a large phase transition in the sodium (de)intercalation layer, which will result in the material structure damage. In this work, high entropy P2/O3-Na0.75Cu0.1Fe0.2Mg0.2Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCFMMT) materials were successfully prepared by employing NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) as the modification layer. It can be distinctly seen that the cyclic stability of NCFMMT@NTP has been significantly improved, and the first capacity at 0.2C reaches 165.32 mAh/g and the capacity can maintain 86.73 % after 100 cycles. Moreover, the voltage hysteresis after triggering anionic redox can be clearly ameliorated. Apparently, the high-entropy strategy not only can satisfactorily optimize the lattice structure and stability of the cathode material during sodium intercalation/de-intercalation process, but also can increase the ion mobilization rate and promote further electrochemical properties. Therefore, this study provides valuable exploration for the design and preparation of cobalt/nickel-free cathodes with excellent electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-based oxides are promising candidates as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost and high specific capacity. However, the Jahn–Teller distortion from high-spin Mn3+ induces detrimental lattice strain and severe structural degradation during sodiation and desodiation. Herein, lithium is introduced to partially substitute manganese ions to form distorted P′2-Na0.67Li0.05Mn0.95O2, which leads to restrained anisotropic change of Mn–O bond lengths and reinforced bond strength in the [MnO6] octahedra by mitigation of Jahn–Teller distortion and contraction of MnO2 layers. This ensures the structural stability during charge and discharge of P′2-Na0.67Li0.05Mn0.95O2 and Na+/vacancy disordering for facile Na+ diffusion in the Na layers with a low activation energy barrier of ∼0.53 eV. It exhibits a high specific capacity of 192.2 mA h g−1, good cycling stability (90.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles) and superior rate capability (118.5 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1), as well as smooth charge/discharge profiles.

Our findings demonstrate that doping with Ca2+ significantly enhances the electrochemical performance, as evidenced by comparisons with undoped materials. Specifically, the material Na0.95Ca0.025(Ni0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33)O2, synthesized at 900 °C, showed the best electrochemical performance, achieving an initial discharge specific capacity of 137 mAh/g within a voltage range of 2–4 V, maintaining a capacity of 117 mAh/g at a 5C discharge rate, and exhibiting a capacity retention rate of 96.2 % after 50 cycles at 1C. Additionally, Ca2+ doping was found to enhance the air stability, with negligible change in initial discharge capacity after exposure to air for 24 and 72 h. This doping strategy not only improves the performance of sodium-ion batteries but also supports the development of high-energy–density industrial batteries, offering a viable approach to designing other layered oxide materials.",

We discover that electronic delocalization takes place at the early stage of charge, which may account for the excellent rate performance. In addition, via EPR imaging, an EPR signal associated with the irreversible phase transition at 3.8 V is located in the electrolyte, which is then attributed to the Cr5+ ions dissolved with the surface reconstruction.

        "abstract": "P’2‐Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 (NMNO) is one of the most promising cathodic materials for new generation sodium‐ion batteries, SIBs. One drawback that is preventing its commercialization is however the high instability in the potential window 2.5 ‐ 4.5 V vs Na+/Na, caused by degradation reactions affecting the material’s structure and composition. Herein we propose a strategy to overcome this weak spot introducing the surface coating of the material particles with inert magnesium oxide, that has been chosen as coating agent because of its low molecular weight. This protective layer is able to reduce the structural instability of the material without modifying the mixed conduction properties and thus globally stabilizing the electrochemical performances. In fact, the electrode of NMNO coated with 7% of MgO, after an initial stabilization, was able to deliver over 90 mAh g‐1 of reversible specific capacity at a current value of 50 mA g‐1, with a capacity retention of 70% after 250 cycles, to be compared with the 30 mAh g‐1 of the uncoated material. The effect of the coating on the particles surface is here investigated with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, to analyze the influence of the treatment on the electrode/electrolyte interphase.",

Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with a NASICON structure, a high-ion-conductivity phosphate-based solid electrolyte, was used as the coating material.

        "abstract": "In a community where industrialization and urbanization keep expanding, there is growing demand for rechargeable energy storage systems (ESS). ESS is crucial in modern power grids and renewable energy integration which provides solutions for energy reliability, efficiency, and sustainability. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, namely, batteries, supercapacitors, flywheels, compressed air energy storage and pumped energy storage. Enhancing energy density, power density, lifetime, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency are the main goals of ESS technology. Because of their high energy density and efficiency, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) currently command most of the market. However, newer technologies such as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), solid-state batteries, and redox flow batteries are drawing interest because they may provide safer, more affordable, and environmentally friendly alternatives. Since LIBs have been undergoing several challenges like lower lithium resources, limited electrode efficiency, incompatible electrolyte solutions and expensive product, it becomes necessary to develop alternative solutions like SIBs. Cathode and anode are the important aspects of a battery to deliver desired performance. As the transition to SIBs accelerate, there is a requirement to develop proper electrodes that is compatible with electrolyte solutions, cost-saving and demonstrate high efficiency. Anodes for SIBs have been widely discussed but there are few investigations for cathodes. In this paper, layered transition metal oxides cathodic materials for SIBs have been discussed along with their structural properties and electrochemical performances. Layered oxide cathode materials-based SIBs have high energy density. Moreover, affordability, and availability of sodium supplies, are essential to the development of SIBs. Nevertheless, several strategies to enhance the performance of the cathode materials are explored in following sections to comprehend the underlying mechanisms to improve the functionality and economic feasibility of cathodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Efficient and durable cathode materials are crucial for improving the performance and reliability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) in various energy storage applications. This work clarifies the complex mechanism of enhancing electrochemical performance of F-doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) through combining density functional theory (DFT) and experiments. The results suggest that Na2 cannot be extracted owing to the large coordination number and unique structure. The migration of sodium ions in NFPP is 1D and 2D rather than the commonly believed 3D, which could be interpreted by the fact that the c-direction channel is blocked by Na2 and cannot be released. The initial capacity of NFPP and NFPP-F electrodes at 1C are 95.7 and 105.9 mAh g−1, respectively. After 1000 cycles the capacity retention rate could separately reach up to 70.2 % and 86.2 %. The above results reveal that F doping is beneficial to improve the cyclic stability of NFPP materials, which is attributed to the change in the twisting mode of two P2O7 dimers during sodium extraction/insertion process. These findings contribute to ongoing research efforts aimed at developing high-performance NFPP sodium ion batteries, and thus facilitating their practical application in sustainable energy storage systems.",

        "title": "Stabilizing oxygen redox reaction in phase-transition-free P2-type Co/Ni-free cathode via Cu doping for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Due to their high capacity, the P2-type layered oxide cathodes containing oxygen redox reaction processes have attracted wide attention for sodium-ion batteries. However, these materials usually exhibit poor electro- chemical properties, resulting from irreversible oxygen redox reactions and phase transition processes at high voltages, and thus hinder their large-scale application. This work reveals the mechanism for the significantly improved cycle stability and rate performance of Co/Ni-free Na_0.75Li_0.25−2/3 x Cu_ x Mn_0.75−1/3 x O_2 via Cu doping. Ex-situ XPS demonstrates that Cu doping reduces the amount of Mn^3+ that triggers the Jahn-Teller effect during the cycling. In addition, the electron enrichment of oxygen around Cu can alleviate the irreversible oxidation of oxygen, and thus suppressing the phase transition originates from the rapid weakening of the electrostatic repulsion between O-O. Meanwhile, in-situ XRD results verify that the Na_0.75Li_0.19Cu_0.09Mn_0.72O_2 maintains the P2 phase structure during charging and discharging, resulting in a near-zero strain characteristic of 1.9%. Therefore, the optimized cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 194.9 mAh g^−1 at 0.1 C and excellent capacity retention of 88.6% after 100 cycles at 5 C. The full cell paired with commercial hard carbon anode delivers energy density of 240 Wh kg^−1.

        "abstract": "Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 F3 (NVPF) is emerging as a promising cathode material for high-voltage sodium-ion batteries. Whereas, the inferior intrinsic electrical conductivity leading to poor rate performance and cycling stability. To address this issue, a strategy of synthesizing unique yolk-shell structured NVPF with copper substitution via spray drying method is proposed. Besides, the synergistic modulation of both crystalline structure and interfacial properties results in significantly enhanced intrinsic and interfacial conductivity of NVPF. The optimized yolk-shell structured cathode materials can possess a high capacity of 117.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, and remains a high-capacity retention of 91.3% after 5000 cycles. A detailed investigation of kinetic properties combined with in situ XRD technology and DFT calculations, has been implemented, particularly with regard to electron conduction and sodium ion diffusion. Consequently, the yolk-shell structured composition of Na3 V1.94 Cu0.06 (PO4 )2 F3 with nitrogen-modified carbon coating layer shows the lowest polarization potential because of the effectively enhanced electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion process in the bulk phase. The robust electrochemical performance suggests that developing the unique yolk-shell structure with the collaboration of interface and bulk crystal properties is a favorable strategy to design cathode material with a high performance for sodium-ion batteries.",

The half cells exhibited a specific capacity of 111.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 C as well as an 82.64% capacity retention with a high initial capacity of 85.80 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles under a rate of 5 C. Notably, in situ X-ray diffraction revealed a reversible P2-OP4 phase transition and displayed a tiny volume change of 6.96% during the charge/discharge process, indicating an outstanding cycling stability of the modified cathode.

Spray drying provides porous, hierarchically structured particles of cathode active material (CAM) in large amounts, suitable for up‐scaling. Changing the chemical composition of the Na0.6Al0.11 − xNi0.22 − yFex + yMn0.66O2 layered oxides under identical synthesis conditions lead to differences in particle morphology, conductivities, sodium vacancy ordering, and phase transition, therefore influencing the electrochemical performance via several mechanisms. Here, a broad overview on these changes for samples with variable nickel and iron content is presented. With increasing iron content, the particle porosity is reduced and lower initial capacity is received for most cycling windows. Substituting half of the original Ni amount with Fe still leads to high capacities and improved cycling stability. The influence of Al as electrochemically inactive element becomes visible in stabilized cycling stability as well.",

The materials exhibit superior structural reversibility and moisture insensitivity. In-operando XRD reveals an essential correlation between cycling stability and phase reversibility, whereas Mg substitution suppressed the P2-O2 phase transition by forming a new Z phase, and Mg/Sn cosubstitution enhanced the P2-Z transition reversibility benefiting from strong Sn-O bonds. DFT calculations disclosed high chemical tolerance to moisture, as the adsorption energy to H2O was lower than that of the pure Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2.

Sodium-based layered oxides with a P2-type layered framework have been considered as one of the most promising cathode materials for SIBs. However, they suffer from the undesired P2-O2 phase transition, which leads to rapid capacity decay and limited reversible capacities. Herein, we show that this problem can be significantly mitigated by substituting some of the nickel ions with magnesium to obtain Na0.67 Mn0.67 Ni0.33-x Mgx O2 (0≤x≤0.33). Both the reversible capacity and the capacity retention of the P2-type cathode material were remarkably improved as the P2-O2 phase transition was thus suppressed during cycling. This strategy might also be applicable to the modulation of the physical and chemical properties of layered oxides and provides new insight into the rational design of high-capacity and highly stable cathode materials for SIBs.",

Opposite to the good cyclic capability at room temperature, however, the high-temperature cyclability of NaCrO_2 deteriorates due to the complex irreversible structural evolution in NaCrO_2 during cycling at elevated temperatures.

        "abstract": "Although the electrochemical properties of various cathode candidates for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are intensively studied on the material level, the evaluation and comparison from the perspective of future practical implementation are still lacking. In particular, air stability, which is often overlooked, will not only affect the electrode manufacturing processes but also cause detrimental structural change. Herein, two recently commercialized cathode products of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) are adopted to evaluate their stability in ambient atmospheres and investigate the structural degradation mechanisms. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the stability of NFM is significantly inferior to that of NVP during air exposure owing to the thermodynamically preferred chemical transformation of NFM. Furthermore, Raman mapping and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) measurements reveal the generation of alkaline, which accelerates the structural degradation of NFM. Accordingly, a simple second‐sintering strategy is proposed to enhance the air stability of NFM by removing impurities and retrieving surface‐precipitated Na+ into the crystalline host. In situ XRD reveals the stabilized crystal structure after the second‐sintering treatment not only effectively inhibits the chemical transformation of NFM in air but also endows the improved cycling stability (a high capacity retention of 90.7% after 200 cycles).",

Nonetheless, its practical utilization is impeded by challenges related to insufficient cycling stability, primarily stemming from poor structural stability due to large defects in the lattice structures and irreversible phase transitions. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to overcome these challenges by substituting the manganese sites of PW with 10 mol% copper. During the synthesis process, substitution with Cu enabled the formation of fewer defects and interstitial water. Cu has no electrochemical redox reactions during the charge-discharge process; so, it showed an initial lower capacity(120 mAh g-1 at 0.1C). However, Cu substitution resulted in a significant improvement in the long-term cycling stability(67.6% at 10C after 500 cycles) by relieving structural stress due to the reversible rhombohedral-to-cubic phase transition. Moreover, the pouch cell (PW-Cu10/hard carbon) exhibits a discharge capacity of 85.4 mAh g−1 and stable cycling retention of 80% at 1.0C after 250 cycles. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for designing practical Prussian white cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

The case that the Fermi energy level difference between R-MnO2 and NaMnO2 is lower than that between the layered Na(12-x)/12MnO2 and NaMnO2 makes the potential plateau of R-MnO2 turning into NaMnO2 lower than that of the layered Na(12-x)/12MnO2 to NaMnO2. This can be confirmed by our experiment from the 1st-2nd voltage capacity profile of R-MnO2 in EC/PC (ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate) electrolyte. The study would give a new view of the production of sustainable sodium battery cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐based layered oxides are among the leading cathode candidates for sodium‐ion batteries, toward potential grid energy storage, having large specific capacity, good ionic conductivity, and feasible synthesis. Despite their excellent prospects, the performance of layered intercalation materials is affected by both a phase transition induced by the gliding of the transition metal slabs and air‐exposure degradation within the Na layers. Here, this problem is significantly mitigated by selecting two ions with very different MO bond energies to construct a highly ordered Ni6‐ring superstructure within the transition metal layers in a model compound (NaNi2/3Sb1/3O2). By virtue of substitution of 1/3 nickel with antimony in NaNiO2, the existence of these ordered Ni6‐rings with super‐exchange interaction to form a symmetric atomic configuration and degenerate electronic orbital in layered oxides can not only largely enhance their air stability and thermal stability, but also increase the redox potential and simplify the phase‐transition process during battery cycling. The findings reveal that the ordered Ni6‐ring superstructure is beneficial for constructing highly stable layered cathodes and calls for new paradigms for better design of layered materials.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered transition-metal (TM) oxides, NaxTMO2, are highly promising as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent rate capability and affordability. However, P2-type NaxTMO2 is afflicted by issues such as Na+/vacancy ordering and multiple phase transitions during Na-extraction/insertion, leading to staircase-like voltage profiles. In this study, we employ a combination of high Na content and Li dual-site substitution strategies to enhance the structural stability of a P2-type layered oxide (Na0.80Li0.024[Li0.065Ni0.22Mn0.66]O2). The experimental results reveal that these approaches facilitate the oxidation of Mn ions to a higher valence state, thereby affecting the local environment of both TM and Na ions. The resulting modification in the local structure significantly improves the Na-ion storage capabilities as required for cathode materials in SIBs. Furthermore, it induces a solid-solution reaction and enables nearly zero-strain operation (ΔV = 0.7%) in the Na0.80Li0.024[Li0.065Ni0.22Mn0.66]O2 cathode during cycling. The assembled full cells demonstrate an exceptional rate performance, with a retention rate of 87% at 10 C compared to that of 0.1 C, as well as an ultrastable cycling capability, maintaining a capacity retention of 73% at 2 C after 1000 cycles. These findings offer valuable insights into the electronic and structural chemistry of ultrastable cathode materials with \"zero-strain\" Na-ion storage.",

Herein, the development and optimization of the aqueous electrode processing for the ecofriendly Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) cathode material, employing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as binder, are reported for the first time. The characterization of such an electrode reveals that the performances are strongly affected by the employed electrolyte solution, especially, the sodium salt and the use of electrolyte's additives.

With this electrolyte, the outstanding capacity of 99.7 mA h g-1 is delivered by the CMC-NMO cathode after 800 cycles at a 1C charge/discharge rate. On the basis of this excellent long-term performance, a full sodium cell, composed of a CMC-based NMO cathode and hard carbon from biowaste (corn cob), has been assembled and tested.

Micron-scale single crystals with greater packing density and lower surface area can overcome these challenges and improve performance compared to the traditional polycrystalline morphology. Herein, the authors present the synthesis of layered O3-type Na(Ni0.3 Fe0.4 Mn0.3 )O2 single-crystals with greatly improved cycle life and air stability. A molten-salt synthesis technique is adopted with excess sodium hydroxide to obtain platelet-like single crystals. Because the main mechanisms of both capacity fade and air degradation occur as a result of surface reactions at the opening of the sodium diffusion channels, particle morphology is found to be a critical metric for materials performance. More important than particle size or total surface area, the smaller proportion of exposed edge planes in the platelet morphology greatly reduces the amount of harmful surface reactions. Furthermore, the molten-salt method is found to eliminate the need for coprecipitated precursors and even form better morphology, starting from metal oxides instead of coprecipitated hydroxides.",

The W‐doping not only enriches the sodium storage sites but also improves the cycling performance.

In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the enhanced structural stability of the P2‐Na0.44Mn0.99W0.01O2 electrodes.

        "abstract": "To fulfill the requirements for practical applications, it is urgent to boost the gravimetric energy density of sodium-ion batteries. An effective way is to increase the charging voltage of O3-type layered cathodes preferably to 4.2 V versus Na/Na+ (VNa). Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to achieve stable cycling of the cathodes at such a high cut-off voltage. Here a novel electrolyte strategy to design an intermolecular-reinforced electrolyte (IRE) is presented, utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, which facilitates stable high-voltage cycling of the commercially viable NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM). While the NFM with the IRE exhibits a high specific capacity of ≈158 mAh g-1 at 4.2 VNa (130 mAh g-1 at 4.0 VNa), the aggressive cathode surface can still be effectively stabilized by the formation of favorable thin and inorganic-rich cathode-electrolyte interfaces. Remarkably, under a high cut-off voltage of 4.2 VNa, an industrial ampere-hour-level NFM||hard carbon pouch cell with the IRE electrolyte shows an excellent long-term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles, largely outperforming the localized high-concentration electrolyte (82.9% after 200 cycles).",

        "abstract": "Low-cost and long-life cathode materials, such as the polyanionic iron-based Alluaudite-type Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3, are crucial for future large-scale energy storage applications. This material is typically synthesized from the hydrated precursor Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O. However, the vapor released during the heating of crystal water can lead to reduced crystallinity, increased fraction of Na6Fe(SO4)4 impurities, and potential structural damage to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3. For the first time, we synthesized a stable Stanfieldite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2 material using a well-designed sol-gel method. This approach effectively mitigates the aforementioned risks by facilitating a unique transition from anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 precursor to Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode. The enhanced crystallinity, controllable impurity fraction, and reduced migration barriers of the pristine Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3 cathode significantly improve electrochemical performance. Moreover, we constructed Na2+2δFe2-δ(SO4)3/C composite cathodes to optimize their high-rate capacity and cycling retention. At 25 °C, these composites exhibit remarkable high-rate capacity and maintain an impressive 92.2 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 C.

Herein, we propose a multivariate doping strategy with Cu, Mg, and Ti ions to solve the above problems of the O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode. The O3-Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)0.9Cu0.03Mg0.02Ti0.05O2 (NFMCMT) cathode exhibits enlarged Na+ diffusion channels and a strengthened layered structure, which improves the Na+ diffusion kinetics, suppresses the harmful P3-O3' phase transition at high voltages, and inhibits the intragranular fatigue cracks, leading to enhanced rate capability and cycling performance. As a result, the NFMCMT exhibits outstanding performance in the 2-4.1 V voltage window, delivers a discharge capacity of 151.2 mAh g-1 with the 81.5% capacity retention for 100 cycles at 0.1 C, and 83.1% capacity retention for 300 cycles at 5 C.

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-based oxides (LMOs) are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their versatile structures. However, the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ induces severe distortion of MnO6 octahedra, and the resultant low symmetry is responsible for the gliding of MnO2 layers and then inferior multiple-phase transitions upon Na+ extraction/insertion. Here, hexagonal P2-Na0.643 Li0.078 Mn0.827 Ti0.095 O2 is synthesized through the incorporation of Li and Ti into the distorted orthorhombic P'2-Na0.67 MnO2 to function as a phase-transition-free oxide cathode. It is revealed that Li in both the transition-metal and Na layers enhances the covalency of Mn-O bonds and allows degeneracy of Mn 3d eg orbitals to favor the formation of hexagonal phase, and the high strength of Ti-O bonds reduces the electrostatic interaction between Na and O for suppressed Na+ /vacancy rearrangements. These collectively lead to a whole-voltage-range solid-solution reaction between 1.8 and 4.3 V with a small volume variation of 1.49%. This rewards its excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 90% after 500 cycles) and rate capability (89 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Most P2-type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further lead to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na 2/3 Mn x Ni x-1/3 Co 4/3-2x O 2 (1/3 ≤ x ≤ 2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2-Na 2/3 Mn 1/2 Ni 1/6 Co 1/3 O 2 cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5-4.5 V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9%. Such a low strain is benefical for cycling stability. The current work provides a new and effective route to regulate the structural evolution of the promising P2-type layered cathode for sodium ion batteries.",

Despite their high energy density, structural flexibility, and ease of synthesis, P-type Na layered oxides cannot be utilized in energy-storage applications, owing to their severe capacity fading. In this regard, we report a novel composite layered-tunnel Na0.5Mn0.5Co0.48Mg0.02O2 cathode whose binary structure was confirmed via scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The combination of the two-dimensional (2D) layered oxides with the three-dimensional tunnel structure, as well as the presence of Mg2+ ions, resulted in a high capacity of 145 mAh g-1 at a current density of 85 mA g-1, along with a high stability and rate capability. An NIC was fabricated with 2D layered oxides as a battery-type electrode and commercial activated carbon as a counter electrode. The NIC exhibited a maximum energy density of 35 Wh kg-1 and good stability retaining 72% of its initial energy density after 3000 cycles. This integrated approach provides a new method for designing high-energy and high-power cathodes for NICs and NIBs.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides are considered promising cathode materials for next-generation high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, they face challenges, such as low rate capacity and poor cycling stability, which arise from structural deformation, sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, and interfacial side reactions. Herein, a synergistic substitution strategy for transitional and interstitial sites was adopted to improve the structure stability and Na+ diffusion kinetics of the O3-type NaNi0.2Fe0.4Mn0.4O2. Simulation results indicate that Co3+/B3+ codoping effectively lowers the Na+ migration energy barrier. In addition, the synergistic effect of Co3+/B3+ codoping provides ultralow lattice strain during repeated Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. In situ characterization verified that the complex phase transformation during charge and discharge was suppressed, thereby significantly improving the structural stability. At 1 and 3 C, the capacity retention of the modified O3-Na(Ni0.2Fe0.4Mn0.4)0.96Co0.04B0.02O2 (NFMCB) improved from 29.6% and 1.7% to 86.7% and 88.6% after 200 cycles, respectively. Even at 10 C, it could still produce 107.2 mAh·g-1. Furthermore, full cells assembled with this material and commercial hard carbon exhibit a high energy density of 316.2 Wh·kg-1 and a capacity retention of 80.8% after 200 cycles at 1 C.

        "abstract": "Multishelled binary metal oxide, which can exert a synergetic effect of different oxides, is a promising electrochemical electrode material. However, it is challenging to synthesize this kind of binary metal oxide due to the severe hydrolysis and/or precipitation reactions of the precursors between cations and anions of different metals. Herein, by using citric acid as a chelating agent to inhibit hydrolysis and precipitation, a series of multishelled binary metal oxide hollow spheres (Fe2(MoO4)3, NiMoO4, MnMoO4, CoWO4, MnWO4, etc.) were obtained via coabsorption of negative and positive metal ions. In addition, the chelation between a metal ion and citric acid is systematically validated by NMR, MS, Raman, and UV-vis. In particular, multishelled Fe2(MoO4)3 hollow spheres show excellent electrochemical performance as cathode material for sodium-ion batteries benefited from their structural superiorities. Especially, the quintuple-shelled Fe2(MoO4)3 hollow sphere shows the highest specific capacity (99.03 mAh g-1) among all Fe2(MoO4)3 hollow spheres, excellent stability (85.6 mAh g-1 was retained after 100 cycles at a current density of 2.2 C), and outstanding rate capability (67.4 mAh g-1 can be obtained at a current density of 10 C). This general approach can be extended to the synthesis of other multishelled multielement metal oxides and greatly enrich the diversity of hollow multishelled structures.",

        "title": "Impact of Potassium in Layered Cobalt Oxide Cathodes on Electrochemical Performance in Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries are promising sustainable energy storage systems, owing to their low cost and high energy density. However, the existing cathode chemistries, particularly layered sodium transition metal oxides, exhibit restricted electrochemical performance, which hinders their extensive applications. To overcome challenges, originating from kinetically limited structural transformations, various cation substitutions are reported in the literature. Especially the partial Na–K replacement is discussed recently, which can increase bulk Na‐diffusivity and suppress undesirable phase transitions. Here, a critical study of potassium doping in different layered materials P3‐K0.5Co0.33Mn0.67O2 and P3‐K0.5Co0.33Mn0.67O2*0.5H2O with redox‐active Co (and Mn), and P2‐Na0.7Co0.8Ti0.2O2 and P2‐K0.1Na0.7Co0.8Ti0.2O2 with Co activity is presented. It is found that the presence of K significantly enhances the moisture sensitivity: P3‐K0.5Co0.33Mn0.67O2*0.5H2O is quickly formed in the air from K0.5Co0.33Mn0.67O2, while Na0.7Co0.8Ti0.2O2 remains stable under the same conditions. In electrochemical Na‐cells, a partial K–Na cation exchange in P3‐K0.5Co0.33Mn0.67O2 and P3‐K0.5Co0.33Mn0.67O2*0.5H2O occurs without applying current. The electrochemical performance of P3‐K0.5Co0.33Mn0.67O2 is slightly increased in comparison to K‐free P2‐Na0.67Co0.33MnO.67O2 from the literature, staying, however, behind the performance of Na0.7Co0.8Ti0.2O2. K0.1Na0.7Co0.8Ti0.2O2 shows weaker rate capability than isostructural Na0.7Co0.8Ti0.2O2, reflecting a negative impact of K on Na‐diffusivity. Therefore, effect of K‐incorporation in layered structures on the battery performance strongly depends on the cathode composition.",

The composite C5O5Na2 cathode with carboxylic-acid-functionalized-(COOH–) MWCNT exhibits a 3.5 V-class high-voltage redox activity with a cycle performance higher than that of non-functionalized MWCNT/C5O5Na2 composite cathodes; the capacity retention ratio is improved from 0 % to 34 % after 30 cycles at 0.1C. Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance reveal the formation of hydrogen bonding between COOH groups on MWCNT and carbonyl groups in C5O5Na2 molecules; leading to suppression of organic molecules and improvement on the cycle performance. A full cell assembled with the C5O5Na2/COOH–MWCNT cathode and a hard carbon anode also shows a high-voltage redox plateau at around 3.5 V and a 1st discharge capacity of 123 mAh g−1 at 1C.

The resultant product is structurally and electrochemically investigated by combining X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, transition electron microscope, and electrochemical analysis. Experimental results show that the optimized NVPF/C product possesses a three-dimensional graphene-encapsulation nanostructure composed of ∼100 nm NVPF nanoparticles and ∼4 nm carbon-coating layer. The unique hierarchical structure enables it cycling with excellent electrochemical performance in terms of a high reversible capacity (116.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C), excellent high-rate capability (87.4 mA h g−1 at 10 C) and long-term lifetime (82.1% capacity retention after 1200 cycles).

        "abstract": "The high-theoretical-capacity (∼170 mAh/g) Prussian white (PW), NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]y·nH2O, is one of the most promising candidates for Na-ion batteries on the cusp of commercialization. However, it has limitations such as high variability of reported stable practical capacity and cycling stability. A key factor that has been identified to affect the performance of PW is water content in the structure. However, the impact of airborne moisture exposure on the electrochemical performance of PW and the chemical mechanisms leading to performance decay have not yet been explored. Herein, we for the first time systematically studied the influence of humidity on the structural and electrochemical properties of monoclinic hydrated (M-PW) and rhombohedral dehydrated (R-PW) Prussian white. It is identified that moisture-driven capacity fading proceeds via two steps, first by sodium from the bulk material reacting with moisture at the surface to form sodium hydroxide and partial oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. The sodium hydroxide creates a basic environment at the surface of the PW particles, leading to decomposition to Na4[Fe(CN)6] and iron oxides. Although the first process leads to loss of capacity, which can be reversed, the second stage of degradation is irreversible. Over time, both processes lead to the formation of a passivating surface layer, which prevents both reversible and irreversible capacity losses. This study thus presents a significant step toward understanding the large performance variations presented in the literature for PW. From this study, strategies aimed at limiting moisture-driven degradation can be designed and their efficacy assessed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Prussian blue (PB) is regarded as a promising cathode for sodium‐ion batteries because of its sustainable precursor elements (e.g., Mn, Fe), easy preparation, and unique framework structure. However, the unstable structure and inherent crystal H2O restrain its practical application. For this purpose, a self‐constructed trace Mg2+/K+ co‐doped PB prepared via a sea‐water‐mediated method is proposed to address this problem. The Mg2+/K+ co‐doping in the Na sites of PB is permitted by both thermodynamics and kinetics factors when synthesized in sea water. The results reveal that the introduced Mg2+ and K+ are immovable in the PB lattices and can form stronger K‒N and Mg‒N Coulombic attraction to relieve phase transition and element dissolution. Besides, the Mg2+/K+ co‐doping can reduce defect and H2O contents. As a result, the PB prepared in sea water exhibits an extremely long cycle life (80.1% retention after 2400 cycles) and superior rate capability (90.4% capacity retention at 20 C relative to that at 0.1 C). To address its practical applications, a sodium salts recycling strategy is proposed to greatly reduce the PB production cost. This work provides a self‐constructed Mg2+/K+ co‐doped high‐performance PB at a low preparation cost for sustainable, large‐scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3 has garnered attention as a promising cathode material, primarily due to its substantial theoretical capacity, high operating voltage, and high structural stability. Nonetheless, this material suffers from the low intrinsic electronic conductivity, resulting in a considerable impact on the material properties. To address this challenge, we employ a straightforward hydro-solvothermal reduction process to fabricate Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3/reduced graphene oxide composites featuring a three-dimensional conductive structure. Through an integrated approach involving material synthesis, structural characterization, and electrochemical analysis, we elucidate the synergistic effects between Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3 and reduced graphene oxide in facilitating sodium ion storage and transport. The Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3/reduced graphene oxide cathode in a Na ion cell exhibits reversible capacities of 127 mAh.g^−1 at 0.1C and 74 mAh.g^−1 at 10C with a 99% retention after 100 cycles at 25 °C. Excellent capacity, reversibility, structure stability, and improved ionic diffusivity make novel composite material an advanced cathode material for sodium-ion batteries, contributing to the development of cost-effective and high-performance energy storage solutions for a sustainable future.",

However, the kinetic behaviors corresponding to complex and prominent phase transitions are still perplexing. Here, we investigate the detailed electrochemical kinetic characteristics of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in three-electrode configurations assistance with the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) and trusted equivalent circuit models numerical analysis. The complex and prominent phase transformations evolution of O3-P3-O3' in the charge process and O3'-P3'-O3 during the discharge process are reflected at different degrees of frequencies and potentials, and significant contributions for the charge transfer step are established on this basis. As the charge and discharge proceed, the influence on charge transfer process by phase transform will be weak, however, which still has some expression and can be caught by EIS assistance with DRT. Additionally, a diagrammatic model for Na+ extraction/insertion is established to illustrate the physicochemical reaction mechanism in the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode. The results definitely provide certain scientific thoughts and guiding principles for the commercialization of NaxTMO2 in SIBs.",

In general, hybridization with carbon materials is an effective strategy to improve the sodium storage performance of NFS. However, the role of carbon materials in the electrochemical performance of NFS cathode materials has not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, the effect of carbon materials was revealed by employing various conductive carbon materials as carbon sources. Among these, the NFS coated with Ketjen Black (NFS@KB) shows the largest specific surface area, which is beneficial for electrolyte penetration and rapid ionic/electronic migration, leading to improved electrochemical performance. Therefore, NFS@KB shows a long cycle life (74.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles), superior rate performance (61.5 mA h g−1 at a 5.0 A g−1), and good temperature tolerance (−10 °C to 60 °C). Besides, the practicality of the NFS@KB cathode was further demonstrated by assembling a NFS@KB//hard carbon full cell. Therefore, this research indicates that a suitable carbon material for the NFS cathode can greatly activate the sodium storage performance.",

Surface engineering is a popular strategy to modify the high-voltage stability of cathode materials, yet its efficacy for sodium layered TMOs remains elusive, especially given the deleterious layer-gliding phase transition during high-voltage operation. Here, we examined the effect of surface coatings on the high-voltage cycling stability of Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, finding that they suppress high-voltage polarization but do not significantly affect capacity retention, which is mainly impacted by bulk structure degradation. Hence, surface engineering must be complemented with bulk structure modification to stabilize high-voltage cycling.",

The deformation of local structure caused by rare‐earth ions and intrinsic defect properties in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as a positive electrode for SIB have been investigated with atomistic simulation based on the lattice energy minimization. A good reproduction of the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 structure is obtained. It is revealed that Na Frenkel defect, which is formed by sodium interstitial and vacancy pair, is the most favorable type of intrinsic defect. This leads to the formation of stable sodium vacancy required for the Na‐ion diffusion. The results indicate that trivalent rare‐earth dopants at the V3+ site are the most energetically favorable dopants for Na3V2(PO4)2F3, and that the incorporation at the Na and P site could be used as a strategy to increase the sodium vacancy and interstitial, respectively. The deformation in the local structure by the rare‐earth ions doping at the V site is also investigated as helpful in improving the rate performance of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The iron-based hybrid polyanionic compound Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is perceived as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) on account of its high theoretical capacity, resource abundance, nontoxicity and stable framework structure, however, its sodium storage capabilities are hindered by sluggish ionic mobility kinetics. This paper reports the successful synthesis of porous carbon-modified La-doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) materials using sol-gel and freeze-drying techniques. Na4Fe2.94La0.04(PO4)2(P2O7)/C (NFPP-0.04) showcases remarkable sodium ion mobility, outstanding cycling stability, and exceptionally high discharge specific capacity. These attributes are attributed to the enhancement of embedded pseudocapacitance and electrochemical kinetics through the synergistic effect of lanthanum doping and freeze-drying technology. The NFPP-0.04 achieves a high discharge capacity (128.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, 1 C = 129 mAh g−1) and eminent durability (capacity retention of 97.2 % after 100 cycles at 0.2 C). Furthermore, in situ XRD analysis revealed the exceptional structural stability of NFPP-0.04. Additionally, the correlation of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at various scan rates confirms that the charge/discharge mechanism of NFPP-0.04 predominantly relies on embedded pseudocapacitance. This study highlights the feasibility of enhancing the sodium storage kinetics of materials through precise ion doping. Consequently, NFPP-0.04 emerges as a promising candidate for cathodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).",

        "abstract": "Recently, sodium-ion batteries have shown great potential for energy storage owing to their favorable electrochemical properties and intrinsic cost performance, which fuels the research and development of Mn-based layered oxides as promising sodium-ion cathodes. However, the undesirable structural evolution and oxygen redox impose great challenge on the cycling stability and rate capability of such cathodes. In this work, it is reported that Fe and Al can effectively tailor the Na2/3 Mn2/3 Fe1/6 Al1/6 O2 to trigger a stable cationic and anionic redox behavior. In situ X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the retention of a stable P2 phase upon cycling, and density functional theory results demonstrate that Al3+ doping can strengthen the covalency of MnO bond. The Na2/3 Mn2/3 Fe1/6 Al1/6 O2 cathode can retain 90% of its initial capacity within the voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V versus Na+ /Na at 200 mA g-1 after 100 cycles. Moreover, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the specific capacity can be replenished by the synergistic reactions between Fe3+ /Fe4+ /Fe3+ and O2- /(O2 )n - pairs within the voltage range of 4.0-4.4 V versus Na+ /Na, which is also elucidated by theoretical calculation.",

Further, the HMHE-HCF//hard carbon full-cell delivers capacities of 99.0 and 82.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 10 C, respectively, and retains 98.1% of the initial capacity after 1,600 cycles at 5C, demonstrating its potential application for sodium-ion storage.",

The poor Na+ diffusion kinetics is, however, one of the major obstacles to advancing large-scale practical application. Herein, we report bismuth-doped O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (NMB) microspheres consisting of unique primary nanoplatelets with the radially oriented {010} active lattice facets. The NMB combines the advantages of the oriented and exposed electrochemical active planes for direct paths of Na+ diffusion, and the thick primary nanoplatelets for less surface parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. Consequently, the NMB cathode exhibits a long-term stability with an excellent capacity retention of 72.5% at 1C after 300 cycles and an enhanced rate capability at a 0.1C to 10C rate (1C = 240 mA g-1). Furthermore, the enhancement is elucidated by the small volume change, thin cathode-electrolyte-interphase (CEI) layer, and rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics. In particular, the radial orientation-based Bi-doping strategy is demonstrated to be effective at boosting electrochemical performance in other layered oxides (such as Bi-doped NaNi0.45Mn0.45Ti0.1O2 and NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2).

Herein, highly crystalline P3-type Na0.67[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2 heated at 900 °C is introduced to improve the electrochemical performance of Fe-based layered oxides. The structures, reaction mechanisms, and electrochemical performances of P3 Na0.67[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2, P2 Na0.57[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2, and P2 Na0.67[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 are compared to demonstrate the roles of Li+ doping in the improved electrochemical performance of P3 Na0.67[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2, such as stable capacity retention over 100 cycles. P3 Na0.67[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2 significantly suppresses the migration of Fe3+ ions to tetrahedral sites in the Na layer during cycling because the cation disorder of Li+ is more favorable than that of Fe3+. As a result, P3 Na0.67[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2 shows better cycle performance than P2 Na0.67[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2. P3 Na0.67[Li0.1(Fe0.5Mn0.5)0.9]O2 also exhibits an improved rate performance compared to P2 Na0.67[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2. This finding provides fundamental insights to improve the electrochemical performance of layered oxide cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "In an effort to develop high‐energy‐density cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), low‐cost, high capacity Na(Li1/3Mn2/3)O2 is discovered, which utilizes the labile O 2p‐electron for charge compensation during the intercalation process, inspired by Li2MnO3 redox reactions. Na(Li1/3Mn2/3)O2 is systematically designed by first‐principles calculations considering the Li/Na mixing enthalpy based on the site preference of Na in the Li sites of Li2MnO3. Using the anionic redox reaction (O2−/O−), this Mn‐oxide is predicted to show high redox potentials (≈4.2 V vs Na/Na+) with high charge capacity (190 mAh g−1). Predicted cathode performance is validated by experimental synthesis, characterization, and cyclic performance studies. Through a fundamental understanding of the redox reaction mechanism in Li2MnO3, Na(Li1/3Mn2/3)O2 is designed as an example of a new class of promising cathode materials, Na(Li1/3M2/3)O2 (M: transition metals featuring stabilized M4+), for further advances in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Using the density functional method, we investigated the crystal and electronic structures and the electrochemical properties of NaxVOPO4 (x = 0, 1) and explored the diffusion mechanism of Na ions in these materials. The van der Waals interaction was also taken into account to include the non-local electron correlation in the calculation of structural parameters and voltage. The diffusion of Na ions is treated as a process of the Na vacancy-positive small polaron complex in NaVOPO4 and the Na ion-negative small polaron complex in VOPO4, respectively. During the charging (discharging) process, the removal (insertion) of a Na ion would result in the formation of a positive (negative) small polaron at one of the two first nearest vanadium sites to the Na vacancy. Three elementary diffusion processes, including the single, crossing and parallel diffusion processes, are explored. It is found that the [010] direction is preferable for Na ion diffusion in both the charging and discharging processes. The influence of small polaron migration on Na ion diffusion in the charging state is negligible, whereas such effect is considerably strong in the discharging process. Moreover, while three elementary diffusion processes in NaVOPO4 require the same energy, the parallel diffusion process in VOPO4 is not preferred. The diffusion of Na vacancy accompanied by a positive polaron in the full charging process requires an activation energy of 395 meV, while the diffusion of Na ion accompanied by a negative polaron in the discharging state, VOPO4, has a higher activation energy of 627 meV. With a voltage and activation barrier similar to that of the olivine phosphate LiFePO4, these sodium-based materials are expected to be promising cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) is an attractive candidate as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high energy density. However, its practical application is hindered by poor electrochemical stability caused by the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn and the unstable structure of NaMnHCF. Here, this paper aims to address this issue by introducing highly stable AMnHCF (where A = K, Rb, or Cs) through a facile method to composite with NaMnHCF. The findings reveal that all AMnHCFs have a \"pillar effect\" on the crystal structure of NaMnHCF. It is observed that the degree of pillar effect varies depending on the specific AMnHCF used. The less electrochemically inactive the alkaline ion is and the greater the degree of compositing with NaMnHCF, the more dramatic the pillar effect. KMnHCF shows limited pillar effect due to its rough composition with NaMnHCF and the loss of K+ upon (de)intercalation. RbMnHCF has lower electrochemical activity and can be better composited with NaMnHCF. On the other hand, CsMnHCF exhibits the strongest pillar effect due to the inactivation of Cs+ and the excellent coherent structure formed by CsMnHCF and NaMnHCF. This research provides a new perspective on stabilizing NaMnHCF with other alkaline elements.",

        "abstract": "Na4Mn1.5Fe1.5(PO4)2P2O7 (NMFPP), with its low cost and high energy density, is essential for accelerating the commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries. However, its practical application is limited by serious voltage hysteresis and detrimental Jahn‐Teller distortions. Herein, a high operating voltage and superior stable Nb‐doped NMFPP with fewer intrinsic anti‐site defects are elaborately designed by the reconstruction of the crystal lattice and electronic distribution. By introducing higher charge density Nb─O bonds, the lengths of Mn‐O bonds are shortened, enhancing lattice stability. As a result, the lattice volume contracted during Na+ extraction/insertion is decreased with niobium‐modified Na4(Mn0.5Fe0.5)2.94Nb0.06(PO4)2P2O7, mitigating lattice distortion from the Jahn‐Teller effect and increasing the capacity retention after 1000 cycles from 57.5% to 82.3%. More importantly, the delayed effect of Mn2+ involvement in redox reactions is significantly reduced, raising the average operating voltage from 3.32 to 3.64 V and increasing the overall energy density by 13%. This study opens new avenues to develop advanced sodium‐ion battery cathode materials with high energy density and long calendar life for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Fe-based polyanionic materials are potential cathode candidates for sodium-ion batteries, however, voltage decay and cycling stability become main challenges for practical applications. Besides, the mechanism of phase transition during charge/discharge processes is still unclear. Herein, the Fe-rich phase Na1.4Fe1.3P2O7 with Na/Fe atom vacancies is constructed, showing robust voltage decay suppression and a larger ratio of the plateau length (6:1) at 3.0 and 2.5 V than that of the conventional Na-rich phase Na2FeP2O7 (2.5:1). After 650 cycles at 1 C, the capacity and average voltage retentions of Fe-rich phase are 84 % and 95 %, respectively, much higher than that of Na-rich phase (12 % and 61 %). Furthermore, Mössbauer spectra unveil that, during discharge processes at high voltages, more Fe3+reduction in Fe-rich phase is the intrinsic reason for larger plateau length and lower voltage decay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that the higher reduction ability of Fe3+ in Fe-rich phase at high voltages is due to the better reversibility of the two-phase transition between β-NaFeP2O7 and Fe-rich phase than that between β-NaFeP2O7 and Na-rich phase. These allow Fe-rich phase with higher energy densities, lower voltage decay and better cycling stability at high voltage plateaus. Our work provides a new idea for safe design, low-cost and long cycle life sodium ion cathode battery materials.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3, based on multi-electron reactions between V3+/V4+/V5+, is a promising cathode material for SIBs. However, its practical application is hampered by the inferior conductivity, large barrier of V4+/V5+, and stepwise phase transition. Herein, these issues are addressed by constructing a medium-entropy material (Na3.2V1.1Ti0.2Al0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Ni0.1(PO4)3, ME-NVP) with strong ME─O bond and highly occupied Na2 sites. Benefiting from the medium-entropy effect, ME-NVP manifests a phase-transition-free reaction mechanism, two reversible plateaus at 3.4 (V3+/V4+) and 4.0 V (V4+/V5+), and small volume change (2%) during Na+ insertion/extraction processes, as confirmed by comprehensive in/ex situ characterizations. Moreover, kinetics analysis illuminates the superior Na+ diffusion ability of ME-NVP. Thus, the ME-NVP cathode realizes remarkable rate capability of 67 mA h g-1 at 50C and a long-term lifespan over 10 000 cycles (capacity retention of 81.3%). Theoretical calculations further illustrate that the weak binding of Na+ ion in the channel is responsible for the rapid Na+ diffusion, accounting for the superior reaction kinetics. Moreover, rigid MEO6 octahedral and feasible rearrangement of Na+ ions can suppress the phase transition, thus endowing an ultrastable ME-NVP cathode. This work highlights the significant role of medium-entropy engineering in advancing the output voltage, cycling stability, and rate capability of polyanionic cathodes.",

The results obtained show that materials doped with titanium have higher structural stability than undoped material. Also after doping, the conductivity of the materials increases greatly but Na(Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.5)0.98Ti0.02O2 is slightly more conductive (ΔEg = 0.017 eV). Na(Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.5)1-xTixO2 (NNFM-Tix) (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1) indicates a larger sodium layer, which allows easy migration of sodium ions during charge/discharge processes than NNFM. Sodium ions diffuse faster in NNFM-Ti0.06 and NNFM-Ti0.08 compared to other doped-NNFMs. In addition, the Pugh index value of NNFM (1.8222) is lower than that of NNFM-Ti0.02, NNFM-Ti0.04, NNFM-Ti0.06, NNFM-Ti0.08, and NNFM-Ti0.1 (2.1376), demonstrating enhancement of elastic ductility after doping. Titanium-doped materials exhibited improved stability under temperature effects between −20 and 60 °C, which represent the operating temperature range of sodium-ion batteries, although this effect did not vary much with the doping rate. The improved thermodynamic stability indicates that the doped materials can better resist degradation, have high efficiency, and a long cycle life. These Na(Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.5)1-xTixO2 materials, particularly those with the titanium rate at 0.06 and 0.08 are therefore powerful materials for the accomplishment of efficient sodium-ion batteries cathodes.",

P2-type manganese-based layered oxides have received special attention by virtue of their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environment friendliness. However, the water sensitivity and limited cycling stability hinder their application, especially the underlying mechanisms for the above two issues are still unclear. In this work, copper substitution is used to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and affect the corresponding lattice structure. The water sensitivity and charge compensation mechanism were carefully investigated. Results demonstrate that water sensitivity of the electrode is related to the order of Na+/vacancy in the Na interlayers since water molecules are more easily inserted into the charged state electrodes, but the tendency for the uptake water does not increase with Na+ extraction. Furthermore, Mn2+ forms on the surface of electrodes in the initial discharge process, and the redox reaction in the bulk are predominantly between Mn3+ and Mn4+. Cu-substituted in TM layer affects the arrangement of Na+/vacancy and suppresses the Mn2+ formation on the Na0.7Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 electrode that results in superior air stability and better storage properties.",

        "abstract": "The rapid capacity loss suffered by P2-type Ni/Fe/Mn-based layered cathode materials, which is caused by deleterious high-voltage phase transformations and the dissolution of active materials, greatly limits their application in large-scale sodium-ion battery installations. In this study, a novel P2/O3 biphasic Na_0.62Mg_0.05Ni_0.15Fe_0.2Li_0.05Mn_0.6O_2 (NM-NFLM) layered cathode is developed using a multi-element (Mg and Li) co-substitution strategy. The absence of significant voltage plateaus in the charge/discharge profiles of cells featuring the proposed cathode indicates that deleterious phase transformations and concomitant lattice mismatch in the high-voltage region are effectively suppressed because of the intergrown structure of the resulting cathode, which has also been demonstrated by ex-situ X-ray diffraction analyses. The optimized cathode also displays improved structural stability and enhanced Na^+ diffusion kinetics owing to the incorporation of stabilizing dopant pillars. Hence, the assembled Na half-cell delivers a high initial capacity of 205.6 mAh g^−1 at 0.1 C and excellent rate capability (98.6 mAh g^−1 at 10 C). Moreover, the P2 phase of NM-NFLM is maintained throughout the charging and discharging processes, with only a small amount of the O3 phase undergoing reversible phase transitions of O3-P3-O3, which improves its structure stability significantly.

The presence of the metal oxides properly coating the surface of the active material is evidenced by XPS and electron microscopy. Galvanostatic cycling of sodium half-cells reveals a significant capacity enhancement for samples coated with 1.5% of metal oxides and an exceptional cycling stability as evidenced by Coulombic efficiencies as high as 95.9% for ZnO@ Na3V2(PO4)3. It is correlated to their low surface layer and charge transfer resistance values. The formation of metal fluorides that remove traces of corrosive HF from the electrolyte is checked by XPS spectroscopy. The feasibility of sodium-ion batteries assembled with C+MxOy@Na3V2(PO4)3 is further verified by evaluating the electrochemical performance of full cells. Particularly, a Graphite//Al2O3@ Na3V2(PO4)3 battery delivers an energy density as high as 260 W h kg-1 and exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 89.3% after 115 cycles.",

The reversible access of the Mn2+/Mn3+ (3.75/3.4 V), Mn3+/Mn4+ (4.25/4.1 V), and Cr3+/Cr4+ (4.4/4.3 V vs Na/Na+) redox couples in a Na4MnCr(PO4)3 cathode endows a distinct three-electron redox reaction during the insertion/extraction process.

However, these layered oxides suffer from poor cyclability and low rate performance because of structural instability and sluggish electrode kinetics. In the present work, we show the sodiation reaction of Mn_3O_4 to yield crystal water free NaMnO_2−y−δ(OH)_2y, a monoclinic polymorph of sodium birnessite bearing Na/Mn(OH)_8 hexahedra and Na/MnO_6 octahedra. With the new polymorph, NaMnO_2−y−δ(OH)_2y exhibits an enlarged interlayer distance of about 7 Å, which is in favor of fast sodium ion migration and good structural stability. In combination of the favorable nanosheet morphology, NaMn_2−y−δ(OH)_2y cathode delivers large specific capacity up to 211.9 mAh g^–1, excellent cycle performance (94.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles), and outstanding rate capability (156.0 mAh g^–1 at 50 C).

        "abstract": "Polyanionic cathode materials that have high energy density and good temperature adaptability are in high demand for practical applications in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this study, a scalable spray-drying strategy has been proposed to construct interconnected conductive networks composed of amorphous carbon and reduced graphene oxide in Na3MnZr(PO4)3 microspheres (NMZP@C-rGO). The dual-carbon conductive networks provide fast electron migration pathways in the microspheres. Moreover, they significantly increase the porosity and specific surface area of the microspheres, which are conducive to accommodating the volume change and improving the electrode/electrolyte contact interface and the contribution of the pseudocapacitance effect to achieve fast sodium storage. As a result, NMZP@C-rGO exhibits excellent rate performance (50.9 mAh g-1 at 50C and 30 °C, 35.4 mAh g-1 at 50C and -15 °C) and long-term cycling stability (capacity retentions of 97.4 and 79.6% after 1500 cycles at 30 and -15 °C, respectively) in a wide temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Although Prussian blue analogues are the promising candidate cathode materials for the Na‐ion batteries for the grid storage due to 3D open‐framework structure and large interstitial “A” sites, high content of defects in the crystals obtained in the conventional strategy severely impede Na+ migration, leading to an unsatisfactory power density. Here a novel epitaxial nucleation‐assisted controlled crystallization approach to eliminate the structural defects of NaFeHCF crystals is reported. Due to their limited lattice misfit of only 4.87% (< 5%) between the graphene and NaFeHCF as well as the electronegativity of the functional groups (─COOH, ─OH, ─CH(O)CH─), GO can act as the nucleation and subsequent epitaxial growth platform of NaFeHCF, which results in a unique one‐corner‐cut cubic nano‐crystals morphologies with much decreased contents of defects (0.08 per formula unit). This enhanced lattice regularity significantly enhanced the speedy diffusion of Na cations (by 5 times) in the nanocrystals, resulting in the unprecedented rate capability of 96.8 mAh g−1 at an ultra‐high rate of 9 A g−1 (39 s, 23228 W kg−1), which is far exceeding that of any previously reported PBA‐based cathodes to the knowledge, authenticating its superiority as a candidate for high‐power sodium‐ion batteries for the reliable grid energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium layered transition metal oxides have attracted great attention for advanced Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because of their rich structural diversity and superior specific capacity provided by not only cation redox reactions but also possible oxygen-related anionic redox reactions. However, they usually undergo severe electrochemical performance fading, especially the voltage retention during the cationic and anionic redox processes. Herein, we design and synthesize a couple of novel sodium lithium magnesium aluminum manganese oxides (Na0.75Li0.2Mg0.05Al0.05Mn0.7O2) with the same Na+ coordination environment but different oxide layer stacking sequences, namely, P2-NLMAMO and P3-NLMAMO. We systematically investigate and compare the voltage decay phenomenon and the cationic/anionic redox processes under different electrochemical cycling windows combined with ex-situ hard- and soft-XAS techniques. The results clearly indicate that the P2-NLMAMO electrode with a lower extent of Mn redox is prone to deliver a superior capacity retention and rate performance, more importantly, a higher average voltage in contrast to the P3-type counterpart. In addition, negligible change is detected for the average discharge voltage upon extended cycling when increasing the discharge cut-off voltage to 2.5 V for both P2-NLMAMO and P3-NLMAMO. This unique feature work provides an effective strategy for developing high-capacity P-type layered cathodes based on both cationic and anionic redox chemistry under controlled crystal structure arrangement, which could lead to a more deeply understanding of the correlation between crystal structure and electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries.",

The results indicate that a small amount of Mg substitution has strong effects on the cycling performance and the Na+ mobility. Amongst the tested cathode systems, it was found that the composition with a Mg content of x = 0.02 resulted in the best cycling stability and highest Na+ mobility based on electrochemical and μ+SR results.

In this study, we introduce novel chemical synthesis method that diverges from traditional methodologies reported till date. Rather than relying on sulfur, nitrate, or acetate metal precursor salts, we employ metal carbonate salt coupled with oxalic acid as a chelating agent, and sodium carbonate as a precipitating agent. This novel chemistry enhances the microstructure of the cathode material inherited from its precursor exhibiting spherical morphology, influence on the electrochemical properties, bestowing the material with high specific capacity, extended cycle life, and an elevated charge–discharge rate. The primary focus of this work centers on a comprehensive investigation of the hydrodynamic and kinetics aspects of the co-precipitation reaction, guided by the principles of chemical engineering. The effects of key parameters such as impeller speed, impeller type, and scale-up effects on the co-precipitation process have been systematically explored. This research introduces insights into optimizing reaction conditions such as pH, reaction temperature, metal precursor salt ratio, precipitating agent, through rigorous experimentation and characterization reports. The notable effect of precipitating agent on morphology has been demonstrated by electron microscopy images. The kinetics study shows the activation energy of 8.9 kJ mol−1 depicts the reaction is controlled by mass transfer resistance and to overcome this effect, impeller type and speed plays significant role and experimentation results shows the axial mixing pattern created by pitched blade impeller is effective to improvise electrochemical properties. The synthesized cathode material exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties, including tap density of approximately 1.3 g cc−1 with reversible capacity of 215 mAh g−1, along with excellent cyclic stability (90 %) over 60 cycles. Furthermore, it shows the high energy density up to 1300 Wh/L and a rapid charge–discharge rate. These findings contribute to the advancement of SIBs technology and offer promising prospects for future researchers to efficient development of high-performance energy storage solutions.",

To enlarge the alkali-layer distance inside the layer structure of NaNFM may benefit Na+ diffusion. Herein, the effect of Ca-substitution is reported in Na sites on the structural and electrochemical properties of Na1-x Cax/2 NFM (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Na1-x Cax/2 NFM samples show single α-NaFeO2 type phase with slightly increased alkali-layer distance as Ca content increases.

        "abstract": "The multiple issues of unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases, sluggish reaction kinetics, and transition‐metal (TM) dissolution have long greatly affected the rate and cycling performance of cathode materials for Na‐ion batteries. Herein, a multifunctional protein‐based binder, sericin protein/poly(acrylic acid) (SP/PAA), is developed, which shows intriguing physiochemical properties to address these issues. The highly hydrophilic nature and strong H‐bond interaction between crosslinking SP and PAA leads to a uniform coating of the binder layer, which serves as an artificial interphase on the high‐voltage Na4Mn2Fe(PO4)2P2O7 cathode material (NMFPP). Through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, it is shown that the SP/PAA binder is electrochemically stable at high voltages and possesses increased ionic conductivity due to the interaction between sericin and electrolyte anion ClO4−, which can provide additional sodium‐migration paths with greatly reduced energy barriers. Besides, the strong interaction force between the binder and the NMFPP can effectively protect the cathode from electrolyte corrosion, suppress Mn‐dissolution, stabilize crystal structure, and ensure electrode integrity during cycling. Benefiting from these merits, the SP/PAA‐based NMFPP electrode displays enhanced rate and cycling performance. Of note, the universality of the SP/PAA binder is further confirmed on Na3V2(PO4)2F3. It is believed that the versatile protein‐based binder is enlightening for the development of high‐performance batteries.",

        "title": "Manganese Local Environment Modulation via SiO4 Substitution to Boost Sodium Storage Performance of Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3.",
        "abstract": "Manganese-based Na superionic conductors (NASICONs) Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 with three-electron reaction are attractive cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, the irreversible distortion of Mn local structure leads to sluggish electrode kinetics, voltage hysteresis, and poor cycling stability. Here, SiO4 is introduced to substitute PO4 to modulate the local environment of Mn to activate the redox activity and stabilize the reversibility of Na4 MnCr(PO4 )2.9 (SiO4 )0.1 (NMCP-Si). A combined experimental and theoretical investigation have been undertaken to reveal the evolution of electronic structures and Na storage properties associated with SiO4 substitution. The NMCP-Si exhibits much-enhanced rate capability and cycling stability, being attributed to the unique Jahn-Teller distortion (Mn3+ ) that facilitates sodium de/insertion kinetics by optimizing the Na ion diffusion channels. This work addresses the challenge of stabilizing the structure of Mn-based NASICONs and represents a breakthrough in understanding how to improve the Na+ conductivity by regulating local structure.",

        "title": "A Quinone-Based Cathode Material for High-Performance Organic Lithium and Sodium Batteries",
        "abstract": "With the increased application of batteries in powering electric vehicles as well as potential contributions to utility-scale storage, there remains a need to identify and develop efficient and sustainable active materials for use in lithium (Li)- and sodium (Na)-ion batteries. Organic cathode materials provide a desirable alternative to inorganic counterparts, which often come with harmful environmental impact and supply chain uncertainties. Organic materials afford a sustainable route to active electrodes that also enable fine-tuning of electrochemical potentials through structural design. Here, we report a bis-anthraquinone-functionalized s-indacene-1,3,5,7(2H,6H)-tetraone (BAQIT) synthesized using a facile and inexpensive route as a high-capacity cathode material for use in Li- and Na-ion batteries. BAQIT provides multiple binding sites for Li- and Na-ions, while maintaining low solubility in commercial organic electrolytes. Electrochemical Li-ion cells demonstrate excellent stability with discharge capacities above 190 mAh g–1 after 300 cycles at a 0.1C rate. The material also displayed excellent high-rate performance with a reversible capacity of 142 mAh g–1 achieved at a 10C rate. This material affords high power capabilities superior to current state-of-the-art organic cathode materials, with values reaching 5.09 kW kg–1. The Na-ion performance was also evaluated, exhibiting reversible capacities of 130 mAh g–1 after 90 cycles at a 0.1C rate. This work offers a structural design to encourage versatile, high-power, and long cycle-life electrochemical energy-storage materials.",

        "abstract": "The rising demand for energy storage calls for technological advancements to address the growing needs. In this context, sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries have emerged as a potential complementary technology to lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion). Among other materials, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is a promising cathode for Na-ion batteries due to its high operating voltage and good energy density. In order to further characterize the (dis)charge behavior of NVPF, the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D) was employed to track both the frequency and dissipation loss changes at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The electrode composite preparation proved to be crucial for extending the potential window to both Na3V2(PO4)2F3/Na2V2(PO4)2F3 and Na2V2(PO4)2F3/Na1V2(PO4)2F3 domains. Composites prepared with rawNVPF powder (1-20 μm particles) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder (raw-NVPF:PVDF) exhibited large dissipation changes during (dis)charging, attributed to the soft viscoelastic nature of the binder and substantial hydrodynamic interaction caused by the large particles. On the other hand, composites prepared by sieved NVPF particles (<1 μm particles) with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) binder (sieved-NVPF:NaCMC) showed rigid properties, enabling an extended and more accurate gravimetric analysis. This allowed for the determination of a linear charge-to-mass relationship for the full potential window of NVPF, reflecting the potential independent insertion/deinsertion of bare Na ions (23 g·mol-1). Additionally, reversible dissipative changes were observed for the Na3V2(PO4)2F3/Na2V2(PO4)2F3 transition, with no further dissipative changes observed during the Na2V2(PO4)2F3/Na1V2(PO4)2F3 process.",

        "abstract": "Development of highly stabilized and reversible cathode materials has become a great challenge for sodium-ion batteries. O'3-type layered Mn-based oxides have deserved much attention as one of largely reversible-capacity cathodes featured by the resource-rich and low-toxic elements. However, the fragile slabs structure of typical layered oxides, low Mn-ion migration barriers, and Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ have easily resulted in the severe degradation of cyclability and rate performances. Herein, a new queue-ordered superstructure is built up in the O'3-NaMn0.6 Al0.4 O2 cathode material. Through the light-metal Al substitution in O'3-NaMnO2 , the MnO6 and AlO6 octahedrons display the queue-ordered arrangements in the transition metal (TM) slabs. Interestingly, the presence of this superstructure can strengthen the layered structure, reduce the influence from Jahn-Teller effect, and suppress the TM-ions migrations during long-terms cycles. These characteristics results in O'3-NaMn0.6 Al0.4 O2 cathode deliver a high capacity of 160 mAh g-1 , an enhanced rate capability and the excellent cycling performance. This research strategy can provide the broaden insight for future electrode materials with high-performance sodium-ions storage.",

        "abstract": "The flexible free‐standing cathodes with high energy density have been challenging toward wearable sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, Na5V12O32 nanobelts (NVO‐NBs)‐based heterostructure is fabricated with boosting the sodium‐ion kinetic characteristics to address the challenges. In the heterostructure, the controllable VOC bonds are generated at the interface originating from the chemical conversion of functional groups of the reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) with VO bonding of NVO through interfacial electronic interactions. The interfacial synergistic between the brilliant bonding properties and the inherent formation of a stress field at the heterointerface motivated by work function difference can reduce the Na+ diffusion barrier, facilitate charge transfer, hence accelerates reaction kinetics and electron/ion transport, as well as modifying the electronic structure to realize a cherished adsorption energy of Na+. Therefore, the optimized NVO‐NBs‐based heterostructure exhibits exceptional rate capability (213 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C with 100 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and ultralong cycling stability (95.4%, 3000 cycles at 5 C).

        "abstract": "Room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) using a manganese-based layered cathode have been considered promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage applications. However, manganese-based materials suffer from serious Jahn-Teller distortion, phase transition, and unstable interface, resulting in severe structure degradation, sluggish sodium diffusion kinetics, and poor cycle, respectively. Herein, we demonstrate a Zr-doped Na0.70Mn0.80Co0.15Zr0.05O2 material with much improved specific capacity and rate capability compared with Zr-free Na0.70Mn0.85Co0.15O2 when used as cathode materials for NIBs. The material delivers a reversible capacity of 173 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C rate, corresponding to approximately 72% of the theoretical capacity (239 mA h g-1) based on a single-electron redox process, and a capacity retention of 88% after 50 cycles was obtained. Additionally, a homogenous solid-state interphase (SEI) film was revealed directly by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy in Zr-doped material after battery cycling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy proves that the formation of SEI films provides the Zr-doped material with special chemical/electrochemical stability. These results here give clear evidence of the utility of Zr-doping to improve the surface and environmental stability, sodium diffusion kinetics, and electrochemical performance of P2-type layered structure, promising advanced sodium-ion batteries with higher energy density, higher surface stability, and longer cycle life compared with the commonly used magnesiumdoping method in electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Na superionic conductor of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 only containing high earth‐abundance elements is regarded as one of the most promising cathodes for the applicable Na‐ion batteries due to its desirable cycling stability and high safety. However, the voltage hysteresis caused by Mn2+ ions resided in Na+ vacancies has led to significant capacity loss associated with Mn reaction centers between 2.5–4.2 V. Herein, the sodium excess strategy based on charge compensation is applied to suppress the undesirable voltage hysteresis, thereby achieving sufficient utilization of the Mn2+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couples. These findings indicate that the sodium excess Na3.5MnTi0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 cathode with Ti4+ reduction has a lowest Mn2+ occupation on the Na+ vacancies in its initial composition, which can improve the kinetics properties, finally contributing to a suppressed voltage hysteresis. Based on these findings, it is further applied the sodium excess route on a Mn‐richer phosphate cathode, which enables the suppressed voltage hysteresis and more reversible capacity. Consequently, this developed Na3.6Mn1.15Ti0.85(PO4)3 cathode achieved a high energy density over 380 Wh kg−1 (based on active substance mass of cathode) in full‐cell configurations, which is not only superior to most of the phosphate cathodes, but also delivers more application potential than the typical oxides cathodes for Na‐ion batteries.",

Here we report the Na0.7MnO2 solid state synthesized at 1000 °C that shows two distinct phases; one adopts hexagonal P2-type P63/mmc space group symmetry, and the other adopts orthorhombic Pbma space group symmetry. The phase ratio of P2 to the orthorhombic phase is 55.0(5):45.0(4). A single-phase P2 structure is found to form at 1000 °C after modification with alkali metals Rb and Cs, while the K-modified form produces an additional minor impurity. The modification is the addition of the alkali elements during synthesis that do not appear to be doped into the crystal structure. As a cathode for NIBs, parent Na0.7MnO2 shows a second charge/discharge capacity of 143/134 mAh g-1, K-modified Na0.7MnO2 a capacity of 184/178 mAh g-1, Rb-modified Na0.9MnO2 a capacity of 159/150 mAh g-1, and Cs-modified Na0.7MnO2 a capacity of 171/163 mAh g-1 between 1.5 and 4.2 V at a current density of 15 mA g-1.

In this study, a new open-system synthesis approach is proposed to achieve carbon-encapsulated Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F microcubes (demoted as NVPF/C) with enhanced reaction kinetics and electrochemical reversibility, which involves in-situ growth of NVPF crystals on graphene oxides (NVPF/GO) in aqueous reaction systems and subsequent conversion of NVPF/GO into conductive NVPF/C.

Experimental results suggest that the material is composed of carbon-coated NVPF crystals with an average particle size of ∼ 2 μm and a carbon-layer thickness of ∼ 5 nm.

Layered iron/manganese oxide cathodes receive extensive attentions due to the element abundance and large theoretical capacity. However, these materials usually undergo obvious degradation of electrochemical performance due to the tendency of Mn dissolution and Fe migration during continuous sodium release and uptake. Herein, a strategy of anion–cation synergetic redox is proposed to suppress the structural deterioration originated from overusing the electrochemical activity of transition‐metal ions, and decreased lattice strain as well as superior electrochemical performance are realized simultaneously. Results show that the Na0.8Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2 (NLFM) electrode is highly resistant to the erosion of moisture that is distinct from the traditional Mn/Fe‐based electrodes. Moreover, the NLFM electrode demonstrates solid solution behavior without phase transition during cycles. The ultra‐small volume change of 0.85% is ascribed to the negligible manganese dissolution and invisible transition‐metal migration. The high‐stable layered structure assures superior reversible capacity of ≈165 mA h g–1, excellent rate capability, and splendid capacity retention of over 98.3% with 100 cycles. The findings deepen the understanding of the synergy between anion and cation redox and provide new insights to design the high‐stable layered cathode for sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have gained tremendous attention; however, the large‐sized Na+ poses serious challenges on the development of inorganic‐based cathodes. To overcome the issues, metal–organic electrode materials are appealing because they combine attractive characteristics of organic redox centers (e.g., flexibility, highly reversible redox properties, fast kinetics (regardless of size and charge of guest ions), structural/redox tunability, and resource abundance) with structural stability arising from metal‐ligand coordination. Herein, a one‐dimensional copper‒benzoquinoid coordination polymer (CP), [CuL(Py)2]n, (LH4 = 1,4‐dicyano‐2,3,5,6‐tetrahydroxybenzene, Py = pyridine) is investigated as cathode for SIBs. As opposed to most CPs reported for SIBs which possess high porosity and surface area, this close‐packed CP can deliver discharge capacity as high as 277 mAh g‒1 at 2C (~523 mA g‒1), and at extremely high rates of 50C and 300C (~13 and 78 A g‒1), reversible capacities of 131 and 74 mAh g‒1 still can be delivered, respectively. The transport kinetics of Na+ in [CuL(Py)2]n is found to be even faster than that of Li+ despite the close‐packed structure. The mechanistic and kinetic studies have been performed. The findings gained in this work undoubtedly unravel a potential design strategy for high‐performance metal–organic electrode materials for emerging post‐Li‐ion batteries.",

The highly reversible structural evolution during cycling between rhombohedral, cubic and tetragonal phases is the key to enable the good performance. Iron-based Prussian blue analogs are promising low-cost and easily prepared cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Their materials quality and electrochemical performance are heavily reliant on the precipitation process. Here we report a controllable precipitation method to synthesize high-performance Prussian blue for sodium-ion storage. Characterization of the nucleation and evolution processes of the highly crystalline Prussian blue microcubes reveals a rhombohedral structure that exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency, excellent rate performance, and cycling properties. The phase transitions in the as-obtained material are investigated by synchrotron in situ powder X-ray diffraction, which shows highly reversible structural transformations between rhombohedral, cubic, and tetragonal structures upon sodium-ion (de)intercalations. Moreover, the Prussian blue material from a large-scale synthesis process shows stable cycling performance in a pouch full cell over 1000 times. We believe that this work could pave the way for the real application of Prussian blue materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Irreversible phase transformation of layered structure into spinel structure is considered detrimental for most of the layered structure cathode materials. Here we report that this presumably irreversible phase transformation can be rendered to be reversible in sodium birnessite (Na_ x MnO_2· y H_2O) as a basic structural unit. This layered structure contains crystal water, which facilitates the formation of a metastable spinel-like phase and the unusual reversal back to layered structure. The mechanism of this phase reversibility was elucidated by combined soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy with X-ray diffraction, corroborated by first-principle calculations and kinetics investigation. These results show that the reversibility, modulated by the crystal water content between the layered and spinel-like phases during the electrochemical reaction, could activate new cation sites, enhance ion diffusion kinetics and improve its structural stability. This work thus provides in-depth insights into the intercalating materials capable of reversible framework changes, thereby setting the precedent for alternative approaches to the development of cathode materials for next-generation rechargeable batteries. The irreversible layered-to-spinel phase transformation is detrimental for many cathode materials. Here, the authors show that reversibility can be realized in crystal water containing sodium birnessite by controlled dehydration, leading to enhanced ion diffusion kinetics and improved structural stability.",

        "abstract": "Reducing size of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) into nanoscale is regarded as an effective way to improve its high-rate performance for sodium-ion storage. However, the current synthetic approaches for nanostructured NVP such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, and electrospinning still possess limitations in terms of long reaction time and complicated operation. Here, we combine high-boiling organic solvent-assisted colloidal synthesis (HOS-CS) and calcination to fabricate carbon-coated NVP nanoparticles (NPs) with the size of about 50 nm distributed in carbon nanotubes scaffolds as the cathode for SIBs. This HOS-CS strategy demonstrates unique merit of short synthetic period, solving the problem of previously-known approaches in the aspect of synthetic efficiency. Impressively, NVP@C@MWCNTs offers up to 108.6 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C, and also achieves 83.67 and 67.6 mAh g-1 of initial capacities nearly 80 % and 76.1 % of retention after 3000 cycles at ultrahigh rates of 30 C and 50 C, respectively. More surprisingly, the NVP@C@MWCNTs cathode is matched with the hard carbon (HC) anode to construct NVP@C@MWCNTs||HC full cell, delivering as high as 71 mAh g-1 of initial capacity with 72.8 % of retention after 500 cycles even at 10 C.

        "abstract": "P2-type manganese-rich layered oxide have attracted much attention as cathodes of sodium-ion batteries owing to the low cost, high capacity and fast sodium ion diffusion kinetics. However, the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+, P2-O2 phase transition and anionic redox on charging to the high-voltage, resulted in a severe capacity delay. Herein, an effective Li substitution strategy is proposed to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+, the harmful phase transition of P2-O2 and the anionic redox. As a result, the as-prepared sample Na0.67(Ni0.25Mn0.75)0.9Li0.1O2 (67L10) displays a discharge specific capacity of 168.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C, enhanced average working voltage, and improved cycling stability at 1 C after 200 cycles within 1.5–4.5 V voltage window (capacity retention of 83.3 %, specific capacity of 106.8 mA h g−1) compared with that of pristine Na0.67Ni0.25Mn0.75O2(capacity retention of 34.2 %, specific capacity of 51.3 mA h g−1). This work demonstrates the favorable effect of Li doping in P2-type layered materials to suppress the phase transition and inhibit the redox activity of Mn and O ions, and it provides an effective approach for the development of cathodes for sodium-ion batteries with high specific energy and long life.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides have been considered promising candidates as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high capacity and high rate capability. However, because of the difficulty involved in forming hierarchical microstructures, it remains challenging to develop high energy density P2-type layered oxides with good electrochemical performance and high electrode density. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of P2-type Na0.65[Ni0.17Co0.11Mn0.72]O2 as a very efficient cathode material for high energy density SIBs by synthesizing a micron-sized hierarchical structure via the coprecipitation route. The as-prepared P2-type microsphere cathode constructed from nanoscale primary particles provides a sufficient interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte solution, which enables to shorten the transport pathways for Na+ ions and electrons. Simultaneously, the hierarchical microstructure enhances the structural stability and high tap density (∼1.18 g cm-3). Benefiting from these merits, the proposed P2-type microsphere Na0.65[Ni0.17Co0.11Mn0.72]O2 displays a high discharge capacity of 187 mA h g-1 at 12 mA g-1 and an exceptional cycle retention of 74.7% after 500 cycles, even at the high current density of 600 mA g-1. In addition, the high tap density of this P2-type microsphere enhances the density of composite cathodes, which translates to a high volumetric energy density of 340 W h L-1 based on the overall volume of the cathode active mass and the aluminum foil current collector.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted extensive attention as cathode materials in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, high theoretical capacity, and facile synthesis process. However, it is of great challenge to control the crystal vacancies and interstitial water formed during the aqueous co‐precipitation method, which are also the key factors in determining the electrochemical performance. Herein, an antioxidant and chelating agent co‐assisted non‐aqueous ball‐milling method to generate highly‐crystallized Na2‐xFe[Fe(CN)6]y with hollow structure is proposed by suppressing the speed and space of crystal growth. The as‐prepared Na2‐xFe[Fe(CN)6]y hollow nanospheres show low vacancies and interstitial water content, leading to a high sodium content.

At this point, composite materials show superior performance due to balancing different structures and are offered as an alternative to single-phase cathodes.

The oxygen redox reaction was activated during the initial charging process, accompanied by the self-regulation of active elements, enhancing the ionic bonds to form a vacancy wall near the TM vacancies and thus preventing the migration of transition metal elements. Systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations comprehensively support the understanding of the self-regulation mechanism of Mn-HEO. As a result, the Mn-HEO cathode exhibits a stable structure during cycling. It demonstrates almost zero strain within a wide voltage range of 2.0-4.5 V with a remarkable specific capacity (177 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C) and excellent long-term cycling stability (87.6% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 2 C).

However, irreversible multiphase transformation and structural degradation, as well as lattice oxygen loss, hindered their commercialization. Electronic structure modulation based on the orbital hybridization concept is an important way to solve key scientific problems. Herein, due to its unique electronic structure, Sn is chosen as the proof of the conceptual element, and its effect on layered oxide cathode is summarized in three aspects: reversible phase transformation, abnormal structural regulation, and stable anionic redox. Firstly, the large size of Sn4+ suppresses the sliding of the transition metal oxide (TMO2) layer and Na+/vacancy ordering as well as enhances the delocalization of electrons. Secondly, Sn with a similar ionic radius to other TM ions in the structure promotes the stacking of the O3 phase. What’s more, the distinctive electronic structure of Sn4+ will enhance the operating voltage. Thirdly, a strong Sn-O bond stabilizes the lattice oxygen, promotes stable anion redox, and improves the energy density of the battery. Therefore, electronic structure modulation can provide technical direction for the development and industrialization of high-performance SIBs.",

In this paper chemical strategy is adopted to partially replace V 3+ of NVP framework by low valence Mn 2+ and high valence Mo 6+ substitution. The crystal structure, sodium-ion diffusion coefficient and electrochemical performance of Mn-Mo-doped [Na 3.94 V 0.98 Mo 0.02 Mn(PO 4 ) 3 @C] cathode were investigated. X-ray diffraction confirmed the NASICON-type structure and XPS analysis confirmed the oxidation state of Mn and Mo in doped NVP cathode. The Na ion diffusion processes were inferred from Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, which clearly show rapid Na-ion diffusion in NASICON-type cathode materials. The Mn-Mo-substituted NVP shows smoother charge-discharge profiles, improved rate performance (64.80 mAh/g at 1C rate), better energy density (308.61 mWh/g) and superior Na-ion kinetics than that of unsubstituted NVP@C cathode. Their enhanced performance is attributed to large interstitial volume mainly created by high valence Mo 6+ and enhanced capacity is attributed to the low valence Mn 2+ doping. These results demonstrate that Mn-Mo-doped NVP cathode is strongly promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) with NASCION (Na superionic conductor) is recognized as a potential cathode material owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, the electronic conductivity of NVPF is much lower than its ionic conductivity, which seriously affects the properties of this material. The carbon layer can be used as the conductive medium to enhance the conductivity of NVPF. In this study, we propose a single-step solid-state reaction method based on mechanical activation with pitch as the carbon source to synthesize NVPF/C composites. The crystallographic structure and morphology of all as-prepared samples were investigated by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, BET measurement, thermal analysis, SEM and TEM. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance and kinetic properties were analyzed by CV, galvanostatic charge–discharge and EIS tests. These tests outcomes demonstrated that the NVPF/C-2 composite with a carbon content of 12.14 wt% showed an excellent rate performance and cycle stability. It presented reversible capacities of 103 and 95 mA h g−1 at 0.2 and 10C, respectively, and an outstanding retention of 91.9% after 500 cycles at 5C. These excellent properties of the NVPF/C-2 composite are attributed to its high ion diffusion coefficient and small charge transfer impedance.",

Here, we have combined the excellent electronic conductivity of reduced graphene oxide, polysulfide adsorption ability of the ultrafine manganese oxide nanocrystals, rapid ion/electron dissemination efficiency of nanosized sulfur, and outstanding mechanical stiffness and good electrical conductivity of Na alginate/polyaniline hybrid binder in a single electrode heterostructure.

        "abstract": "Conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs), which possess long-range planar π-d conjugation, are fascinating for various applications because they inherit the merits of both metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and conducting polymers. However, only one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) CCPs have been reported so far. The synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) CCPs is challenging and even seems theoretically infeasible because conjugation implies 1D or 2D structure. Besides, the redox activity of the conjugated ligands and the π-d conjugation makes the synthesis of CCPs very complicated, and hence, single crystals of CCPs are rarely achieved. Herein, we reported the first 3D CCP and its single crystals with atomically precise structures. The synthesis process involves complicated in situ dimerization, deprotonation of ligands, oxidation/reduction of both ligands and metal ions, and precise coordination between them. The crystals contain in-plane 1D π-d conjugated chains and close π-π interactions between the adjacent chains that are bridged by another column of stacked chains, thus forming 3D CCP with high conductivity (400 S m-1 at room temperature and 3100 S m-1 at 423 K) and potential applications as cathodes in sodium-ion batteries with high capacity, rate capability, and cyclability.",

However, NASICON‐type cathodes suffer from low capacities. This limitation can be addressed through the activation of sodium‐excess phases, which can enhance capacities up to theoretical values. Thus, this paper proposes the use of transition metal (TM)‐substituted Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) to induce sodium‐excess phases. To identify suitable doping elements, an inverse design approach is developed, combining machine learning prediction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Graph‐based neural networks are used to predict two crucial properties, i.e., the structural stability and voltage level. Results indicate that the use of TM‐substituted NVPF materials leads to about 150% capacity enhancement with reduced time and resource requirements compared with the direct design approach. Furthermore, DFT calculations confirm improvements in cyclability, electronic conductivity, and chemical stability. The proposed approach is expected to accelerate the discovery of superior materials for battery electrodes.",

However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value.

The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co-precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as-prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168 mAh g-1 at 25 mA g-1, close to PBAs' theoretical capacity 170 mAh g-1), high rate performance (90 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1), and high energy density (over 500 Wh kg-1).",

The reaction time for NaCrO2 particles was reduced by almost one order of magnitude compared to a normal flask synthesis and by several orders of magntitude compared to a conventional solid-state reaction. In addition, it allows for an easy upscaling and was generalized for the synthesis of other layered oxides NaMO2 (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Al). The automated water-in-oil emulsion approach circumvents the diffusion limits of solid-state reactions by allowing a rapid intermixing of the components at a molecular level in submicrometer-sized micelles. A combination of Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 23Na), thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy provided insight into the formation mechanism of NaCrO2 particles.

However, their development is challenged by the availability of satisfactory cathode materials with stable framework to accommodate the transportation of large-sized Na+ (1.02 Å), whose continuous insertion/extraction is easy to cause irreversible volumetric deformation in the crystalline material, leading to inevitable structural failure and capacity fading. Here, different from the previous synthesis efforts targeting at Na+ containing compounds, we unveil the possibility of achieving a highly reversible sodiation/desodiation process by resorting to a K+-based layered metal oxide formulated as K0.5Mn0.7Fe0.2Ti0.1O2 (KMFT), which is P2 type in structure with a wide interlayer spacing to sit K+ (1.38 Å). We demonstrate that an initial K+/Na+ exchange can introduce Na+ into the lattice while a small amount of K+ remains inside, which plays significant role in ensuring enlarged channels for a fast and stable Na+ diffusion. The KMFT electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 147.1 mA g-1 at 10 mA g-1and outstanding long cycling stability with capacity retention of 71.5% after 1000 cycles at 500 mA g-1.

Additionally, it introduces supplementary charge carriers, thereby modulating the internal charge balance of the crystal lattice and mitigating electron confinement. Although the as-prepared Na3V2(PO4)2.8Cl0.6 and pristine NVP material show similar discharge capacity at low rate (0.1C), the former delivers higher capacity at high rates (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20C), indicating excellent rate performance. Notably, even after 2000 cycles at 10C, Na3V2(PO4)2.8Cl0.6 maintains a capacity retention of approximately 70 %. Remarkably, it retains 63 % of its initial capacity (48.1 mAh/g) after 5000 cycles at the demanding 20C, with a Coulombic efficiency approaching 100 %.

As a result, the optimized NVOPF/Ti3C2Tx cathode exhibits high rate capabilities (111 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C and 78 mA h g-1 at 20 C), with an impressively high capacity retention of 74.8% over a wide temperature range (from -20 to 20 °C). Additionally, the assembled sodium-ion full cell provides a highly reversible capacity of 116 mA h g-1 at 1 C, with a capacity retention of 67.2% after 100 cycles. These inspiring results provide new insights for improving the charge-transfer kinetics of the NVOPF cathode and this methodology may be extended to other cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The O3 layered oxides have been extensively investigated as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their remarkable theoretical capacity. However, the large radius of Na+ lead to complex phase transitions and tortuous diffusion channels during extraction/insertion, which ultimately restricts the Na+ diffusion kinetics and cyclic stability. In this study, we report a Zn and Cu co-doping strategy to the high entropy layer oxide Na [Ni0·2Fe0·2Mn0·4Cu0·15Zn0.05]O2 (HEO-CuZn) using the sol-gel method to prepare the oxides. Here, Zn is used to stabilize the structure of layer between the transition metal and O atoms, which slows down the adverse phase transition. In the fabricated sample, the element Cu provides additional capacity and inhibits excessive oxidation. The prepared HEO-CuZn used as cathode for Na+ ion battery exhibits better electrochemical performance, delivering a high specific capacity of 148 mA h g−1, and 84 % capacity retention after 100 cycles, which is attributed to the expanded Na+ transfer channels, reduced activation energy and interface side reactions, thus enhancing the Na+ diffusion kinetics. Meanwhile, the high entropy strategy stabilizes the overall structure by reducing the John-Teller distortion and suppressing the Na+/vacancy order, and effectively avoids adverse phase transitions such as O′3 and P′3. This study provides a new insight for the advance of the next generation high specific energy sodium-ion battery.",

        "abstract": "As a natrium superionic conductor, NASICON-type Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) has garnered increasing attention for large-scale sodium-ion batteries due to its high stability and power densities. Nevertheless, it still suffers from an inferior rate capability and poor cycling longevity, arising from sluggish intrinsic kinetics and severe structural degradation. Herein, vanadium (V) is used as a dopant for equal substitution of manganese (Mn) and titanium (Ti) in NMTP to alleviate voltage hysteresis and enhance the cycling performance. V-doping regulates the local coordination chemistry of transition metals and reduces derivative antisite defect concentration upon cycling. Through density functional theory analysis, Na3Mn0.9V0.2Ti0.9(PO4)3 (NMTP-V0.2) demonstrates a lower bandgap and higher electronic conductivity. Additionally, V-doping significantly lowers the diffusion barrier of Na2, leading to Na+ diffusivity that is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of NMTP during the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox process. The as-prepared NMTP-V0.2 delivers an excellent rate capability of 85.3 mAh g-1 under 50 C and satisfactory cycling retention of 81% with a high capacity over 1400 cycles. Thus, the assembled NMTP-V0.2/hard carbon sodium-ion full cell achieves a high energy density of 292.3 Wh kg-1 as well as outstanding capacity retention of 92% after 500 cycles under 10 C. This result not only provides an approach for suppressing voltage hysteresis in polyanion cathodes but also offers guidance for designing high-power SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxides constitute one of the most promising cathode materials classes for large-scale sodium-ion batteries because of their high specific capacity, scalable synthesis, and low cost. However, their practical use is limited by their low energy density, physicochemical instability, and poor cycling stability. Aiming to mitigate these shortcomings, in this work, we synthesized polycrystalline (PC) and single-crystal (SC) P2-type Na0.67−δMn0.67Ni0.33O2 (NMNO) cathode materials through a solid-state route and evaluated their physicochemical and electrochemical performance. The SC-NMNO cathode with a large mean primary particle size (D50) of 12.7 μm was found to exhibit high cycling stability leading to 47% higher capacity retention than PC-NMNO after 175 cycles at 1C rate in the potential window 4.2–1.5 V. This could be attributed to the effective mitigation of parasitic side reactions at the electrode–electrolyte interface and suppressed intergranular cracking induced by anisotropic volume changes. This is confirmed by the lower volume variation of SC-NMNO (ΔV ∼ 1.0%) compared to PC-NMNO (ΔV ∼ 1.4%) upon charging to 4.2 V. Additionally, the SC-NMNO cathode displayed slightly higher thermal stability compared to PC-NMNO. Both cathodes exhibited good chemical stability against air and water exposure, thus enabling material storage/handling in the ambient atmosphere as well as making them suitable for aqueous processing. In this regard, PC-NMNO was investigated with two low-cost aqueous binders, carboxymethyl cellulose, and sodium trimetaphosphate, which exhibited higher binding strength and displayed excellent electrochemical performance compared to PVDF, which could potentially lead to significant cost reduction in electrode manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Layered sodium-ion oxides hold considerable promise in achieving high-performance sodium-ion batteries. However, the notorious phase transformation during charging, attributed to increased O2-─O2- repulsion, results in substantial performance decay. Here, a hierarchical layer modification strategy is proposed to stabilize interlayer repulsion. During desodiation, migrated Li+ from the transition metal layer and anchored Ca2+ in sodium sites maintain the cationic content within the sodium layer. Meanwhile, partial oxygen substitution by fluorine and the involvement of oxygen in redox reactions increase the average valence of the oxygen layer. This sustained cation presence and elevated anion valence collectively mitigate increasing O2-─O2- repulsion during sodium extraction, enabling the Na0.61Ca0.05[Li0.1Ni0.23Mn0.67]O1.95F0.05 (NCLNMOF) cathode to retain a pure P2-type structure across a wide voltage range. Unexpected insights reveal the interplay between different doping elements: the robust Li─F bonds and Ca2+ steric effects suppressing Li+ loss. The NCLNMOF electrode exhibits 82.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and a high-rate capability of 94 mAh g-1 at 1600 mA g-1, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical layer modification for high-performance layered oxide cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage system, and their electrochemical performance is determined by the cathode materials. Recently, the polyanion-type cathode Na4 Fe3 (PO4 )2 P2 O7 (NFPP) demonstrates decent performance, while there exists promotion space with respect to its cycle stability and rate capability. Herein, an entropy-enhanced Na4 Fe2.95 (NiCoMnMgZn)0.01 (PO4 )2 P2 O7 (HE-NFPP) cathode is proposed with improved rate performance (67.1 mAh g-1 at 50 C) and cycle performance (retention of 92.0% after 1000  cycles at 1 C). The enhancement of configuration entropy improves the structural stability of NFPP thermodynamically. In-situ XRD illustrates the sodium storage mechanism of HE-NFPP as an imperfect solid solution reaction driven by Fe2+ /Fe3+ redox with a low volume change of 4.0% (90.9% of NFPP). Through doping, the structure distortion and abrupt rearrangement are inhibited. Additionally, HE-NFPP and hard carbon (HC) are utilized to fabricate pouch cell that demonstrates an average working voltage of 3.0 V and a maximum energy density of 165 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials). These results highlight the potential for enhancing the high-rate and long-cycle performance of NFPP as a promising cathode for SIBs through an entropy-enhanced multi-doping strategy.",

Until now, ether-based electrolytes have been rarely reported for high-voltage sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) operated under a low-temperature range. Herein, a novel ether-based electrolyte consisting of tetrahydrofuran as the main solvent is proposed and it could be utilized for a high-voltage Na2/3Mn2/3Ni1/3O2 (MN) cathode in a wide-temperature range from -40 to 25 °C. Meanwhile, a thin and robust inorganic component-rich cathode electrolyte interface layer is elaborately introduced on the MN cathode by this tailored electrolyte, resulting in excellent cycle life of MN cathode. Specifically, a capacity retention of 97.2% after 140 cycles could be delivered by MN at 0.3 C at room temperature (RT). Especially at an ultra-low temperature of -40 °C, the initial discharge capacity of MN could still approach 89.3% of that at RT, and the capacity retention is 94.1% at 0.2 C after 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodium iron sulfate in the form of alluaudite Na2+2xFe2-x(SO4)3 (or NFSx) has emerged as one of the most promising cathodes for Na-ion batteries due to its highest Fe2+/3+ redox potential, low-cost, sustainability and high rate capability. Unlike most of the other cathodes, NFSx generally crystalizes in its non-stoichiometric form with partial Na substitution for Fe sites and contains a small amount of impurities. However, profound explanations behind this inherent behavior including others, like phase stability, configurational structure and defect formation are still ambiguous. We have therefore performed first principles calculations combined with a random swapping method to determine the minimum energy configurations of NFSx (with x = 0, 0.25 and 0.5) and find a correlation between the Na distribution pattern and energetics in which the site preference for Na+ ion is in a sequence of Na4 > Na1 > Na2 > Na3. Our result points out that the non-stoichiometry cannot be properly described under the framework of primitive structures. Moreover, we investigated phase stability diagrams and defect formations based on thermodynamic criteria. Our predicted phase diagrams can explain the inevitable impurity precipitation, which can be reduced as x diminishes. Defect formation analysis indicates an unlikely formation of channel blockage and identifies the dominant formation of FeNa+VNa and Nai+NaFe complexes. While the former can become spontaneous in a Na-deficient environment, the latter occurs mainly in NFS0 and accommodates the presence of non-stoichiometry.",

However, the weak intrinsic electronic conductivity has hindered its further commercialization. Herein, an ingenious strategy of Bi3+ substitution at V3+ site in NVP system is proposed. The ionic radius of Bi3+ is slightly larger than that of V3+, which can further expand the crystal structure inside the NVP, thus accelerating the migration of Na+. Meanwhile, the appropriate amount of carbon coating and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) enwrapping construct an effective three-dimensional network, which provides a conductive framework for electronic transfer. Furthermore, the introduction of CNTs also inhibit the agglomeration of active grains during the sintering process, reducing the particle size and shortening the diffusion path of Na+.

        "abstract": "Among a variety of promising cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, polyanionic Na-insertion compounds are among the preferred choices due to known fast sodium transfer through the ion channels along their framework structures. The most interesting representatives are Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF), which display large Na+ diffusion coefficients (up to 10-9 m2 s-1 in NVP) and high voltage plateaux (up to 4.2 V for NVPF). While the diffusion in the solid material is well-known to be the rate-limiting step during charging, already being thoroughly discussed in the literature, interfacial transport of sodium ions from the liquid electrolyte toward the electrode was recently shown to be important due to complex ion desolvation effects at the surface. In order to fill the blanks in the description of the electrode/electrolyte interface in Na-ion batteries, we performed a molecular dynamics study of the local nanostructure of a series of carbonate-based sodium electrolytes at the NVP and the NVPF interfaces along with careful examination of the desolvation phenomenon. We show that the tightness of solvent packing at the electrode surface is a major factor determining the height of the free energy barrier associated with desolvation, which explains the differences between the NVP and the NVPF structures. To rationalize and emphasize the remarkable properties of this family of cathode materials, a complementary comparative analysis of the same electrolyte system at the carbon electrode interface was also performed.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxide cathodes, particularly those with P2 and P3 type structures, have lower specific capacities limited by the Na‐ion content in their structure. In this study, the Na content is elevated to its uppermost limit with a cathode. The material is synthesized in a monophasic P3, monophasic P2 (with a minor O3 phase), and biphasic P3/P2 configuration. During electrochemical testing, the biphasic P3/P2 and the monophasic P2 type compounds exhibited excellent performance, with specific capacities reaching 102 and 87 mAh g−1, respectively, at 6C. A full cell fabricated using the monophasic P2 type cathode demonstrated a specific capacity of 123 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and retained 90% of its initial specific capacity after 200 cycles at 0.2C. The structural integrity of both the biphasic P3/P2 and the monophasic P2 type cathode materials is supported by the operando synchrotron X‐ray diffraction data, which showed no phase transformations and P2 phase showing only a 0.78% variation in unit cell volume. These findings highlight the transformative potential of achieving high Na‐ion concentrations in P2‐type cathode materials, paving the way for developing high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Combinatorial synthesis of Li-ion batteries has proven extremely powerful in screening complex compositional spaces for next-generation materials. To date, no Na-ion counterpart exists wherein Na-ion cathodes can be synthesized in such a way to be comparable to that obtained in bulk synthesis. Herein, we develop a synthesis route wherein hundreds of mg-scale powder samples can be made in a total time of 3 days. We focus on materials in the Na-Fe-Mn-O pseudo-ternary system of high immediate interest. Using a sol-gel method, developed herein, yields both phase-pure combinatorial samples of Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 and NaFe1/2Mn1/2O2, consistent with previous reports on bulk samples of interest commercially. By contrast, the synthesis route used for Li-ion cathodes (namely co-precipitations) does not yield phase pure materials, suggesting that the sol-gel method is more effective in mixing the Na, Fe and Mn than co-precipitation. This has important consequences for all attempts to make these materials, even in bulk. Finally, we demonstrate that these mg-scale powder samples can be tested electrochemically in a combinatorial cell. The resulting cyclic voltammograms are in excellent agreement with those found on bulk samples in the literature. This demonstrates that the methodology developed here will be effective in characterizing the hundreds of samples needed to understand the complex ternary systems of interest, and that such results will scale-up well to the g and kg-scale.",

        "title": "A high-entropy engineering on sustainable anionic redox Mn-based cathode with retardant stress for high-rate sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "Manganese-based (Mn-based) layered oxides have emerged as competitive cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), primarily due to their high energy density, cost-effectiveness, and potential for mass production. However, these materials often suffer from irreversible oxygen redox reactions, significant phase transitions, and microcrack formation, which lead to considerable internal stress and degradation of electrochemical performance. This study introduces a high-entropy engineering strategy for P2-type Mn-based layered oxide cathodes (HE-NMCO), wherein a multi-ingredient cocktail effect strengthens the lattice framework by modulating the local environmental chemistry. This innovative approach fosters sustainable reversible oxygen activity, mitigates stress concentrations at grain boundaries, and accelerates Na⁺ transport kinetics. The resulting robust lattice framework with optimized elemental interactions significantly improves structural integrity and reduces the formation of intragranular fractures. Consequently, HE-NMCO demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, retaining 93.5% capacity after 100 deep (de)sodiation cycles, alongside an enhanced rate capability of 134.1 mAh g-1 at 5C. Notably, comparative studies through multimodal characterization techniques highlight HE-NMCO's superior reversibility in oxygen anion redox (OAR) reactions over extensive cycling, contrasting sharply with conventional NMCO cathode. This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn-based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.",

        "abstract": "Na4 MnV(PO4 )3 /C (NMVP) has been considered an attractive cathode for sodium-ion batteries with higher working voltage and lower cost than Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /C. However, the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity and Jahn-Teller distortion caused by Mn3+ inhibit its practical application. In this work, the remarkable effects of Zr-substitution on prompting electronic and Na-ion conductivity and also structural stabilization are reported. The optimized Na3.9 Mn0.95 Zr0.05 V(PO4 )3 /C sample shows ultrafast charge-discharge capability with discharge capacities of 108.8, 103.1, 99.1, and 88.0 mAh g-1 at 0.2, 1, 20, and 50 C, respectively, which is the best result for cation substituted NMVP samples reported so far. This sample also shows excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.2% at 1 C after 500 cycles. XRD analyses confirm the introduction of Zr into the lattice structure which expands the lattice volume and facilitates the Na+ diffusion. First-principle calculation indicates that Zr modification reduces the band gap energy and leads to increased electronic conductivity. In situ XRD analyses confirm the same structure evolution mechanism of the Zr-modified sample as pristine NMVP, however the strong ZrO bond obviously stabilizes the structure framework that ensures long-term cycling stability.",

The NNMO@CuO cathode material combines the advantages of CuO coating and Cu2+ doping. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, TEM elemental line scan analysis and ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that CuO has been successfully coated on the particle surface uniformly, and that this CuO layer effectively suppresses the exfoliation of the metal oxide layers and unfavorable side reactions. Furthermore, Cu2+ is also partially incorporated into the host structure, according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and refinement results. Although incorporated Cu2+ does not take part in the redox reactions of the battery cell, the refinement results indicate that the d-spacing of the Na+-ion diffusion layer is enlarged due to Cu2+ doping in the crystal structure, which results in better Na+ kinetics. Thus, the CuO-coated cathode material shows prominent cycling performance and rate capability. We believe that this CuO-coating and Cu2+-doping co-modification strategy provides a promising approach to designing advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

To address the problem, electrochemically inactive Mg2+ was introduced into the structure by substituting some of the Fe ions. It was shown that Mg substitution led to a smoother voltage profile with improved cycling performance and rate capability. These observations were attributed to the suppressed structural changes during electrochemical processes. Detailed redox mechanisms, associated local structural changes, and phase transitions were investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.

However, our understanding of the structural stability and dynamic reaction mechanisms of Na3Ni2SbO6 cathode during cycling, especially at atomic-scale, remains limited. Here, we track the microstructure evolution during extraction of Na+ ions in Na3Ni2SbO6 cathode at atomic scale in an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope. The electron beam irradiation that can provide a driving force for the Na+ ion migration, allows us to mimic the battery charge process. By controlling the electron beam dose, we study the structure evolution behavior to obtain insights into understanding the work principle and failure mechanism of Na3Ni2SbO6 cathode under different charge rate conditions. We find that the real-time structural evolution and ion migration pathways of Na3Ni2SbO6 cathode are distinct under different electron beam doses. High-dose irradiation reveals Na ion depletion, surface cracks, and phase transformations, mimicking rapid capacity decay. In contrast, low-dose irradiation shows slower ion migration, ordered Na vacancy formation, and maintaining structural integrity, which more closely resembles the electrochemical process of actual battery. This study provides an atomistic understanding of the structural stability and Na ions deintercalation mechanism in Na3Ni2SbO6 cathodes, offering new insights into optimizing electrode materials.",

        "title": "Local Construction of Mn-Based Layered Cathodes through Covalency Modulation for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "P2-type Mn-based layered oxides are among the most prevalent cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their low cost, resource abundance, and high theoretical specific capacity. However, they usually suffer from Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion from high-spin Mn3+ and poor cycling stability, resulting in rapid degradation of their structural and electrochemical properties. Herein, a stable P2-type Mn-based layered oxide is realized through a local construction strategy by introducing high-valence Ru4+ to overcome these issues. It has been revealed that the Ru substitution in the as-constructed Na0.6Mg0.3Mn0.6Ru0.1O2 (NMMRO) renders the following favorable effects. First, the detrimental P2-OP4 phase transition is effectively inhibited owing to the robust Ru-O covalency bond. Second, the Mg/Mn ordering is disturbed and the out-of-plane displacement of Mg2+ and in-plane migration of Mn4+ are suppressed, leading to improved structural stability. Third, the redox ability of Mn is increased by weakening the covalence between Mn and O through the local Ru-O-Mn configurations, which contributes to the attenuated J-T distortion. Last, the strong Ru-O covalency bond also leads to enhanced electron delocalization between Ru and O, which decreases the oxidation of oxygen anion and thereby reduces the driving force of metal migration. Because of these advantages, the structural integrity and electrochemical properties of NMMRO are largely improved compared with the Ru-free counterpart. This work provides deeper insights into the effect of local modulation for cationic/anionic redox-active cathodes for high-performance SIBs.",

However, it suffers from low energy density due to the limited specific capacity and partial low voltage plateau (≈2.5 V vs Na+/Na). Regulating such low voltage plateau can be a promising way to increase the energy density of NFPO. As revealed by the systematic characterizations and theoretical calculations, the low‐voltage plateau results from the Fe1 site (corner‐sharing mode) redox reaction accompanied by Na4 insertion/extraction process. Accordingly, in this work, a precise Ti3+ doping strategy is proposed to selectively occupy the Fe1 site based on the energy effect, thus boosting the energy density from 277.5 to 307.7 Wh kg−1 due to the improved reversible capacity (109.8 mAh g−1) and regulated voltage plateau. Reversible structural evolution with very tiny volume variation (3%) due to the strengthened local environment (Ti─O bonds) promises outstanding cycling durability (90.3% capacity retention over 4000 cycles). Moreover, fast reaction kinetics and low diffusion energy barriers achieved by introducing Ti3+ contribute to the excellent rate capability. This lattice regulation strategy enables NFPO cathode with superior performance and can provide deep guidelines for designing advanced polyanion cathodes.",

The composite of α-MnO_2 and OLC demonstrates exceptional performance as an electrode across various electrochemical energy storage systems, including zinc-ion batteries (ZIB), sodium-ion batteries (SIB), and supercapacitors (SC) than the pristine α-MnO_2. In SIB systems, the composite exhibits a specific capacity of 266 mAh g^−1 at initial cycle with 50% capacity retention over 500 cycles, whereas the pristine electrode delivers only 39% capacity retention. The rapid yet controlled charge transfer kinetics facilitated by OLC addition in the α-MnO_2 matrix outperforms as the ZIB cathode with an excellent specific capacity of 476 mAh g^−1 with 100% capacity retention, while the pristine sample exhibits 77.5% capacity retention. As a SC electrode, the α-MnO_2/OLC composite exhibits better electrochemical properties such as rectangular behavior, increased specific capacitance (792 F g^−1), excellent capacity retention at high current densities, and others. The higher surface area that could be offered by the OLC to the α-MnO_2 matrix facilitates the improved electrochemistry in the pristine sample and this kind of modification can be a viable solution to overcome the limitations of α-MnO_2 for electrochemical energy storage applications. It is important to note that the performance outputs of α-MnO_2/OLC composite are far better than the regular carbon (graphite, graphene) in α-MnO_2 electrodes. Further, OLC provided with high surface area and ordered morphology can play the role of conductivity booster, structural stabilizer, and electrochemical active material in all the energy storage applications which may give a significant research attention in near future.",

        "abstract": "The design of high-entropy O3-type layered oxides has been considered as an effective method for suppressing multiple phase transitions during cycling and improving stability. Herein, a series of high entropy layered oxides (HEOs) with different Mg:Sn ratios are investigated. It is found that the structural stability and electrochemical performance of these HEOs can be optimized by varying the Mg to Sn ratio. A lower Mg content is conducive to the formation of a single-phase HEO. An optimized HEO composition (namely NaNi0.1Co0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Cu0.1Mg0.04Sn0.16O2) exhibits high specific capacity (137.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1C) and good rate capability (~100 mAh g−1 at 1C). The cycling performance (capacity retention of ~87 % after 200 cycles at 0.5C) is also comparable to the reported O3-type HEOs. Such good performance can be attributed to its good redox activity, low interfacial impedance, higher Na+ diffusion coefficient (2.26 × 10−11 cm2 s−1) and reversible O3-P3 phase transition.",

        "abstract": "The undesirable phase transformation of Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes is a tremendous challenge in commercializing Mn-based oxide cathodes for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, Na0.67MnO2 cathode with stable P2-type structure was successfully synthesized by modulating its coordination numbers to suppress the preferred orientation growth of (001) crystal plane, which was realized to maintain a stable P2-type structure in the whole state of charging and discharging. Specifically, designing Mn2+ six coordination sites to lower the high surface energy of (001) crystal plane is an effective way to reduce nucleation rates, which leads to the production of few grain boundaries and the suppression of layer-to-layer stacking in the crystal growth stage. Due to their fewer grain boundaries and skeleton structure with layer-to-layer stacking, the interlaminar stress and intragranular fatigue cracks can be alleviated in the long-life cycling performance of Na0.67MnO2 cathode. Na0.67MnO2 cathodes derived from the precursor of Mn2+ six coordination sites (C-Na0.67MnO2) have more exposed {010} crystal face and enlarged sodium-ion diffusion channels and structure integrity compared to Na0.67MnO2 cathode prepared by the precursor of Mn2+ four coordination sites (O-Na0.67MnO2). Therefore, C-Na0.67MnO2 cathode delivers an initial capacity of 106.8 mAh/g and has excellent capacity retention of 94.8 % after 150 cycles at 80 mAh/g. The rational design strategy endows Mn-based P2-layered oxide cathodes with stable sodium-ion diffusion channels and lamellar structure.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most promising cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries, manganese-based layered oxides have aroused wide attention due to their high specific capacity and plentiful reserves. However, they are plagued by poor air stability rooting in water/Na+ exchange and adverse structural reconstruction, hindering their practical applications. Herein, it is demonstrated that utilizing fluorine to substitute oxygen atoms can narrow the interlayer spacing of novel P'2-Na0.67 MnO1.97 F0.03 (NMOF) cathode material, which resists the attack of water molecules, significantly prolonging exposure time in air. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that fluorine substitution alleviates the insertion of water molecules and spontaneous extraction of Na+ effectively. Benefiting from the structural modulation, NMOF can deliver a high specific capacity of 227.1 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 and a promising capacity retention of 84.0% after 100 cycles at 200 mA g-1 .

Cycling this material to a higher cutoff voltage of 4.5 V versus Na+/Na increases the specific discharge capacity to ≈140 mAh g-1 due to the appearance of a well-defined high-voltage plateau, but after only 20 cycles, capacity retention declines to 88% and Coulombic efficiency drops to around 97%. In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements conducted on composition NaxCo1/2Mn1/3Ni1/6O2 (y = 1/2) in the two potential windows studied help elucidate the operating potential of each transition metal redox couple. It also reveals that at the high-voltage plateau, all of the transition metals are stable, raising the suspicion of possible contribution of oxygen ions in the high-voltage plateau.",

In this work, the interfacial stability of layered NaNi_1/3Fe_1/3Mn_1/3O_2 cathode was effectively enhanced by electrolyte optimization. And the interfacial chemistry between the cathode and four widely used electrolytes (EC/DMC, EC/EMC, EC/DEC and EC/PC) was elucidated through experiments and theoretical calculations. The Na^+ solvation structures at cathode-electrolyte interface in all four electrolytes exhibited enhanced coordination due to high electron density and strong nucleophilicity of oxide surface, which promoted the electrolytes’ decomposition with decreased oxidation stability. Among them, the EC/DMC electrolyte showed the tightest solvation structure due to smaller molecular chains and stable electrochemistry, which derived an even and robust cathode electrolyte interphase. It effectively protected the cathode and facilitated the reversible Na^+ transport during long cycles, enabling the batteries with a high capacity retention of 83.3% after 300 cycles. This work provides new insights into the role of electrode surface characteristics in interface chemistry that can guide the design of advanced electrode and electrolyte materials for rechargeable batteries.",

However, severe agglomeration of the HEPBA particles still limits the fast charging capabilities. Here, an HEPBA (Nax(FeMnCoNiCu)[Fe(CN)6]y□1-y·nH2O) with a hollow stair-stepping spherical structure has been prepared through the chemical etching process of the traditional cubic structure of HEPBA. Electrochemical characterization (sodium ion battery), kinetic analysis, and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal that the nature of the high-entropy and the hollow stair-stepping spherical structure can greatly improve the diffusion behavior of Na+ ions. Moreover, the hollow structure effectively mitigates the volume change of HEPBA during SIBs operation, ultimately extending the lifespan. Consequently, the as-prepared HEPBA cathode exhibits excellent rate performance (126.5 and 76.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 and 4.0 A g-1, respectively) and stable long-term capability (maintaining its 75.6% capacity after 1000 cycles) due to its unique structure. Furthermore, the waste of the etching process can easily be recycled to prepare more HEPBA product.

        "abstract": "In this study, we present improved power characteristics and suppressed phase transition by incorporating elemental doping into a P2-type cathode of sodium ion batteries. A Cu-doped Fe-Mn based P2-type Na0.67Cu0.125Fe0.375Mn0.5O2 cathode was designed based on the calculations of the electronic structure and then examined experimentally. Using first principles, we introduced instrinsic p-type conductivity by elemental doping with Cu. Introduction of Cu generated electron holes above the Fermi level in the electronic structure, which is typical of p-type semiconductors. Charge analyses suggested that the hole generation was driven primarily by the greater reduced characteristics of Cu as compared with those of Fe and Mn. In addition, introduction of Cu retaining high reduced property also suppressed phase transition from the P2 to Z phase by Fe migration to empty Na layers mainly. Electrochemical experiments revealed improved power characteristics upon the introduction of p-type conductivity. This could be attributed to the increase in the electronic conductivity by hole generation in the valence band. This study suggests that the introduction of p-type conductivity could be a rational tactic for the development of promising cathode materials for high performance sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are receiving considerable attention as economic candidates for large-scale energy storage applications. Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F (NVPF) is intensively regarded as one of the most promising cathode materials for SIBs, due to its high energy density, fast ionic conduction, and robust Na+ -super-ionic conductor (NASICON) framework. However, poor rate capability ascribed to the intrinsically low electronic conductivity severely hinders their practical applications. Here, high-rate and highly reversible Na+ storage in NVPF is realized by optimizing nanostructure and rational porosity construction. Hierarchical porous NVPF hollow nanospheres are designed to modify the issues of inconvenient electrolyte transportation and unfavorable charge transfer behavior faced by solid-structured electrode materials. The individual unique nanosphere is assembled from numerous nanoparticles, which shortens the length of Na+ transport in solid state and thus facilites the Na+ migration. Hollow nanostructure hierarchically porous configuration enables adequate electrolyte penetration, continuous electrolyte supplementation, and facile electrolyte transportation, leading to barrier-free Na+ /e- diffusion and high-rate cycling. In addition, the large electrolyte accessible surface area boosts the charge transfer in the whole electrode. Therefore, the present NVPF demonstrates unprecedented rate capability (85.4 mAh g-1 at 50 C) and long-term cyclability (62.2% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 20 C).",

        "title": "Improved rate capability and long cycle life of metal-organic framework derived TiO2@V2O5 composite as an efficient cathode for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Vanadium oxide on carbon nanoporous structure (V2O5/C) as a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offers significant specific capacities in energy storage systems but suffers from slow ionic diffusivity upon long cycling at higher current rates, thereby generally resulting in substandard electrochemical performance. This study suggests a facile strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of V2O5/C as a cathode in sodium-ion batteries via titanium (Ti) doping using the pre-synthesized Ti-doped vanadium-based metal-organic framework template (V-MIL-101) as the precursor, which can be converted into a sophisticated core-shell type structure in which titania nanoparticle-based shell surrounds the vanadium oxide with a porous carbon-based octahedral core. Structural characterization reveals that Ti-doping forms a protective layer around vanadium based MIL-101 octahedrons that, upon pyrolysis, preserves the octahedral geometry and transforms into a nanoporous core-shell structure. It also greatly enhances the electrochemical performance as a cathode for SIBs. The titania-doped vanadium oxide structures represent higher specific capacities than the undoped vanadium oxide cathode, whereas among all the titania-doped samples, the 3 wt% TiO2@V2O5/C exhibited a much higher reversible capacity of 276.2 mAh/g as compared to the other cathode samples at 0.1C current rate and was able to retain a capacity of 250.1 mAh/g with a high coulombic efficiency after 200 cycles. Titanium species induce the formation of oxygen vacancies and V+5 species, which enhance the electrode's electric conductivity and ion diffusion—the stable octahedrons with a porous structure and carbon hybridisation in 3 wt% TiO2@V2O5/C could facilitate ion/electron transfer through shortened diffusion pathways.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide materials are considered to be a highly suitable cathode for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) due to their appreciable specific capacity and energy density. However, rapid capacity fading caused by serious structural changes and interfacial degradation hampers their use. A novel Sn-modified O3-type layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode is presented, with improved high-voltage stability through simultaneous bulk Sn doping and surface coating in a scalable one-step process. The bulk substitution of Sn4+ stabilizes the crystal structure by alleviating the irreversible phase transition and lattice structure degradation and increases the observed average voltage. In the meantime, the nanolayer Sn/Na/O composite on the surface effectively inhibits surface parasitic reactions and improves the interfacial stability during cycling. A series of Sn-modified materials are reported. An 8%-Sn-modified NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode exhibits a doubling in capacity retention increase after 150 cycles in the wide voltage range of 2.0–4.1 V vs Na/Na+ compared to none, and 81% capacity retention is observed after 200 cycles in a full cell vs hard carbon. This work offers a facile process to simultaneously stabilize the bulk structure and interface for the O3-type layered cathodes for sodium-ion batteries and raises the possibility of similar effective strategies to be employed for other energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are attractive energy storage media owing to the abundance of sodium, but the low capacities of available cathode materials make them impractical. Sodium-excess metal oxides Na_2MO_3 (M: transition metal) are appealing cathode materials that may realize large capacities through additional oxygen redox reaction. However, the general strategies for enhancing the capacity of Na_2MO_3 are poorly established. Here using two polymorphs of Na_2RuO_3, we demonstrate the critical role of honeycomb-type cation ordering in Na_2MO_3. Ordered Na_2RuO_3 with honeycomb-ordered [Na_1/3Ru_2/3]O_2 slabs delivers a capacity of 180 mAh g^−1 (1.3-electron reaction), whereas disordered Na_2RuO_3 only delivers 135 mAh g^−1 (1.0-electron reaction). We clarify that the large extra capacity of ordered Na_2RuO_3 is enabled by a spontaneously ordered intermediate Na_1RuO_3 phase with ilmenite O1 structure, which induces frontier orbital reorganization to trigger the oxygen redox reaction, unveiling a general requisite for the stable oxygen redox reaction in high-capacity Na_2MO_3 cathodes. Sodium-excess metal oxides Na_2MO_3 are appealing cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Here, the authors demonstrate that honeycomb-type cation ordering in Na_2RuO_3 triggers the oxygen redox reaction via frontier orbital reorganization, increasing the capacity by 1/3 compared with disordered Na_2RuO_3.",

P2 and O′3 are two representative structures of Mn-based layered oxides.

In this study, a novel ternary layered oxide NaNi1/2Mn1/4Ti1/4O2 is reported as a robust high-capacity cathode for SIBs, and its structural evolution and redox chemistry in the potential range of 1.5–4.2 V (vs Na+/Na) are carefully explored by coupling X-ray diffraction technique, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, FTIR spectroscopy, and galvanostatic measurement. Experimental facts reveal that the material undergoes multiple structural phase evolutions involving two solid-solution regions and one two-phase region based on the redox chemistry of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+ couples. It exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 145.2 mAh g−1 and an impressive capacity retention of 85.1% after 100 cycles due to the unique structure with robust ternary composition and stable coating interface. The coating interface is mainly related with formation of the amorphous carbonate layer at preparation step and the CEI film containing alkoxy group during the first charge. In addition, initial Na extraction from the material suffers from a “potential jump” phenomenon owing to severe electrochemical polarization caused by large interfacial impedance and charge-transfer impedance. This work provides new insights on interfacial change, structural evolution and redox reaction of high-capacity O3-type layered oxide cathode during Na extraction/insertion.",

        "abstract": "Due to its affordability, strong structural stability, and high rate capability, rhombohedral sodium ferrous hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) has been identified as a potential cathode material for sodium ion batteries. Nevertheless, the presence of inherent crystal water and the susceptibility of its interface stability significantly hinder its capacity and cycling performance. In this study, we propose a novel modification approach involving the addition of ZnCl2 to effectively capture crystal water and facilitate the in-situ formation of a ZnO coating on the FeHCF surface. Due to the decreased crystal water content and the presence of stable ZnO interphases, the occurrence of side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, as well as crystal particle cracks in FeHCF during repeated sodiation/desodiation processes, is effectively reduced. Consequently, the modified FeHCF demonstrates an extended operational lifespan of 1000 cycles, with an initial discharge capacity of 112.0 mAh/g and a capacity retention rate of 77.8 % at a current rate of 1C within the voltage range of 2.0–4.2 V.

        "abstract": "The booming consumption of energy storage devices spontaneously accelerates the urgent development of robust cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In view of this, the sodium superionic conductor Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP), with considerable energy density of 425 Wh kg−1, has become the focus in SIB research. Despite this, the performance of NMVP is substantially compromised by Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ ions in conjunction with inherently limited electronic conductivity. In order to address this limitation, this study introduces a series of N-doped carbon (NC) coated NMVP materials with interleaved large and small microsphere morphology. Of particular note, the optimized NMVP-NC2 shows the most excellent performance, maintaining a capacity of 65.7 mAh g−1 at 5C over 500 cycles. A full cell configuration employing an NMVP-NC2 cathode and a commercial hard carbon (HC) anode manifests commendable circular stability with a capacity of 80.7 mAh g−1 underneath 100 cycles at 1C, with an impressive 95.3 % capacity preservation. This distinctive architecture imparts the materials with a high tap density and a relatively low surface area, which is beneficial to the industrial employment. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the NC regulation significantly narrows the NMVP's bandgap and facilitates electron transfer, thereby accelerating electron/ion transport kinetics. The NC coating approach combined with large-scale spray drying tactic in this work offers a clear strategy to industrialize NMVP cathode towards high-performance SIBs.",

In this work, a Cs+/Zn2+ co-doping strategy is proposed to increase the performance at low temperature of −20 °C for the first time. The doped Cs+/Zn2+ ions have a vital role in lowering interstitial water content in PBA, resulting in improved diffusion dynamics of Na+ ions and greatly enhancing cyclic stability at temperature as low as −20 °C. The half cells made from PBA with an optimized Cs+/Zn2+ concentration exhibited excellent performance, retaining 79.63 % of the capacity after 5400 cycles at a low temperature of −20 °C and a current density of 5C.

        "abstract": "With the limited resources and high cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and the ever-increasing market demands, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) gain much interest due to their economical sustainability, and similar chemistry and manufacturing processes to LIBs. As cathodes play a vital role in determining the energy density of SIBs, Mn-based layered oxides are promising cathodes due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high theoretical capacity. However, the main challenge is structural instability upon cycling at high voltage. Herein, Mg is introduced into the P2-type Na0.62 Ni0.25 Mn0.75 O2 cathode to enhance electrochemical stability. By combining electrochemical testing and material characterizations, it is found that substituting 10 mol% Mg can effectively alleviate the P2-O2 phase transition, Jahn-Teller distortion, and irreversible oxygen redox. Moreover, structural integrity is greatly improved. These lead to enhanced electrochemical performances. With the optimized sample, a remarkable capacity retention of 92% in the half cell after 100 cycles and 95% in the full cell after 170 cycles can be achieved. Altogether, this work provides an alternative way to stabilize P2-type Mn-based layer oxide cathodes, which in turn, put forward the development of this material for the next-generation SIBs.",

        "abstract": "High-entropy layered cathode materials have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional structural stability and capacity retention. However, the complex composition of these materials has posed challenges for performance optimization. Herein, an innovative high-entropy P2/O3 hybrid layered oxide cathode material with impressive reversible capacity and high-rate capabilities is designed according to the configurational entropy adjustment strategy. Specifically, the unique structure of Na0.85Li0.05Ni0.3Fe0.1Mn0.5Ti0.05O2 (LNFMT) exhibits not only enhanced anionic activity but also mitigated migration of transition metals at high voltage. The high-entropy effect facilitates the migration of Li+ to Na layer, forming a pseudo-tetrahedral structure that hinders the movement of Fe3+. Additionally, the robust Ti-O bond ensures the internal cohesion of transition metal layers, enhancing the structural stability during de-/intercalation processes. As a result, the undesirable P2-O2 phase transformation is effectively suppressed in 1.5–4.5 V, leading to a remarkable capacity retention of over 70% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Moreover, LNFMT shows a high discharge capacity of 116 mAh/g at 10 C with excellent capacity retention of 94.23% after 150 cycles in 2.0–4.2 V, demonstrating its superior rate capability. This research showcases the significant impact of the high-entropy effect and provides a novel perspective for the design of sodium-ion cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The layer-structured oxide cathode for sodium-ion batteries has attracted a widespread attention due to the unique redox properties and the anionic redox activity providing additional capacity. Nevertheless, such excessive oxygen redox reactions will lead to irreversible oxygen release, resulting in a rapid deterioration of the cycling stability. Herein, sulfur ion is successfully introduced to the O3-NaNi0.3Mn0.5Cu0.1Ti0.05W0.05O2 material through high-temperature quenching, thereby developing a novel Na2S-modified O3/P2-NaNi0.3Mn0.5Cu0.1Ti0.05W0.05O2 composite with extended cycling life. The S2- is analyzed for the ability to enhance the reversibility of oxidation-reduction reactions under high voltage and suppress the loss of lattice oxygen during cycling. The stable S─O covalent bonds are found to inhibit the oxygen generation and release within the structure. Benefiting from these improvements, the Na₂S-modified O3/P2-NaNi0.3Mn0.5Cu0.1Ti0.05W0.05O2 exhibited a high reversible capacity of 173.1 mA h g-1 over a wide voltage range of 1.5-4.3 V under test conditions at 0.1 C and 81.5% capacity retention after 120 cycles at 1 C. The Na₂S-modified O3/P2-NaNi0.3Mn0.5Cu0.1Ti0.05W0.05O2 demonstrates the excellent rate capability with the reversible capacities of 173.1,137.0,114.7,96.7, and 80.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C.",

However, most of the Prussian blue compounds obtained from the conventional synthetic routes contain large amounts of Fe(CN)6 vacancies and coordinated water molecules, which leads to the collapse of cyano-bridged framework and serious deterioration of their Na-storage ability. Herein, we propose a facile citrate-assisted controlled crystallization method to obtain low-defect Prussian blue lattice with greatly improved Na-storage capacity and cycling stability. As an example, the as-prepared Na2CoFe(CN)6 nanocrystals demonstrate a reversible 2-Na storage reaction with a high specific capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) and a ∼ 90% capacity retention over 200 cycles, possibly serving as a low cost and high performance cathode for Na-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Although \"water-in-salt\" electrolytes have opened a new pathway to expand the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes, the electrode instability and irreversible proton co-insertion caused by aqueous media still hinder the practical application, even when using exotic fluorinated salts. In this study, an accessible hybrid electrolyte class based on common sodium salts is proposed, and crucially an ethanol-rich media is introduced to achieve highly stable Na-ion electrochemistry. Here, ethanol exerts a strong hydrogen-bonding effect on water, simultaneously expanding the electrochemical stability window of the hybridized electrolyte to 2.5 V, restricting degradation activities, reducing transition metal dissolution from the cathode material and improving electrolyte-electrode wettability. The binary ethanol-water solvent enables the impressive cycling of sodium-ion batteries based on perchlorate, chloride, and acetate electrolyte salts. Notably, a Na0.44MnO2 electrode exhibits both high capacity (81 mAh g-1) and remarkable long cycle life >1000 cycles at 100 mA g-1 (a capacity decay rate per cycle of 0.024%) in a 1 M sodium acetate system. The Na0.44MnO2/Zn full cells also show excellent cycling stability and rate capability in a wide temperature range. The gained understanding of the hydrogen-bonding interactions in the hybridized electrolyte can provide new battery chemistry guidelines in designing promising candidates for developing low cost and long lifespan batteries based on other (Li+, K+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+) systems.",

Herein, the combination of high‐entropy (HE) and multiphase structure is demonstrated to be helpful for maintaining the structure and improving the cycling stability. In the Ni/Mn/Cu/Ti/Sn five‐component HE multiphase cathode, the multiple elements at transition metal sites can enlarge the lattice and stabilize the structure simultaneously without causing an obvious capacity drop, achieving the synergistic effect of multi‐cations. In the HE cathodes consisting of P2 and O3 phases, the harmful phase transition in high‐voltage is suppressed and the cycling performance is improved. A capacity retention of 77.3 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles is delivered, and an improved rate performance of 88.7 mAh g−1 at 750 mA g−1 is observed, better than that of the low‐entropy multiphase cathode(P2 and O3) and the HE oxide single O3‐phase cathode. The weighted average ionic radius(WAIR) of all transition metals is demonstrated critical for the formation of the phase composition in HE composites. Through comparing a series of HE and multiphase cathodes, an empirical range of WAIR is obtained, which shows guidance for the design of other cathode materials.",

By 3D imaging and subsequent post‐processing involving image segmentation, the spatial distribution of NVP is resolved in 3D, and the spatial distribution of carbon and pores is resolved in 2D. Based on this information, a parametric stochastic model, specifically a Pluri‐Gaussian model, is calibrated to the 3D morphology of the nanostructured NVP/C particles. Model validation is performed by comparing the nanostructure of simulated NVP/C composites with image data in terms of morphological descriptors which have not been used for model calibration. Finally, the stochastic model is used for predictive simulation to quantify the effect of varying the amount of carbon while keeping the amount of NVP constant. The presented methodology opens new possibilities for a ressource‐efficient optimization of the morphology of NVP/C particles by modeling and simulation.",

Bare NaCrO2 is usually synthesized by a solid-state reaction and suffers from serious capacity decay and poor power capability. Modification by coating is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties, but it inevitably reduces the energy density. To avoid the decrease of energy density and optimize the electrochemical performance, a specific route, i.e., a freeze-drying-assisted sol-gel method, has been adopted to synthesize bare NaCrO2 in this work. Three-phase coexistence during charging is confirmed for the first time, which contributes to delaying the disappearance of the O3 phase and then improving the structural reversibility, resulting in superior cycle stability (∼50% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5C). Meanwhile, as-synthesized NaCrO2 delivers an outstanding rate capability (82.1 mAh g-1 at 50C), which is attributed to the fast Na+ diffusivity and high electronic conductivity proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is worth mentioning that NaCrO2 also exhibits excellent electrochemical properties when used as a cathode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). This work provides new perspectives on the structural evolution of NaCrO2, and the results are expected to contribute to the development of SIBs and PIBs.",

This cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 160.4 mAh g^−1 and operates at a considerable medium voltage of 3.2 V. The Na_3.5MnCr_0.5Ti_0.5(PO_4)_3 cathode undergoes a multi-electron redox reaction involving the Cr^3+/4+ (4.40/4.31 V vs. Na/Na^+), Mn^3+/4+ (4.18/4.03 V), Mn^2+/3+ (3.74/3.41 V), and Ti^3+/4+ (2.04/2.14 V) redox couples. This redox reaction enables a three-electron transfer during the Na^+ intercalation/de-intercalation processes. As a result, the Na_3.5MnCr_0.5Ti_0.5(PO_4)_3 demonstrates a significant enhancement in energy density, surpassing other recently reported SIB cathodes. The highly reversible structure evolution and small volume changes during cycling were demonstrated with in-situ X-ray diffraction, ensuring outstanding cyclability with 77% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Furthermore, a NMCTP@C//Sb@C full battery was fabricated, which delivered a high energy density of 421 Wh kg^−1 and exhibited good cyclability with 75.7% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The rational design of composition regulation with multi-metal ion substitution holds the potential to unlock new possibilities in achieving high-performance SIBs. Graphical Abstract A novel NASICON-structured Na_3.5MnCr_0.5Ti_0.5(PO_4)_3 nanofiber was successfully designed and prepared. This nanofiber was employed to research the multi-electron reaction and the resulting structural evolution in SIBs. The optimal Na-migration pathway has also been investigated by DFT computations. A full SIB battery was fabricated and delivered a high energy density (421 Wh kg^−1) and cyclability (75.7% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g^−1).",

        "abstract": "Materials with a layered structure have attracted tremendous attention because of their unique properties. The ultrathin nanosheet structure can result in extremely rapid intercalation/de-intercalation of Na ions in the charge–discharge progress. Herein, we report a manganese oxide with pre-intercalated K and Na ions and having flower-like ultrathin layered structure, which was synthesized by a facile but efficient hydrothermal method under mild condition. The pre-intercalation of Na and K ions facilitates the access of electrolyte ions and shortens the ion diffusion pathways. The layered manganese oxide shows ultrahigh specific capacity when it is used as cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. It also exhibits excellent stability and reversibility. It was found that the amount of intercalated Na ions is approximately 71% of the total charge. The prominent electrochemical performance of the manganese oxide demonstrates the importance of design and synthesis of pre-intercalated ultrathin layered materials.",

        "abstract": "Layered O3-type sodium oxides (NaMO2 , M=transition metal) commonly exhibit an O3-P3 phase transition, which occurs at a low redox voltage of about 3 V (vs. Na+ /Na) during sodium extraction and insertion, with the result that almost 50 % of their total capacity lies at this low voltage region, and they possess insufficient energy density as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Therefore, development of high-voltage O3-type cathodes remains challenging because it is difficult to raise the phase-transition voltage by reasonable structure modulation. A new example of O3-type sodium insertion materials is presented for use in NIBs. The designed O3-type Na0.7 Ni0.35 Sn0.65 O2 material displays a highest redox potential of 3.7 V (vs. Na+ /Na) among the reported O3-type materials based on the Ni2+ /Ni3+ couple, by virtue of its increased Ni-O bond ionicity through reduced orbital overlap between transition metals and oxygen within the MO2 slabs. This study provides an orbital-level understanding of the operating potentials of the nominal redox couples for O3-NaMO2 cathodes. The strategy described could be used to tailor electrodes for improved performance.",

Unfortunately, PBAs exhibits poor cycling performance and low coulombic efficiency because of their large vacancy flaws and inadequate structural stability during the insertion/extraction of Na+. Herein, we have developed a series of vanadium-doped PBAs with different transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) via chemical co-precipitation method combined with water bath process. Through rigorous regulation of transition metals, the designed sodium vanadium ferrohexacyanate (VFeHCF) exhibits optimal electrochemical properties, including an initial specific capacity of 110 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 93.7 %, and a reversible capacity of 80 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 72.7 %, outperforming VCoHCF and VNiHCF. The enhancement in sodium storage can be attributed to the establishment of a stable Na+ interspersion potential between V4+ and Fe2+, as well as the extensive coordination environment of the iron ions, which promotes both electron transfer and Na+ transport.",

Herein, we design a trace topological doping strategy to introduce barium ions into crystal domains of Na3V2(PO4)3 to partially replace vanadium sites. Deep learning demonstrates that the violation of the inversion symmetry of vanadium by barium substitution can improve the structural stability and change the charge density distribution of vanadium, resulting in the re-distribution of surface electrons and supplying more possible migration paths for sodium ions. Simultaneously, the slight alteration of the crystal structure helps the positive shift of vanadium valence from +3 to +4, providing more multi-electron redox reactions. Among these candidates, NVBP-2 manifests a specific capacity of 65.1 mA h g-1 at 50C rate with superior charge-discharge capability and cycling performance. Moreover, it possesses decent long-term cycling stability with 81.2% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 50C. In summary, the results indicate that trace topological doping of alkaline metal ions in combination with deep learning has a novel ability to achieve sodium ion storage regulation for sodium ion batteries, which exquisitely provides a new perspective for screening cathode materials with high electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic sodium ion cathodes have attracted lots of concern because of their excellent structural stability. However, the low specific capacity is still a pressing issue hampering their practical application. In this work, a medium‐entropy NASICON‐structure cathode Na3.5V0.5Mn0.5Fe0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 (Me‐NVMP) is proposed. The Me‐NVMP achieves a highly reversible specific capacity of 165.8 mAh g−1 (1.8–4.4 V vs Na+/Na) at 0.1 C via the stepwise redox reactions of Ti3+/Ti4+‐Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+‐Mn2+/Mn3+, and V4+/V5+‐Mn3+/Mn4+. More impressively, the Me‐NVMP yields super rate capability and cycling stability via the regulation of configuration entropy in NASICON. Specifically, the Me‐NVMP cathode can preserve a capacity retention of 83.5% after 10,000 cycles at 100 C (17 A g−1). Furthermore, excellent cycling performance even at the temperature of 0 °C (capacity retention of 93.45% at 20 C after 1000 cycles) is also demonstrated. In situ X‐ray diffraction analysis reveals that the enhanced performance can be mainly attributed to the solid–solution‐type Na+ storage behavior in Me‐NVMP. Moreover, issues such as Jahn‐Teller distortion of Mn3+ and irreversible structural change at high voltage (>4.0 V vs Na+/Na) are effectively mitigated. This work inspires a new strategy to design high‐performance polyanionic electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Mn3+ (d4) in manganese-based Prussian blue analogues (MnPBA) exhibits intrinsic orbital degeneracy upon sodiation/desodiation, resulting in severe Jahn-Teller distortion, which causes rapid capacity decay and sluggish kinetics. Unfortunately, traditional modification strategies are deficient for electronic tuning of Mn3+ to address these issues. Herein, Intervalence Charge Transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions is unraveled in a series of novel V3+-substituted MnPBA to enhance electrochemical reaction reversibility and kinetics. Precisely, IVCT drives electron distribution from localized to delocalized, achieves electronic coupling and mitigates Jahn-Teller by transferring a single-electron of Mn3+ eg orbital. Notably, the reported Na1.2V0.63Mn0.58Fe(CN)6 cathode demonstrates incredible rate capability (136.9 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 and 94.9 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), remarkable long-cycle stability (91.6% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 20 mA g-1 and 90.7% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g-1), and robust performance across a wide temperature range (98.59% capacity after 300 cycles at -30°C and 50 mA g-1), surpassing the majority of reported sodium-ion cathodes. The intrinsic functioning mechanisms of IVCT and quasi-zero-strain reaction mechanisms were adequately understood through systematic in-situ/ex-situ characterizations.

However, the fascinating Mn3+/2+ redox couple suffers from inadequate activation due to the Mn-O covalent character and poor electronic conductivity, impeding its further applications. Herein, a local electronic structure regulation strategy is proposed to improve the Mn3+/2+ redox potential and reversible capacity simultaneously through introducing elements with low-energy 3d orbitals to expand the energy gap between the eg orbitals and Fermi energy of Na. Moreover, the 3d element substitution serves to narrow the band gap toward the improved intrinsic electronic conductivity.

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are the most important cathode materials for Li/Na/K ion batteries. Suppressing undesirable phase transformations during charge-discharge processes is a critical and fundamental challenge towards the rational design of high-performance layered oxide cathodes. Here we report a shale-like Na_ x MnO_2 (S-NMO) electrode that is derived from a simple but effective water-mediated strategy. This strategy expands the Na^+ layer spacings of P2-type Na_0.67MnO_2 and transforms the particles into accordion-like morphology. Therefore, the S-NMO electrode exhibits improved Na^+ mobility and near-zero-strain property during charge-discharge processes, which leads to outstanding rate capability (100 mAh g^−1 at the operation time of 6 min) and cycling stability (>3000 cycles). In addition, the water-mediated strategy is feasible to other layered sodium oxides and the obtained S-NMO electrode has an excellent tolerance to humidity. This work demonstrates that engineering the spacings of alkali-metal layer is an effective strategy to stabilize the structure of layered transition metal oxides. Suppressing phase transitions is crucial for the layered lithium/sodium transition metal oxide cathodes in batteries.

        "abstract": "Layered oxide cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising candidates due to their fascinating high capacity, good cyclability, and environmental friendliness. However, the air sensitivity of layered SIB cathodes causes high electrode manufacturing costs and performance deterioration, hampering their practical application. Herein, a commercial O3-type layered Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2 (NNFM) material is adopted to investigate the air corrosive problem and the suppression strategy. We reveal that once the layered material comes in contact with ambient air, cations migrate from transition metal (TM) layers to sodium layers at the near surface, although Na+ and TM ions show quite different ion radii. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that more Ni/Na disorder occurs in the air-exposed O3-NNFM materials, owing to a lower Ni migration energy barrier. The cation mixing results in detrimental structural distortion, along with the formation of residual alkali species on the surface, leading to high impedance for Na+ diffusion during charge/discharge. To tackle this problem, an ultrathin and uniform hydrophobic molecular layer of perfluorodecyl trimethoxysilane is assembled on the O3-NNFM surface, which significantly suppresses unfavorable chemistry and structure degradation during air storage. The in-depth understanding of the structural degradation mechanism and suppression strategy presented in this work can facilitate high-energy cathode manufacturing from the perspective of future practical implementation and commercialization.",

        "abstract": "A sequentially processed method is developed to prepare a high-voltage cathode material sodium vanadium diphosphate Na7V3(P2O7)4 for Na-ion battery. We find that the growth of Na7V3(P2O7)4 generally introduces growth orientation due to their hybrid ionic and covalent bonding. The crystal growth of the diphosphate prefers to grow perpendicular to [002] direction, leading to an increase of the diffusion length of Na+ ion. To regulate the growth of crystal, three kinds of carbon additives, graphene oxide, Cabot carbon black and Ketjen carbon black are adopted to tune the morphologies of Na7V3(P2O7)4 to further improve its electrochemical performances. The morphologies and physicochemical properties of carbon additives and corresponding prepared Na7V3(P2O7)4 are both well characterized to clarify the effects of carbon additives on the growth process. We find that the Cabot carbon black can dramatically weaken the oriented growth direction and produce fine morphology. By adding Cabot carbon black to the sequential process, the reversible capacity of Na7V3(P2O7)4 can reach to 76 mAh g−1 with good cyclability within the voltage window of 2–4.5 V. An average voltage of 3.8 V can be obtained due to the strong inductive effect of diphosphate group.",

        "abstract": "Delivery of high energy density in polyanion compound-Na3V2(PO4)3 based on three-electron redox is still challenging because of their controversial multi-electron reaction mechanism and unsatisfactory electrochemical reversibility. Herein, the reversible V4+/V5+ redox (ca. 4.0 V) could be successfully activated in Na4VFe(PO4)3 cathode material through a Na-rich strategy, demonstrating a reversible specific capacity of 154.7mAh g−1 at 0.1C and 90.3mAh g−1 after 800 cycles at 20C, with 80 % of the initial capacity retained. The entire electrochemical reaction undergoes a highly recoverable phase transition by in-situ X-ray diffraction. Impressively, the Na-rich strategy could not only allow Na2 site to be occupied to activate the V4+/V5+ redox pair confirmed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, but also enable Na+ transportation across the generated vacancies rather than synergistic Na+ diffusion. This work provides rational design strategy of multi-electron transfer reaction in high-energy sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "In oxygen-redox intercalation cathodes, voltage hysteresis can be avoided by forming cathode materials with a ‘ribbon’ superstructure in the transition metal layers that suppresses transition metal migration. In conventional intercalation cathodes, alkali metal ions can move in and out of a layered material with the charge being compensated for by reversible reduction and oxidation of the transition metal ions. If the cathode material used in a lithium-ion or sodium-ion battery is alkali-rich, this can increase the battery’s energy density by storing charge on the oxide and the transition metal ions, rather than on the transition metal alone^ 1 – 10 . There is a high voltage associated with oxidation of O^2− during the first charge, but this is not recovered on discharge, resulting in reduced energy density^ 11 . Displacement of transition metal ions into the alkali metal layers has been proposed to explain the first-cycle voltage loss (hysteresis)^ 9 , 12 – 16 . By comparing two closely related intercalation cathodes, Na_0.75[Li_0.25Mn_0.75]O_2 and Na_0.6[Li_0.2Mn_0.8]O_2, here we show that the first-cycle voltage hysteresis is determined by the superstructure in the cathode, specifically the local ordering of lithium and transition metal ions in the transition metal layers. The honeycomb superstructure of Na_0.75[Li_0.25Mn_0.75]O_2, present in almost all oxygen-redox compounds, is lost on charging, driven in part by formation of molecular O_2 inside the solid. The O_2 molecules are cleaved on discharge, reforming O^2−, but the manganese ions have migrated within the plane, changing the coordination around O^2− and lowering the voltage on discharge. The ribbon superstructure in Na_0.6[Li_0.2Mn_0.8]O_2 inhibits manganese disorder and hence O_2 formation, suppressing hysteresis and promoting stable electron holes on O^2− that are revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results show that voltage hysteresis can be avoided in oxygen-redox cathodes by forming materials with a ribbon superstructure in the transition metal layers that suppresses migration of the transition metal.",

Moreover, the capacity retention of CoFe-PBA@PDA after 100 cycles is 14.3% higher than that of the two comparison samples. In addition, the reversible structure of CoFe-PBA@PDA without forming a new phase was verified by in situ X-ray diffraction.

        "abstract": "The solid-state reaction between NaF and VPO4 is widely used to produce Na3V2(PO4)2F3, a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. In the present work, the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction between NaF and VPO4 were investigated, and the effect of preliminary high-energy ball milling (HEBM) was studied using in situ time-resolved synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, in situ transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, etc. The reaction was attributed to a \"dimensional reduction\" formalism; it proceeds quickly with the unilateral diffusion of Na+ and F- ions into VPO4 particles as a limiting stage. The use of HEBM leads to the mechanism corresponding to the third-order reaction model and accelerates the interaction. The rate constant k increases from 3.5 × 10-5 to 3.4 × 10-3 s-1, and diffusion coefficient D increases from 2 × 10-14 to 4 × 10-13 cm2 s-1 when HEBM is used.

Sodium-ion batteries are well positioned to become, in the near future, the energy storage system for stationary applications and light electromobility. However, two main drawbacks feed their underperformance, namely the irreversible sodium consumption during solid electrolyte interphase formation and the low sodiation degree of one of the most promising cathode materials: the P2-type layered oxides.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 is a promising high-voltage cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) and organic sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the poor rate capability, specific capacity, and cycling stability severely hamper it from further development. In this work, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with vanadium nitride (VN) quantum dots encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) nanoflowers (NVP/VN@NC) are manufactured as cathode using in situ nitridation, carbon coating, and structural adjustment. The outer NC layer increases the higher electronic conductivity of NVP. Furthermore, VN quantum dots with high theoretical capacity not only improve the specific capacity of pristine NVP, but also serve as abundant \"pins\" between NVP and NC to strengthen the stability of NVP/VN@NC heterostructure. For Zn-ion storage, these essential characteristics allow NVP/VN@NC to attain a high reversible capacity of 135.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and a capacity retention of 91% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Meanwhile, NVP/VN@NC also demonstrates to be a stable cathode material for SIBs, which can reach a high reversible capacity of 124.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and maintain 92% of initial capacity after 11000 cycles at 5 A g-1.

Herein, a series of high-entropy-doped Na3+xV1.76–xZnx(GaCrAlIn)0.06(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.35, and 0.5) cathodes are systematically prepared with an activated V5+⇌V4+ high-voltage plateau (4.0 V) and elevated discharge capacity, which is derived from the charge compensation of divalent Zn substituting for trivalent V accompanied by extra Na+ input to create an Na-rich phase. A range of in situ/ex situ characterization studies and DFT calculations radically verify the charge conservation mechanism, enhanced bulk conductivity, and robust structural stability. Accordingly, in half-cells, the optimized cathode (x = 0.35) is capable of giving a much-improved discharge capacity (126.8 mA h g–1), reliable cycling stability (97.4%@5000 cycles@40 C), and a competitive energy density (426.1 W h kg–1) at 2.0–4.3 V. Upon reducing the discharge cutoff voltage to 1.4 V, the three-electron reaction (V5+⇌V2+) is entirely activated with superior stability, delivering an unparalleled capacity of 193.4 mA h g–1 with higher energy density (544.3 W h kg–1). Besides, it displays high capacity (126.1 mA h g–1) and energy density (417.2 W h kg–1) in NVPZGCAI-35//hard carbon full-cells at 1.6–4.1 V. Hence, this pioneering high-entropy and Na-rich strategy is above rubies for developing high-energy-density and high-stability sodium-ion batteries.",

The HEO cathode displays excellent sodium-ion storage performance with a capacity of 121 mAh g−1, competitive cycling stability (∼83.8% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 2 C), and enhanced water resistance (capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1 after soaking in water for 2 h and capacity retention of 83% after 200 cycles at 1 C). Moreover, the as-obtained NFCNMT‖hard carbon full cells exhibit superior performance with reversible specific capacity 115 mAh g−1 and approximately ∼73% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy reveal the completely reversible O3 → P3 → O3 structure evolution and suppressed violent changes in lattice parameters owing to the high-entropy design.

        "abstract": "All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) based on sulfide electrolytes are considered a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage.

Cycling-stable ASIBs can be achieved only if the designed cathode can simultaneously address challenges including insufficient interfacial contact, electrochemical and chemical instability between the electrode and electrolyte, and strain/stress during operation , rather than just addressing one or part of these challenges. Chevrel phase Mo6S8 has inherent high electronic conductivity and small volume change during sodiation/desodiation, and is chemically and electrochemically stable with the sulfide electrolyte, and therefore the only challenge of using Mo6S8 as the cathode for ASIBs is the insufficient contact between Mo6S8 and the solid electrolyte (SE). Herein, a thin layer of SE is coated on Mo6S8 using a solution method to achieve an intimate contact between Mo6S8 and the SE. Such a SE-coated Mo6S8 cathode enabled an ASIB with a high cycling performance (500 cycles), even much better than that of the liquid-electrolyte batteries with the Mo6S8 cathode.

        "abstract": "In this study, manganese vacancy and Li-ion are introduced into Na2/3[Ni1/6Mn5/6]O2 to tailor the relationship between the structure and property. Neutron and X-ray diffraction confirm a structural transition from disordering to ordering in the transition-metal layers to form an in-plane honeycomb structure in the designed Na5/6[Ni1/6Li1/6□1/18Mn2/3]O2 (V-NNM, □ = Mn vacancy) material, which, for the first time, benefits from the Mn vacancies in transition-metal sites. Besides, neutron diffraction also uncovers that V-NNM adopts the P2 structure with the P63 space group, different from the P63/mmc space group by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and doped Li ions mainly enter the transition-metal sites in V-NNM. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that V-NNM delivers a reversible specific capacity close to the theoretical value and long-term cycling stability (71.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). V-NNM also exhibits the excellent high-rate performance, such as the reversible capacities of 72.5%, 63.7%, 57.1% and 50.5% relative to the theoretical value at 10 C, 15 C, 20 C and 25 C, respectively, indicating the fast Na-storage. Theoretical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations further validate the structural disorder-to-order transformation, decreased band gap and enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics in V-NNM, which are responsible for the electrochemical performance. In addition, in situ XRD experiments disclose a complete solid-solution reaction layered cathode accompanied by near zero-strain characteristic upon charging and discharging, ensuring the structural integrity and stability, as well as the resulting electrochemical performance.

Layered manganese-based oxides as a prevailing cathode for sodium-ion batteries have been extensively studied, where doping or coating have been demonstrated to improve the electrochemical performance. However, the binder which tends to be the popular PVDF, is revealed to generate swellability upon cycling, leading to electrode material crack and the disconnection with current collectors. For the above issues, in this work, environmentally friendly sodium alginate is utilized as the aqueous binder in conventional layered transition metal oxide cathode P2-Na2/3MnO2 for SIBs. Through credible comparative experiments, sodium alginate is testified to play an essential role in suppressing cracks on the surface of materials, preventing surge in charge transfer resistance and restraining detachment between electrode and current collector. Therefore, sodium alginate is proved to be an ideal binder to match with P2-Na2/3MnO2, where some issues existed before, as promising cathode material with excellent performance, low cost. This study displays that improving battery performance by exploring suitable binder systems can equal or even exceed the performance improvement through modification of material itself.",

        "title": "Regulating electron distribution of P2-type layered oxide cathodes for practical sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "For transition metal oxide materials, high Ni content is an effective method to obtain a high specific capacity. However, the theoretical capacity is determined due to the certain amount of variable charges of transition metal ions. The increased capacity in specific voltage window may attribute to the easier transport of alkali ions, instead of more active elements. Borrowing the theory of Ni-rich materials in LIB, excess Ni elements were added into P2-type layered oxide material to form the Jahn-Teller active Ni3+ ions. About 25%-61% Ni3+ ions can effectively promote de-/intercalation of Na+ ions due to the decreased diffusion energy barrier and increased adsorption energy of Na+. The preferred “Ni-rich” material Na0.67Mn0.45Ni0.22Co0.33O2 (Ni-R1) shows a reversible specific capacity of 114 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 2.0–4.25 V. In addition, it shows an excellent cycle stability, the capacity retention ration is 80% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. The in-depth study proves that, Jahn-Teller active Ni3+ ions can effectively regulate the valence electron distribution of surrounding ions in synthesis stage. However, it will promote Jahn-Teller distortion when the Ni3+ content is increased to 74%, which makes the rate performance deteriorate dramatically. The present work provides a simple and efficient way to increase the capacity in suitable voltage range for application.",

        "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring structural diversity, permanent porosity, and functional versatility, have emerged as promising electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. To date, amorphous polymer, COF, or their composites are mostly explored in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), while their research in other alkali metal ion batteries is still in infancy. This can be due to the challenges that arise from large volume changes, slow diffusion kinetics, and inefficient active site utilization by the large Na+ or K+ ion. Herein, microwave-assisted imide-based 2D COF, TAPB-NDA covalently connected with amine-functionalized carbon nanotubes (TAPB-NDA@CNT) targeting the application in both Li-/Na-ion batteries, is synthesized. As-synthesized, TAPB-NDA@CNT50 displays the good performance as LIB cathode with a specific capacity of ≈138 mAh g-1 at 25 mA g-1, long cycling stability (81.2% retention after 2000 cycles at 300 mA g-1), with excellent reversible capacity retention of ≈79.6%. Similarly, TAPB-NDA@CNT50, when employed in sodium-ion battery (SIB), exhibited 136.7 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 25 mA g-1, retained ≈80% of the reversible capacity after 1000 cycles at 300 mA g-1 and showing excellent rate performance. The structural advantage of TAPB-NDA@CNT will encourage researchers to design COF-based cathodes for the alkali ion batteries.",

Here, we report a microwave-assisted synthesis and characterization of a triazine-based polyimide COF that features dual redox-active sites (-C=O from pyromellitic and -C=N- from triazine) and COF@CNT nanocomposites (COF@CNT-X, where X=10, 30, and 50 wt % of NH2-MWCNT) formed through covalent linking with amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. These composites are evaluated as cathode materials for the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The amine functionalization renders the covalent bond between COF and CNT, improving electronic conductivity, structural rigidity, and long-term stability. The interfacial growth of COF layers on CNTs increases accessible redox-active sites, enhancing sodium diffusion kinetics during sodiation/desodiation. The COF@CNT-50 composite exhibits outstanding Na+ ion storage performance (reversible capacity of 164.3 mAh g-1 at 25 mA g-1) and excellent stability over 1000 cycles at ambient temperature. At elevated temperature (65 °C), it also maintains good capacity and cycle stability. Ex situ XPS analysis confirms the importance of dual active sites in the Na+ diffusion mechanism.

The pore structures (macrostructures, hierarchically meso/macrostructures, and mesostructures), pore sizes (5 ~ 2000 nm), and specific surface areas (26 ~ 158 m 2 g -1 ) of the samples can be readily controlled by tuning the sizes of droplet templates. The resultant hierarchically meso/macropores NVP demonstrates superior sodium storage performances, because its porous single crystal structure owns solid-liquid Na + transmission mode, shortens ion diffusion distance and provides large electrode-electrolyte contact area, greatly facilitating fast ionic transport. We believe the presented method will supply a novel avenue to prepare porous single crystal structured materials for anticipative applications.",

        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is regarded as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its low cost, easy manufacture, environmental purity, high structural stability, unique three-dimensional Na-ion diffusion channels, and appropriate working voltage. However, for NFPP, the low conductivity of electrons and ions limits their capacity and power density. The generation of NaFeP2O7 and NaFePO4 inhibits the diffusion of sodium ions and reduces reversible capacity and rate performance during the manufacturing process in synthesis methods. Herein, we report an entropy-driven approach to enhance the electronic conductivity and, concurrently, phase purity of NFPP as the superior cathode in sodium-ion batteries. This approach was realized via Ti ions substituting different ratios of Fe-occupied sites in the NFPP lattice (denoted as NTFPP-X, T is the Ti in the lattice, X is the ratio of Ti-substitution) with the configurational entropic increment of the lattice structures from 0.68 R to 0.79 R. Specifically, 5% Ti-substituted lattice (NTFPP-0.05) inducing entropic augmentation not only improves the electronic conductivity from 7.1 × 10-2 S/m to 8.6 × 10-2 S/m but also generates the pure-phase of NFPP (suppressing the impure phases of the NaFeP2O7 and NaFePO4) of the lattice structure, which is validated by a series of characterizations, including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT). Benefiting from the Ti replacement in the lattice, the optimal NTFPP-0.05 composite shows a high first discharge capacity (118.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C), superior rate performance (70.5 mAh g-1 at 10 C), and excellent long cycling life (1200 cycles at 10 C with capacity retention of 86.9%). This research proposes a new entropy-driven approach to improve the electrochemical performance of NFPP and reports a low-cost, ultrastable, and high-rate cathode material of NTFPP-0.05 for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Developing high-voltage cathode materials is critical for sodium-ion batteries to boost energy density. NASICON (Na super-ionic conductor)-structured Nax MnM(PO4 )3 materials (M represents transition metal) have drawn increasing attention due to their features of robust crystal framework, low cost, as well as high voltage based on Mn4+ /Mn3+ and Mn3+ /Mn2+ redox couples. However, full activation of Mn4+ /Mn3+ redox couple within NASICON framework is still a great challenge. Herein, a novel NASICON-type Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 material with highly reversible Mn4+ /Mn3+ redox reaction is discovered. It proceeds a two-step reaction with voltage platforms centered at 4.15 and 3.52 V versus Na+ /Na, delivering a capacity of 108.4 mA h g-1 . The Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 cathode also exhibits long durability over 500 cycles and impressive rate capability up to 10 C. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test shows fast Na diffusivity which is further verified by density functional theory calculations. The high electrochemical activity derives from the 3D robust framework structure, fast kinetics, and pseudocapacitive contribution. The sodium storage mechanism of the Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 cathode is deeply studied by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing that both solid-solution and two-phase reactions are involved in the Na+ ions extraction/insertion process.",

Consequently, it delivers an excellent specific capacity of 243.3 mAh g-1 over a wide voltage range of 2.0 V to 4.5 V, which can be attributed to La3+ doping that promotes oxidation of O2- to peroxide O2 n- (n<2) during charge.",

Nevertheless, the permanent changes in structure accompanied by sodium extraction/insertion restrict their capacity and retention in cycles.

In this paper, a simple high-temperature solid-state approach is used to create Ni-rich NaNi2/3Mn1/6Fe1/6O2 materials aiming to achieve high capacity. Systematic researches are conducted through a combination of electrochemical measurements and structural characterization.

In the voltage range of 1.5–4.2 V, this sample demonstrates an impressive initial discharge capacity of 226 mAh/g at a rate of 0.2 C. Furthermore, even after 100 cycles, it still maintains a capacity retention of approximately 76 %, exhibiting outstanding cycling stability.

Herein for the first time we report new graphene wrapped Na6.24Fe4.88(P2O7)4 composite nanofibers (NFPO@C@rGO) made from electrospinning for cathodes of SIBs to achieve an even higher performance with a highly stable discharge capacity of ∼99 mA h g-1 at a current density of 40 mA g-1 after 320 cycles, which is 1.6 times higher than that of the pristine Na6.24Fe4.88(P2O7)4 (NFPO@C) composite. In particular, the NFPO@C@rGO composite cathode exhibits an even higher discharge rate capacity of ∼53.9 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1280 mA g-1 (11C) than that of ∼40 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1100 mA g-1 (9.4C) for the reported best high discharge rate performance of NFPO. The superior cycling and high rate capability are attributed to the unique spinning vein fiber based porous structure offering a good intimate contact between NFPO@C and graphene for great electronic conductivity, fast ionic transport, a large reaction surface and a strong solid structure preventing collapse during cycling, thus achieving a high rate discharge performance and high cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "To address the structural defects and poor electrical conductivity of conventional Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) samples, in this study, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) and nickel hexacyanoferrate epitaxially grown with iron hexacyanoferrate (Ni@FeHCF-X) series of samples were successfully synthesized by co-precipitation combined with epitaxial growth technique, and their structural and electrochemical properties were systematically characterized. X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) results show that all the samples maintain a cubic crystal system structure, and the diffraction peaks of the (220) and (400) crystal planes are shifted to a lower angle with the epitaxial growth of ferric hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF). The successful embedding of Fe was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement data. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that the samples are in a cubic morphology, and the surfaces gradually become rounded from sharp to rounded with the increase of the Fe content. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analyses confirm the successful construction of the core-shell structure and the homogeneous distribution of the elements. Electrochemical testing showed that the Ni@FeHCF-X samples exhibited higher specific capacities and superior rate performance compared to NiHCF, particularly the Ni@FeHCF-4 sample, which delivered a high specific capacity of 73.4 mAh·g⁻¹ at a current density of 100 mA·g⁻¹, significantly outperforming the 38.2 mAh·g⁻¹ achieved by NiHCF. Additionally, the capacity retention rate of Ni@FeHCF-4 reached 42.16 %. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further confirmed the reduced charge transfer resistance and enhanced reversibility of the electrochemical reactions in the Ni@FeHCF-X samples. These results demonstrate that Ni@FeHCF-4 significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of the samples in aqueous sodium-ion battery, providing new insights into the design of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Polymer electrolytes are considered as promising candidates to power a multitude of high safety level and high energy density solid-state batteries. However, commercial applications of polymer electrolyte-based solid-state batteries are still significantly limited by the low room-temperature ionic conductivity, poor mechanical properties as well as weak interfacial stability between electrode and electrolyte, especially for room-temperature solid-state batteries. In this study, a novel poly (vinylene carbonate)-based composite polymer electrolyte (PVC-CPE) prepared by a facile in situ solidification method, is reported for the first time to realize high performances of solid-state sodium batteries at room temperature. This in situ solidified PVC-CPE possesses superior room-temperature ionic conductivity (0.12 mS cm-1), high Na+ transference number (t_(〖Na〗^+ )= 0.60), wide electrochemical window (up to 5.3 V, vs. Na+/Na) and enhanced electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability. Notably, the composite cathode NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (c-NFM) is designed through in situ growth of polymer electrolyte inside the electrode to decrease interfacial resistance and facilitate effective ion transport in electrode/electrolyte interfaces. It is demonstrated that the solid-state c-NFM/PVC-CPE/Na battery assembled by one-step in situ solidification method exhibits remarkably enhanced cell performances at room temperature compared with a reference NFM/PVC-CPE/Na assembled through a conventional ex situ method. The battery delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 104.2 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of about 86.8% after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, and superior rate performance with discharge specific capacity of 80.2 mAh g-1 at 1 C. This study suggests that PVC-CPE is a very promising electrolyte for solid-state sodium batteries. This work also provides a new strategy for design of high performance polymer electrolytes for other solid-state rechargeable batteries to realize high safety and considerable electrochemical performance at room temperature.",

Both galvanostatic and voltammetric tests reveal a superior electrochemical behavior for the Ni-free sample, which delivers 94 mA h g-1 at 5C. This excellent performance is associated with a good kinetic response in terms of low charge and discharge hysteresis, high Na+ diffusivity, and low cell resistance. Ex-situ measurements evidenced the combined contribution of both the reversible electrolyte insertion and the formation of peroxo species. These advantageous properties allow this electrode to reach a remarkable behavior when is cycled either to low temperatures or high rates.",

This work reports two three‐dimensional (3D) RAPs as stable organic cathodes in Na‐ion batteries (NIBs) and K‐ion batteries (KIBs). Carbonyl functional groups are incorporated into the repeating units of the RAPs by the polycondensation of Tetrakis(4‐aminophenyl)methane and two different dianhydrides. The RAPs with interconnected 3D extended conjugation structures undergo multi‐electron redox reactions and exhibit high performance in both NIBs and KIBs in terms of long cycle life (up to 8000 cycles) and fast charging capability (up to 2 A g‐1). The results demonstrate that developing 3D RAPs is an effective strategy to achieve high‐performance, affordable, and sustainable NIBs and KIBs.",

        "title": "Eliminating Charge Transfer at Cathode-Electrolyte Interface for Ultrafast Kinetics in Na-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries suffer from kinetic problems stemming from sluggish ion transport across the electrode-electrolyte interface, causing rapid energy decay during fast-charging or low-temperature operation. One exciting prospect to enhance kinetics is constructing neuron-like electrodes that emulate fast signal transmission in a nervous system. It has been considered that these bioinspired designs enhance electron/ion transport of the electrodes through carbon networks. However, whether they can avoid sluggish charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface remains unknown. By connecting the openings of carbon nanotubes with the surface of carbon-coated Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathode nanoparticles, here we use carbon nanotubes to trap Na+ ions released from the nanoparticles during charge. Therefore, Na+ movement is confined only inside the neuron-like cathode, eliminating ion transport between the electrolyte and cathode, which has been scarcely achieved in conventional batteries. As a result, a 14-fold reduction in interfacial charge transfer resistance is achieved when compared to unmodified cathodes, leading to superior fast-charging performance and excellent cyclability up to 200C, and surprisingly, reversible operation at low temperatures down to -60 °C without electrolyte modification, surpassing other Na3V2O2(PO4)2F-based batteries reported to date. As battery operation has relied on charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface for over 200 years, our approach departs from this traditional ion transport paradigm, paving the way for building better batteries that work under harsh conditions.",

However, the long-term cycle stability of P3-type cathodes is still not satisfactory. In this work, we design a new quaternary manganese-iron-based cathode material (P3-Na_0.54Mn_0.64Fe_0.16Mg_0.1Cu_0.1O_2) by Cu substitution. The strong covalent Cu–O bonds improve the structural stability and the reversibility of O redox during charge and discharge processes. Cu substitution also mitigates the structure change with less unit cell volume variation, and improves the Na-ion transport kinetics effectively. As a result, NMFMC delivers much improved cycling stability and rate capability compared with NMFM. It reveals that the charge compensation of NMFMC is mainly contributed by Mn^3+/4+, Fe^3+/3.5+ and O^2−/− during the charge and discharge processes, and Cu substitution can also enhance the activity and reversibility of Fe redox. This strategy provides a new pathway toward improving the stability and O redox reversibility of P3-type cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

It is reported that dopant aggregation effectively boosts the cyclability of a Mg‐doped P2‐type layered cathode (Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2). Experimental characterization and calculation consistently reveal that randomly distributed Mg dopants tend to segregate into the Na‐layer during high‐voltage cycling, leading to the formation of high‐density precipitates. Intriguingly, such Mg‐enriched precipitates, acting as 3D network pillars, can further enhance a material's mechanical strength, suppress cracking, and consequently benefit cyclability. This work not only deepens the understanding on dopant evolution but also offers a conceptually new approach by utilizing precipitation strengthening design to counter cracking related degradation and improve high‐voltage cyclability of layered cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nanoconfinement is a promising strategy in chemistry enabling increased reaction rates, enhanced selectivity, and stabilized reactive species. Sulfur's abundance and highly reversible two‐electron transfer mechanism have fueled research on sulfur‐based electrochemical energy storage. However, the formation of soluble polysulfides, poor reaction kinetics, and low sulfur utilization are current bottlenecks for broader practical application. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to confine sulfur species in a nanostructured hybrid sulfur‐carbon material. A microporous sulfur‐rich carbon is produced from sustainable natural precursors via inverse vulcanization and condensation. The material exhibits a unique structure with sulfur anchored to the conductive carbon matrix and physically confined in ultra‐micropores. The structure promotes Na+ ion transport through micropores and electron transport through the carbon matrix, while effectively immobilizing sulfur species in the nanoconfined environment, fostering a quasi‐solid‐state redox reaction with sodium. This translates to ≈99% utilization of the 2e− reduction of sulfur and the highest reported capacity for a room temperature Na−S electrochemical system, with high rate capability, coulombic efficiency, and long‐term stability. This study offers an innovative approach toward understanding the key physicochemical properties of sulfurcarbon nanohybrid materials, enabling the development of high‐performance cathode materials for room‐temperature Na‐S batteries with efficient sulfur utilization.",

Herein, N-doped dual-carbon decoration strategy is proposed to solve the above problems of NVP. The N-doped double carbon-wrapped NVP (NVP/NC@CNTs) is successfully synthesized via introducing highly conductive CNTs and carbonization of N-rich urea. The results indicate that the NVP/NC@10 %CNTs composites exhibit a high initial reversible capacity of 106.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, with have high rate capability (94.8 mAh g−1 at 5C) and excellent capacity retention at high rates (98.9 % capacity retention at 20C after 2000 cycles). Additionally, the tests of multiple methods (CV, EIS and GITT) exhibit significant improvement in the kinetic properties. More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that N-doped carbon layers combined with CNTs can significantly reduce the energy bandwidths of the carbon layers and enhance the adsorption energy for Na+, thus increasing the electrical conductivity of the carbon layers and lowering the diffusion energy barrier for Na+. The symmetric full cells are assembled and measured its electrochemical performance. The cells exhibit good compatibility and excellent cycling stability. The excellent performance of NVP/NC@10 %CNTs composites can be attributed to the defects and active site generation of N-doped double carbon co-modified NVP composites, resulting in increased electronic conductivity and diffusion rate of sodium ions.",

        "title": "New insights on suppressing oxygen redox in layered oxide cathode of sodium-ion batteries with ribbon superstructure and solid-solution behavior",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are proved as one of the most acceptable candidates for replacing lithium-ion batteries in some fields by virtue of a similar “rocking chair” mechanism and the abundance of sodium. The voltage, rate performance, and energy density of these batteries are mainly determined by the cathodes. Hence, a Li-Ni-Co co-substituted P2-Na0.67[Li0.1(Mn0.7Ni0.2Co0.1)0.9]O2 (NLMNC) with ribbon superstructure is prepared with the aim of multi-ion synergistic modification. Owing to the addition of Ni and Co, the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn can be suppressed corresponding with the improved structural stability, and a little bit of oxygen redox activities is triggered. When with the substitution of 10% Li, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of NLMNC show the ribbon superstructure at about 21° and 22°. The smooth charge/discharge profiles of the NLMNC cathode exhibit the solid-solution reaction. In addition, the platform at high voltage disappears corresponding with the existing oxygen redox activities being suppressed which may be related to the ribbon superstructure and the promotion of the Ni redox. Such NLMNC cathode can deliver a reversible discharge capacity of 123.5 mA h g–1 at 10 mA g–1. Even if the current density increases to 500 mA g–1, a reversible discharge capacity of 112.8 mA h g–1 still can be obtained. The distinguished cycling stability is related to the reversible migration of Li+ between the metal oxide layer and the interlayer and low volume change during cycling. It is also needing to be mentioned that the capacity retention of NLMNC cathode is about 94.4% (based on the highest discharge capacity) after 100 cycles. This work presents an effective route to develop high-performance cathodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "P-type layered oxide is a promising cathode candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but faces the challenge of simultaneously realizing high rate capability and long cycle life. Herein, Co-substituted Nax MnO2 nanosheets with tunable P2/P3 biphase structures are synthesized by a novel dealloying-annealing strategy. The optimized P2/P3-Na0.67 Mn0.64 Co0.30 Al0.06 O2 cathode delivers an excellent rate capability of 83 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 1700 mA g-1 (10 C), and an outstanding cycling stability over 500 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 . This excellent performance is attributed to the unique P2/P3 biphases with stable crystal structures and fast Na+ diffusion between open prismatic Na sites. Moreover, operando X-ray diffraction is applied to explore the structural evolution of Na0.67 Mn0.64 Co0.30 Al0.06 O2 during the Na+ extraction/insertion processes, and the P2-P2' phase transition is effectively suppressed. Operando Raman technique is utilized to explore the structural superiority of P2/P3 biphase cathode compared with pure P2 or P3 phase. This work highlights precisely tailoring the phase composition as an effective strategy to design advanced cathode materials for SIBs.",

It can maintain over 92 % capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C. It also has excellent rate performance with a specific capacity of 103.4mAg−1 at 20 C.

        "abstract": "Tunnel-type manganese-based oxide cathodes of sodium-ion batteries have attracted enormous attentions due to their advantages of low cost, good endurance to the ambient air and superior cycling stability. However, they still suffer from successive phase transitions and sluggish kinetics, which hampers their further practical applications. Herein, we introduce Cu2+ and F− into the typical tunnel material Na0.44MnO2 to improve the abovementioned shortages for the first time. As a result, the ultra-stable cycling performance (capacity retentions of 98.9% after 150 cycles at 120 mA/g and 98.0% after 200 cycles at 360 mA/g) and enhanced Na+ diffusion rate can be achieved thanks to the synergistic effect of anion-cation co-doping. More importantly, with the aid of experiments and theoretical calculations, we unequivocally shed light on the role of Cu2+ and F−, respectively. Besides, the underlying practical value of the optimal case is assessed in the full cell. This work provides a universal perspective for designing oxide cathodes with respectable performance, and paves a new way to promote the practical applications of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The search for suitable electrode materials for sodium storage in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) poses significant challenges. Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) has emerged as a promising candidate among various cathode materials due to its distinct three-dimensional tunnel structure, which facilitates Na+ diffusion and governs structural stress fluctuations during Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. However, NMO faces obstacles such as limited electronic conductivity, lattice distortion induced by the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ during cycling, and Mn3+ disproportionation leading to material dissolution, which affects cycling durability. To overcome these problems, Na0.44MnO2/polypyrrole (NMO/PPy) composites were fabricated through surface modification of the conductive PPy using an ultrasonically assisted dispersion method. Experimental results show that NMO/PPy with a 7 wt% PPy content exhibits superior sodium storage capabilities. Specifically, at a current density of 0.5C, the initial specific discharge capacity reaches 135.2 mA h g-1, a 12.1% increase over pristine NMO, with a capacity retention of 94.5% after 100 cycles. Of particular note is a capacity retention of 82% after 500 cycles at 1C, attributed to the PPy coating, which suppresses Mn3+ side reactions, enhances the structural stability and electronic conductivity of NMO, and accelerates Na+ diffusion. These results suggest that the use of conductive polymer coatings represents a simple and effective strategy to improve the sodium storage capacity of NMO, paving the way for the further development of high-performance SIB cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Both high operation voltage and theoretical capacity promise polyanion‐type fluorophosphate Na3V2(PO4)2O2F as a competitive cathode toward high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, the intrinsic low kinetic characteristics seriously influence its high‐power property and service life. To well address this, a creative tiny high‐entropy (HE) doping methodology is purposefully developed to fabricate nanoscale Na3V1.94(Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu)0.06(PO4)3O2F (NVPOF‐HE) as the advanced cathode materials for SIBs. The grain refinement effect induced by collaborative regulations from polyvinyl pyrrolidone and tiny HE heteroatomic doping is reasonably proposed for nanosizing particle dimension of NVPOF‐HE. Systematic experiments and theoretical calculations authenticate that the HE doping efficiently promotes the electronic/ionic transport and high‐voltage capacity contribution, and weakens the lattice expansion over Na+‐(de)intercalation processes. Thanks to the appealing virtues mentioned here, the nano NVPOF‐HE, compared to single‐ion/dual‐ion/triple‐ion doped cases, achieves even better Na+‐storage performance in terms of both high‐rate capacities and long‐term cycling stability. Furthermore, the NVPOF‐HE assembled full SIBs deliver a high materials‐level energy density of 463 Wh kg−1 and electrochemical stability of ≈93.8% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 C rate. More essentially, the fundamental insights gained here provide a significant scientific and technological advancement in high‐performance and durable polyanionic cathodes toward next‐generation SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Among electroanalytical techniques, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) offers the unique advantage of a high degree of frequency resolution. This enables EIS to readily deconvolute between the capacitive, resistive, and diffusional processes that underlie electrochemical devices. Here, we report the measurement of impedance spectra of individual, pseudocapacitive nanoparticles. We chose Prussian blue as our model system, as it couples an electron-transfer reaction with sodium ion intercalation—processes which, while intrinsically convoluted, can be readily resolved using EIS. We used a scanning electrochemical cell microscope (SECCM) to isolate single Prussian blue particles in a microdroplet and measured their impedance spectra using the multi-sine, fast Fourier transform technique. In doing so, we were able to extract the exchange current density and sodium ion diffusivity for each particle, which respectively inform on their electronic and ionic conductivities. Surprisingly, these parameters vary by over an order of magnitude between particles and are not correlated to particle size nor to each other. The implication of this apparent heterogeneity is that in a hypothetical battery cathode, one active particle may transfer electrons 10 times faster than its neighbor; another may suffer from sluggish sodium ion transport and have restricted charging rate capabilities compared to a better-performing particle elsewhere in the same electrode. Our results inform on this intrinsic heterogeneity while demonstrating the utility of EIS in future single-particle studies.",

        "abstract": "P2-type manganese-based layered oxide is regarded as a promising candidate cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, when non-sodium-containing materials are used as the anode in a full cell, irreversible interfacial reactions occurring in non-sodium-containing anodes will significantly consume active Na^+ ions in P2-type manganese-based oxides, leading to rapid capacity decay. In this work, the introduction of sodium formate is proposed as a sodium compensation additive into P2-type manganese-based layered oxide (Na_0.66Ni_0.26Zn_0.07Mn_0.67O_2, NNZMO). The decomposition products of sodium formate can also act as a modifier for the surface of NNZMO particles. The results show that sodium formate added to NNZMO can significantly improve cycling performance for both the half cell and full cell. The capacity retention of the NNZMO cathode with 15 wt.% sodium formate is 88.6% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g^–1 in a half cell, much higher than that (81.3%) of the NNZMO cathode without sodium formate. The full cell, based on a P2-type layered NNZMO cathode and a hard carbon anode with HCOONa as a sodium compensation additive, can provide 95.7 mAh g^–1 first-cycle discharge specific capacity and 81.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g^–1, much higher than those (71.8 mAh g^–1 and 55.7%) of the NNZMO cathode without sodium formate. This sodium compensation strategy provides an effective way to increase the discharge specific capacity and operational stability of the full cell and is also expected to be applicable to other cathode materials.

The XANES detections affirm that substituting Ni/O with Al/F intends to augment the amount of highly active Mn3+ cations in cathodes, making more contributions on specific capacities for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Besides, this co-doping treatment would disorder the transition metal ionic arrangements of cathodes, disrupting long-range Jahn-Teller effects and impeding other undesired phases generation. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, our designed Na2/3Ni0.23Al0.1Mn2/3O1.95F0.05 (NAF) cathodes show a delivered capacity as high as 142.0 mAh g\n                     −1 (0.2C), and an impressive capacity retention of 86.7 % after all cycling. The in-situ XRD detections reveal no apparent O2 phase peaks emerge until 4.23 V upon deep Na+ extraction from NAF. This work provides a key understanding toward cation/anion co-doping effects, opening up a useful avenue for rational design of practical P2-type cathodes for SIBs.",

In this study, the working mechanism of Mg and Ti dopants in mitigating degradation was investigated through the use of first-principles calculations. More specifically, the effects of each dopant in suppressing the phase transition, lattice expansion and shrinkage, and possible oxygen generation during repeated charging and discharging processes were validated. The results showed that the pristine structure exhibits irreversible O3-P3 phase transition after 75% desodiation, while doping with Mg or Ti effectively delays this transition. In addition, the change in lattice parameters as well as in the volume during desodiation was investigated. It was found that both dopants reduce the magnitude of structural change, which potentially improves the structural stability. Furthermore, introducing the dopants increases the thickness of the Na diffusion channel, possibly leading to an enhanced rate capability. Finally, the oxygen atomic charge variation during charging indicated that doping can enhance the oxygen stability by reducing the initial charge of oxygen as well as its increase during desodiation.",

This new cathode material delivers high discharge capacities of 164 mA g–1 at 0.1 C and 68 mAh g–1 at a very high rate of 86 C, demonstrating an outstanding high rate capability. Ex situ and operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction were used to reveal the detailed structural evolution of the cathode upon cycling.

        "title": "Determining Factors in Triggering Hysteretic Oxygen Capacities in Lithium-Excess Sodium Layered Oxides.",
        "abstract": "Oxygen redox (OR) reactions in sodium layered oxide cathodes have been studied intensively to harness their full potential in achieving high energy density for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, OR triggers a large hysteretic voltage during discharge after the first charge process for OR-based oxides, and its intrinsic origin is unclear. Therefore, in this study, an in-depth reinvestigation on the fundamentals of the reaction mechanism in Na[Li1/3Mn2/3]O2 with a Mn/Li ratio (R) of 2 was performed to determine the factors that polarize the OR activity and to provide design rules leading to nonhysteretic oxygen capacity using first-principles calculations. Based on thermodynamic energies, the O2-/O22- and O2-/On- conditions reveal the monophasic (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 4/6) and biphasic (4/6 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) reactions in Na1-x[Li2/6Mn4/6]O2, but each stability at x = 5/6 is observed differently. The O-O bond population elucidates that the formation of an interlayer O-O dimer is a critical factor in triggering hysteretic oxygen capacity, whereas that in a mixed layer provides nonhysteretic oxygen capacity after the first charge. In addition, the migration of Li into the 4h site in the Na metallic layer contributes less to the occurrence of voltage hysteresis because of the suppression of the interlayer O-O dimer. These results are clearly elucidated using the combined-phase mixing enthalpies and chemical potentials during the biphasic reaction. To compare the Mn oxide with R = 2, Na1-x[Li1/6Mn5/6]O2 tuned with R = 5 was investigated using the same procedure, and all the impeding factors in restraining the nonhysteretic OR were not observed. Herein, we suggest two strategies based on three types of OR models: (i) exploiting the migration of Li ions for the suppression of the interlayer O-O dimer and (ii) modulating the Mn/Li ratio for controlling the OR participation, which provides an exciting direction for nonhysteretic oxygen capacities for SIBs and lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have recently aroused the interest of industries as possible replacements for lithium-ion batteries in some areas. With their high theoretical capacities and competitive prices, P2-type layered oxides (NaxTMO2) are among the obvious choices in terms of cathode materials. On the other hand, many of these materials are unstable in air due to their reactivity toward water and carbon dioxide. Here, Na0.67Mn0.9Ni0.1O2 (NMNO), one of such materials, has been synthesized by a classic sol–gel method and then exposed to air for several weeks as a way to allow a simple and reproducible transition toward a Na-rich birnessite phase. The transition between the anhydrous P2 to the hydrated birnessite structure has been followed via periodic XRD analyses, as well as neutron diffraction ones. Extensive electrochemical characterizations of both pristine NMNO and the air-exposed one vs sodium in organic medium showed comparable performances, with capacities fading from 140 to 60 mAh g–1 in around 100 cycles. Structural evolution of the air-exposed NMNO has been investigated both with ex situ synchrotron XRD and Raman. Finally, DFT analyses showed similar charge compensation mechanisms between P2 and birnessite phases, providing a reason for the similarities between the electrochemical properties of both materials.",

        "abstract": "Conspectus Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are ubiquitous in all modern portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops as well as for powering hybrid electric vehicles and other large-scale devices. Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), which possess a similar cell configuration and working mechanism, have already been proven as ideal alternatives for large-scale energy storage systems. The advantages of NIBs are as follows. First, sodium resources are abundantly distributed in the earth’s crust. Second, high-performance NIB cathode materials can be fabricated by using solely inexpensive and noncritical transition metals such as manganese and iron, which further reduces the cost of the required raw materials. Recently, the unprecedented demand for lithium and other critical minerals has driven the cost of these primary raw materials (which are utilized in LIBs) to a historic high and thus triggered the commercialization of NIBs. Sodium layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, TM = transition metal/s), such as Mn-based sodium layered oxides, represent an important family of cathode materials with the potential to reduce costs, increase energy density and cycling stability, and improve the safety of NIBs for large-scale energy storage. However, these layered oxides face several key challenges, including irreversible phase transformations during cycling, poor air stability, complex charge-compensation mechanisms, and relatively high cost of the full cell compared to LiFePO4-based LIBs. Our work has focused on the techno-economic analysis, the degradation mechanism of NaxTMO2 upon cycling and air exposure, and the development of effective strategies to improve their electrochemical performances and air stability. Correlating structure–performance relationships and establishing general design strategies of NaxTMO2 must be considered for the commercialization of NIBs. In this Account, we discuss the recent progress in the development of air-stable, electrochemically stable, and cost-effective NaxTMO2. The favorable redox-active cations for NaxTMO2 are emphasized in terms of abundance, cost, supply, and energy density. Different working mechanisms related to NaxTMO2 are summarized, including the electrochemical reversibility, the main structural transformations during the charge and discharge processes, and the charge-compensation mechanisms that accompany the (de)intercalation of Na+ ions, followed by discussions to improve the stability toward ambient air and upon cycling. Then the techno-economics are presented, with an emphasis on cathodes with different chemical compositions, cost breakdown of battery packs, and Na deficiency, factors that are critical to the large-scale implementation. Finally, this Account concludes with an overview of the remaining challenges and new opportunities concerning the practical applications of NaxTMO2, with an emphasis on the cost, large-scale fabrication capability, and electrochemical performance.",

Additionally, they exhibit unsatisfactory stability when exposed to water for extended periods. To address these challenges, we propose a Cu/Ti co-doped P3-type cathode material (Na0.67Ni0.3Cu0.03Mn0.6Ti0.07O2), which effectively mitigates Na+/vacancy ordering and suppresses P3-O3 phase transitions at high voltages. As a result, the as-prepared sample exhibited outstanding cyclic performance, with 81.9% retention after 500 cycles within 2.5–4.15 V, and 75.7% retention after 300 cycles within 2.5–4.25 V. Meanwhile, it demonstrates enhanced Na+ transport kinetics during desodiation/sodiation and reduced growth of charge transfer impedance (R\n                     ct) after various cycles. Furthermore, the sample showed superb stability against water, exhibiting no discernible degradation in structure, morphology, or electrochemical performance.

        "abstract": "Ultralow‐concentration ether electrolytes hold great promise for cost‐effective sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), while their inferior cycle stability under high voltages remains an awkward challenge. Herein, ultralow‐concentration diglyme (G2)‐based electrolytes with single sodium salt are found to manifest high‐rate capability when employed for high‐voltage Na3(VOPO4)2F (NVOPF) cathode, but their specific capacity rapidly depletes to exhaustion during long‐term cycling. To address this issue, trace NaBF4 (0.03 m) as electrolyte additive is introduced, which minimally affects ion conductivity of the pristine electrolyte, yet weakens the coordination between Na+ ions and G2 molecules. This allows more PF6− to enter the solvation sheath of Na+ ions, forming a more stable cathode electrolyte interphase and enhancing the cycle performance without sacrificing high‐rate performance (up to 20 C). As a result, the trace NaBF4 modulated G2‐based electrolyte enables the NVOPF cathode to cycle steadily, with a capacity retention of 94.2% over 1000 cycles at a low rate of 1 C. This work provides valuable insights into the modulation of ultralow‐concentration ether electrolytes for use in durable high‐voltage SIBs.",

In this study, we present tetra-lithium and sodium salts with the generic formulae: A4-Ph-CH3P and A4-Ph-PhP, wherein A = Li, Na; Ph-CH3P = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-phenylene bis(methylphosphinate); Ph-PhP = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-phenylene bis(phenylphosphinate), as novel alkali-ion reservoir cathode materials.

Theoretical calculations provide further insight into the electrochemical activity of the Li/Na-phenolate groups, as well as the enhanced electron affinity resulting from -phenyl and -Na substitutions. Additionally, Na4-Ph-PhP displays two distinct charge–discharge plateaus at approximately 2.2 V and 2.7 V, and 2.0 V and 2.5 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively, and demonstrates stable cycling performance, with 100 cycles at a rate of 0.1C and an impressive 1000 cycles at 1C.

FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the characteristic peak of the H2VOPO4 precursor (at 797 cm−1) disappeared after calcination and a characteristic peak representing ε-VOPO4 was captured at 914 cm−1. Furthermore, the XPS results showed that the V in the prepared ε-VOPO4 was mainly +5 valence. In order to further evaluate the potential of ε-VOPO4 as an energy storage material, it was applied as cathode material in sodium ion battery system. Electrochemical tests have demonstrated that ε-VOPO4 has satisfactory electrochemical performance as cathode material for sodium ion batteries. The initial capacities of ε-VOPO4 electrode materials reached 162.3, 135.1, 86.7, 51.4, and 29.7 mAh g−1 at 0.05, 0.2, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively, and the long-cycle performance results showed that the electrochemical stability was still superior after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C. Meanwhile, the density functional theory calculation shows that the optimized lattice constants (a = 7.279 Å, b = 6.896 Å and c = 7.268 Å) are in good agreement with the experimental data. Notably, the experimental ε-VOPO4 material has a higher voltage plateau than the theoretical calculation, which shows the potential advantage of ε-VOPO4 as a new generation electrode material for high energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Layered cathode materials based on oxygen redox are of great significance for the realization of high energy density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) that meet the demands of future-oriented energy storage technique. However, the conventional P2-type natrium-poor cathode Na0.67Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 is unable to perform oxygen redox at high voltage. In this work, the multiple substitution of Mg, Ti, and Li in the layered cathode of P2-type is investigated. It has been proved experimentally and theoretically that Li balances the charge imbalance caused by Ti substitution, reduces the c-axis spacing and improves the structure and cycle stability. Meanwhile, Mg and Ti activate and promote the redox reaction of lattice oxygen, stabilize the material structure, and inhibit the loss of active substances caused by transition-metal dissolution. In-situ X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the O2 phase does not appear in the whole range of de-/sodiation and that the volume change is small. After 100 cycles of 2–4.5 V, the capacity is maintained to 93.6%, and the initial capacity of 0.1 C is 159.3 mAh/g. Taking a broader view, this study provides a possible design thought for the development of SIB cathode materials with optimized anionic activity as well as excellent structural stability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries, as an attractive option for large-scale energy storage, still face the problems of low energy density and unsatisfactory rate performance. Among various cathodes, the tunnel-type Na0.44MnO2 with large S-shaped Na+ transport tunnels is one of the promising cathode materials for fast and robust sodium-ion storage, yet suffering from Mn dissolution and structural collapse. Herein, a Na-rich layered oxide Na2TiO3 is first constructed as a multifunctional coating layer on the surface of the Na0.44MnO2 nanorod. Na2TiO3 not only acts as an Na+ reservoir, but also serves as a protective layer to prevent Na0.44MnO2 from electrolyte etching. Besides, the derived Ti-doped Na0.44MnO2 transition layer supplies additional Na+ diffusion pathways along the radial direction of the nanorod with a short migration distance. The optimized 3 wt % Na2TiO3-coated Na0.44MnO2 exhibits enhanced an initial capacity of 127 mAh g-1 at 2-4.5 V. In addition, it shows an ultra-high capacitive-like capacity ratio of 96.7%, hence delivering an excellent rate performance of 80.2 mAh g-1 at 20C. Long-term cycling tests indicate splendid stability against high voltage, achieving 97.7% capacity retention at 20C after 900 cycles. This work provides an effective strategy to improve the rate performance and high-voltage stability of Na0.44MnO2 for high energy and power density batteries.",

        "abstract": "Stabilizing Na+ accessibility at high voltage and accelerating Na+ diffusivity are pressing issues to further enhance the energy density of the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, by taking a V/Cr solid-solution MXene as a precursor, a facile in-situ reactive transformation strategy to embed Cr-substituted NVP (NVCP) nanocrystals in a dual-carbon network is proposed. Particularly, the substituted Cr atom triggers the accessibility of additional Na+ in NVCP, which is demonstrated by an additional reversible redox plateau at 4.0 V even under extreme conditions. More importantly, the Cr atom alters the Na+ ordering at the Na2 sites with an additional intermediate phase formation during charging/discharging, thus reducing the energy barriers for Na+ migration. As a result, Na+ diffusivity in NVCP accelerates to 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of NVP. Eventually, the NVCP cathode exhibits extraordinarily high-rate capability (78 mA g-1 at 200 C and 68975 W kg-1), outstanding cycle stability (over 1500 cycles at 10 C), excellent low-temperature property, and full cell performance.",

To solve this problem, we partially substitute Ni2+ in O3-type NaNi0.45Mn0.25Ti0.3O2 by Co3+. NaNi0.45Mn0.25Ti0.3O2 with co-substitution possesses an expanded interlayer and exhibits higher rate capability, as well as cyclic stability, compared with the pristine cathode in 2.0-4.4 V. The optimal NaNi0.4Mn0.25Ti0.3Co0.05O2 delivers discharge capacities of 180 and 80 mA  h  g-1 at 10 and 1000 mA g-1. At 100 mA g-1, NaNi0.4Mn0.25Ti0.3Co0.05O2 exhibits 152 mA h g-1 in the initial cycle and maintains 91.4 mA h g-1 after 180 cycles. Through ex situ X-ray diffraction, co-substitution is demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the reversibility of P3-P3″ phase transition from 4.0 to 4.4 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that higher electronic conductivity is achieved by co-substitution. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique demonstrate faster kinetics for Na+ diffusion due to the co-substitution.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their easy synthesis and high sodium content. However, complex phase transitions and poor air stability limit their practical applications. Introducing sodium deficiency suppresses reactions with air and improves phase stability, but often at the cost of significantly compromising the sodium storage capacity. Herein, we present a hierarchical composition regulation strategy to achieve radial concentration control of sodium in the O3-type layered oxides, constructing radially distributed sodium gradients. The gradient Na content structure not only can alleviate the volume changes caused by the O3-P3 phase transition, which minimizes the degradation of electrochemical performance during cycling, but also suppresses Na+/H+ exchange. This ensures enhanced air stability, improved kinetic performance, and cycling stability. The modified cathode material exhibits a capacity retention rate of 93.37% after 400 cycles at 5 C. When exposed to 82% relative humidity, CO2 concentration of 3044 ppm for 10 h, it still maintains a specific capacity of 84.9 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 1 C, with a capacity retention rate of 77.27%. This work provides a strategy for radial sodium concentration control, contributing to the development of high-performance and air-stable O3-type sodium-ion battery cathode materials.",

The bulk material and thin films of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 are employed by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) and the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, respectively.

Identification of surface roughness and morphology was obtained from atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Emerging electrochemical properties were observed from charge–discharge profiles of the thin films, which are well comparable to bulk material properties. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 thin film electrodes delivered a highly reversible Na+ storage capacity of ∼120 mAh g–1 with an excellent stability of over 500 cycles.

        "title": "Origin of multiple voltage plateaus in P2-type sodium layered oxides.",
        "abstract": "Although layered transition metal (TM) oxides have attracted considerable attention for cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries, they suffer from uncontrolled multiple voltage plateaus due to local structure transformations such as TM-layer gliding and Na+/vacancy ordering upon Na+ extraction and insertion. However, the intrinsic origins of these local structure transformations are not fully understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, we concentrate on Na+/vacancy ordering in single phase domains to reveal the underlying mechanism of multiple voltage plateaus by tracking desodiation-induced electronic structure evolutions of two typical compounds, P2-Na0.6[Cr0.6Ti0.4]O2 and P2-NaCrO2. During desodiation, P2-NaCrO2 generates obvious multiple voltage plateaus, which are not observed in P2-Na0.6[Cr0.6Ti0.4]O2 due to TM disordering. A combination of first-principles desodiation calculations and electronic structure analysis reveals that charge localization accompanied by Na+ migration is an intrinsic feature of multiple voltage plateaus in P2-NaCrO2. A correlation between charge localization and multiple voltage plateaus is established by a comparative study in which P2-Na0.6[Cr0.6Ti0.4]O2 always follows the charge transfer order from high-activity to low-activity sites. This finding reveals that disordering design of active sites to avoid charge localization in redox is of much importance for developing high-performance Na-ion cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Anionic redox is an effective way to boost the energy density of layer-structured metal-oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries. However, inherent rigid nature of the TMO6 (TM: transition metals) subunits in the layered materials makes it hardly tolerate the inner strains induced by lattice glide, especially at high voltage. Herein, P2-Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07□0.13]O2 (□: TM vacancy) is designed that contains vacancies in TM sites, and Mg ions in both TM and sodium sites. Vacancies make the rigid TMO6 octahedron become more asymmetric and flexible. Low valence Co2+/Co3+ redox couple stabilizes the electronic structure, especially at the charged state. Mg2+ in sodium sites can tune the interlayer spacing against O-O electrostatic repulsion. Time-resolved in situ X-ray diffraction confirms that irreversible structure evolution is effectively suppressed during deep desodiation benefiting from the specific configuration. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that, deriving from the intrinsic vacancies, multiple local configurations of \"□-O-□\", \"Na-O-□\", \"Mg-O-□\" are superior in facilitating the oxygen redox for charge compensation than previously reported \"Na-O-Mg\". The resulted material delivers promising cycle stability and rate capability, with a long voltage plateau at 4.2 V contributed by oxygen, and can be well maintained even at high rates. The strategy will inspire new ideas in designing highly stable cathode materials with reversible anionic redox for sodium-ion batteries.",

However, the comparatively low intrinsic electronic conductivity (≈10-7 S cm-1 ) of NVOPF leads to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, especially at high rates, limiting its practical applications. To improve the conductivity and enhance Na storage performance, many efforts have been devoted to designing NVOPF, including morphology optimization, hybridization with conductive materials, metal-ion doping, Na-site regulation, and F/O ratio adjustment. These attempts have shown some encouraging achievements and shed light on the practical application of NVOPF cathodes. This work aims to provide a general introduction, synthetic methods, and rational design of NVOPF to give a deeper understanding of the recent progress. Additionally, the unique microstructure of NVOPF and its relationship with Na storage properties are also described in detail. The current status, as well as the advances and limitations of such SIB cathode material, are reported.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries continue to rise in the energy storage landscape, their increasing adoption being driven by factors such as cost‐effectiveness and sustainability. As a consequence, there is a growing emphasis on the development of new electrode materials. Among these, olivine phosphates emerge as a promising family of cathode materials. However, viable synthesis routes are still lacking. In this study, cathode materials of olivine NaMn1‐xFexPO4 (x=0.34 and 1) were prepared by directly sodiating Mn1‐xFexPO4 through a solid‐state process at 300 °C. X‐ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements were employed to study their structural and electrochemical features. NaMn0.66Fe0.34PO4 exhibits two pseudo‐plateaus profile with an average potential of ~3.2 V vs. Na+/Na0 with a reversible capacity reaching 75 mAh/g at C/20 via a monophasic (de)intercalation mechanism. In parallel, the intermediate composition Na0.5Mn0.66Fe0.34PO4 could be prepared via the solid‐state reaction of NaMn0.66Fe0.34PO4 and Mn0.66Fe0.34PO4. Such a solvent‐free sodiation process not only provides a simplified preparation of NMFP, but also offers easy scalability compared to the more laborious electrochemical sodiation route, making it an interesting prospect for future industrialization. Finally, this research confirms that the olivine NMFP is indeed an attractive candidate as a cathode material for SIBs.",

Here, the electrochemical‐temperature‐dependent evolution of P2 Na2/3MnO2 is investigated using X‐ray powder diffraction. P2 Na2/3MnO2 powder under a N2 atmosphere shows evidence of the formation of a monoclinic C2/m phase, from about 450 °C. The P2 Na2/3MnO2 electrode sealed in a capillary undergoes a sequence of phase transitions from the as‐prepared hexagonal P63 /mmc to a secondary hexagonal P63 /mmc phase followed by a transition to Mn3O4 and subsequently MnO. NaF also appears parallel to the formation of the secondary hexagonal phase. These transitions suggest a local reducing environment as the Mn oxidation state evolves from 3+/4+ to 2+. The samples at various states of charge show similar thermal evolution with the exception of the discharged (Na‐inserted) state which features a slightly more complex evolution. Understanding the structure and thermal evolution at various states of charge and under various conditions provides insight into the stability of these potential cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (NM) layered cathode in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) undergoes structural distortion and capacity degradation during cycling, which seriously hinders its practical application. Herein, lanthanum (La) is employed as a dopant in O3‐NaNi0.5Mn0.5‐xLaxO2 (NML) cathodes, which triggered an “atomic knife” effect, reducing particle size, and stabilizing crystal structure. The larger La ions generated structural strain during grain growth at high temperatures, hindering the movement of grain boundaries and refining the size of NML particles. Comprehensive characterizations illuminated La doping‐induced atomic site occupancy and phase transformations within NML. A competitive phase formation between layered NML and perovskite LaMnO3 (LMO) is observed. Spontaneously formed perovskite LMO provides surface protection. Moreover, strong La─O bonds expand the Na interlayer spacing, enhancing Na+‐ion diffusion. Consequently, NML cathodes exhibit superior long‐term cycling stability and ultrahigh rate capacities compared to pristine NM cathode and most currently reported layered cathodes for SIBs.",

Among the different members of this family of materials, KNi[Fe(CN)6] has attracted great attraction because of its low synthesis cost and excellent stability. Multiple synthesis approaches based on coprecipitation methods have been explored to optimize its capacity to intercalate sodium; however, the effects of the synthesis conditions on the structural and electrochemical properties of KNi[Fe(CN)6] remain vague.

The obtained orthorhombic structure (S.G.

The 15% and 20% PEG-coated Na2FePO4F are evaluated at a 2 - 4 V voltage range at C/15 in Na-half cells using two electrolyte formulations: 5% FEC 1 M NaClO4:PC and 1 M NaPF6:PC. The NaPF6/FEC electrolyte exhibits better electrochemical characteristics and high cycling stability, especially in the case of the 15% PEG-coated material.

Honeycomb-ordered antimony-based O3 structures, however, unsatisfactorily exhibit complex phase transitions and sluggish Na+ kinetics during cycling. Herein, we prepared a completely cationic-disordered O3-type Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 compound by composition regulation for SIBs. Surprisingly, the measured redox potentials for typical O3-P3 phase transition are located at 3.4 V. Operando X-ray diffraction confirms a reversible phase transition process from the O3 to P3 structure accompanied with a very small volume change (1.0%) upon sodium extraction and insertion. The low activation barrier energy of 400 meV and the fast Na+ migration of 10-11 cm2·s-1 are further obtained by first-principles calculations and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, respectively. As a result, the O3-Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 cathode displays a reversible capacity of 106 mA h g-1 at 0.1C (12 mA g-1), smooth charge-discharge curves, and a high average working voltage of 3.5 V during battery cycling.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have evoked much attention, benefiting from the advantages of low cost, high safety and excellent performance at low temperature. Especially, Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) cathode is considered to be one of the best candidates for SIBs cathode with abundant resources and long‐term cycling stability. However, the impurities of NaFePO4 (NFP) and Na2FeP2O7 (NFPO) formed synchronously with NFPP which restrict the further application of NFPP. It is meaningful to clear the formation process and regulate the contents of NFP and NFPO. Therefore, NFPP cathodes with different contents of NFP and NFPO were prepared through high energy ball milling cooperated with post‐heat treatment by controlling the Fe concentration in reactants. The NFPP‐2.85 showed the best electrochemical performance because of the high content of NFPP and transition zone between NFPP and NFPO which fasts the Na+ transport kinetics. When employed as cathode for SIBs, the as‐prepared NFPP‐2.85 showed a specific capacity of 111.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintained at 68.9 mAh g−1 even at 100 C. The retention ratio was as high as 93.6 % after 1500 cycles at 20 C, implying superior high rate‐long term cycling stability. This work provides a new way for impurities regulation and the improvement of NFPP electrochemical performance.",

In this work, we report the electrochemical performance of Na4Mn2O5, a sodium-rich manganese oxide, which has been previously reported to suffer from structural instability due to the Jahn-Teller distortion of the Mn3+ ion. It was observed that the Na4Mn2-xZrxO5 (x = 0.1) cathode delivered a discharge capacity of ∼203 mA h g-1 post 250 cycles with a capacity retention rate of ∼82.8% on doping with Zr4+ ions. The improvement in cycling ability and rate capability is attributed to the enhanced structural stability and improved electronic conduction brought about by the substitution of Mn3+ by Zr4+ in Na4Mn2O5. Density functional theory-based studies were conducted, which adequately support the obtained results.",

In this work, firstly using the monomers N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (TPDA) and terephthaldehyde (TA), p-type phenylenediamine-based imine-linked TPDA-TA-COF is synthesized. To construct a bipolar redox-active, porous and highly crystalline polyimide-linked COF, i.e., TPDA-NDI-COF, n-type 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NDA) molecules are incorporated into p-type TPDA-TA-COF structure via postsynthetic linker exchange method. This tailored COF demonstrated a wide potential window (1.03.6 V vs Na+/Na) with dual redox-active centers, positioning it as a favorable cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Owing to the inheritance of multiple redox functionalities, TPDA-NDI-COF can deliver a specific capacity of 67 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, which is double the capacity of TPDA-TA-COF (28 mAh g-1). The incorporation of carbon nanotube (CNT) into the TPDA-NDI-COF matrix resulted in an enhancement of specific capacity to 120 mAh g-1 at 0.02 A g-1. TPDA-NDI-50%CNT demonstrated robust cyclic stability and retained a capacity of 92 mAh g-1 even after 10 000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Furthermore, the COF cathode exhibited an average discharge voltage of 2.1 V, surpassing the performance of most reported COF as a host material.",

Layered oxides are the most promising cathode materials and their pure phases (e.g., P2, O3) have been widely investigated. Here we report a series of cathode materials with O3/P2 hybrid phase for sodium-ion batteries, which possesses advantages of both P2 and O3 structures. The designed material, Na0.78Ni0.2Fe0.38Mn0.42O2, can deliver a capacity of 86 mAh g-1 with great rate capability and cycling performance. 66% capacity is still maintained when the current rate reaches as high as 10C, and the capacity retention is 90% after 1500 cycles. Moreover, in situ XRD was performed to examine the structure change during electrochemical testing in different voltage ranges, and the results demonstrate 4 V as the optimized upper voltage limit, with which smaller polarization, better structural stability, and better cycling performance are achieved.

However, the reversible capacity based on the two‐electron reaction mechanism is not satisfactory limited by the inactive M1 lattice sites during the insertion/extraction process. Herein, self‐supporting 3D porous NVP materials with different crystallinity are fabricated on carbon foam substrates by a facile electrostatic spray deposition method. The V5+/V4+ redox couple is effectively activated and the three‐electron reactions are realized in NVP for sodium storage by a proper crystallinity tuning. In a disordered NVP sample, an ultra‐high specific capacity of 179.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C is achieved due to the coexistence of redox reactions of the V4+/V3+ and V5+/V4+ couples. Moreover, a pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism induced by the disordered structure is first observed in the NVP electrode. An innovative model is given to understand the disorder‐induced‐pseudocapacitance phenomenon in this polyanion cathode material.",

The influence of crystallinity and sodium content on the electrochemical properties was systematically investigated. The optimized Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes exhibited an initial capacity of 151 mA h g-1 , which is close to its theoretical capacity (170 mA h g-1 ). Meanwhile, the Na2 CoFe(CN)6 cathode demonstrated an outstanding long-term cycle performance, retaining 78 % of its initial capacity after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Na2 CoFe(CN)6 Prussian white nanocubes also achieved a superior rate capability (115 mA h g-1 at 400 mA g-1 , 92 mA h g-1 at 800 mA g-1 ). The enhanced performances could be attributed to the robust crystal structure and rapid transport of Na ions through large channels in the open-framework. Most noteworthy, the as-prepared Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes are not only low-cost in raw materials but also contain a rich sodium content (1.87 Na ions per lattice unit cell), which will be favorable for full cell fabrication and large-scale electric storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Activating anionic redox chemistry in layered oxide cathodes is a paradigmatic approach to devise high-energy sodium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, excessive oxygen redox usually induces irreversible lattice oxygen loss and cation migration, resulting in rapid capacity and voltage fading and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, the reductive coupling mechanism (RCM) of uncommon electron transfer from oxygen to copper ions is unraveled in a novel P2-Na0.8Cu0.22Li0.08Mn0.67O2 cathode for boosting the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions. The resultant strong covalent Cu-(O-O) bonding can efficaciously suppress excessive oxygen oxidation and irreversible cation migration. Consequently, the P2-Na0.8Cu0.22Li0.08Mn0.67O2 cathode delivers a marvelous rate capability (134.1 and 63.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and 100C, respectively) and outstanding long-term cycling stability (82% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 10C). The intrinsic functioning mechanisms of RCM are fully understood through systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations and theoretical computations.

        "title": "Enabling One‐Step De‐Sodiation of Na4MnV(PO4)3 Cathode via Regulating Coordination Environment for High‐Power and Long‐Lasting Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) is considered as a promising cathode candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) because it possesses a higher voltage plateau of 3.6 V (Mn3+/Mn2+) besides the voltage plateau of 3.4 V (V4+/V3+), lower cost, and environmental benign compared to Na3V2(PO4)3. However, such cathode still suffers from sluggish intrinsic Na+ diffusion kinetics and the Jahn‐Teller distortion of Mn3+, leading to low capacity and poor cycling performance. Particularly, the second‐step Na+ de‐sodiation in NMVP is the rate‐determining step owing to a lower chemical diffusion coefficient with one order of magnitude than that of the first‐step counterpart. To address these issues, a coordination environment regulation strategy is reported to develop a one‐step de‐sodiation NMVP cathode via introducing Zr4+ and K+/Ca2+ into Mn and Na sites, respectively. Based on theoretical calculations and electrochemical evaluation, the obtained Na3.3K0.1Ca0.1Mn0.8VZr0.2(PO4)3 exhibits much enhanced Na+ diffusion and efficiently inhibits the Jahn‐Teller distortion. Importantly, such modification significantly facilitates the second‐step Na+ diffusion of NMVP, realizing one‐step de‐sodiation. When employed as a cathode for SIBs, such cathode shows a specific capacity of 73 mAh g−1 (15 C), and capacity retentions of 92.7% after 3000 cycles (at 10 C, room temperature), and 72.6% after 1000 cycles (1 C, 50 °C).",

        "title": "Water-Stable Cathode for High Rate Na-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Most of sodium layered oxide cathodes are unstable under moisture condition. As a unique water-stable cathode, Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNM) usually become vulnerable to water molecules after element substitution treatment to suppress the Na+ vacancy ordering arrangement, which causes limited Na+ diffusion kinetics. Herein, we show that these issues can be addressed simultaneously by rational designing the transition metal (TM) layer to achieve both water-stable and Na+ vacancy disordering structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the water-stability of layered oxide cathode can be correlated to the surface adsorption energy of H2O molecule. In TM layer, the Co/Mn and Fe/Mn units exhibit much lower adsorption energy than that of Li/Mn unit, hence the H2O molecule prefers to be absorbed on Co/Mn and Fe/Mn units rather than Li/Mn. Moreover, the Li/Mn unit in TM layer can suppress the Na+ vacancy ordering structure in NNM to improve the Na+ diffusion kinetics. As a consequence, the well-designed Na2/3Li1/9Ni5/18Mn2/3O2 cathode can not only maintain its original crystal structure and electrochemical property after water soaking treatment, but also exhibit high rate capability (78% capacity retention at 20 C) and excellent cycling stability (87% capacity retention after 1000 cycles).",

        "abstract": "Low-cost sodium-ion batteries have demonstrated great prospects in energy storage, among which layered transition metal oxides hold great potential as a cathode material. However, the notorious phase transition in layered cathode materials has greatly hampered their cycle life due to large volume changes upon desodiation/sodiation. In this study, by adopting an O3-type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) with controlled synthesis temperatures, we have revealed that the grain size is closely related to its phase transition behaviors. The layered material with a smaller grain size and more distorted lattice tends to experience a shorter plateau of the O3-P3-O3 phase transitions during the charge/discharge process. Despite having a lower nominal discharge capacity without the phase transition plateau, its cycling stability increases from 77.4% to 96.2% after 100 cycles with greatly reduced intragranular cracks. The smaller grain size and lattice distortion act as a barrier that prevents the smooth layer from gliding upon sodium intercalation and deintercalation. This study focuses on the influence of grain size on battery cycle stability and provides a basis for future analysis of the structural instability of layered materials.",

The use of agar reduces the synthesis time significantly, and the high Na content enhances the stability of the structure and contributes to its capacity.

        "title": "Copper and nickel hexacyanoferrates/carbon nanotube nanocomposites thin films as high-performance light cathode materials for aqueous sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Aqueous rechargeable Na-ion batteries are gaining popularity as an attractive alternative for energy storage systems due to their low cost, wide range of raw material sources, non-flammability, and ultrahigh ionic conductivity. Currently, Because of their three-dimensional open structure, high specific capacity, and inexpensive cost, Prussian blue analogues are being investigated as electrode materials for electrochemistry. In this work, we present an innovative strategy to create novel two-component nanoarchitected thin films that exhibit exceptional performance as cathodes in aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). By leveraging the versatility of the liquid-liquid interfacial method, we have prepared two distinct transparent nanocomposite films composed of carbon nanotubes and either copper or nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles. The results show that the NiHCF/CNT and CuHCF/CNT deliver a high specific capacity of 152 mA h g−1 and 135 mA h g−1, respectively, at a high current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, the cells (rGO//NiHCF and rGO//CuHCF) show that the energy density of the battery can reach up to 7.75 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 27.92 W kg−1 for rGO//NiHCF/CNT, while rGO//CuHCF/CNT showed an energy density of 3.67 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 13.21 W kg−1. The results demonstrate that NiHCF/CNT and CuHCF/CNT nanocomposite films provide new insight into the design of high-performance PBA cathodes.",

        "abstract": "The interface of layered cathodes for sodium ion batteries is subject to atmospheric and electrochemical corrosions. Here, the authors demonstrate an environmentally stable interface via titanium enriched surface reconstruction in a layered manganese-based oxide. Sodium-ion batteries are strategically pivotal to achieving large-scale energy storage. Layered oxides, especially manganese-based oxides, are the most popular cathodes due to their high reversible capacity and use of earth-abundant elements. However, less noticed is the fact that the interface of layered cathodes always suffers from atmospheric and electrochemical corrosion, leading to severely diminished electrochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate an environmentally stable interface via the superficial concentration of titanium, which not only overcomes the above limitations, but also presents unique surface chemical/electrochemical properties. The results show that the atomic-scale interface is composed of spinel-like titanium (III) oxides, enhancing the structural/electrochemical stability and electronic/ionic conductivity. Consequently, the interface-engineered electrode shows excellent cycling performance among all layered manganese-based cathodes, as well as high-energy density. Our findings highlight the significance of a stable interface and, moreover, open opportunities for the design of well-tailored cathode materials for sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with low cost and environmentally friendly features have recently attracted significant attention for renewable energy storage. Sodium layer oxides stand out as a type of promising cathode material for SIBs owing to their high capacity, good rate performance, and high compatibility for manufacturing. However, the poor cycling stability of layer oxide cathodes due to structure distortion greatly impacts their practical applications. Herein, a high entropy doped Cu, Fe, and Mn-based layered oxide (HE-CFMO), Na0.95Li0.05Mg0.05Cu0.20Fe0.22Mn0.35Ti0.13O2 for high-performance SIBs, is designed. The HE-CFMO cathode possesses high-entropy transition metal (TM) layers with a homogeneous stress distribution, providing a moderated interlayer spacing to maintain the structure stability and enhance Na+ ion diffusion. In addition, Li doping in TM layers increases the Mn valence state, which effectively suppresses John-Teller effect, thus stabilizing the layered structure during cycling. Furthermore, the use of nontoxic and low-cost raw materials benefits future commercialization and reduces the risk of environmental pollution. As a result, the HE-CFMO cathode exhibits a super cycling performance with a 95% capacity retention after 300 cycles. This work provides a promising strategy to improve the structure stability and reaction kinetics of cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The dual strategy of K regulation and microsphere morphology tailoring for Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) is designed in this work. By introducing potassium ion within the NMVP structure, the sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type framework can be well stabilized. Potassium ions can act as “pillars” within the NASICON framework, slightly expanding the lattice and thereafter promoting faster sodium ion diffusion. Simultaneously, the microsphere morphological design is tailored to optimize the electrochemical performance by decreasing ion diffusion pathways and facilitating a more efficient ion exchange between the electrolyte and the active material, improving the kinetics of Na⁺ ion upon cycling. As a proof of concept, DFT computations corroborate that K selectively replaces Na1 sites in NMVP, which effectively ameliorates electronic conductivity and diminishes Na diffusion barrier. On the other hand, the heightened ionicity between Mn/V and O, induced by K-doping regulation, arouses a higher redox voltage in K-doped NMVP due to enhanced charge localization. As expected, the optimized NMVP-K1 delivers satisfied capacities of 103.5 mAh and 86.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 C, retaining 79.8 % of its initial capacity undergoing 2000 circulations at 10 C. Moreover, when used in a full SIB, NMVP-K1//HC reflects a high energy density of 256.8 Wh kg−1 at 321 W kg−1.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have gained significant popularity as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their remarkable features such as high capacity and convenient synthesis. However, PBAs usually suffer from kinetic problems during the electrochemical reactions due to sluggish Na^+ diffusion in the large crystals, resulting in low-capacity utilization and inferior rate capability. In this study, we present a facile etching method aiming at activating the sodium storage sites and accelerating the Na^+ transport of Na_2NiFe(CN)_6 (denoted as NaNiHCF) by precisely controlling its morphologies. A progressive corner passivation phenomenon occurred in NaNiHCF during the etching process, which led to a substantial augmentation of the specific surface area as the morphology transitioned from a standard cube to a dice shape. Notably, by controlling the etching time, the obtained NaNiHCF-3 electrode exhibited boosted electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity of 83.5 mAh g^−1 (98.2% of its theoretical capacity), superior rate capability (71.2 mAh g^−1 at 10 C), and stable cycling life-span at different temperatures. Both experimental and computational methods reveal the remarkably reversible structural evolution process and improved Na^+ diffusion coefficient. We believe that this work can serve as an indispensable reference to tailor the structure of PBAs to obtain improved electrochemical performance.",

In this study, highly dense, spherical P2-type oxides Na0.67[Ni0.167Co0.167Mn0.67]1-xTixO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) are synthesized by calcining a mixture of Na2CO3, spherical ternary precursor powder Ni0.167Co0.167Mn0.67O2, and different amounts of nanoscale TiO2. High-temperature X-ray diffraction results obtained during calcination reveal 850 °C as the optimum calcination temperature. All materials exhibit high crystallinity without any impurity phases. The initial reversible capacities of the as-prepared samples decrease with increasing Ti substitution; however, these samples attain better cycling stability. When x = 0.2, the sample delivers an initial discharge capacity of 138 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1 between 2 and 4.5 V. Even at 100 mA g−1, the sample delivers 101 mAh g−1 reversible capacity in the first cycle with capacity retention of 89.4% after 300 cycles. Moreover, the material shows sloping potential profiles, with the average voltages reaching up to ∼3.8 V. The ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of the samples after cycling demonstrate that Ti substitution improves the structural stability.

        "abstract": "Raising the upper cut‐off voltage of cathode is an effective method to improve the energy density of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, the high upper cut‐off voltage could cause severe side reactions and injure the cycle life of SIBs as the absence of stable cathode‐electrolyte interface. Some fluorinated co‐solvents have been ever employed and proven effective in stabilizing the cathode‐electrolyte interface to support the normal operation of SIBs under a high upper cut‐off voltage. However, the high‐cost of fluorinated co‐solvents would notably improve battery expenses. In this study, a low‐cost co‐solvent called ethyl methylsulfone (EMS) is introduced into the electrolyte for the Na0.67Mn0.8Cu0.2O2 cathode with a high upper cut‐off voltage of 4.5 V. It is found that a stable and uniform cathode‐electrolyte interface (CEI) forms on the cathode, which mitigates the cathode degradation and enhances the cycling stability of cathode. Consequently, this cathode with the designed electrolyte achieves a high capacity retention of 83.2% after 750 cycles at a current density of 1 C (1 C=110 mAh g‐1). This work provides valuable insights into the development of electrolytes for sodium‐ion batteries working at high‐voltage.",

        "abstract": "P2-type manganese-based cathode materials are notable for their high theoretical capacity and open prismatic channels. However, rapid capacity decay caused by harmful irreversible phase transformations (P2-O2) and oxygen release in the high-voltage region (>4.2 V) limits their commercial application. Here, a co-doping strategy with lithium and niobium is proposed to enhance the structural stability at both room-temperature (RT) and low-temperature (LT) over extended cycles. The X-ray absorption near-edge spectra and first-principles calculations reveal that Li doping elevates the valence states of transition metals, thereby enhancing the reversibility of anionic redox reactions. Additionally, Nb doping leads to the formation of a rock-salt-like phase on the surface, which improves the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface. In situ X-ray diffraction and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry show that Li and Nb co-doping prevents the P2-O2 phase transition, suppresses gas release, and enhances long-cycle stability.

FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) (310 Wh kg-1/7720 W kg-1). Besides, the relative pouch-type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up-and-coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries with Na-Mn-O compounds as cathodes have been widely studied as substitutes for lithium ion batteries due to their abundant resources. However, the relatively poor cycling stability and low capacity of Na-Mn-O compounds significantly limit their applications. Different approaches, including element substitution and surface modification, have been applied to improve the electrochemical performance of those cathode materials. Herein, element doping and coating of ZrO2 on Na0.7MnO2 particles have been achieved by atomic layer deposition followed by post-annealing. The rate capability and cycling stability of the modified materials were significantly improved, and the mechanism of performance enhancement was revealed. The ZrO2 coatings acted as a stable interfacial layer to enhance the cycling stability of Na0.7MnO2 by suppressing side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte. The doping of transition metal ions reduced energy barriers for sodium ion insertion and deintercalation during charge/discharge cycling, further improving the charge/discharge capacity and rate performance of Na0.7MnO2.",

        "abstract": "P2 layered oxide cathode materials for sodium ion batteries are favored by many scholars because of their advantages such as high energy density, abundant type, simple synthesis way and low environmental pollution. Among them, the most representative material is P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (P2-NaNMO). However, the following issues can potentially affect how the material is used in practice: The Na+/vacancy ordering increases the diffusion barrier of Na+, which has a significant impact on the electrochemical performance; Mn3+ induces Jahn-Teller distortion, which disrupts the structural stability of the oxygen octahedron, resulting in structural degradation and decreased performance; an unexpected P2-O2 phase transition will occur when the cut-off voltage is >4.2 V. Therefore, the preparation of P2-NaNMO with high stability under high operating voltage has become the primary problem at present. Firstly, the research progress of layered transition metal oxides is introduced. Secondly, the structure and advantages of P2-NaNMO materials are analyzed. At the same time, in order to inhibit the phase transition of P2-NaNMO during the charging and discharging process, the modification method of the material was proposed. Finally, the influences of doping elements at various positions, surface modification, different binders on the performances of P2-NaNMO are systematically discussed, and their future development is prospected.",

The substitution of Co3+ to Mn3+ leads to the enlargements of small and S-shape tunnel spaces, which facilitates the insertion/deinsertion of Na+ into/from the NMO-3 and greatly enhance its rate capability and cycling stability. Moreover, the reduced energy barrier for Na+ diffusion in small tunnels make the inactive Na+ easily to be deintercalated, which should be responsible for its high specific capacity that exceeds the theoretical capacity of T-type NMO.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries are the most attractive substitutes for lithium-ion batteries in large-scale energy storage devices due to wide spread reserves and low-cost of sodium resources and the similarities between sodium and lithium chemistry. However, finding a suitable cathode material is still a hurdle to be overcome. To date, Prussian white (PW), NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]y·nH2O has stood out as one of the most promising Na-host materials due to its low cost, facile synthesis and competitive electrochemical capacity. Despite this, there are concerns that this material will thermally decompose at relatively low temperatures to form cyanogen gas, which is a safety hazard. Thus, low vacancy NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]y·nH2O (x = 1.5, 1, 0.5 and 0) has been synthesized, and the influence of x on its thermal behavior systematically investigated. It is demonstrated that the thermal decomposition temperature, water content and moisture sensitivity of the samples strongly depend on the sodium content. The sample with x = 1.5 is found to be the most thermally stable and has the highest water content under the same experimental conditions. In addition, the sodium-rich samples (x = 1.5, 1 and 0.5) have higher surface water than the sodium-deficient one (x = 0). The local structure for this sample is also very different to the sodium-rich ones. Our findings offer new insights into the profound implications of proper material handling and safer operating conditions for practical Na-ion batteries and may be extended to analogous systems.",

The zero-band gap of NVP@NC-2 through first-principles calculations means the ionic conductivity of NVP@C is greatly enhanced after N doping. The addition of the N element to the carbon layer contributes a pair of lone pairs of electrons to the matrix carbon and introduces certain active sites and defects. The reason for the improved electrochemical performance is that the N-doped carbon layer (NC) enables the expansion and deformation of the crystal structure to be controlled, increasing the Na+ diffusion coefficient and the electrical conductivity of NVP.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the oxygen‐redox reactions within Mn‐rich layered cathode materials is an important strategy to improve the capacity of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) while satisfying the demand for low cost and the use of abundant resources. Nonetheless, the P2‐type Nay[AxMn1‐x]O2 compositions (where A = electro‐inactive elements) exhibit poor capacity retention and low operation voltage along with a broad voltage hysteresis. In addition, Nay[TMxMn1‐x]O2 (where TM = transition metal) still suffers from low capacity in the absence of anion redox activity. This investigation introduces Li, Mg, and Ni into the P2‐layered NaxMnO2 matrix to explore diverse compositional dynamics engineered by density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics. The P2‐Na0.7[Li0.1Mg0.05Ni0.15Mn0.7]O2 configuration is optimized, exhibiting enhanced structural and electrochemical stabilities. Operando X‐ray diffraction analyses affirm the preservation of the P2 structure throughout de/sodiation, and comprehensive structural analyses unraveled the complex charge‐compensation mechanisms facilitated by Ni2+/Ni4+, Mn3+/Mn4+, and O2−/(O2)n− redox pairs. Neutron diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques elucidate the Li migration phenomena within the TM and sodium layers. This research underscores the pivotal role of Li, Mg, and Ni co‐doping in the development of cathode materials, paving the way for SIBs with enhanced electrochemical performance.",

The electrochemical reaction pathways, structural integrity, and long cycling ability at low current rates of the P3- and P2-phases of the Na0.67Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 cathodes were investigated using time-consuming techniques, such as galvanostatic titration and series cyclic voltammetry. The results obtained from these techniques were supported by those obtained from operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Particularly, the P2-phase provided excellent structural stability owing to its intrinsic crystal structure, thereby exhibiting a reversible capacity retention of 82.6% after 262 cycles at a low rate of 0.1 C; in contrast, the P3-phase exhibited a capacity retention of 38.7% after 241 cycles at a similar current rate. The air stability of these as-prepared powders, which were stored under ambient conditions, was progressively analyzed over a period of 6 months through XRD without conducting any special experiments. The results suggest that in the P3-phase, the formation of NaHCO3 and hydrated phase impurities, resulting from Na+/H+ exchange and hydration reactions, respectively, was likely to occur more quickly, that is, within a few days, compared to that in the P2-phase.",

Herein, a lattice regulation strategy to enlarge the size in favor of Na+ insertion/extraction and to maintain the stability of the tunnel structure of Na0.44MnO2 by Ti and trace Mg co-doping is reported for the first time. Subsequently, the Na0.44Mn0.895Ti0.1Mg0.005O2 (NMO-TM) material is synthesized with Ti/Mg co-doping. The structure and phase composition of the as-synthesized samples are investigated through X-ray diﬀraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that Ti/Mg has been effectively doped into the crystal structure of Na0.44MnO2 while it maintains the stability of the tunnel structure. The material was used as cathode materials of rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. As a result, at a 1 C rate, the NMO-TM sample exhibits a considerable capacity of 110 mAh g−1, with retention rates of up to 93.6 % after 200 cycles. Even at a higher cycle rate of 20 C, the NMO-TM sample maintains a specific capacity of 80.0 mAh g−1, with a retention rate of 67 % after 2000 cycles. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the tunnel structure to get stable and high-rate performance of cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we present a variable-temperature 23Na NMR and variable-temperature and variable-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis of the local structure of a layered P2 Na-ion battery cathode material, Na0.67[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 (NMMO). For the first time, we elucidate the superstructure in this material by using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and total neutron scattering and show that this superstructure is consistent with NMR and EPR spectra. To complement our experimental data, we carry out ab initio calculations of the quadrupolar and hyperfine 23Na NMR shifts, the Na+ ion hopping energy barriers, and the EPR g-tensors. We also describe an in-house simulation script for modeling the effects of ionic mobility on variable-temperature NMR spectra and use our simulations to interpret the experimental spectra, available upon request. We find long-zigzag-type Na ordering with two different types of Na sites, one with high mobility and the other with low mobility, and reconcile the tendency toward Na+/vacancy ordering to the preservation of local electroneutrality. The combined magnetic resonance methodology for studying local paramagnetic environments from the perspective of electron and nuclear spins will be useful for examining the local structures of materials for devices.",

        "title": "Sustainable layered cathode with suppressed phase transition for long-life sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are among the most promising alternatives to lithium-based technologies for grid and other energy storage applications due to their cost benefits and sustainable resource supply. For the cathode—the component that largely determines the energy density of a sodium-ion battery cell—one major category of materials is P2-type layered oxides. Unfortunately, at high state-of-charge, such materials tend to undergo a phase transition with a very large volume change and consequent structural degradation during long-term cycling. Here we address this issue by introducing vacancies into the transition metal layer of P2-Na_0.7Fe_0.1Mn_0.75□_0.15O_2 (‘□’ represents a vacancy). The transition metal vacancy serves to suppress migration of neighbouring Na ions and therefore maintain structural and thermal stability in Na-depleted states. Moreover, the specific Na−O−□ configuration triggers a reversible anionic redox reaction and boosts the energy density. As a result, the cathode design here enables pouch cells with energy densities of 170 Wh kg^−1 and 120 Wh kg^−1 that can operate for over 600 and 1,000 cycles, respectively. Our work not only suggests a feasible strategy for cathode design but also confirms the possibility of developing a battery chemistry that features a reduced need for critical raw materials. The poor structural stability of cathode materials is responsible for the rapid capacity loss of sodium-ion batteries during cycling. This work addresses the instability by introducing vacancies into the transition metal layers and realize long-life pouch cells.",

        "abstract": "The development of high-energy-density cathode materials is regarded as the ultimate goal of alkali metal-ion batteries energy storage. However, the strategy of regulating specific capacity is limited by the theoretical capacity, and meanwhile focusing on improving capacity will lead to structural destructions. Herein, a novel perspective is proposed that tuning the electronic band structure by introducing highly electronegative fluoride atoms in NaxTMO2-yFy (0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 2) model compounds to improve redox potential for developing high-energy-density layered oxides. Highly electronegative fluoride atoms is introduced into P2-type Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 (NFM), and the thus fluoride NFM (F-NFM) cathode achieved high redox potential (3.0 V) and high energy density (446 Wh kg-1). Proved by structural characterizations, fluorine atoms are successfully incorporated into oxygen sites in NFM lattice. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy is applied to quantitatively analyze the improved redox potential of F-NFM, which is achieved by the decreased valence band energy in electronic band structure due to the strongly electrophilic fluoride ions. Moreover, fluoride atoms can stabilize the local environment of NFM and improve its redox potential. The work provides a perspective to improve redox potential by tuning the electronic band structure in layered oxides and developing high-energy-density alkali metal-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The O-type layered nickel oxides suffer from undesired co-operative Jahn-Teller distortion stemming from Ni3+ ions and undergo multiple biphasic structural transformations during the insertion/extraction of large Na+ ions, posing a significant challenge to stabilize the structural integrity. We present here a systematic investigation of the impact of substituting 5% divalent (Mg2+) or trivalent (Al3+ or Co3+) ions for Ni3+ to alleviate Na+-ion ordering and perturb the Jahn-Teller effect to enhance structural stability. We gauge a fundamental understanding of the Mg-O and Na-O or Mg-O-Na bonding interactions, noting that the ionicity of the Mg-O bond deshields the electronic cloud of oxygen from Na+ ions. Furthermore, calculations of the Van Vleck distortion modes reveal a relaxation of NiO6 octahedra from Jahn-Teller distortion and a reduced electron density at the interlayer with Mg2+ substitution. Long-range (operando X-ray diffraction) and short-range (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) structural analyses provide insights into reduced ordering, allowing a stable continuous solid solution. Overall, Mg-substitution results in a high-capacity retention of ~ 96% even after 100 cycles, showcasing the potential of this strategy for overcoming the structural instabilities and enhancing the performance of sodium-ion batteries.",

This finding suggests a complex interplay between the valence states of the reactants and phase formation mechanisms, which needs further investigation. Additionally, electrochemical testing indicated that the phase composition significantly impacts the electrochemical performance of the material. Specifically, the M0 sample, possessing the optimal P2/β ratio, exhibited excellent electrochemical performances, achieving a high initial discharge capacity of 155.1 mA h g−1 and remains 88.1 % after 40 cycles.

        "abstract": "Recently, polyanionic material has been identified as the most attractive choice for the cathode in sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor electronic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) limits its electrochemical performance, while the presence of vanadium increases material costs. To address these challenges, we have synthesized carbon-coated Fe, Ni dual-doped NVPF (Na3V1.9Fe0.01Ni0.09(PO4)2F3) via a rota tumbler assisted sol-gel process and reported for the first time. Comprehensive studies reveal that dual doping significantly affects the structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of the material. Rietveld refinement shows that doping adjusts the crystal structure, enlarging Na⁺ diffusion pathways and enhancing diffusion kinetics. Na3V1.9Fe0.01Ni0.09(PO4)2F3 exhibits a superior capacity of 115.58 mAhg−1 at 0.1C, 92.86 mAhg−1 at 2C, 87.79 % cyclic retention at 2C after 500 cycles. The optimized material demonstrates robust performance across a wide temperature range (55 °C to −21.1 °C). Furthermore, full-cell constructed using Na3V1.9Fe0.01Ni0.09(PO4)2F3 as cathode and hard carbon as anode delivers an impressive capacity of 87.01 mAhg−1 at 1C and a retention of 94.50 % for 100 cycles at 0.5C. Moreover, reducing the vanadium content in the cathode helps lower the overall manufacturing costs. Our research demonstrates that Na3V1.9Fe0.01Ni0.09(PO4)2F3 is a promising option for a high-performance cathode in sodium-ion batteries.",

The whole electrochemical reaction undergoes highly reversible single‐phase and biphasic transitions with a moderate volume change of 7.7% through in situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ high‐energy synchrotron X‐ray diffraction. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, the superior performance is ascribed to the low ionic‐migration energy barrier and desirable Na‐ion diffusion kinetics.

In-situ XRD confirms that the Cu substitution for Ni stabilizes the P2 structure during the charge–discharge process and inhibits the unfavorable P2-O2 phase transition at high voltage. In addition, Cu-substituted cathode materials exhibit a good effect on improving air stability, attributed to the higher Cu2+/Cu3+ redox potential. This unique substitution mechanism offers a novel perspective for understanding the structure-performance relationship of P2-type cathode materials and provides important support for the design of air-stable, high-performance cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type polyanionic vanadium fluorophosphate Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) is a promising cathode material for high-energy sodium-ion batteries. The dynamic diffusion and exchange of sodium ions in the lattice of NVOPF are crucial for its electrochemical performance. However, standard characterizations are mostly focused on the as-synthesized material without cycling, which is different from the actual battery operation conditions. In this work, we investigated the hopping processes of sodium in NVOPF at the intermediate charging state with 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our experimental characterizations revealed six distinct sodium coordination sites in the intermediate structure and determined the exchange rates among these sites at variable temperatures. The theoretical calculations showed that these dynamic processes correspond to different ion transport pathways in the crystalline lattice. Our combined experimental and theoretical study uncovered the underlying mechanisms of the ion transport in cycled NVOPF and these understandings may help the optimization of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting advanced layered transition metal oxide cathode materials is of great importance to rechargeable sodium batteries. Layered oxides are composed of negatively charged TMO2 slabs (TM = transition metal) separated by Na+ diffusion layers. Herein, we propose a novel insight, for the first time, to control the electrochemical properties by tuning Coulombic repulsion between negatively charged TMO2 slabs. Coulombic repulsion can finely tailor the d-spacing of Na ion layers and material structural stability, which can be achieved by employing Na+ cations to serve as effective shielding layers between TMO2 layers. A series of O3-type NaxMn1/3Fe1/3Cu1/6Mg1/6O2 (x = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7) have been prepared, and Na0.7Mn1/3Fe1/3Cu1/6Mg1/6O2 shows the largest Coulombic repulsion between TMO2 layers, the largest space for Na ion diffusion, the best structural stability, and also the longest Na-O chemical bond with weaker Coulombic attraction, thus leading to the best electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, the thermal stability depends on the Na concentration in pristine materials. Ex situ X-ray absorption (XAS) analysis indicates that Mn, Fe, and Cu ions are all electrochemically active components during insertion and extraction of sodium ion. This study enables some new insights to promote the development of advanced layered NaxTMO2 materials for rechargeable sodium batteries in the future.",

        "abstract": "Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-structure Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NVMP) electrode materials reveal highly attractive application prospects due to ultrahigh energy density originating from two-electron reactions. Nevertheless, NVMP also encounters challenges with its poor electronic conductivity, Mn dissolution, and Jahn-Teller distortion. To address this issue, utilizing N-doped carbon layers and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for dual encapsulation enhances the material's electronic conductivity, creating an effective electron transport network that promotes the rapid diffusion and storage of Na+. On this basis, partially substituting Mn in NVMP with Fe, a new sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) structured cathode material has been designed to alleviate Jahn-Teller distortion and prolong the cycling life. The synergistic effect of N-doped double nanocarbon encapsulation and multielectron reactions is employed to promote the optimized Na3.25VMn0.25Fe0.75(PO4)3/NC@CNTs (NVMn0.25Fe0.75P/NC@CNTs) electrode material to deliver fast Na+ diffusion kinetics, high reversible capacity (110.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C), and long-term cyclic stability (80.1% of the capacity at 10 C over 2000 cycles). Besides, the electrochemical properties of NVMn0.25Fe0.75P/NC@CNTs composites were investigated in detail at high loads and high window voltages to evaluate their potential for practical applications. The reduction/oxidation processes involved in Fe2+/Fe3+, Mn2+/Mn3+, and V3+/V4+ redox couples and a solid-solution and biphasic reaction mechanism upon repeated de- and re-intercalation processes are revealed via ex-situ XRD and XPS characterization. Finally, the assembled NVMn0.25Fe0.75P/NC@CNTs ∥ hard carbon full cell manifests high capacity (101.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C) and good cycling stability (98.2% capacity retention at 1 C after 100 cycles).

A significant hurdle to wide application of these layered oxides lies in simultaneously satisfying high-energy density and long cycle life because of the intrinsic problems associated with their structural irreversibility. Herein, a O3/O'3-P2 core-shell composite that integrates a high specific capacity from O-type Ni-based core and good structural stability from P2-type Mn-rich shell is presented. Multiscale electron microscopy and affiliated spectroscopy analyses reveal that in addition to the microscale O3/O'3-P2 core-shell structure, nanoscale coherent P2/O3 intergrown structure can also be identified in the composite. Such well-tailored structures not only constrain the structural damages (microscale cracks) induced by repeated volumetric changes upon desodiation and re-sodiation, but also facilitate fast Na ions diffusion through the exterior P2-type layered structure. This work may provide new clues into the design of high-performance cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).",

        "abstract": "On the basis of resource abundance and low cost, high capacity layered P2-type Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 material is regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries but suffers from its unstable structure during cycling. In this work, P2-type Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 layered materials were synthesized by a chelating agent assisted sol-gel method with NH3·H2O. With the addition of NH3·H2O and the control of the synthesis conditions, highly active material with a more stable structure and better electrochemical performance was obtained. Furthermore, the influences of structure changes during different voltage ranges (1.5-4.0 V and 1.5-4.3 V vs Na(+)/Na) on the Na(+) storage behaviors were also evaluated and compared. It is confirmed that, when being charged to 4.2 V, an OP4-type phase emerges, which can reduce the damage by the gilding of the MeO2 layers but leads to an unstable crystal structure. For long-term cycling, it is preferred to cut off at 4.0 V rather than at 4.3 V. For the optimized P2-type Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 calcined at 900 °C, a discharge capacity of 92 mAh/g remains after 40 cycles in the voltage range of 1.5-4.0 V, and the Coulombic efficiency remains 100%.",

        "abstract": "A 3D framework with Nasicon structured polyanionic Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been emphasized as a leading cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high working voltage plateau, structural stability, and good rate performance. Herein, pristine NVP and MWCNT@NVP composite synthesized via a facile solid-state method are examined and compared as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries. The morphological study confirms the uniform distribution of MWCNTs in the pristine NVP structure. Impedance spectroscopy clearly confirms more diffusion of Na ions for the MWCNT@NVP composite as compared to pristine NVP, considering its diffusion coefficient which directly implies on an increase in specific capacity. MWCNT@NVP (FNV-2) showed specific discharge capacity 110 mAhg-1 at 0.1C current rate which is almost stable at higher current rates with marginal fading. However, the pristine NVP shows capacity loss at a higher current rate. It is noteworthy that the MWCNT@NVP composite shows stable performance with marginal specific capacity fading (1%) compared to pristine (15%). This is because of the mechanical integrity and stability afforded to the composite by the intertwined MWCNT framework in the MWCNT@NVP composite matrix against electrode degradation during the electrochemical reaction. More significantly, even at a higher current rate, that is, at 10 C, the composite recorded a very stable and excellent Columbic efficiency of 97% with a reversible specific capacity of 94 mAhg-1 after 2000 cycles. An enhanced electrochemical performance, that is, rate capability and cycling stability, demonstrates the high potential of the MWCNT@NVP composite for Na-ion storage. Moreover, a sodium-ion full cell with hard carbon demonstrated a reversible capacity of 103 mAhg-1 at C/20 current rate, which clearly demonstrates that MWCNT@NVP is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue (PB) is one of the main cathode materials with industrial prospects for the sodium ion battery. The structural stability of PB materials is directly associated with the presence of crystal water within the open 3D framework. However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding whether all forms of crystal water have detrimental effects on the structural stability of the PB materials. Currently, it is widely accepted that interstitial water is the stability troublemaker, whereas the role of coordination water remains elusive. In this work, the dynamic evolution of PB structures is investigated during the crystal water (in all forms) removal process through a variety of online monitoring techniques. It can be inferred that the PB-130 °C retains trace coordination water (1.3%) and original structural integrity, whereas PB-180 °C eliminates almost all of crystal water (∼12.1%, including both interstitial and coordinated water), but inevitably suffers from structural collapse. This is mainly because the coordinated water within the PB material plays a crucial role in maintaining structural stability via forming the -N≡C-FeLS-C≡N- conjugate bridge. Consequently, PB-130 °C with trace coordination water delivers superior reversible capacity (113.6 mAh g-1), high rate capability (charge to >80% capacity in 3 min), and long cycling stability (only 0.012% fading per cycle), demonstrating its promising prospect in practical applications.",

Such a well-organized nanostructure can greatly enhance both ion and electron transport.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered extensive attentions in recent years as a low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, achieving both high capacity and long cyclability in cathode materials remains a challenge for SIB commercialization. P3-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathodes exhibit high capacity and prominent Na+ diffusion kinetics but suffer from serious capacity decay and structural deterioration due to stress accumulation and phase transformations upon cycling. In this work, a dual modification strategy with both morphology control and element doping is applied to modify the structure and optimize the properties of the P3-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode. The modified Na0.67Ni0.26Cu0.07Mn0.67O2 layered cathode with hollow porous microrod structure exhibits an excellent reversible capacity of 167.5 mAh g-1 at 150 mA g-1 and maintains a capacity above 95 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 750 mA g-1. For one thing, the specific morphology shortens the Na+ diffusion pathway and releases stress during cycling, leading to excellent rate performance and high cyclability. For another, Cu doping at the Ni site reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier and mitigates unfavorable phase transitions. This work demonstrates that the electrochemical performance of P3-type cathodes can be significantly improved by applying a dual modification strategy, resulting in reduced stress accumulation and optimized Na+ migration behavior for high-performance SIBs.",

The inverted pyramid structure fits tightly with the 3DUC during nucleation to form a one-piece stable structure. This integration effectively curbs aggregation and hasty nucleation tendencies of NiPBA. Furthermore, the abundant voids and interconnected networks within the 3DUC structure significantly reduce ion diffusion path lengths, thereby lowering the Na diffusion barrier and enhancing the material’s capacitance contribution rate. Consequently, this cathode material exhibits commendable initial capacity (125.2 mAh/g at 50 mA g−1) and exceptional long-term cycling stability (with a capacity retention of 89.06 % after 900 cycles at 50 mA g−1). These findings hold significant promise for advancing the commercial viability of metal-PBA based electrodes by rational heterogeneous structure design.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathodes have been widely investigated due to their high reversible capacities and sufficient Na+ reservoirs. However, such materials usually suffer from complex multistep phase transitions along with drastic volume changes, leading to the unsatisfied cycle performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Ti co-doped O3-type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, which can effectively suppress the complex multistep phase transition and realize a solid-solution reaction within a wide voltage range. It is confirmed that, the Mg/Ti co-doping is beneficial to enhance the structural stability and integrity by absorbing micro-strain and distortions. Thus, the as obtained sample delivers an outstanding cyclic performance (82.3% after 200 cycles at 1 C) in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V, and a high discharge capacity of 86.6 mAh/g after 100 cycles within the wide voltage range (2.0–4.5 V), which outperform the existing literatures. This co-doping strategy offers new insights into high performance O3-type cathode for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have gained tremendous attention as promising low-cost electrochemically-tunable electrode materials, which can accommodate large Na+ ions with attractive specific capacity and charge-discharge kinetics. However, poor cycling stability caused by lattice strain and volume change remains to be improved. Herein, metal-doping strategy has been demonstrated in FeNiHCF, Na1.40Fe0.90Ni0.10[Fe(CN)6]0.85·1.3H2O, delivering a capacity as high as 148 mAh g‒1 at 10 mA g‒1. At an exceptionally high rate of 25.6 A g‒1, a reversible capacity of ~55 mAh g‒1 still can be obtained with a very small capacity decay rate of 0.02% per cycle for 1000 cycles, considered one of the best among all metal-doped PBAs. This exhibits the stabilizing effect of Ni doping which enhances structural stability and long-term cyclability. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals an extremely small (~1%) change in unit cell parameters. The Ni substitution is found to increase the electronic conductivity and redox activity, especially at the low-spin (LS) Fe center due to inductive effect. This larger capacity contribution from LS Fe2+C6/Fe3+C6 redox couple is responsible for stable high-rate capability of FeNiHCF. The insight gained in this work may pave the way for the design of other high-performance electrode materials for sustainable sodium-ion batteries.",

The obtained cathode shows a surprisingly high specific capacity of 194 mA h g-1 upon the initial discharge, a good cycling performance and excellent rate performance.

Nevertheless, the sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics and drastic capacity decay triggered by irreversible phase transition limit their large-scale application. In this study, we employ a synergistic optimization strategy involving cation and anion dopants to successfully restrain intergranular strain and tune local electronic structure, strengthening structural stability and electrochemical performance of the cathode material. Specifically, the Mg2+ dopant suppresses Na+/vacancy rearrangement and Mn-O anisotropic changes, while the F− dopant facilitates Na+ transport and alleviates phase evolution in high-voltage regions. Through this co-doping design, the modified electrodes display more alleviated voltage decay and exceptional capacity retention enhancements ranging from 6.57 % to 81.23 % after 750 cycles at 1000 mA g–1. This work provides novel perspectives on precise design of cathode materials, making layered oxides promising contenders for the next generation energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Sodium manganese oxides are promising Na-ion battery cathodes but they suffer from irreversible phase transitions during electrochemical reactions. Most strategies to date have aimed to suppress the phase transitions by stabilizing their layered structures through limiting the content of extractable Na+. Here, we conversely increase atomic disorder in the Na-birnessite, a layered sodium manganese oxide, and thereby modulate its phase transition behavior toward improved electrochemical reversibility. Our study reveals that Mn vacancies and Mn migrated into the interlayer affect interlayer local environment of Na+ and water molecules consequently enhancing Na+ mobility. We observe better capacity retention for disordered \"D-Na-birnessite\", which undergoes a reversible phase transition from the birnessite-type structure to an O'3-type α-NaxMnO2-like structure through another intermediate metastable birnessite-type phase. This research highlights the positive effects of atomic disorder to regulate phase transition routes for achieving superior electrochemical reversibility, finally paving the way to overcoming the limits of layered oxide cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Co substitution has been extensively used to improve the electrochemical performances of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but the role of Co has not been well understood. Herein, we have comprehensively investigated the effects of Co substitution for Ni on the structure and electrochemical performances of Na0.7Mn0.7Ni0.3-xCoxO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) as cathode materials for SIBs. In comparison with the Co-free sample, the high-rate capability and cycle performance have been greatly improved by the substitution of Co, and some new insights into the role of Co have been proposed for the first time. With the substitution of Co(3+) for Ni(2+) the lattice parameter a decreases; however, c increases, and the d-spacing of the sodium-ion diffusion layer has been enlarged, which enhances the diffusion coefficient of the sodium ion and the high-rate capability of cathode materials. In addition, Co substitution shortens the bond lengths of TM-O (TM = transition metal) and O-O due to the smaller size of Co(3+) than Ni(2+), which accounts for the decreased thickness and volume of the TMO6 octahedron. The contraction of TM-O and O-O bond lengths and the shrinkage of the TMO6 octahedron improve the structure stability and the cycle performance. Last but not least, the aliovalent substitution of Co(3+) for Ni(2+) can improve the electronic conductivity during the electrochemical reaction, which is also favorable to enhance the high-rate performance. This study not only unveils the role of Co in improving the high-rate capability and the cycle stability of layered Na0.7Mn0.7Ni0.3-xCoxO2 cathode materials but also offers some new insights into designing high performance cathode materials for SIBs.",

However, their practical application is hindered by the unsatisfied structural stability and the deficient understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanisms.

With several characterization techniques such as neutron diffraction, superconducting quantum interferometry, in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we determined the TM vacancy content and further revealed that higher content of TM vacancies (7.8%) in the transition layer is beneficial to mitigate the structure evolutions and maintain the P2 structure during cycling in voltage range 1.5-4.5 V, while the oxides with lower content of TM vacancies (1.6%) deliver higher discharge capacity but experience complicated phase transition, including stacking faults and P2-P2' transitions. It is demonstrated that regulating the contents of TM vacancies can be utilized as an effective strategy to tune the structure stability and electrochemical performances of layered sodium oxide cathodes.",

Ex situ Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction characterization reveals that the interstitial water can stably exist in the Prussian blue framework during repeated cycling. The long-standing interstitial water can reduce the volume change during the Na+ insertion/extraction process, resulting in improved cycling stability.

The first‐discharge capacities of Na0.67CoO2 and Na0.6 [Co0.78Ru0.22]O2 materials are 128 and 163 mAh g−1 (23.5 mA g−1), respectively. Furthermore, the rate capability is improved due to the electro‐conducting nature of Ru doping. Operando X‐ray diffraction analysis reveals that the Na0.67CoO2 does not undergo a phase transition; however, multiple Na+/vacancy ordered superstructures within the P2 phase appear during Na+ extraction/insertion. In contrast, the Na0.6[Co0.78Ru0.22]O2 material undergoes a P2–OP4 phase transition during desodiation, with no formation of Na+/vacancy ordering within the P2 phase. The increased discharge capacity of Na0.6[Co0.78Ru0.22]O2 is most likely associated with additional cationic Ru4+/Ru5+ redox and increased anionic O2−/(O2n−) redox participation. Combined experimental (galvanostatic cycling, X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry) and theoretical (density functional theory calculations) studies confirm that Ru substitution provokes the oxygen‐redox reaction and that partial O2 release from the oxide lattice is the origin of the reaction. The findings provide new insight for improving the electrode performance of cathode materials via 4d Ru substitution and motivate the development of a new strategy for the design of high‐capacity cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries.",

However, it suffered poor electrical conductivity. In this work, the as-prepared PBA (high purity, low vacancy (∼2%), and high sodium-ion content) was then coated with various concentrations of conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS) via simple stirring method to aid the electron route. The coated PBA (PB–P5) demonstrates two-fold enhanced conductivity of 2.04 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C and 1.18 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 100 °C. XRD peaks of coated PBAs show a slight shifting to higher diffraction angle, indicating the changes from rhombohedral-like to cubic structure. The battery capacity retention has also improved from 73.9% (PB–P0) to 82.87% (PB–P5), on account of having PEDOT-PSS to slow down the side reaction between cathode and electrolyte and eventually improve the cycling stability. Additionally, PB-P5 displays the lowest potential separation in cyclic voltammetry (CV) and small charge transfer resistance, R\n                     \n                        ct\n                      value, in which indicating a better electron transfer and enhanced overall conductivity.",

        "abstract": "A typical polyanionic based material Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (Na3VPO2F) attracts much interest as a cathode for large‐scale sodium‐ion batteries in consideration of its stable structure and remarkable energy density. Nevertheless, the large coulombic attraction and repulsion suffered by the mobile Na+ from structural anions and surrounding Na+, respectively, result in a torpid reaction kinetics and inferior rate capability. Herein, Br−‐doped and Na+ vacancy preinstalled Na3−yVPO2−xBrxF is prepared to dilute the charges on and inside the Na+ transportation tunnel. In virtue of density functional theory analysis, Na3−yVPO2−xBrxF reveals a reduction in the bandgap and an increase in electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, the almost electrostatically shielded tunnel in Na3−yVPO2−xBrxF alleviates the coulombic hindrance imposed on Na+ during its (de)intercalation, which demonstrates a Na+ diffusivity about five times higher than that of Na3VPO2F. Consequently, the Na3−yVPO2−xBrxF cathode shows a superior rate capacity of 77.7 mAh g−1 under 50 C and great cycling property corresponding to a high capacity retention of 94.4% over 800 cycles at 10 C. The assembled Na3−yVPO2−xBrxF//hard‐carbon sodium‐ion full‐cell presents excellent specific energy/power (226 Wh kg−1@15424.2 W kg−1) as well as outstanding long‐term cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 5 C.",

        "abstract": "Advanced high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are inseparable from cathode materials with high specific capacities. Layered manganese‐rich oxides (NaxMnO2, 0.6 ≤ x ≤1) are promising cathode materials owing to their ease of intercalation and extraction of a considerable amount of sodium ions. However, lattice interactions, especially electrostatic repulsive forces and anisotropic stresses, are usually caused by deep desodiatin/sodiation process, resulting in intragranular cracks and capacity degradation in SIBs. Here, boron ions are introduced into the layered structure to build up B─O─Mn bonds. The regulated electronic structure in Na0.637B0.038MnO2 (B‐NMO) materials inhibits the deformation of MnO6 octahedra, which finally achieves a gentle structural transition during the deep sodiation process. B‐NMO electrode exhibits a high capacity (141 mAh g–1) at 1 C with a capacity retention of 81% after 100 cycles. Therefore, anchoring boron to manganese‐rich materials inhibits the detrimental structural evolution of deep sodiation and can be used to obtain excellent cathode materials for SIBs.",

The batteries based on the obtained CPFs indeed delivered much better electrochemical performance than the small molecular construction units without any complex post-treatments. The moderate BET surface area of CPFs and the detailed analyses suggested that the micropores and the lamellar structure should be responsible for the fast ionic diffusion. We believe that this work will provoke growing interest of CPFs for OSIBs with functional molecular design toward high performance and pave a venue to achieve OSIBs in large-scale applications.",

An example of HE-HCF with the formula of Na1.41Mn0.32Fe0.11Co0.28Ni0.32Cu0.32[Fe(CN)6]×2.89H2O has been synthesized as a proof of concept, which has achieved impressive cycling stability (~ 95% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles and 79.2% after 50,000 cycles) and an outstanding fast-charging capability up to 75 C. Remarkable air stability and all-climate performance are observed.

Herein, we for the first time simultaneously tune bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for reversible oxygen redox chemistry in P2-Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co-doping. O2- is oxidized to molecular O2 and peroxide (O-2)n- (n < 2) during charging. Molecular O2 derived from transition metal (TM) migration is related to the superstructure ordering induced by Li doping. The synergy mechanism of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/ Ti co-doping on the two O-redox modes is revealed. Firstly, Li2TiO3 coating restrains the surface O2 and inhibits O2 loss. Secondly, nonbonding Li-O-Na enhances the reversibility of O2-→(O2)n-. Thirdly, Ti doping strengthens the TM-O bond which fixes lattice oxygen. The cationic redox reversibility is also enhanced by Li/Ti co-doping. The proposed insights into the oxygen redox reversibility are insightful for other oxide cathodes.",

        "abstract": "NaCrO2 with high rate-capability is an attractive cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, the amount of reversibly extractable Na+ ions is restricted by half, which results in relatively low energy density for practical NIB cathodes. Herein, we describe aliovalent-doped O3–Na0.9[Cr0.9Sn0.1]O2 (NCSnO) and O3–Na0.8[Cr0.9Sb0.1]O2 (NCSbO), both of which show high-voltage characteristics that translate to an increase in energy density. In contrast to NaCrO2, NCSnO and NCSbO can be reversibly charged to 3.80 and 3.95 V, respectively, delivering 0.5 Na+ along with Cr3+/4+ redox alone. The reversible chargeability to Na0.4[Cr0.9Sn0.1]O2 and Na0.3[Cr0.9Sb0.1]O2 is not associated with the suppression of Cr6+ formation. Both compounds show concentrations of Cr6+ that are higher than that of Na0.3CrO2, with an absence of O3′ phases. This implies that aliovalent-doping contributes to a suppression of the Cr6+ migration into tetrahedral sites in the interslab space, which reduces the possibility of irreversible comproportionation. NCSnO and NCSbO deliver capacities comparable to that of NaCrO2, but show a higher average discharge voltage (2.94 V for NaCrO2; 3.14 V for NCSnO; 3.21 V for NCSbO), which leads to a noticeable increase in energy densities. The high-voltage characteristics of NCSnO and NCSbO are also validated via density-functional-theory calculations.",

However, the inherently poor electronic conductivity of phosphates compromises the electrochemical properties of this material. Here, we develop a general strategy to improve the electrochemical performance by preparing a new composite material \"polyaniline (PANI)@NVPF\" using a Pickering emulsion method. The X-ray diffraction and Raman results indicated a successful PANI coating without affecting the NASICON-type structure of NVPF, and they enhanced the interfacial bonding between the two components. Also, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed that the PANI content influenced the thermal stability and morphology of the nanocomposites. As a result, the sodium test cells exhibited multielectron reactions and a better rate performance for PANI@NVPF nanocomposites as compared to NVPF. Specifically, 2%PANI@NVPF maintained 70% of its initial capacity at 5C. Ex-situ electron paramagnetic resonance revealed the existence of mixed valence states of vanadium (V4+/V3+) in both discharge and charge processes. Consequently, the successful PANI coating into the sodium superionic conductor framework improved the sodium diffusion channels with a measurable increase of diffusion coefficients with cycling (ca. 3.25 × 10-11 cm2 s-1). Therefore, PANI@NVPF nanocomposites are promising cathode candidates for high-rate sodium-ion battery applications.",

        "abstract": "As a potential substitute for lithium-ion battery, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a tremendous amount of attention due to their advantages in terms of cost, safety and sustainability. Nevertheless, further improvement of the energy density of cathode materials in SIBs remains challenging and requires the activation of anion redox reaction (ARR) activity to provide additional capacity. Herein, we report a high-performance Mn-based sodium oxide cathode material, Na0.67Mg0.1Zn0.1Mn0.8O2 (NMZMO), with synergistic activation of ARR by cosubstitution. This material can deliver an ultra-high capacity of ∼233 mAh/g at 0.1 C, which is significantly higher than their single-cation-substituted counterparts and among the best in as-reported MgMn or ZnMn-based cathodes. Various spectroscopic techniques were comprehensively employed and it was demonstrated that the higher capacity of NMZMO originated from the enhanced ARR activity. Neutron pair distribution function and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments revealed that out-of-plane migration of Mg/Zn occurred upon charging and oxygen anions in the form of molecular O2 were trapped in vacancy clusters in the fully-charged-state. In NMZMO, Mg and Zn mutually interacted with each other to migrate toward tetrahedral sites, which provided a prerequisite for further ARR activity enhancement to form more trapped molecular O2. These findings provide unique insight into the ARR mechanism and can guide the development of high-performance cathode materials through ARR enhancement strategies.",

Nevertheless, the widespread use of such oxygen-related anionic redox is still precluded because of the oxygen release and the correlated irreversible structural transformations and voltage fade. To fundamentally unravel the related mechanism, we have investigated the corresponding anionic redox process based on a new P3-type layered material Na0.5Mg0.15Al0.2Mn0.65O2. Here, we prove an excellent structural stability via the operando/ex situ structural evolution within this cathode and further elucidate the complete anionic/cationic redox activity via both surface-sensitive (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and bulk-sensitive (X-ray absorption spectroscopy) spectroscopies. Moreover, based on the characterization of the ex situ state to the operando evolution for the whole anionic redox process by Raman and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, the nature of the reversible oxygen redox chemistry is clarified. Meanwhile, the origin of a small portion irreversible oxygen release generated upon the first charging and its resulting impact on subsequent processes are also fully illuminated.

        "abstract": "The abundant sodium resources makes sodium ion batteries have the potential to be an alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Due to the large ionic radius of sodium ion, suitable cathode materials have a significant impact on the electrochemical performance of sodium ion batteries. Herein, Cu0.18V2O5•0.72H2O/ Ketjen black, a double modification strategy of groups (Cu2+/H2O) intercalation and Ketjen black composition materials was successfully synthesized. Copper ions and water molecules co-inserted into the V2O5 interlayer to increase its spacing, thus increasing the active sites of Na+ ions intercalation and deintercalation. Meanwhile, the interlayer groups serve as “pillars” to improve the structural stability of the material. Ketjen black not only reduces particle aggregation but also enhances electrical conductivity of the material. As the cathode of sodium-ion batteries, the combination of these factors allows the cathode to exhibit high reversible specific capacity (up to 155 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and superior cycle performance. The fast and highly reversible Na+-ion intercalation/deintercalation mechanism was revealed by in situ XRD.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) used as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes are usually the focus of attention due to their three-dimensional open frame and high theoretical capacity. Nonetheless, the disadvantages of a low working voltage and inferior structural stability of PBAs prevent their further applications. Herein, we propose constructing the Kx(MnFeCoNiCu)[Fe(CN)6] (HE-K-PBA) cathode by high-entropy and potassium incorporation strategy to simultaneously realize high working voltage and cycling stability. The reaction mechanism of metal cations in HE-K-PBA are revealed by synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ Raman spectra. We also investigate the entropy stabilization mechanism via finite element simulation, demonstrating that HE-K-PBA with small von Mises stress and weak structure strain can significantly mitigate the structural distortion. Benefit from the stable structure and everlasting K+ (de)intercalation, the HE-K-PBA delivers high output voltage (3.46 V), good reversible capacity (120.5 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1), and capacity retention of 90.4% after 1700 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, the assembled full cell and all-solid-state batteries with a stable median voltage of 3.29 V over 3000 cycles further demonstrate the application prospects of the HE-K-PBA cathode.",

        "abstract": "One main challenge for phosphate cathodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is to increase the working voltage and energy density to promote its practicability. Herein, an advanced Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C cathode is prepared successfully for sodium-ion full cells. It is revealed that, carbon coating can not only enhance the electronic conductivity and electrode kinetics of Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C and inhibit the growth of particles (i.e., shorten the Na+-migration path), but also unexpectedly for the first time adjust the dis-/charging plateaux at different voltage ranges to increase the mean voltage (from 3.59 to 3.71 V) and energy density (from 336.0 to 428.5 Wh kg−1) of phosphate cathode material. As a result, when used as cathode for SIBs, the prepared Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C delivers much improved electrochemical properties in terms of larger specifc capacity (115.9 vs. 93.5 mAh g−1), more outstanding high-rate capability (e.g., 87.3 vs. 60.5 mAh g−1 at 10 C), higher energy density, and better cycling performance, compared to pristine Na3V2(PO4)2F3. Reasons for the enhanced electrochemical properties include ionicity enhancement of lattice induced by carbon coating, improved electrode kinetics and electronic conductivity, and high stability of lattice, which is elucidated clearly through the contrastive characterization and electrochemical studies. Moreover, excellent energy-storage performance in sodium-ion full cells further demonstrate the extremely high possibility of Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C cathode for practical applications.",

Of particular interest is the P3-type K_0.45Mn_0.8Cu_0.2O_2, which exhibited enhanced diffusion capability and improved structural stability, resulting in an impressive reversible capacity of 109 mAh g^−1 at 20 mA g^−1 within the voltage range of 1.5–4.0 V (Na^+/Na), superior rate capability of 74 mAh g^−1 at 500 mA g^−1, and excellent cycling performance with 86% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 20 mA g^−1. The substitution of Cu for Mn effectively mitigates Na^+/vacancy ordering and complex phase transition observed in P3-K_0.45MnO_2. Post-cycling phase characterization indicates the presence of excess K ions in the layers, contributing to the stabilization of the layered structure.

        "abstract": "In this work, for the performance enhancement of iron hexacyanoferrate, an electrochemically active Mn-doped iron hexacyanoferrate cathode is fabricated via a bottom-up approach. It is found that the pre-treatment of interstitial water and appropriate Mn doping are two keys to achieving higher capacity and higher stability. The interstitial water has a trade-off effect between the alleviation of volume expansion upon Na+ (de)intercalation and the retardation of Na-ion diffusion. The moisture-tailored iron hexacyanoferrate with appropriate Mn doping exhibits a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.8%, enhanced capacity and rate performance, and excellent cycling stability. These results benefit from the fact that the extraction/insertion of Na ions from/into the lattice via a solid-solution mechanism correspond to both the slight volume expansion and fast sodium diffusion rate; otherwise, the removal of interstitial water and a higher Mn content might lead to poor cycling stability due to excessive volume expansion resulting from rhombohedral to cubic phase transformation. Finally, the less demand on the control of air humidity for the fabrication of electrodes and the potential for the full cell coupled with hard carbon are also demonstrated, which shows great potential for practical applications.",

However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high‐rate performance and long‐cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1) and ultralong cycling life (>3000 circulations at 0.5 A g−1), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA‐based cathode materials. This study opens a new avenue for boosting sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in electrodes of rechargeable batteries and also provides a new paradigm for solving the dilemma that electrodes’ failure due to high‐stress concentration upon ion storage.",

However, NaxTMO2 still faces significant challenges, including poor kinetic performance and low energy efficiency. Herein, in order to enhance the kinetics of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NaNFMO), topography control and component design were proposed: First, Cu doping (Cu-NaNFMO) was used to expand lattice channels and improve “flat sheet” of layered oxide, which synergistically enhanced transport kinetics of Na+. Second, Co coating (NaNFMO@Co) reacted with surface residue to form a fast-ionic conductor NaxCoO2 (0 < x ≤ 1), which inhibited interfacial side reactions and enhanced transport kinetics of Na+. Furthermore, the presence of strong Cu-O bonds in Cu-NaNFMO and fast-ionic conductor NaxCoO2 in NaNFMO@Co led to better electrochemical redox performance, the initial charge specific capacity of NaNFMO was increased from 141.5 mAh g⁻1 to 145.8 mAh g⁻1 and 144 mAh g⁻1, with capacity retention improving by nearly 10 % after 100 cycles. Furthermore, NaNFMO@Co improves ICE from 90.56 % to 93.57 %. With the improved kinetics, the DCR of pouch cells decreased, and the energy efficiency increased from 93.3 % to 94 % and 95.7 %.",

This strategy is proven to effectively suppress V-ion migration and, as a consequence, enhance the reversibility of multielectron reactions. By combining electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques (in situ XRD, STEM, and XAFS), we investigated the changes in the composition, structural evolution, and distortion of the VO6 octahedral before and after cycling. Under a 1 C rate, the capacity retention after 500 cycles is increased from 52.3% to 85.7%, with significant suppression of voltage hysteresis and capacity fading.

However, reversible oxygen‐redox can only be obtained in the high‐voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal‐oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen‐redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V in a P2‐layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6□0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition‐metal (TM) sites and Mg‐ions are located in Na sites. Mg‐ions in the Na layer serve as “pillars” to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high‐voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of “□–O–□”, “Na–O–□” and “Mg–O–□” to trigger oxygen‐redox in the whole voltage range of charge–discharge. Time‐resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5–4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn‐ and O‐ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V, while the redox of Fe‐ions only contributes to the high‐voltage region of 3.0–4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM‐vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen‐redox, and Mg‐ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.",

In striking contrast to V2O5 NW cathodes obtained by annealing under air, the V8C7 NWs exhibit outstanding cycling stability during 500 cycles, and good rate capability for both LIBs and SIBs. V8C7 NWs as cathode active materials for LIBs exhibited 203.9 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C after 500 cycles, 91.12% cycling retention and a coulombic efficiency of 99.84%. As cathodes in SIBs, the V8C7 NWs delivered 176.34 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C during 300 cycles. Their defect sites by removal of the oxygen framework in V2O3 NWs have a high surface area (183.27 m2 g-1) and the unique 1D NW structure highly mitigates the volume changes during charge and discharge showing a superior electrochemical performance. Compared to commercially available cathodes, V8C7 nanowires have very good cycling stability and enhanced electrical conductivity. Moreover, the synergistic effect with 3D CCs utilized here as a current collector provides a large number of cation-accessible active sites in conjunction with high electrical conductivity and chemical stability.",

The spherical NaNi0.25Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.1Sn0.05Co0.05Li0.1O2 (SP-HEO) has been developed to address the challenges faced by O3-type layered oxide in sodium-ion batteries. The SP-HEO material is synthesized by piling and high entropy. The multiple strategies combine to enhance the electrochemical performance and air stability. The SP-HEO demonstrated a specific discharge capacity of 150.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and 100.4 mA h g-1 at 7 C. Ex situ XRD analysis confirmed that the SP-HEO effectively retards complex phase transitions. This study not only introduces a high-entropy design for high tap density spherical storage materials but also dispels industry concerns regarding the performance of sodium ion layered oxide cathode materials.",

        "title": "Origins of Irreversibility in Layered NaNixFeyMnzO2 Cathode Materials for Sodium Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Layered NaNixFeyMnzO2 cathode (NFM) is of great interest in sodium ion batteries because of its high theoretical capacity and utilization of abundant, low-cost, environmentally friendly raw materials. Nevertheless, there remains insufficient understanding on the concurrent local environment evolution in each transition metal (TM) that largely influences the reversibility of the cathode materials upon cycling. In this work, we investigate the reversibility of TM ions in layered NFMs with varying Fe contents and potential windows. Utilizing ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure of precycled samples, the valence and bonding evolution of the TMs are elucidated. It is found that Mn is electrochemically inactive, as indicated by the insignificant change of Mn valence and the Mn-O bonding distance. Fe is electrochemically inactive after the first five cycles. The Ni redox couple contributes most of the charge compensation for NFMs. Ni redox is quite reversible in the cathodes with less Fe content. However, the Ni redox couple shows significant irreversibility with a high Fe content of 0.8. The electrochemical reversibility of the NFM cathode becomes increasingly enhanced with the decrease of either Fe content or with lower upper charge cutoff potential.",

        "abstract": "A NASICON‐type Mn/F dual‐doping Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode material is successfully synthesized via a spray drying method. A medium‐spin of Fe is measured by DFT calculation, X‐ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), temperature‐dependent magnetization susceptibility (M−T) measurement, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests. It indicates that the eg orbital occupation of Fe2+ can be finely regulated, thus optimizing the bond strength between the oxidation and reduction processes. Furthermore, from UV−vis DRS and four‐point probe conductivity measurements, it can be seen that, after adjusting the electron spin states, the band gap of the material has decreased from 1.01 to 0.80 eV, and the electronic conductivity has increased from 8.5 to 24.4 µS cm−1, thereby leading to competitive electrochemical performance. The as‐optimized Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 displays both excellent rate performance (121.0 and 104.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and 5 C, respectively) and outstanding cycling stability (88.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C). The results indicate that this low‐cost Mn/F dual‐doping Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode can be a competitive candidate material for sodium‐ion batteries.",

The first-principles calculation results show that Cr3+ doping can reduce the band gap of FeF3·0.33H2O to improve its intrinsic conductivity. The discharge specific capacity of Fe0.95Cr0.05F3·0.33H2O with a narrowest band gap is 194.02 mA h/g at 0.1 C within the range of 1.4-4.0 V, which is higher than that of FeF3·0.33H2O (136.47 mA h/g).

        "abstract": "The air-sensitivity of transition metal oxide cathode materials (NaxTMO2, TM: transition metal) is a challenge for their practical application in sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage. However, the deterioration mechanism of NaxTMO2 under ambient air is unclear, which hinders the precise design of air-stable NaxTMO2. Here, we revealed the origin of NaxTMO2 degradation by capturing the initial degradation status and microstructural evolution under ambient atmospheres with optimal humidity. It was found that the insertion of CO2 into Na layers along (003) planes of NaxTMO2 led to initial growth of Na2CO3 nanoseeds between TM layers, which initiated fast structure degradation with surface cracks and extrusion of Na2CO3 out of NaxTMO2. The degradation extents and pathways for NaxTMO2 could be highly associated with crystal orientation, particle morphology, and ambient humidity. Interestingly, the deteriorated NaxTMO2 could be completely healed through optimal recalcination, showing even improved air-stability and electrochemical performance. This work provides a helpful perspective on the interfacical structure design of high-performance NaxTMO2 cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

Experiments and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that PBN has lower crystal water and volume expansion compared to Fe[Fe(CN)6] (PB). Also, N=O bond in PBN significantly reduces the diffusion potential of Na+ in the skeleton.

Increased interlayer spacing of Na+ can offer numerous active sites for Na+ insertion and extraction. P2-Na0.5Li0.1Ni0.2Mn0.7O2 exhibits an impressive initial discharge capacity of 139.1 mAh g−1 and 78.5 % capacity retention after 100cycles at 1.0C, which is a significant improvement compared to the pristine Na0.7Ni0.3Mn0.7O2.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathodes are identified as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high specific capacity and moderate operating voltage, yet it usually suffers from sluggish Na-ion diffusion and structure instability. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a trace Ti/Mg co-doped NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (TiMg-NFM) cathode, in which Ti-ion is distributed in transition metal layers and Mg-ion is doped into sodium layers. The co-doping can enlarge the Na-layer spacing inside the layered structure to reduce Na-ion diffusion barrier. Meanwhile, the structural stability is effectively reinforced via the stronger Ti-O bond and the pillar effect of Mg-ions, further reducing surface side reaction with electrolyte. These merits endow a high reversible capacity of the TiMg-NFM cathode with 144.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, and much higher capacity retention of 111.4 mAh g−1 at 5C versus the pristine NFM (62.1 mAh g−1). More impressively, 80.1% of initial capacity can be maintained after 300 cycles at 2C. This work presents a feasible strategy to enhance the reaction kinetics and structure stability for developing advanced O3-type layered oxide cathodes.",

        "abstract": "High‐voltage phase changes limit the capacity and cycle stability of P2‐type sodium‐layered transition metal oxides. In this study, Cu, Zn, and Mg ions are successfully co‐doped into Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to restrain the phase transition and increase Na+ diffusion with enhanced structural stability. In situ and ex situ evaluations elucidate the structural and charge compensation during high‐voltage operation. Remarkably, the resultant Na0.76Ni0.23Cu0.07Zn0.03Mn0.62Mg0.05O2 (NNCZMMO) cathode exhibits superior rate capability (135 and 94.0 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 5C), prolonged‐cycling stability (85.4% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 5C) and excellent air/water stability over 40 days. According to density functional theory (DFT), scanning transmisson electron microscopy (STEM), and other assessments, Cu at 2a sites strengthens the metal layer, whereas Zn/Mg on Na sites creates a “dual‐pillar” effect to avoid cracks and O2 phase formation during desodiation.

        "abstract": "One key challenge facing room temperature Na-ion batteries lies in identifying earth-abundant, environmentally friendly and safe materials that can provide efficient Na+ storage sites in Na-ion batteries. Herein, we report such a material, polyoxometalate Na2H8[MnV13O38] (NMV), with entirely different composition and structure from those cathode compounds reported before. Ex-situ XPS and FTIR analyses reveal that NMV cathode behaves like an \"electron/Na-ion sponge\", with 11 electrons/Na+ acceptability per mole, which has a decisive contribution to the high capacity. The extraordinary structural features, evidenced by X-ray crystallographic analysis, of Na2H8[MnV13O38] with a flexible 2D lamellar network and 1D open channels provide diverse Na ion migration pathways, yielding good rate capability. First-principle calculations demonstrate that a super-reduced state, [MnV13O38]20-, is formed with slightly expanded size (ca. 7.5%) upon Na+ insertion compared to the original [MnV13O38]9-. This \"ion sponge\" feature ensures the good cycling stability. Consequently, benefiting from the combinations of \"electron/ion sponge\" with diverse Na+ diffusion channels, when revealed as the cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, Na2H8[MnV13O38]/G exhibits a high specific capacity (ca. 190 mA h/g at 0.1 C), associates with a good rate capability (130 mA h/g at 1 C), and a good capacity retention (81% at 0.2 C). Our results promote better understanding of the storage mechanism in polyoxometalate host, enrich the existing rechargeable SIBs cathode chemistry, and enlighten an exciting direction for exploring promising cathode materials for Na-ion batteries.",

In this study, NaNi1/3Mn1/3−xFe1/3NbxO2 (NFM-Nb x, x = 0, 0.01, 0.02) precursor were synthesized through ball-milling spray drying method. The structure morphology characterization confirmed that Nb was successfully doped into the material and replaced part of Mn in the transition metal. The chemical valence analysis shows that Nb doping promoted the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+, and the increase of Mn3+ improved the ionic conductivity. NFM-Nb 0.01 significantly improved long cycle stability and rate capacity, the capacity of NFM-Nb 0.01 at 1 C and 5 C were 125.4 and 115.5 mAh g−1, respectively, and the corresponding cycle retention rate maintained 83. 81% and 83.12%.

        "abstract": "凭借其独特的3D骨架结构和卓越的循环稳定性，NASICON型Na3V2(PO4)2F3（NVPF）被认为是先进钠离子电池极具竞争力的正极材料。然而，在热处理过程中氟的释放导致形成额外的Na3V2(PO4)3（NVP）相，从而引发了低电压平台并损害其能量密度。本文通过Al取代V来调制V位的局部电子，从而增强F的稳定性。结果证实，Al的引入不仅改变了V位的局部电子态，使NVP副产物的形成从6.71 wt%显著降低到1.01 wt%，而且有效地减小了带隙，提高了NVPF材料的电子导电性。与原始正极材料相比，优化后的Na3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)2F3具有更高的能量密度（340 Wh·kg‒1）和更好的倍率性能（10C 下放电106.7 mAh·g‒1）。 With its unique 3D skeleton structure and exceptional cyclic stability, the Na^+ superionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3 (NVPF) has been considered as a competitive cathode material for advanced Na-ion batteries. However, the release of fluorine during the heat treatment leads to the formation of an additional phase Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 (NVP), which results in a low-voltage plateau and compromises the energy density. Herein, we modulate the local electronic states of the V site by aluminum substitution to strengthen the stability of F. The results confirm that the aluminum introduction not only changes the local electron states of V sites, significantly reducing the formation of NVP by-product from 6.71 wt% to 1.01 wt%, but also effectively reduces the band gap, improving the electronic conductivity of NVPF. The optimized Na_3V_1.9Al_0.1(PO_4)_2F_3 exhibits higher energy density of 340 Wh·kg^−1 and excellent rate performance of 106.7 mAh·g^−1 at 10C compared with the pristine cathode.

However, their low energy density compared with lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) hinders their practical applications. The high reactivity of high‐voltage cathodes, the primary factor, leads to deterioration of electrode/electrolyte interphase. Herein, a novel anion/cation solvation strategy is innovatively proposed for a ternary low‐concentration electrolyte that tackles the critical bottleneck of unstable electrode/electrolyte interphase. Especially, the intermolecular interaction within as‐designed electrolyte is remodeled by weakly polar fluorinated co‐solvent (ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene, PFPN) compared with traditional carbonate‐based electrolytes. PFPN can not only stabilize propylene carbonate (PC), reduce the interaction of Na+‐PC, ClO4−, accelerating Na+ desolvation, but also weaken the interaction of anions to form stable organic/inorganic composite cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). In this work, the ionic conductivity of low‐concentration electrolyte increases to 6.12 mS cm−1 and the oxidation stability is successfully extended to 4.84 V.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are a prospective sustainable alternative to the ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries due to the abundancy of sodium, and their cobalt free cathodes. The high nickel O3-type oxides show promising energy densities, however, a time dependency in the rheological properties of the composite electrode slurries is observed, which leads to inhomogeneous coatings being produced. A combination of electron microscopy and infra-red spectroscopy were used to monitor the O3-oxide surface changes upon exposure to air, and the effect upon the rheology and stability of the inks was investigated. Upon exposure to air, NaOH rather than Na2CO3 was observed on the surfaces of the powder through FTIR and EDS. The subsequent gelation of the slurry was initiated by the NaOH and dehydrofluorination with crosslinking of PVDF was observed through the reaction product, NaF. Approximately 15% of the CF bonds in PVDF undergo this dehydrofluorination to form NaF. As observed in the relaxation time of fitted rheological data, the gelation undergoes a three-stage process: a dehydrofluorination stage, creating saturated structures, a crosslinking stage, resulting in the highest rate of gelation, and a final crosslinking stage. This work shows the mechanism for instability of high nickel containing powders and electrode slurries, and presents a new time dependent oscillatory rheology test that can be used to determine the process window for these unstable slurry systems.",

Layered Mn-based cathode materials have significant application potential because of their simple structure and high specific capacities. Serious voltage attenuation and phase transition are the prominent problems of layered manganese-sodium ion batteries. To eliminate these issues, in this study, we investigated the effects of different Mn/Ni ratios in Na-Ni-Mn cathode materials on their structural stability and electrochemical performances. Na_0.8MnO_2 (NNM-8010), Na_0.8Ni_0.1Mn_0.9O_2 (NNM-819), Na_0.8Ni_0.2Mn_0.8O_2 (NNM-828), and Na_0.8Ni_0.3Mn_0.7O_2 (NNM-837) were synthesized and characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical analyses. The addition of Ni^2+ increased the Mn oxidation state from + 3 to + 4, thus reducing the Jahn–Teller effect of Mn^3+ and stabilizing the material structure. NNM-819 exhibited the best electrochemical performance. Its initial discharge-specific capacity was 198.5mAh g^−1 at a current density of 0.2C, and the capacity retention rate after 100 cycles was 86.9% at 0.5C.

        "abstract": "Currently, the construction of amorphous/crystalline (A/C) heterophase has become an advanced strategy to modulate electronic and/or ionic behaviors and promote structural stability due to their concerted advantages. However, their different kinetics limit the synergistic effect. Further, their interaction functions and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, a unique engineered defect‐rich V2O3 heterophase structure (donated as A/C‐V2O3−x@C‐HMCS) composed of mesoporous oxygen‐deficient amorphous − hollow core (A‐V2O3−x/HMC) and lattice‐distorted crystalline shell (C‐V2O3/S) encapsulated by carbon is rationally designed via a facile approach. Comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that the lattice distortion enlarges the porous channels for Na+ diffusion in the crystalline phase, thereby optimizing its kinetics to be compatible with the oxygen‐vacancy‐rich amorphous phase. This significantly reduces the high contrast of the kinetic properties between the crystalline and amorphous phases in A/C‐V2O3−x@C‐HMCS and induces the formation of highly dense A/C interfaces with a strong synergistic effect. As a result, the dense heterointerface effectively optimizes the Na+ adsorption energy and lowers the diffusion barrier, thus accelerating the overall kinetics of A/C‐V2O3−x@C‐HMCS. In contrast, the perfect heterophase (defects‐free) A/C‐V2O3@C‐HCS demonstrates sparse A/C interfacial sites with limited synergistic effect and sluggish kinetics. As expected, the A/C‐V2O3−x@C‐HMCS achieves a high rate and ultrastable performance (192 mAh g−1 over 6000 cycles at 10 A g−1) when employed for the first time as a cathode for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). This work provides general guidance for realizing dense heterophase cathode design for high‐performance SIBs and beyond.",

        "abstract": "For practical sodium-ion batteries, both high electrochemical performance and cost efficiency of the electrode materials are considered as two key parameters. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are broadly recognized as promising cathode materials due to their low cost, high theoretical capacity, and cycling stability, although they suffer from low-crystallinity-induced performance deterioration. Herein, a facile \"ice-assisted\" strategy is presented to prepare highly crystallized PBAs without any additives. By suppressing structure defects, the cathode exhibits a high capacity of 123 mAh g-1 with initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.2%, a long cycling lifespan of 3000 cycles, and significantly enhanced high/low temperature performance and calendar life. Remarkably, the low structure distortion and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been identified via in situ synchrotron powder diffraction and first-principles calculations, while its thermal stability has been analyzed by in situ heated X-ray powder diffraction. We believe the results could pave the way to the low-cost and large-scale application of PBAs in all-climate sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Due to their high capacity and sufficient Na+ storage, O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 has attracted much attention as a viable cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the challenges of complicated irreversible multiphase transitions, poor structural stability, low operating voltage, and an unstable oxygen redox reaction still limit its practical application. Herein, using O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5-xSnxO2 cathode materials as the research model, a universal strategy based on bridging microstructure engineering and local electronic structure manipulation is proposed. The strategy can modulate the physical and chemical properties of electrode materials, so as to restrain the unfavorable and irreversible multiphase transformation, improve structural stability, manipulate redox potential, and stabilize the anion redox reaction. The effect of Sn substitution on the intrinsic local electronic structure of the material is articulated by density functional theory calculations. Meanwhile, the universal strategy is also validated by Ti substitution, which could be further extrapolated to other systems and guide the design of cathode materials in the field of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Prussian white (PW) is one of the most promising candidates as a cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high theoretical capacity, excellent rate performance, and low production cost. However, PW materials suffer severe capacity decay during long-term cycling. In this work, a robust cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is designed on the PW cathode by employing cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP) and adiponitrile (ADN) as electrolyte additives. CDP and ADN possess higher highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (HOMO) than other solvents, leading to the preferential decomposition of CDP and ADN to construct an inorganics-rich CEI layer in situ on the PW cathode. Benefiting from this CEI layer, the degradation of PW is effectively inhibited during the long cycling. The Na||PW cell achieves an excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention of 85.62% after 1400 cycles. This work presented here provides a feasible strategy for improving the cycling performance of PW by electrolyte modification.",

To address these issues, nitrogen- and sulfur-co-doped reduced graphene oxide (NSrGO) sheet-decorated NVP was synthesized and incorporated into the carbon conductive network of the cathode material to enhance the performance of sodium-ion batteries. Different amounts of NSrGO (5, 10, and 20 wt.%) were used to decorate NVP microspheres through a ball milling technique. Characterization of the samples was conducted using SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, and TGA. The results indicated that the NVP-NSrGO composite, containing 10 wt.%, performed exceptionally well. NSrGO exhibited excellent rate performance and cycling stability, with a discharge capacity of 144 mAh g\n                     −1 at a rate of 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 91.6 % after 100 cycles at 1 C. The BB-5CNT||NVP-10NSrGO full cell demonstrated an impressive discharge capacity of 98.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and a long cycle life of up to 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10 C, due to reduced charge transfer resistance and a higher diffusion coefficient for Na+ in the NVP-10NSrGO electrode. This strategy of coating NVP combinations with N- and S-co-doped rGO provides a promising approach for improving cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) is a powerful operando method for analyzing side reactions in batteries. We describe our DEMS setup highlighting the relevance for implementing a reference electrode. Although the method provides valuable information, the correct assignment of the DEMS signals to types of gases and quantifying the amounts released can be challenging. A frequent limitation is that gas concentrations are calculated from single m/z ratios. This has the drawback of overlooking unexpected gases which can cause misinterpretation of the signal intensities, or even attributing to gases which are not actually formed. We present a multiple concentration determination (MCD) algorithm that uses the full MS‐spectra, which allows a more reliable determination of the gas release. We demonstrate this approach for Na‐ion half‐cells with P2‐Na0.67Mn3/4Ni1/4O2 (NaMNO) as cathode active material (CAM). Studying the gassing behavior for two electrolyte formulations (1 M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) and in diglyme (2G)). Against the general belief that glymes lead to more gassing at high potentials, we find that gas evolution for PC electrolytes is larger compared to 2G electrolytes. Dimethyl ether is found to be a decomposition product of 2G. Pressure change measurements are used to independently validate the gas quantification.",

        "abstract": "Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 has attracted considerable interest owing to its stable three-dimensional framework and high operating voltage; however, it suffers from a low-energy density due to the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity and limited redox couples. Herein, the partial substitution of Mn3+ for V3+ in Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 is proposed to activate V4+ /V5+ redox couple for boosting energy density of the cathodes (Na3 V2- x Mnx (PO4 )3 ). With the introduction of Mn3+ into Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 , the band gap is significantly reduced by 1.406 eV and thus the electronic conductivity is greatly enhanced. The successive conversions of four stable oxidation states (V2+ /V3+ , V3+ /V4+ , and V4+ /V5+ ) are also successfully achieved in the voltage window of 1.4-4.0 V, corresponding to three electrons involved in the reversible reaction. Consequently, the cathode with x = 0.5 exhibits a high reversible discharge capacity of 170.9 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C with an ultrahigh energy density of 577 Wh kg-1 . Ex-situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that the sodium-storage mechanism for Mn-doped Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 consists of single-phase and bi-phase reactions. This work deepens the understanding of the activation of reversible three-electron reaction in NASICON-structured polyanionic phosphates and provides a feasible strategy to develop high-energy-density cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the Na-ion SuperIonic CONductor (NASICON) based polyanionics are considered pertinent cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries due to their 3D open framework, which can accommodate a wide range of Na content and can offer high ionic conductivity with great structural stability. However, owing to the inferior electronic conductivity, these materials suffer from unappealing rate capability and cyclic stability for practical applications. Therefore, in this work we investigate the effect of Co substitution at the V site on the electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of Na3V2-xCox(PO4)3/C (x = 0-0.15) cathodes. All the samples are characterized through Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, etc. We demonstrate improved electrochemical performance for the x = 0.05 electrode with a reversible capacity of 105 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C. Interestingly, the specific capacity of 80 mAh g-1 is achieved at 10 C with retention of about 92% after 500 cycles and 79.5% after 1500 cycles and having nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. The extracted diffusion coefficient values through the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and cyclic voltammetry are found to be in the range of 10-9 to 10-11 cm2 s-1. The post-mortem studies show excellent structural and morphological stability after testing for 500 cycles at 10 C. Our study reveals the role of optimal dopant of Co3+ ions at the V site in improving the cyclic stability at a high current rate.",

        "abstract": "O3‐type layered transition metal cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their sufficient sodium reservoir. However, sluggish sodium ions kinetics and large voltage hysteresis, which are generally associated with Na+ diffusion properties and electrochemical phase transition reversibility, drastically minimize energy density, reduce energy efficiency, and hinder further commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Here, this work proposes a high‐entropy tailoring strategy through manipulating the electronic local environment within transition metal slabs to circumvent these issues. Experimental analysis combined with theoretical calculations verify that high‐entropy metal ion mixing contributes to the improved reversibility of redox reaction and O3–P3–O3 phase transition behaviors as well as the enhanced Na+ diffusivity. Consequently, the designed O3‐Na0.9Ni0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Mn0.2Ti0.15Cu0.05O2 material with high‐entropy characteristic could display a negligible voltage hysteresis (<0.09 V), impressive rate capability (98.6 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and long‐term cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 5 C). This work provides insightful guidance in mitigating the voltage hysteresis and facilitating Na+ diffusion of layered oxide cathode materials to realize high‐rate and high‐energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a novel modification strategy involving the replacement of Mn with Sc in the cathode of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM). The results of this study confirmed that Sc doping introduced strong Sc–O bonds to enhance the bonding between transition metal ions and O2−. Additionally, Sc doping reduced the proportion Mn3+ in the material (from 50.23% to 47.46%), thereby inhibiting the material structural distortion due to the Jahn–Teller effect induced by Mn3+. These factors were the main contributors to the improved cycling performance of the modified material. Furthermore, the introduction of Sc decreased the band gap of the material (1.7416–1.6706 eV) and the Na+ activation barrier energy (0.773–0.732 eV). These changes not noly facilitated the de-embedding of Na+ in the material lattice but also significantly enhanced the material electronic conductivity, leading to an excellent rate performance of the modified material. These results indicate that the NFM-Sc0.01 sample maintained an ultra-high capacity retention of 86.45% after 200 cycles at 1 C. At 5 C, the discharge capacity of NFM-Sc0.01 significantly increased from 79.3 mAh g−1 in NFM to 93.4 mAh g−1, demonstrating great potential for industrialized applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxide cathodes can uniquely benefit from the existing lithium‐ion battery industry as sodium‐ion batteries gain traction as a potential low‐cost, drop‐in replacement. However, achieving relevant energy density with a suitable cycle life remains a challenge for sodium layered oxides. At high operating potentials, several competing degradation mechanisms prevent P2‐type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (≈550 Wh kg−1) from achieving meaningful cycle life—with bulk structural instability and surface reactivity being the primary retractors. Herein, the issue of particle cracking is addressed through detailed synthesis methods of “single‐crystal” materials. By comparison to a polycrystalline baseline, the single‐crystal materials quantify the capacity loss due to isolation of active material caused by intergranular particle cracking. The single crystal materials are then employed in cells with an advanced, “localized saturated electrolyte” (LSE) to demonstrate the magnitude of capacity loss due to electrolyte decomposition at the cathode surface. Mitigation of the surface reactivity through the LSE electrolyte effectively demonstrates the elevated importance of surface reactivity at high voltages despite the onset of egregious particle cracking. This work aims to guide future research into understanding molten‐salt assisted syntheses and advance the debate on surface versus bulk degradation.",

        "abstract": "Mn-based sodium superionic conductors have driven attention to the low-cost advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, low-rate capability and unsatisfactory cyclic performance due to the Jahn teller effect of Mn3+ redox couple which occurs from the change in Mn-O bond length at the octahedral site of crystal structure during charge-discharge, eventually limiting their application. Herein, a disordered and sodium deficient NASICON Na4-xMn(FeVCrTi)0.25(PO4)3 (termed as Na4-xMn(HE)) is synthesized to mitigate this Jahn teller effect to achieve high rate and ultrastable cathode material. Interestingly, the as-prepared Na3.5Mn(HE) shows five reversible electron reactions (i.e., Ti3+/Ti4+, Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, Mn2+/Mn3+, and Mn3+/Mn4+) and demonstrates 141 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C with 80% capacity retention at 1 C after 500 cycles which is far superior to its counterparts binary Mn-based materials. The excellent cyclic performance is due to the remediation of the Jahn teller effect in sodium-deficient entropy-stabilized material. The structural reversibility, enhanced kinetics, and electronic properties are further studied in detail by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and first principal calculations. Na3.5Mn(HE)//HC full cell delivered 89.7 mAh g-1 capacity at 0.2 C. This work sheds light on designing Mn-based cathodes with superior electrochemical performance for wide energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "NASICON-type Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 (NVP) has attracted considerable attention as the cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to three-dimensional open frameworks and high power density. However, the low electronic conductivity severely limits its reversible capacity and rate capability. Here, two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (GO) as a desired self-template was rationally utilized to inductively prepare flake-shaped NVP@C composites via a facile sol–gel route and solid-state reaction. The surface morphology, crystal structure, and pore size distribution of pristine NMCP and as-synthesized NMCP/rGO composite cathode are identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The highly conductive graphene network offers fast electron transfer, while the rGO-induced lamellar structure benefits for Na^+ migration during redox reactions. The performance of half cell in an aqueous electrolyte is evaluated, and the optimized rGO-NVP@C exhibits a capacity of 142.2 mAhg^−1 at 0.2 C. It performs an initial capacity of 142.2 mAhg^−1 at 0.2 C, retaining 95.5% after 100 cycles. Moreover, the rGO-NVP@C//AC battery exhibited energy density of 29.2 Whkg^−1 at 1 C. The rGO-NVP@C electrode showed outstanding cycling performance and superior rate capability. As a result, the sodium storage performance of NVP was largely improved by rGO coatings. As such, it is regarded as a promising material for improving the electrodes of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Iron‐based pyrophosphates are attractive cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries due to their large framework, cost‐effectiveness, and high energy density. However, the understanding of the crystal structure is scarce and only a limited candidates have been reported so far. In this work, we found for the first time that a continuous solid solution, Na4−αFe2+α/2(P2O7)2 (0 ≤ α ≤ 1, could be obtained by mutual substitution of cations at center‐symmetric Na3 and Na4 sites while keeping the crystal building blocks of anionic P2O7 unchanged. In particular, a novel off‐stoichiometric Na3Fe2.5(P2O7)2 is thus proposed, and its structure, energy storage mechanism, and electrochemical performance are extensively investigated to unveil the structure–function relationship. The as‐prepared off‐stoichiometric electrode delivers appealing performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 83 mAh g−1, a working voltage of 2.9 V (vs. Na+/Na), the retention of 89.2% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles, and enhanced rate capability of 51 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1600 mA g−1. This research shows that sodium ferric pyrophosphate could form extended solid solution composition and promising phase is concealed in the range of Na4−αFe2+α/2(P2O7)2, offering more chances for exploration of new cathode materials for the construction of high‐performance SIBs.",

However, its application has been restricted owing to unstable structure and poor cycling performance. Herein, the multi-element doped hexagonal sheet Ni/Mn-based layered oxide with ZrO2 surface modification O3-NaNi0.3Mn0.5-xFe0.1Cu0.1ZrxO2@ZrO2 (NFMCZ-x) cathode materials have been successfully synthesize by high temperature calcination method accompanied by ball milling activation. XRD refinement results show Zr4+ substitution of Mn3+ can increase interlayer distance of sodium layer. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of multi-element doping and ZrO2 surface modification, the optimized NFMCZ-0.03 sample exhibits a higher discharge capacity of 178 mAh/g at 0.1C and good capacity retention (77 % after 50 cycles at 2C). Furthermore, NFMCZ-0.03 has an excellent air stability with a capacity retention rate of 86 % during 50 cycles at 1C after being exposed in the air for 20 days. The ex-situ XRD results of NMFC at different charge/discharge voltages show Zr4+ doping can suppress O3 + P3′'–O3′-O3 + P3′' phase transition during charge/discharge process. These results confirm that synergistic effect of multi-doping combined with surface modification can improve electrochemical performance of layered oxides cathodes, which provides a research idea for development of Ni/Mn-based layered oxides cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

Here, an air-stable single-crystal P2-type Na_2/3Ni_1/3Mn_1/3Ti_1/3O_2 is proposed based on the multifunctional structural modulation of Ti substitution that could alleviate the issues for practical SIBs. As a result, the cathode with high energy density shows excellent air stability and highly reversible phase transitions (P2-OP4), and delivers faster kinetics and stable anion redox chemistry. Meanwhile, a thorough investigation of the relationship between structure, function, and properties is demonstrated, emphasizing formation processes, electrochemical behavior, structural evolution, and air stability. Overall, this study provides the direction of multifunctional structural modulation for the development of high-performance sodium-based layered cathode materials for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Due to a high energy density, layered transition‐metal oxides have gained much attention as the promising sodium‐ion batteries cathodes. However, they readily suffer from multiple phase transitions during the Na extraction process, resulting in large lattice strains which are the origin of cycled‐structure degradations. Here, we demonstrate that the Na‐storage lattice strains of layered oxides can be reduced by pushing charge transfer on anions (O2−). Specifically, the designed O3‐type Ru‐based model compound, which shows an increased charge transfer on anions, displays retarded O3–P3–O1 multiple phase transitions and obviously reduced lattice strains upon cycling as directly revealed by a combination of ex situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ X‐ray diffraction and geometric phase analysis. Meanwhile, the stable Na‐storage lattice structure leads to a superior cycling stability with an excellent capacity retention of 84% and ultralow voltage decay of 0.2 mV/cycle after 300 cycles. More broadly, our work highlights an intrinsically structure‐regulation strategy to enable a stable cycling structure of layered oxides meanwhile increasing the materials' redox activity and Na‐diffusion kinetics.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are becoming an alternative option for large-scale energy storage systems owing to their low cost and abundance. The lattice oxygen redox (LOR), which has the potential to increase the reversible capacity of materials, has promoted the development of high-energy cathode materials in SIBs. However, the utilization of oxygen anion redox reactions usually results in harmful lattice oxygen release, which hastens structural deformation and declines electrochemical performance, severely hindering their practical application. Herein, a ribbon-ordered superstructured P3-type Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 (NLMO) cathode with a uniform Al2O3 coating through atomic layer deposition (ALD) was synthesized. The cycling stability and rate capability of the materials were improved by a proper thickness of the Al2O3 layer. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) results clearly suggest that the Al2O3 coating can inhibit the CO2 release caused by the highly active surface of the NLMO material. Moreover, the results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and etching X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) show that the Al2O3 coating can effectively prevent electrolyte and electrode side reactions and the dissolution of Mn. This surface engineering strategy sheds light on the way to prolong the cycling stability of anionic redox cathode materials.",

Prussian White (PW) with formula NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]y•nH2O is leading the trend, having already been commercialized. However, capacity fade (PW/electrolyte degradation) and safety concerns (cyanide/cyanogen release) still raise concerns. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry, supported by both operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy, is herein used to analyze degradation processes in PW‐based Na‐ion full cells. Apart from the typical cell formation reactions, hydrogen is observed to evolve during cell discharge and evidenced to stem from oxidation of NaH, accumulated upon charge. Over‐oxidation of PW after full desodiation releases CN, which not only forms (CN)2 but also degrades the electrolyte. Loss of CN likely results in a nanometric (≈4 nm) surface‐reconstructed passivation layer on PW, thus inhibiting further degradation. Fundamental understanding of degradation reactions in PW full‐cells, as gathered herein, shows that the aforementioned capacity fade and safety concerns are wholly addressable and hence guides the further development of Na‐ion batteries for wider ranges of applications.",

Results show that the active elements are fully exploited in Na-HE, with a two-electron reaction by Ni2+/4+ (further extended to Cu redox and even oxygen redox), vastly different from a one-electron reaction of Ni2+/3+ in NLNM. The full utilization of the active elements dramatically improves the output capacity of the cathode (122.6 mAh g-1 of Na-HE versus 81 mAh g-1 of NLNM). Moreover, the detrimental phase transition is well suppressed in Na-HE. The cathode exhibits high capacity retention of 88.7% after 100 cycles at 130 mA g-1, compared to only 36.4% for NLNM.

        "abstract": "Co‐free O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries has shown great promise due to its high theoretical capacity and plentiful Na reservoir. However, the rapid capacity recession caused by harmful phase transition and large volume strain severely restricts their practical application. Herein, the obstacle is well addressed by constructing a P2&O3 biphasic structure via a customized boron‐doping strategy. The light‐weight boron doping in the interstitial position reduces the energy gap of the formation energy of P2 and O3 structure, which induces the formation of P2&O3 biphase in high Na state. In addition, the biphasic structure exhibits near zero volume strain due to the lattice interlocking effect of P2&O3, as identified by in situ X‐ray diffraction measurement. As a result, it presents a remarkable cyclability with a capacity retention of 85.2% over 1000 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. More importantly, a pouch‐type full‐cell device can exhibit a long cycling life with 70.8% capacity retention over 150 cycles at 0.1 C. This work can offer a new inspiration for designing advanced high sodium electrode materials via light element doping for future energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The development of the electric vehicle industry has spurred demand for secondary batteries capable of rapid‐charging and slow‐discharging. Among them, sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with layered oxide as the cathode exhibit competitive advantages due to their comprehensive electrochemical performance. However, to meet the requirements of rapid‐charging and slow‐discharging scenarios, it is necessary to further enhance the rate performance of the cathode material to achieve symmetrical capacity at different rates. Simultaneously, minimizing lattice strain during asymmetric electrochemical processes is also significant in alleviating strain accumulation. In this study, the ordered distribution of transition metal layers and the diffusion pathway of sodium ions are optimized through targeted K‐doping of sodium layers, leading to a reduction of the diffusion barrier and endowment of prominent rate performance. At a 20C rate, the capacity of the cathode can reach 94% of that at a 0.1C rate. Additionally, the rivet effect of the sodium layers resulted in a global volume strain of only 0.03% for the modified cathode during charging at a 10C rate and discharging at a 1C rate. In summary, high‐performance SIBs, with promising prospects for rapid‐charging and slow‐discharging capability, are obtained through the regulation of sodium layers, opening up new avenues for commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with Mn-based oxide cathodes have attracted much interest because of their cost effectiveness, minimal toxicity, and remarkable electrochemical activity. The typical tunnel Na0.44MnO2 cathode for SIBs exhibits stable cycling performance, but its low sodium content hinders the practical application. And the other NaxMnO2 cathodes with layered structures provide higher capacity but less satisfactory cycling. Therefore, it is of great significance to construct Mn-based oxide cathodes to integrate high specific capacity layered structure and high stability tunnel structure. Herein, the strategy of breaking the Mn3+/Mn4+ equilibrium in Na0.44MnO2 via doping trace amounts of Mo was proposed to promote the transformation from the original tunnel to the layered structure and to in-situ construct a layered/tunnel biphasic interlocking structure. The optimized interlocking layered/tunnel Na0.44Mn0.97Mo0.03O2 (NMO-3M) cathode integrates the advantages of layered and tunnel structures, and achieves highly reversible phase transition and excellent electrochemical performance, which delivers a high specific capacity of 178.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and capacity retention of 77.8 % after 100 cycles at 1 C. The well-maintained P2 phase was revealed by the in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), demonstrating the highly reversible charge compensation and structural evolution. In addition, NMO-3M cathode shows a good storage performance in air over 270 days. This research designed a layered/tunnel interlocking structure induced by trace Mo doping to construct a stable and high capacity oxide cathode, providing a guideline for the preparation of excellent oxide cathodes for SIBs in the future.",

        "title": "NASICON-Type NaTi2(PO4)3 Surface Modified O3-Type NaNi0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 for High-Performance Cathode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have shown great potential as energy storage devices due to their low price and abundant sodium content. Among them, O3-type layered oxides are a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries; however, most of them suffer from slow kinetics and unfavorable structural stability, which seriously hinder their practical application. O3-NaNi0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 surface modification is performed by a simple wet chemical method of coating NaTi2(PO4)3 on the surface. The NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer has a special three-dimensional channel, which facilitates the rapid migration of Na+, and the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer also prevents direct contact between the electrode and the electrolyte, ensuring the stability of the interface. In addition, the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer induces part of the Ti4+ doping into the transition metal layer of NaNi0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5O2, which increases the stability of the transition metal layer and reduces the resistance of Na+ diffusion. More importantly, the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer can suppress the O3-P3 phase transition and reduce the volume change of the materials throughout the charge/discharge process. Thus, the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the cathode materials. The NFM@NTP3 has a capacity retention of 86% (2.0-4.0 V vs Na+/Na, 300 cycles) and 85% (2.0-4.2 V vs Na+/Na, 100 cycles) at 1C and a discharge capacity of 107 mAh g-1 (2.0-4.0 V vs Na+/Na) and 125 mAh g-1 (2.0-4.2 V vs Na+/Na) at 10C, respectively. Therefore, this surface modification strategy provides a simple and effective way to design and develop high-performance layered oxide cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Zero-Strain Sodium Nickel Ferrocyanide as Cathode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries with Ultra-Long Lifespan.",
        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues are recognized as one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to the open 3D framework structure with large interstitial sites and developed Na-ion diffusion channels. However, high content of anion vacancy and poor structural stability have hampered the prospect of their application. In this work, sodium nickel ferrocyanide (Na1.34Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.92, NNHCF) is proposed as cathode material for SIBs. N-coordinated Ni-ion can boost NNHCF to possess less Fe[(CN)6]4- defect, low Na-ion migration barrier, and more negative formation energy compared with Na0.91Cu[Fe(CN)6]0.77 (NCHCF), thus exhibiting more active sites, fast electrochemical kinetics behavior and great structure stability. It is confirmed that NNHCF undergoes a solid solution mechanism without phase evolution for reversible Na-ion intercalation/deintercalation, employing Fe associated with C atom as redox center for charge compensation. Therefore, NNHCF contributes a high initial energy density of 180.94 Wh·g-1 at 10 mA·g-1, excellent rate capability, superior cycling stability with ultra-long lifespan of 13 000 cycles, and low fading rate of 0.0027% per cycle at 500 mA·g-1. This work sheds light on the construction of low-defect PBA cathodes with outstanding dynamics and stability.",

The presence of copper(II) ion partially contributes the charge storage and significantly stabilizes the structure of porphyrin complex for electrochemical energy storage. The electrochemical polymerization of porphyrin complex through the ethynyl groups in self-stabilization process contributes to high rate capability and excellent cycling stability. Abstract Sodium-organic batteries utilizing natural abundance of sodium element and renewable active materials gain great attentions for grid-scale applications. However, the development is still limited by lack of suitable organic cathode materials with high electronic conductivity that can be operated stably in liquid electrolyte. Herein, we present 5,15-bis(ethynyl)-10,20-diphenylporphyrin (DEPP) and [5,15-bis(ethynyl)-10,20-diphenylporphinato]copper(II) (CuDEPP) as new cathodes for extremely stable sodium-organic batteries. The copper(II) ion partially contributes the charge storage and significantly stabilizes the structure of porphyrin complex for electrochemical energy storage. In situ electrochemical stabilization of organic cathode with a lower charging current density was identified which enables both improved high energy density and power density. An excellent long-term cycling stability up to 600 cycles and an extremely high power density of 28 kW kg^−1 were achieved for porphyrin-based cathode. This observation would open new pathway for developing highly stable sodium-organic cathode for electrochemical energy storage.",

P2‐type sodium deficient transition metal oxide structure, Na0.67Mn1‐xRuxO2 cathodes where x varied between 0.05 and 0.5 are fabricated. The partially substituted main phase where x = 0.4 exhibits the best electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of ≈170 mAh g−1. The in situ X‐ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and time‐resolved X‐ray Diffraction (TR‐XRD) measurements are performed to elucidate the neighborhood of the local structure and lattice parameters during cycling. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the oxygen‐rich structure when Ru is introduced. Density of States (DOS) calculations revealed the Fermi‐Level bandgap increases when Ru is doped, which enhances the electronic conductivity of the cathode. Furthermore, magnetization calculations revealed the presence of stronger Ru─O bonds and the stabilizing effect of Ru‐doping on MnO6 octahedra. The results of Time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectroscopy (TOF‐SIMS) revealed that the Ru‐doped sample has more sodium and oxygenated‐based species on the surface, while the inner layers mainly contain Ru–O and Mn–O species.

Even at 10C, it exhibits a capacity of 60.1 mAh·g-1 between 2 and 4.1 V, maintaining 70.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles, showcasing impressive rate performance and cycling stability.

        "abstract": "Layered sodium manganese-based oxides are appealing cathode candidates due to their high capacity and cost-effectiveness, yet performance degradation related with unwanted structural evolution still remains a disturbing disadvantage. Herein, atomic resolution STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) images of Na-extracted Na2/3NixCo1/3-xMn2/3O2 (x = 0, 1/6, 1/3) are collected and analyzed, to decipher the effect of cobalt and nickel substitution on the structural integrity of layered manganese-based oxides. Cobalt substitution is demonstrated to alleviate the lattice stress and retain the layered structure after sodium removal, and only a local P2-to-O2 phase transition could be identified. By contrast, various types of defects and phase transformation, including rarely reported P2-to-O3, are discovered in the Ni-substituted oxides. The generation of spinel and rock-salt phases is the critical evidence of cation mixing that leads to unrecoverable capacity loss. The interplay of different transition metals is complex, and compositional optimization is encouraged to minimize the effect of the concomitant phase transition.",

However, its poor cycling stability still remains a major bottleneck. Herein, P2/O3 biphasic Na0.67Fe0.425Mn0.425Cu0.15O2 layered oxide is successfully synthesized via a sol–gel method. It is observed that Cu substitution can facilitate the conversion of P2 to O3 phase, and the P2/O3 composite structure can be obtained with an appropriate amount of Cu. Meanwhile, in-situ XRD reveals that constructing P2/O3 composite structure can realize the highly reversible phase transition process of P2/O3–P2/P3–OP4/OP2 and decrease the lattice mismatch during Na+ insertion/extraction. Consequently, the biphasic P2/O3-Na0.67Fe0.425Mn0.425Cu0.15O2 electrode exhibits 87.1 % capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C, while the single phase P2-Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 electrode has only 36.4 %.

Herein, a new strategy of introducing Mg ions into the hinging sites of Mn‐based tunnel‐structured cathode material is designed. Highly reversible electrochemical reaction and phase transition in this cathode are realized. The resulted Na0.44Mn0.95Mg0.05O2 with Mg2+ in the hinging Mn‐O5 square pyramidal exhibits promising cycle stability and rate capability. At a current density of 2 C, 67% of the initial discharge capacity is retained after 800 cycles (70% at 20 C), much improved than the undoped Na0.44MnO2. The improvement is attribute to the enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and the lowered desodiation energy after Mg doping. Highly reversible charge compensation and structure evolution are proved by synchrotron‐based X‐ray techniques. Differential charge density and atom population analysis of the average electron number of Mn indicate that Na0.44Mn0.95Mg0.05O2 is more electron‐abundant in Mn 3d orbits near the Fermi level than that in Na0.44MnO2, leading to higher redox participation of Mn ions.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based spinel cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for next-generation batteries. Unfortunately, most SIB cathode materials exhibit inferior electrochemical properties and are less understood owing to their lower performance. Na[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O4 (NNMO) should be a promising candidate because of its high operating voltage and firm octahedral host structure. Compared with Li[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O4, first-principle calculations are conducted to elucidate the reasons for the low performance of NNMO and determine the requirements for realizing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs. Owing to the Ni2+/Ni4+ double redox, NNMO could operate at a high voltage; however, the large Na+ increases the local site energy of the redox center, promoting electron extraction from the redox center, leading to unexpected voltage loss. Additionally, the homogeneous free energy confirms that NNMO would undergo phase separation into fully intercalated and deintercalated phases, inducing lattice misfits along the interfaces of the two phases. Particularly, higher phase transition barrier and large Na+ cause fast phase separation, inducing increased polarization and severe stress field upon cycling. Strategies to improve manganese-based spinel cathode materials of SIBs, especially NNMO, must be differentiated by considering the effects of thermodynamic stability, structural evolution, and electronic structure on the electrochemical and cycle performance of cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Layered sodium iron manganese oxide cathodes have attracted great interest owing to their high specific capacity and cost-effective metal resources, while the detrimental phase transitions and surface structural degradation severely limit their commercial applications. In this work, the bulk and surface structure stability of a P2-Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode can be synergically enhanced by a one-step Li/Nb co-doping strategy. Structural characterizations reveal that Li doping promotes the formation of P2/O3 biphasic structure and makes the unfavorable P2-OP4 phase transition convert into a smooth solid-solution reaction. Nb doping enhances the mobility of sodium ions and forms strong Nb-O bonds, thereby enhancing the stability of the TMO2 layer structure. In particular, the Nb element induces the surface reorganization of an atomic-scale NaNbO3 coating layer, which could effectively prevent the dissolution of metals and surface side reactions. The synergistic mechanism of enhanced electrochemical performance is proved by multiple characterizations during cycling. As a result, the as-prepared Na0.67Li0.1Fe0.5Mn0.38Nb0.02O2 exhibits improved capacity retention of 85.4 % than raw material (45.7 %) after 100 cycles at 0.5C (1C = 174 mA g−1) within 2.0–4.0 V. This co-regulating strategy provides a promising approach to designing highly stable sodium-ion battery cathodes. Furthermore, a full cell of Na0.67Li0.1Fe0.5Mn0.38Nb0.02O2 with hard carbon displays excellent cycling stability (85.1 % capacity retention after 100 cycles), making its commercial operation possible. This synergistic strategy of biphasic structure and surface reorganization is a critical route to accelerate the application of layer oxide cathodes.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of a superlattice structure into layered oxide cathode materials is a novel strategy to improve the structural stability of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the superlattice structure gradually disappears during cycling, which shortens the long life of SIBs. Here, the highly electronegative Zn is introduced into a P2-type layered oxide to regulate the superlattice structure. The obtained P2-Na0.80Li0.13Ni0.20Zn0.03Mn0.64O2 exhibits excellent cycling performance (the capacity retention is 96.7% after 100 cycles at 0.5C) and rate capability (95.8 mAh g-1 at 5C). Zn effectively inhibits the Li migration and the Mn dissolution, which ensures the integrity of the Li/Mn superlattice structure during long cycling, thus achieving an ultralong cycling life of SIBs. The introduction of Zn dramatically increases the length of the c-axis, leading to a faster de-embedding rate of Na+ and a better diffusion kinetics. Meanwhile, the larger pristine volume can withstand more stress/strain due to the sharp increase in the level of O-O repulsion during the desodiation process. In addition, Raman test results show that Zn can inhibit the Na+/vacancy ordering transition and improve the structural stability. This study confirms the feasibility of a Zn-regulated superlattice structure. It provides inspiration for the construction of stable layered oxide cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layered iron (Fe) ‐based fluorophosphates, Na2FePO4F (NFPF) stands for a cost‐effective and voltage‐advantageous cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, the lack of stability imposes constraints on its development and the decay mechanism remains shrouded in ambiguity. Herein, this work proposes the breakup of Fe─F bond in octahedral dimer accountable for the dissolution of redox centers and the formation of electrochemically inert phase, ultimately leading to the deterioration of electrochemical stability. To verify and address this, Boron (B) atoms situated in interstitial positions of PO4 tetrahedra appearing trigonal BO3 can be specifically targeted to enhance bond covalency and tailor electronic rearrangements at Fe─F bonds, thus stabilizing the octahedral dimer structure. This also facilitates rapid Na+ diffusion dynamics and accelerated electronic conductivity. As expected, NFPF‐B exhibits an ultra‐high discharge specific capacity (118.34 mAh g−1 at 0.1C) and excellent long‐term durability (capacity retention of 91.9% after 1000 cycles). The stability of the octahedra dimer is underscored by minimal volume change (2.9%) within the two‐stage biphase reaction of sodium storage mechanism. This work elucidates the enduring degradation mechanism of NFPF from octahedral dimers and offer theoretical guidance for Fe‐based cathode materials with prolonged stability.",

        "abstract": "The Na2+2xFe2-x(SO4)3 (NFS) cathode has garnered significant attention due to its high voltage and affordability. Nevertheless, the low intrinsic conductivity of the NFS results in poor electrochemical properties. In this work, magnesium ions with low electronegativity are strategically incorporated into the iron sites. There is an increased tendency for electrons to migrate toward the bridging oxygen atom (Fe-O-Mg). This asymmetric distribution of electrons is conducive to the reduction of band gap and the improvement of diffusion kinetics. Besides, the s-p orbital hybridization in Mg-O bonds has a lower energy, leading to a more stable lattice structure and strengthened Fe3d-O2p orbital interactions. Hence, the optimised Mg substituted NFS cathode obtains high capacity (96.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C) and long cycle stability with low average capacity attenuation rates of 0.52 % and 0.57 % per cycle even at high current densities of 10 C and 20 C. Overall, regulating electronic structure through strengthened d–p orbital hybridization is an effective strategy to design cathode materials with superior electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Due to the layered structure and high energy density, transition metal oxides are considered as potential cathode materials for sodium ion batteries. In particular, transition metal oxides with P2 and O3 structures exhibit unique performance characteristics. P2-type materials, while air-stable, possess relatively lower electrochemical capacities. In contrast, O3-type materials exhibit higher capacities but suffer from inadequate kinetic performance. Recent studies have focused on structural modulation through atomic substitution, leading to the successful design of high-performance biphasic (P2/O3) composite cathode materials. In this study, by adjusting the Ni/Mn ratio, a series of Na0.95NixMn1-xO2 (x = 0.475, 0.4, 0.325) samples were synthesized, achieving a controllable phase transition from the O3 phase to the P2 phase. A unique biphasic structure containing 38.9 % of P2 phase and 61.1 % of O3 phase shows better capacity and cycling performance in the voltage range of 2.0–4.2 V (159/112 mAh g−1, 500 cycles at 1C, average capacity loss of 0.062 % per cycle) compared with the other two materials due to the coexistence of the P-phase and the O-phase and the synergistic effect between them. This research not only expands our understanding of the design principles for sodium-ion battery cathode materials but also offers a new perspective on enhancing sodium-ion battery performance through optimization of cathode material structures.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxides are successful cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries. Many of these oxides show interesting kinetic behavior but have poor structural stability. To overcome this limitation, an alternative material containing potassium in the interlayer space in trigonal prismatic coordination is studied here. The transition‐metal layers are formed by sustainable transition elements such as iron and manganese. The solid was prepared using a sol–gel procedure that led to a product with relatively high purity, with a Pʹ3‐type structure indexable in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic system. Its electrochemical behavior was studied in sodium metal half‐cells. When the cell is charged up to 4.3 V, it is observed that the potassium extraction is not complete. The subsequent discharge of the cell is associated with the intercalation of sodium from the electrolyte. Thus, it is possible to incorporate a greater number of alkaline ions than those extracted in the previous charge. The residual potassium in the structure was found to be favorable to maintaining the structural integrity of the compound upon cycling. This can be explained by the beneficial effect of potassium, which would act as a structural “pillar” in the interlayer, which would reduce structural degradation during cycling.",

Despite the promise of O3-type sodium oxygen anionic redox cathodes as high-capacity materials, their development has been severely hindered by a lack of understanding regarding synthetic mechanisms. Here, we elucidate the pivotal role of atmospheric conditions, particularly oxygen content, in the synthesis of such materials by synchronizing multiple operando characterization techniques to monitor changes in both solid and gaseous components. Utilizing the O3-Na[Li_1/3Mn_2/3]O_2 system as a model, we demonstrate that a low oxygen environment is essential and the reaction is highly complex as evidenced by multiple oxygen uptake and release processes, resulting in numerous intermediates. This behavior contrasts sharply with Na-Mn-O and Li-Mn-O ternary systems which show less significant oxygen dynamics, underscoring the unique reaction mechanism within the Na-Li-Mn-O system. We further adopt a dynamic controlled atmosphere approach to modulate oxygen concentration and demonstrate successful synthesis of Ti-substituted NaLi_1/3Mn_2/3- x Ti_ x O_2 materials, all exhibiting capacities surpassing 190 mAh g^-1. Our findings highlight the importance of the atmospheric conditions for the synthesis of oxide cathode materials and these fundamental insights unlock avenues for developing novel high-energy-density sodium-ion battery chemistries. O3-type sodium anion-redox cathodes show promise but are hard to synthesize due to unclear mechanisms.

Three samples of potassium birnessite (KB400, KB500, and KB600) are synthesized using a sol–gel method and subsequently calcined at different temperatures to evaluate the influence of crystal water and K+ ions on structural stability and their electrochemical performance. X‐ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of samples with high crystallinity. Additionally, X‐ray fluorescence, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis are employed to verify their chemical composition and oxidation states. Among the samples, KB500 exhibits the most favorable electrochemical performance, achieving a specific capacity of 175 mAh g–1 at C/10 when cycled within a voltage range of 1.6–4.2 V. Long‐term cycling tests at a narrower potential range of 2–3.6 V demonstrate promising values of 110 mAh g–1 in capacity for KB500, with a retention of 90% over 80 cycles. The presence of potassium and interlayer water is crucial for enhancing structural stability and ion diffusion. These findings suggest that KB500 could serve as a promising cathode material for SIBs, providing a structurally stable option for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries, but the larger radius of Na+ compared with Li+ results in lower energy density, shorter cycle life, and sluggish kinetics of SIBs. Therefore, it is of significant importance to explore appropriate Na+ storage materials with high capacity and fast Na+ transport kinetics. Herein, doublelayered mesoporous graphene nanosheets codoped with oxygen and nitrogen (O,N-MGNSs) were developed as a new cathode material with high Na+ storage capacity and fast ion-transport kinetics for SIBs. The codoping of MGNSs with oxygen and nitrogen by in situ chemical vapor deposition endowed them with a hierarchical porous network, robust structures, good conductivity, and abundant functional groups. The O,N-MGNSs could host Na+ in two ways: surface adsorption and surface redox reaction, and this endowed them with high Na+ storage capacity and fast charging/discharging rates in SIBs. Electrochemical results revealed that the O,N-MGNSs delivered a reversible capacity of 156 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 (corresponding to a rate of 3 C) between 1.5 and 4.2 V and exhibited a high cycling stability (95 % capacity retention at 1 A g-1 for more than 1000 cycles).",

The notable rate performance (53 mA h g-1 at 20 C, 2.0-4.3 V) contributed to the high exposure of {010} facets via controlling the growth orientation of the precursor, which is certified by density functional theory calculation and lattice structural analysis. Mg substitution strengthens the reversibility of anionic oxygen redox and structural evolution in high-voltage areas that was confirmed by the in situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests, leading to outstanding cyclic reversibility (68.9% after 1000 cycles at 5 C) and slowing down the voltage fading. This work provides new insights into constructing electrochemically active planes combined with heteroatom substitution to improve the Na+ transport kinetics and structural stability of layered oxide cathodes for sodium storage.",

However, up to now, anionic redox reaction has not been reported in the mainstream phosphate cathodes for SIBs. Herein, the ultrathin VOPO4 nanosheets are fabricated as promising cathodes for SIBs, where the oxygen redox reaction is first activated accompanied by reversible ClO4− (from the electrolyte) insertion/extraction. As a result, the VOPO4 cathode harvests a record‐high capacity (168 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C) among its counterparts ever reported. Moreover, the ClO4− insertion efficiently expands the interlayer spacing of VOPO4 and accelerates the ion diffusion, enabling an unprecedentedly high rate performance (69 mAh g−1 at 30 C). Via systematic ex situ characterizations and theoretical computations, the anionic redox chemistry and charge storage mechanism upon cycling are thoroughly elucidated. This study opens up a new avenue toward high‐energy phosphate cathodes for SIBs by triggering anionic redox reactions.",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand to efficiently store and utilize the electricity from renewable energy resources in a sustainable way has boosted the request for sodium-ion battery technology due to the high abundance of sodium sources worldwide. Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structured cathodes with a robust polyanionic framework have been intriguing because of their open 3D structure and superior thermal stability. The ever-increasing demand for higher energy densities with NASICON-structured cathodes motivates us to activate multielectron reactions, thus utilizing the third sodium ion toward higher voltage and larger capacity, both of which have been the bottlenecks for commercializing sodium-ion batteries. A doping strategy with Cr inspired by first-principles calculations enables the activation of multielectron redox reactions of the redox couples V2+/V3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+, resulting in remarkably improved energy density even in comparison to the layer structured oxides and Prussian blue analogues. This work also comprehensively clarifies the role of the Cr dopant during sodium storage and the valence electron transition process of both V and Cr. Our findings highlight the importance of a broadly applicable doping strategy for achieving multielectron reactions of NASICON-type cathodes with higher energy densities in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Revealing interlayer oxygen charge is of great significance in understanding the high‐voltage and air stability of sodium layered cathodes, but it currently lacks attention. Particularly, the stability of sodium ion full batteries under high cathode loading (≥8 mg cm−2) also faces extremely challenges. Here, the interlayer oxygen charge and its mechanism for high‐voltage and air stability are revealed in a high‐entropy O3‐Na0.85Li0.1Al0.02Sn0.08Cu0.1Ti0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3O2 (HEO) cathode, which enables robust high‐cathode‐loading sodium‐ion full batteries. The high‐entropy doping effectively maintains the transition metal (TM)─O bond covalency, stabilizing interlayer oxygen charge. The stable O─O repulsion avoids structural collapse, realizing the P3‐OP2‐P3 reversible phase transition. Moreover, reduced interlayer oxygen charge achieves the Na layer contraction and the Na─O bond enhancement. These features inhibit the attack of water and Na loss, realizing well air stability. Therefore, the HEO cathode exhibits a good stability up to 900 cycles under 2.0‒4.3 V and a high‐capacity retention of 96.12% after 5 day air exposure. The pouch full cell with ≈16 mg cm−2 cathode loading exhibits ≈60 mAh and lasts for 100 cycles. This work contributes the new insights into both high‐voltage and air stability of layered cathodes for practical sodium ion full batteries.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues have garnered considerable attention due to their spacious open framework, substantial specific capacity, facile synthesis protocol and cost-effectiveness as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nonetheless, the incomplete electrochemical reaction of low-spin (LS) Fe often results in suboptimal practical specific capacity and diminished specific energy. In this study, a calcination strategy is put forward and successfully activates LS-Fe centers within PB, which exhibits a prolonged high-voltage plateau when employed as a cathode material for SIBs. Notably, PB with LS-Fe activated (denoted as PB-325) contributes with a specific capacity of 65 and 62 mAh/g during the first and fifth charge–discharge cycles, respectively, surpassing those of the pristine material. Comprehensive investigations involving operando \n                     57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, ex situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations unveil a charge transfer-induced spin transition phenomenon occurring during the electrochemical reaction process, which involves transfer of charges from HS-Fe to LS-Fe. The intrinsic narrower bandgap and charge-accumulated LS-Fe species both contribute to enhanced reactivity, especially in LS-Fe site, thus leading to increased specific capacity within the high-voltage range and improving the performance of PB-325. This study provides an effective and simple strategy to activate LS-Fe, and deepens the understanding of the mechanisms of high-performance PB cathodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The layered Mn-based oxides (NaxMnO2), which is one of the most promising cathode families for rechargeable sodium-ions batteries (SIBs), have considerable attention due to their tunable electrochemical performances and low costs. Herein, a novel P2/O3 intergrown Li-containing Na0.8Li0.27Mn0.68Ti0.05O2 cathode material prepared by Ti substitution at Mn site is reported. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of biphasic composite structure and inactive element substitution, this P2/O3 electrode exhibits high initial charge/discharge capacity and excellent cycling performance. The combined use of different characterization techniques including XAS, HRTEM, EPR, and solid-state NMR gives insights into the local electronic environment, the redox chemistry, and also the microstructure rigidity of these cathode materials. On the basis of comprehensive comparison with Ti-free P2/O3 Na0.8Li0.27Mn0.73O2, the observed improvement on the electrochemical performance is primarily attributed to the alleviated Mn3+/Mn4+ redox and the excellent oxygen charge compensation behavior arises from the increased oxygen oxidative activity and reversible oxygen redox chemistry. From the viewpoint of structure evolution, Ti-substitution restrains the irreversible structural deterioration and Li+ loss during cycling. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the electronic and crystal structure evolution after inactive element substitution and thus sheds light on the rational design of high-performance P2/O3 biphasic Mn-based layered cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium-ion batteries, O3-NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, comparable to the state-of-the-art Li-rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction. The as-prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226 mAh g-1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is widely used in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its performance has always been limited by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and cycling stability. Cathode compensation agent is a favorable strategy to make up for the loss of active sodium ions consumed by HC anode. Yet it lacks agent that effectively decomposes to increase the active sodium ions as well as regulate carbon defects for decreasing the irreversible sodium ions consumption. Here, we propose 1,2-dihydroxybenzene Na salt (NaDB) as a cathode compensation agent with high specific capacity (347.9 mAh g−1), lower desodiation potential (2.4–2.8 V) and high utilization (99%). Meanwhile, its byproduct could functionalize HC with more CO groups and promote its reversible capacity. Consequently, the presodiation hard carbon (pHC) anode exhibits highly reversible capacity of 204.7 mAh g−1 with 98% retention at 5 C rate over 1000 cycles. Moreover, with 5 wt% NaDB initially coated on the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, the capacity retention of NVP + NaDB|HC cell could increase from 22% to 89% after 1000 cycles at 1 C rate.

Moreover, the introduction of costly elements such as single or multiple dopants has failed to resolve the sustainability challenges in designing an optimal Mn-based layered oxide cathode. This study proposes a Co-Ni-free, poly-elemental doping strategy (Li, Mg, and Cu) combined with high sodium content for an Mn-based P2-layered cathode designed for Na+ ion storage. In situ X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the absence of P2 - O2 phase transitions during cycling for both NLMMC87 (Na0.87Li0.1Mg0.1Mn0.7Cu0.1O2) and NLMMC77 (Na0.77Li0.1Mg0.1Mn0.7Cu0.1O2). This can be attributed to the co-substitution of the electronegative Cu element and the stabilizing dopants Li and Mg, which suppress oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the high sodium content within the host structure promotes high reversible capacity, enhances structural stability, and minimizes internal stress due to volume changes. Moreover, NLMMC87 demonstrates a reversible capacity of 167.9 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C (97% Coulombic efficiency) and maintains excellent stability across various current rates. Further investigations into the practical application of NLMMC87 in a sodium full cell will be a critical step toward realizing an ideal cathode for sodium-ion batteries.",

The carbon coating not only improve its apparent conductivity, but also inhibit crystal growth and prevent agglomeration of particles. Moreover, Cu2+ doping contributes to an enhanced intrinsic conductivity and decreased Na+ diffusion energy barrier, remarkably boosting its charge transfer kinetics. Based on the structure characterizations, electrochemical performances tests, charge transfer kinetics analyses and theoretical calculations, it’s proved that such an elaborate design ensures the excellent rate performances (116.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1C; 92.6 mA h g−1 at 10C) and distinguished cycling lifespan (95.8 % retention after 300 cycles at 1C; 84.8 % retention after 3300 cycles at 10C).

Energy dispersion spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction (XRD), and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the successful incorporation of Zr elements into the lattice to substitute Mn. Due to the introduction of Zr4+, the crystal structure modulation of O3‐NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 has been realized. By increasing the Zr4+ content, the width of the sodium diffusion layer expands, thereby facilitating the diffusion of sodium ions. Consequently, the material exhibits a remarkable enhancement in high‐rate capability. At the same time, increasing the Zr4+ content results in a notable decrease in both the average bond length of TM−O and the thickness of the TMO6 octahedron in the transition metal layer, resulting in a significant improvement in the cycling performance and structural stability of the cathode material. Additionally, the in‐situ XRD results demonstrate that the optimized cathode composition of O3‐NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3–0.02Zr0.02O2 (NFMZ2) undergoes a reversible phase transition of O3 → O3 + P3 → P3 → O3 + P3 → O3 during the charge–discharge process.",

        "title": "Mitigating Long Range Jahn‐Teller Ordering to Stabilize Mn Redox Reaction in Biphasic Layered Sodium Oxide",
        "abstract": "To develop the next‐generation commercial oxide cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries, it is crucial to reduce the expensive Ni element content, and further regulate redox reaction of cheap transition metal elements such as Mn to elevate specific capacity. Nevertheless, the activation of Mn redox reaction (MRR) remains a challenge, and notably, MRR induces pronounced Jahn‐Teller effect, resulting in severe structural distortion and fast performance decay. Herein, activated by Na vacancies and weakened hybridization of O (2p)‐TM (3d‐t2g) orbital, a biphasic low‐Ni Mn‐based oxide P2/O3‐Na0.8Ni0.23Fe0.34Mn0.43O2 (P2/O3) exhibits reversible MRR, which performs the transition between Mn4+ and Mn3+ during charging and discharging. Due to the interlaced arrangement of P2‐type and O3‐type crystal domains in P2/O3, the long range Jahn‐Teller ordering is restricted to mitigate the cooperative distortion of MnO6 octahedron induced by MRR and the Jahn‐Teller effect is suppressed, ensuring sustained stable involvement of MRR in charge compensation. In addition, owing to the introduction of P2‐type phase, there is a significant reduction of the migration barrier for sodium ions and no obvious capacity decline after air exposure, leading to a marked enhancement in dynamic performance and air stability of P2/O3, respectively. Consequently, P2/O3 exhibits excellent electrochemical and processing performance.",

        "abstract": "All-solid-state sodium-ion batteries that work at ambient temperature are a potential approach for large-scale energy storage systems. Nowadays, ceramic solid electrolytes are gaining attention because of their good ionic conductivity and excellent mechanical and chemical stabilities. Furthermore, a good interface between electrode and solid electrolyte is also required to achieve successful cell performances. In this work, sintered ceramic layer electrolyte Na3.16Zr1.84Y0.16Si2PO12, with high ionic conductivity (0.202 mS/cm at room temperature), are prepared by using uniaxial pressing followed by a sintering process. The conductive carbon coated NASICON material (NaTi2(PO4)3/C) exhibits, as cathode material, enhanced rate capability and stability for sodium ion batteries for high carbon (18.95 %) coated sample. At C/10, the optimized cathode (with higher carbon content) achieves a remarkable initial discharge capacity of 107.3 mAh/g (reversible capacity of 101.4 mAh/g), a sufficient rate capability up to a rate of 10C, and a long cycle life (capacity retention of 58% after 950 cycles). The one-stage reversible biphasic reaction mechanism and potential-dependent structure–property of NaTi2(PO4)3 can be explained by employing in situ X-ray synchrotron method. Sequential Rietveld refinements of the in situ data show the evolution of the Na-poor NaTi2(PO4)3 and Na-rich Na3Ti2(PO4)3 phase fractions (wt%), unit cell characteristics, and unit cell volume. The design of an all-solid-state sodium ion half-cell with a NaTi2(PO4)3/C cathode and a Na3.16Zr1.84Y0.16Si2PO12 solid-state electrolyte interface results in stable capacity of 83.6 mAh/g at C/10 and excellent reversible capacity at high C-rate. The results show that sintered NASICON-based electrolytes can significantly contribute for the fabrication of all-solid-state sodium-ion battery due to the superior conductivity and stability.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical energy storage has recently seen tremendous emphasis being placed on the large-scale (power) grid storage. Sodium-ion batteries are capable of achieving this goal with economic viability. In a recent breakthrough in sodium-ion battery research, the alluaudite framework (Na2Fe2(SO4)3) has been reported, with the highest Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential (ca. 3.8 V, Barpanda, et al., Nat. Commun., 2014, 5, 4358). Exploring this high-voltage sodium insertion system, we report the discovery of Na2+2xCo2-x(SO4)3 (x = 0.16) as a new member of the alluaudite class of cathode. Stabilized by low-temperature solid-state synthesis (T ≤ 350 °C), this novel Co-based compound assumes a monoclinic structure with C2/c symmetry, which undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering below 10.2 K. Isotypical to the Fe-homologue, it forms a complete family of solid-solution Na2+2x(Fe1-yCoy)2-x(SO4)3 [y = 0-1]. Ab initio DFT analysis hints at potential high voltage operation at 4.76-5.76 V (vs. Na), depending on the degree of desodiation involving a strong participation of the oxygen sub-lattice. With the development of safe organic electrolytes, Na2+2xCo2-x(SO4)3 can work as a cathode material (∼5 V) for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Promoting threshold voltage of P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 with Cu2+ cation doping toward high-stability cathode for sodium-ion battery.",
        "abstract": "P2-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 has attracted considerable attraction as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries owing to its high operating voltage and theoretical specific capacity. However, when the charging voltage is higher than 4.2 V, the Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode undergoes a detrimental irreversible phase transition of P2-O2, leading to a drastic decrease in specific capacity. To address this challenge, we implemented a Cu-doping strategy (Na0.67Ni0.23Cu0.1Mn0.67O2) in this work to stabilize the structure of the transition metal layer. The stabilization strategy involved reinforcing the transition metal–oxygen (TMO) bonds, particularly the MnO bond and inhibiting interlayer slip during deep desodiation. As a result, the irreversible phase transition voltage is delayed, with the threshold voltage increasing from 4.2 to 4.4 V. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the Na0.67Ni0.23Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode maintains the P2 phase within the voltage window of 2.5–4.3 V, whereas the P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode transforms entirely into O2-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 when the voltage exceeds 4.3 V. Furthermore, absolute P2-O2 phase transition of the Na0.67Ni0.23Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode occurred at 4.6 V, indicating that Cu2+ doping enhances the stability of the layer structure and increases the threshold voltage. The resulting Na0.67Ni0.23Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode exhibited superior electrochemical properties, demonstrating an initial reversible specific capacity of 89.1 mAh/g at a rate of 2C (360 mA g−1) and retaining more than 78 % of its capacity after 500 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Developing sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications is facing big challenges of the lack of high‐performance cathode materials. Here, a series of new cathode materials Na0.66CoxMn0.66–xTi0.34O2 for sodium‐ion batteries are designed and synthesized aiming to reduce transition metal‐ion ordering, charge ordering, as well as Na+ and vacancy ordering. An interesting structure change of Na0.66CoxMn0.66–xTi0.34O2 from orthorhombic to hexagonal is revealed when Co content increases from x = 0 to 0.33. In particular, Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2 with a P2‐type layered structure delivers a reversible capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C. When the current density increases to 10 C, a reversible capacity of 63.2 mAh g−1 can still be obtained, indicating a promising rate capability. The low valence Co2+ substitution results in the formation of average Mn3.7+ valence state in Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2, effectively suppressing the Mn3+‐induced Jahn–Teller distortion, and in turn stabilizing the layered structure. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy results suggest that the charge compensation of Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2 during charge/discharge is contributed by Co2.2+/Co3+ and Mn3.3+/Mn4+ redox couples. This is the first time that the highly reversible Co2+/Co3+ redox couple is observed in P2‐layered cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries. This finding may open new approaches to design advanced intercalation‐type cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode material is usually nano‐sized particles exhibiting low tap density, high specific surface area, correspondingly low volume energy density, and cycle stability of the sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high‐temperature shock (HTS) strategy is proposed to synthesize NVPF (HTS‐NVPF) with uniform conducting network and high tap density. During a typical HTS process (heating rate of 1100 °C s−1 for 10 s), the precursors rapidly crystallize and form large‐sized and dense particles. The tight connection between particles not only enhances their contact with carbon layers, but also reduces the specific surface area that inhibits side reactions between the interfaces and the electrolyte. Besides, ultrafast synthesis of NVPF reduces the F loss and amount of Na3V2(PO4)3 impurities, which improve cycling capability. The HTS‐NVPF demonstrates a high energy density of 413.4 Wh kg−1 and an ultra‐high specific capacity of 103.4 mAh g−1 at 10 C as well as 84.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. In addition, the excellent temperature adaptability of HTS‐NVPF (−45–55 °C) and remarkable electrochemical properties of NVPF||HC full cell demonstrate extreme competitiveness in commercial SIBs. Therefore, the HTS technique is considered to be a high‐efficiency strategy to synthetize NVPF and is expected to prepare other cathode materials.",

However, its long-cycle and rate performance are significantly constrained by the low Na+ electronic conductivity of NVPOF. Furthermore, the prevalent self-discharge phenomenon restricts its applicability in practical applications. In this paper, the cathode material Na3V1.84Fe0.16(PO4)2F3 (x = 0.16) was synthesized by quantitatively introducing Fe3+ into the V-site of NVPOF. The introduction of Fe3+ significantly reduced the original bandgap and the energy barrier of NVPOF, as demonstrated through density functional theory calculations (DFT). When material x = 0.16 is employed as the cathode material for the sodium-ion battery, the Na+ diffusion coefficient is significantly enhanced, exhibiting a lower activation energy of 42.93 kJ mol−1. Consequently, material x = 0.16 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (rate capacity: 57.32 mA h g−1 @10 C, cycling capacity: the specific capacity of 101.3 mA h g−1 can be stably maintained after 1000 cycles at 1 C current density).

        "abstract": "Developing high power-high energy electrochemical energy storage systems is an ultimate goal in the energy storage field, which is even more difficult but significant for low-cost sodium ion batteries. Here, fluoride is successfully prepared by the electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique, which greatly expands the application scope of ESD. A two-step strategy (solvothermal plus ESD method) is proposed to construct a bicontinuous ordered network of 3D porous Na3 (VO)2 (PO4 )2 F/reduced graphene oxide (NVOPF/rGO). This two-step strategy makes sure that NVOPF can be prepared by ESD, since it avoids the loss of F element during synthesis. The obtained NVOPF particles are as small as 15 nm, and the carbon content is only 3.5% in the final nanocomposite. Such a bicontinuous ordered network and small size of electroactive particles lead to the significant contribution of the pseudocapacitance effect to sodium storage, resulting in real high power-high energy sodium cathodes. The cathode exhibits excellent rate capability and cycling stability, whose rate performance is one of the best ever reported in both half cells and full cells. Moreover, this work provides a general and promising strategy for developing high power-high energy electrode materials for various electrochemical energy storage systems.",

Herein, a Mg-substituted NMPP (NM2.7Mg0.3PP)@C composite was constructed via modified solution combustion and subsequent calcination treatment. The obtained NM2.7Mg0.3PP presents a highly pure phase and single-crystalline characteristics. It is noteworthy that the sample shows a smaller particle size of 100-300 nm due to the Mg2+ incorporation, and the prepared NM2.7Mg0.3PP@C cathode exhibits considerable discharge capacity (119 mA h g-1), an improved rate capability and excellent long cycling stability of 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Recently, the substitution of inactive elements has been reported as a promising strategy for improving the structural stability and electrochemical performance of layered cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this regard, we have investigated the positive effects of inactive Ti substitution into O3-type NaFe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2, based on first principles calculations and electrochemical experiments. After Ti substitution, Na[Ti0.03(Fe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5)0.97]O2 exhibits improved capacity retention and rate capability compared with Ti-free NaFe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2. Such improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced structural stability and lowered activation energy for Na+ migration, induced by Ti substitution in the host structure. Based on the first principles calculations of the average net charges and partial densities of states, we suggest that Ti substitution effectively enhances the binding between transition metals and oxygen by increasing the oxygen electron density, which in turn lowers the energy barrier of Na+ migration, leading to a notable enhancement in the rate capability of Na[Ti0.03(Fe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5)0.97]O2. Compared with other inactive elements (e.g. Al and Mg), Ti is a more suitable substituent for improving the electrochemical properties of layered cathode materials because of its large total charge variation contributing to capacity. The results of this study should provide a practical guideline for developing highly reliable layered cathode materials for SIBs.",

Furthermore, a hypothesis of a joint diffusion-controlled and capacitive mechanism for high-spin (HS) Fe and a mere capacitive mechanism for LS Fe is put forward and verified through potentiastatic tests, operando 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, and ex situ XRD, which provides a new horizon to enhance the electrochemical performance for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of advanced sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) has been intensified due to the escalating demand for sustainable energy storage solutions. A W‐doped P2‐type layered cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.246W0.004Mn0.75O2 (NNWMO), has been developed to address the limitations of traditional cathode materials. Compared to the pristine Na0.67Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 (NNMO), NNWMO exhibits improved reversible capacity, excellent cycle performance, and remarkable rate performance. It can deliver an increased discharge capacity of 142.20 mAh/g at 0.1 C, with an admirable capacity retention of 80.5% after 100 cycles at high voltage. In situ XRD results demonstrate that the rivet effect related to the strong W—O bonds inhibits irreversible phase transition and enhances structural reversibility during charge/discharge processes. High‐resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and X‐ray diffraction results confirm successful lattice doping of W6+ and increased layer spacing, contributing to favorable sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Density‐functional theory (DFT) calculation results further reveal that the smoother Na+ ion diffusion dynamics is attributed to the reduced migration energy barrier of Na+ with the insertion of W6+. This study provides valuable insights into the design of high‐performance cathode materials for next‐generation SIBs, showcasing the potential for more efficient, stable, and enduring energy storage solutions.\n",

However, Na3.4Mn1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 is faced with low electronic conductivity, poor cycling stability and complex phase transition caused by multi‐electron transfers, which limits its practical application. Herein, an anion‐regulated strategy is proposed to optimize the Mn‐rich Na3.4Mn1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 phosphate cathode. After introducing F anions into the lattice, the rate performance is improved from 60.5 to 72.8 mAh g−1 at 20 C. Ascribed to unique structure design, the reaction kinetics of Na3.4Mn1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 are significantly improved, as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry at varied scan rates and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The generated M‐F bond inhibits Jahn–Teller effect with an improved cycle stability (85.8 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 C with 94.3% capacity retention). Interestingly, reaction mechanism of Na3.4Mn1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 with the complex two‐phase and solid solution reactions changes to the whole solid solution reaction after fluorine substitution, and leads to a smaller volume change of 5.41% during reaction processes, which is verified by in situ X‐ray diffraction.

Here, a new strategy, i.e., the manipulation of transition‐metal ordering in layered oxides, is proposed to show a prolonged charge−discharge plateau and cation‐migration‐free structural evolution. The results demonstrate that the transition‐metal ordering with a honeycomb‐type superlattice can adjust the crystal lattice and suppress cation migration by modifying the crystal strain to realize a large reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, which are not characteristics of the widely used common layered oxides.

        "abstract": "Mn-based NASICON-type Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) has been widely investigated as one of the most promising alternatives to Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its higher energy density, higher abundance, and lower cost and toxicity compared to V. However, electrochemical performance for large-scale applications is limited by NMVP’s inferior conductivity and structural degradation during cycling. Herein, a facile strategy to modify the surface/interphase properties of NMVP/C was reported using the thermally stable Al(PO3)3 precursor with a wet process followed by heat treatment to enhance the interface stability of electrodes. The nanomodified layer has the benefits of an ionic conductor (slight NaPO3) and robust composite (Al(PO3)3), which can facilitate the stability of Mn-based cathode materials and ionic conductivity. These merits endow 1 wt% Al(PO3)3-loaded NMVP/C cathodes with a high rate performance (102/61 mAh g−1 at 0.2/50 C) and impressive cyclability (88.5%/89.7% at 5 C/10 C after 3000/4000 cycles) in Na-ion batteries at 2.5–3.8 V. Moreover, when the cutoff voltage is raised to 4 V, improved electrochemical properties (111.6/50.8 mAh g−1 at 0.2/10 C and 71.4% after 1000 cycles at 5 C) are also realized. Such an enhancement indicates that facial surface modification engineering limits organic electrolyte erosion, inhibits transition metal dissolution and suppresses surface lattice degradation, which is confirmed by ex situ X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy. Therefore, the Al(PO3)3 surface modification strategy combined with mechanism analysis can provide a possible reference for advanced electrochemical properties in energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "The specific capacity of P2-type sodium-ion battery cathode is limited because full extraction of Na ions leads to structural degradation. Here authors report pillar-beam structured material to overcome this issue by using K pillar ions to uphold the transition metal layers upon extraction of Na ions. Energy storage with high energy density and low cost has been the subject of a decades-long pursuit. Sodium-ion batteries are well expected because they utilize abundant resources. However, the lack of competent cathodes with both large capacities and long cycle lives prevents the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries. Conventional cathodes with hexagonal-P2-type structures suffer from structural degradations when the sodium content falls below 33%, or when the integral anions participate in gas evolution reactions. Here, we show a “pillar-beam” structure for sodium-ion battery cathodes where a few inert potassium ions uphold the layer-structured framework, while the working sodium ions could diffuse freely. The thus-created unorthodox orthogonal-P2 K_0.4[Ni_0.2Mn_0.8]O_2 cathode delivers a capacity of 194 mAh/g at 0.1 C, a rate capacity of 84% at 1 C, and an 86% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C.

However, its adoption in practical applications faces obstacles due to its inherently low electronic conductivity. To address this challenge, we employ a binary co-doped strategy to design Na3.3K0.2V1.5Mg0.5(PO4)2F3 cathode with nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) coating layer. This configuration enhances electronic conductivity and reduces diffusion barriers for sodium ion (Na+). The strategy of incorporating nitrogen-doped carbon coating not only facilitates the formation of a porous structure but also introduces additional defects and active sites. Such modifications accelerate the reaction kinetics and augment electrolyte interaction through an expanded specific surface area, thus streamlining the electrochemical process. Concurrently, strategic heteroatom substitution leads to a more efficient engagement of Na+ in the electrochemical activities, thereby bolstering the cathode's structural integrity. The vanadium fluorophosphate Na3.3K0.2V1.5Mg0.5(PO4)2F3@NC exhibits an electrochemical performance, including a high discharge specific capacity of 124.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, a long lifespan of 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.1 % at 10C, and a rate property of 73.2 mA h g−1 at 20C.

However, conventional solid-state methods demonstrate a low heating/cooling rate and sluggish reaction kinetics, requiring a long thermal treatment to effectively fabricate NFS cathodes. Herein, we propose a thermal shock (TS) strategy to synthesize alluaudite sodium iron sulfate cathodes using either hydrous or anhydrous raw materials. The analysis of the phase formation process reveals that TS treatment can significantly facilitate the removal of crystal water and decomposition of the intermediate phase Na2Fe(SO4)2 in the hydrous precursor. In the case of the anhydrous precursor, the kinetics of the combination reaction between Na2SO4 and FeSO4 can be also accelerated by TS treatment. Consequently, pure NFS phase formation can be completed after a substantially shorter time of post-sintering, thereby saving significant time and energy. The TS-treated NFS cathode derived from hydrous precursor exhibits higher retention after 200 cycles at 1C and better rate capability than the counterpart prepared by conventional long-term tube furnace sintering, demonstrating the great potential of this novel strategy.",

The prismatic-type structure evolving to an intergrowth structure of the Z phase at high charging state could be simultaneously alleviated by reducing the electrostatic repulsion of O-O layers. As a consequence, P2-NaLMCM' delivers a high specific capacity of 183.8 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C and good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80.2% over 200 cycles within the voltage range of 2.0-4.5 V. Our findings provide new insights into both tailoring oxygen redox chemistry and stabilizing dynamic structural evolution for high-energy battery cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Despite their low cost and high specific capacity, the practical use of monoclinic Mn‐based Prussian blue analogs (Mn‐PBAs) is limited by poor cycling stability, primarily due to the structural degradation caused by the multiple phase transitions and Jahn–Teller effect associated with Mn3+ ions throughout the entire cycle. Herein, by synergistic incorporation of low‐cost Cu and Fe into the manganese sites of Mn‐PBAs, the ternary PBAs (T‐PBAs) achieve solid solution reaction of Na+ extraction and insertion, successfully eliminating the inherent multi‐phase transition from the sodium storage mechanism of T‐PBAs. Ex situ analysis and density functional theory calculations are employed to confirm that T‐PBAs consistently maintain a cubic phase with smaller lattice distortion rather than occur in conventional three‐phase transition during the charging and discharging processes, forcefully inhibiting the structural degradation of T‐PBAs. Therefore, the T‐PBAs showcase unprecedented cycling stability at both room temperature (10 000 cycles at 1 A g−1) and −20 °C (over 3000 h, 4200 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 without distinct capacity degradation), More importantly, when paired with commercial hard carbon, the T‐PBAs based sodium‐ion batteries exhibit excellent capacity retention (2000 cycles 76.8%), showcasing their immense potential in practical applications.",

Their thermal stability, all-climate properties, and potential in full cells are investigated in detail.

        "abstract": "The NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is recognized as a potential cathode material for Na-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, its inherent small electronic conductivity induces limited cycling stability and rate performance. Carbon coating, particularly N-doped carbon, has been identified as an effective strategy to address these challenges. Hence, N-doped carbon-coated NVP was successfully produced by a straightforward high-temperature solid-phase method, and the mechanism of N-doped carbon coating in regulating the electrochemical kinetics of NVP was unraveled. The N-doped carbon layer establishes a robust conductive network that interconnects the active particles, facilitating electron transfer within the electrode. SEM images after cycling show that the uniform carbon coating mitigated NVP agglomeration, thereby reducing undesired side reactions between electrode and electrolyte. The discharge capacities of NVP/N-C2 electrodes at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10C reach 116.0, 114.6, 112.6, 111, 108.7, 104.2, and 99.4 mAh g-1, respectively. Even at 20C, the discharge capacity remains up to 92.2 mAh g-1, which is approximately 80% of the discharge capacity at 0.1C. When the rate returns to 0.1C, the NVP/N-C2 cathode still exhibits a discharge capacity of 115.9 mAh g-1, showing excellent electrochemical reversibility. This study presents a viable approach for fabricating NVP with a N-doped carbon coating, showcasing enhanced sodium storage properties.",

        "abstract": "Overcoming rapid capacity decay and structural instability remains a key challenge for the commercialization of O3-type layered cathode materials. This study investigates the effect of yttrium (Y) doping on the performance of NaNi_1/3Fe_1/3Mn_1/3O_2 (NNFMO) cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. Compared to the TM-O bonds in the unmodified material, the Y-doped material has stronger Y–O bonds that form a stable structure. Y doping enhances the reversibility of Ni/Fe redox reactions and mitigates the irreversible P3-O'-P3' phase transition. Electrochemical analysis reveals that the Y-doped cathode material (NNFY-10000) exhibits excellent rate performance and remarkable cycle stability. Specifically, NNFY-10000 maintains a discharge capacity of 110.6 mAhg^−1 at a 1 C rate and retains 72.26% of its capacity after 200 cycles, outperforming undoped NNFMO. These improvements are attributed to the stable structure formed by strong Y–O bonds, reduced polarization during the cycling process, and enhanced redox reaction reversibility due to Y doping. This study not only elucidates the mechanism by which Y doping improves the electrochemical performance of NNFMO but also provides valuable insights for the development of high-performance sodium-ion battery cathode materials. The strategic introduction of rare earth elements such as Y offers a promising approach to overcoming the inherent limitations of O3-type layered cathode materials, paving the way for their practical application in energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxides, the most commercially promising cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), are extensively investigated due to their low cost, abundant raw materials, flexible structure, and high capacity. However, although the “rotten” transition metal (TM) migration phenomenon in layered oxide cathode materials leads to unfavorable structure reconstruction, sluggish Na+ diffusion and subsequent performance degradation, TM migration has not been systematically summarized and intensively discussed. Herein, a comprehensive insight into the recent advances of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes is provided, aiming to realize the “magical” utilization of TM migration. First, the negative effects of TM migration on crystal structure and electrochemical properties are discussed. Then, the origin of TM migration is intensively analyzed, and three main mechanisms of the migration are presented, including Cr4+–Cr4+–Cr4+ triplets, Jahn–Teller Fe4+ and Na‐free layers. Additionally, the latest research findings on exploring the origin are fully discussed. Finally, the suppression and utilization of TM migration are discussed, and the further exploration of TM migration and the future directions of suppressing/utilizing TM migration are outlooked. It is believed that this perspective will provide guidelines for the design of high‐performance layered oxide cathodes involving TM migration by turning the “rotten” into the “magical.”",

Herein we report a sodium rich disordered birnessite (Na_0.27MnO_2) for aqueous sodium-ion electrochemical storage with a much-enhanced capacity and cycling life (83 mAh g^−1 after 5000 cycles in full-cell). Neutron total scattering and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements show that both structural water and the Na-rich disordered structure contribute to the improved electrochemical performance of current cathode material. Particularly, the co-deintercalation of the hydrated water and sodium-ion during the high potential charging process results in the shrinkage of interlayer distance and thus stabilizes the layered structure. Our results provide a genuine insight into how structural disordering and structural water improve sodium-ion storage in a layered electrode and open up an exciting direction for improving aqueous batteries.

        "abstract": "The O3-type layered oxide represents a highly promising candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the intrinsic stability law of these cathodes remains elusive due to the complex phase transition mechanism and migration of transition metal (TM) ions. Here, we underscore how the ratio between the spacings of alkali metal layer and TM layer ( R  = d_O-Na-O/d_O-TM-O) plays a critical role in determining the structural stability and the corresponding electrochemical performance. We design a peculiar family of Na_xMn_0.4Ni_0.3Fe_0.15Li_0.1Ti_0.05O_2 (0.55 ≤ x ≤ 1) composition that is thermodynamically stable as an O3-type structure even when R is as high as 1.969, far exceeding 1.62 that normal O3-type structures can reach at most. The high R -value puts the O3 cathode in the preparatory stage for the O3-P3 phase transition, resulting in a rapid yet smooth phase transition process. It also induces a significantly stretched interstitial tetrahedral structure to the Na layer, thus effectively impeding TM migration. Leveraging this mechanism, we reexamine the underlying cause for enhanced stability in P2/O3 hybrid structure. Besides the conventional wisdom of an interlocking effect, the high R-value nature of its O3 sub-phase also plays a pivotal role. O3-type layered oxides are promising intercalative electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. Here, authors analyze the interlayer spacings of a family of oxides and propose an intrinsic structural parameter to serve as a measure of cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Vanadate materials are promising for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, high capacity, and high power characteristics enabled by vanadium's multiple oxidation states. However, their development is hindered by poor conductivity, suboptimal high‐rate performance, and limited cycle life. In this work, a layered structure modification strategy involving Ca/F co‐doping in sodium vanadate Na2CaV2O6F (CVF) is proposed to address these issues. Through a combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations, it is demonstrated that Ca/F synergies enhance the Na layer spacing in CVF, resulting in reduced crystal water content and volume shrinkage compared to Na2V2O6 (NVO). Additionally, Ca/F incorporation significantly mitigates the diffusion potential of Na+ within the material framework. The unmodified CVF sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 220 mAh g−1 at 10 mA g−1 and an excellent rate capacity of 65.78 mAh g−1 at 400 mA g−1. Furthermore, the cathode material maintains a capacity of up to 138 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and retains 104.88 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles within the voltage range of 1.5−4.0 V.

        "abstract": "Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its extraordinary three-dimensional structure that provides plenty of channels for sodium-ion migration. However, the unsatisfied electrical conductivity of NMVP limits its utilization in SIBs. Herein, Zn-doped NMVP with a uniform carbonized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) coating layer, named NMZVP@cPAN, was synthesized via a sol-gel method, and carbonized PAN was uniformly distributed on the surface of NMVP. Therefore, the NMZVP@cPAN cathodes exhibited an outstanding discharge capacity of 70.6 mA·h·g-1 at 30 C and remarkable cycling stability with an admirable retention of 89.64% after 1000 cycles at 5 C. Rietveld refinement and ex situ X-ray diffraction analyses were performed to determine the change in the crystal structure. Density functional theory calculations were performed to determine the effects of Zn doping on the density of states and the migration energy barriers. Finally, the NMZVP@cPAN cathodes were successfully modified and could be used in SIBs as NMVP cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) based oxides attract extensive attention as cathode materials for sodium (Na) ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, the Jahn-Teller distortion caused by the Mn (III) center and the phase transition of P2-O2 at high voltage (>4.0 V) limits its practical applications. In this work, a multiphase coupling scheme involving Na0.7MnO2.05 (P2), Na0.44MnO2 (T), and Na0.91MnO2 (Z) is presented to develop improved and available Mn based oxides cathode for superior electrochemical performance SIBs via solid state method. It is found that the optimal coupling at the molecular and atomic levels can be achieved by adjusting the regulation of morphology and grain size of the multiphase, which possesses larger interlayer spacing and fewer Mn3+ ions to suppress the Jahn-Teller lattice distortion of Mn3+ as well as the phase transition of P2-O2 at high voltage (>4.0 V). As a result, the as-prepared cathode delivers a high discharge specific capacity of 183.28 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.5 C with a high-capacity retention of 77.2% after 100 cycles. Moreover, it also shows the fastest Na+ diffusion ability and kinetics properties, which is revealed by refined analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. This study presents a straightforward and scalable approach for developing novel cathode materials based on Mn oxides with excellent performance in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries assembled with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode and hard carbon (HC) anode, show great application prospect due to their relatively high energy density. However, the NFM cathode is accompanied by poor thermal stability detrimental to battery safety, hindering the real commercial application. Here, the detailed thermal runaway process of NFM/HC cell is systematically dissected from cell, electrode and material levels. On cell level, fully charged NFM/HC pouch cell exhibits thermal runaway hazards when abused, which is further proved in adiabatic conditions. On electrode level, heat during the thermal runaway process is collaboratively supplied by NFM and HC. The HC anode induces the initial heat generation, which roots in the anode-electrolyte interface decomposition as the initial chain reactions accumulating heat and mild temperature rise going to battery thermal runaway. The cathode generates huge heat (2–3 times that of anode) at a higher temperature, providing the majority of heat for the whole thermal runaway process. On this basis, the thermochemical crosstalk between electrodes is uncovered, as reductive gases attacking the NFM cathode at an earlier stage around 120 ℃ and electrolyte thermally corroding the cathode at higher temperature. On material level, the NFM cathode loses its layered structure and is corroded into smooth particles due to the different internal crosstalk with temperature. The strategies on how to improve the safety from such three levels were also discussed. These findings shed light on the journey of designing safer commercial sodium-ion batteries through a systematic analysis at multiple scales, including batteries, electrodes, and materials.",

However, the irreversible phase transitions and cationic/anionic redoxes cause fast capacity decay. Herein, P2-type Na_0.67Mg_0.1Mn_0.8Fe_0.1O_2 (NMMF-1) cathode material with moderate active Fe^3+ doping has been designed for sodium storage. Uneven Mn^3+/Mn^4+distribution is observed in NMMF-1 and the introduction of Fe^3+ is beneficial for reducing the Mn^3+ contents both at the surface and in the bulk to alleviate the Jahn–Teller effect. The moderate Fe^3+/Fe^4+ redox can realize the best tradeoff between capacity and cyclability. Therefore, the NMMF-1 demonstrates a high capacity (174.7 mAh g^−1 at 20 mA g^−1) and improved cyclability (78.5% over 100 cycles) in a wide-voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V ( vs. Na^+/Na).

According to reports, NVPOF performs poorly in normal commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder systems and performs best in combination with aqueous binder. Although in line with the concept of green and sustainable development for future electrode preparation, aqueous binders are challenging to achieve high active material loadings at the electrode level, and their relatively high surface tension tends to cause the active material on the electrode sheet to crack or even peel off from the collector. Herein, a cross-linkable and easily commercial hybrid binder constructed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding (named HPP) has been developed and utilized in an NVPOF system, which enables the generation of a stable cathode electrolyte interphase on the surface of active materials. According to theoretical simulations, the HPP binder enhances electronic/ionic conductivity, which greatly lowers the energy barrier for Na+ migration. Additionally, the strong hydrogen-bond interactions between the HPP binder and NVPOF effectively prevent electrolyte corrosion and transition-metal dissolution, lessen the lattice volume effect, and ensure structural stability during cycling. The HPP-based NVPOF offers considerably improved rate capability and cycling performance, benefiting from these benefits. This comprehensive binder can be extended to the development of next-generation energy storage technologies with superior performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are increasingly recognized as ideal for large-scale energy storage applications. Alluaudite Na2+2 δFe2- δ(SO4)3 has become one of the focused cathode materials in this field. However, previous studies employing aqueous-solution synthesis often overlooked the formation mechanism of the impurity phase. In this study, the nonequilibrium evolution mechanism between Na2+2 δFe2- δ(SO4)3 and impurities by adjusting ratios of the Na2SO4/FeSO4·7H2O in the binary system is investigated. Then an optimal ratio of 0.765 with reduced impurity content is confirmed. Compared to the poor electrochemical performance of the Na2.6Fe1.7(SO4)3 (0.765) cathode, the optimized Na2.6Fe1.7(SO4)3@CNTs (0.765@CNTs) cathode, with improved electronic and ionic conductivity, demonstrates an impressive discharge specific capacity of 93.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and a high-rate capacity of 67.84 mAh g-1 at 20 C, maintaining capacity retention of 71.1% after 3000 cycles at 10 C. The Na2.6Fe1.7(SO4)3@CNTs//HC full cell reaches an unprecedented working potential of 3.71 V at 0.1 C, and a remarkable mass-energy density exceeding 320 Wh kg-1. This work not only provides comprehensive guidance for synthesizing high-voltage Na2+2 δFe2- δ(SO4)3 cathode materials with controllable impurity content but also lays the groundwork of sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage applications.",

However, challenges such as intractable impurities, voltage hysteresis/decay, and sluggish Na+ kinetics hinder their practical application. In this study, failure mechanisms of Na4Fe1.5Mn1.5(PO4)2(P2O7) are intensively investigated and demystified. It is found that the issues of this material are mainly caused by surface element segregation, Na/Mn antisite defects, and the closure of Na+ channels. To address these problems, a nonhomogeneous Mg doping engineering strategy is proposed, which effectively eliminates inert impurity phases, decreases the concentration of Na/Mn antisite defects, reactivates the anomalous Jahn-Teller behavior, and inhibits Mn dissolution. The synthesized ternary polyanionic cathode material, Na4Fe1.5Mn1.35Mg0.15(PO4)2(P2O7)@C-N, demonstrates significant improvements, featuring an average operating voltage of approximately 3.5 V, an energy density of 430 Wh kg-1 at 0.2C, and an ultralong cycle life (>12,000 cycles).

However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction (ORR) and unstable crystal structure at high voltage make it impossible to meet the above requirements. Herein, an innovative mechanism is proposed to simultaneously formulate the orbital hybridization and local covalency for enhancing ORR reversibility and structural stability in HSMC (Na0.8Li0.12Ni0.22Mn0.66O1.95F0.05, NLNMOF). In this configuration, the doping of Li into transition metal (TM) site promotes the transition of O lone-pair electrons and triggers the positively shift in projected density of state (PDOS) of Mn, contributing to the high capacity and structural stability. Meanwhile, the substitution of F into oxygen site increases the covalency of Mn-O and pins adjacent oxygen layers, improving the ORR reversibility. As a result, the NLNMOF exhibits extremely competitive high-rate and long-cycle performance, retaining 85.6 % capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C and delivering 68 mAh g–1 at 30 C.

        "abstract": "It has been suggested that sodium layered transition metal oxides could potentially serve as excellent cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their appropriate operating potentials and high capacities. However, the growing reliance on energy requirements has necessitated a higher energy density of SIBs. It has been demonstrated that activating oxygen-related activities for SIBs is a viable method to improve energy density. Herein, we suggest applying the synergy of Li and Zn codoping to activate the anionic redox reactions (ARRs) and improve their reversibility in Na0.75Ni0.3Mn0.7O2. The dual ion doping alleviates the phase transition and inhibits the Na+/vacancy arrangements, consequently improving the rate capacity and cyclic stability. The Na0.75Li0.15Ni0.1Zn0.05Mn0.7O2 delivers a discharge capacity of 134 mA h g-1 and no significant capacity loss at 100 mA g-1 between 2 and 4.5 V after 200 cycles. More importantly, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation proves that the codoping strategy triggers more ARRs compared to single-element doping, thereby providing enhanced capacity. The codoping induced oxygen redox strategies will create a new path for rational design of cathodes to enhance the energy density for SIBs.",

        "title": "Active and passive high-entropy shell enabling high rate and durable sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode for sodium ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity, low cost, and ease of preparation. However, MnHCF typically suffer from poor rate performance and limited cycling stability, primarily due to low electrical conductivity and undesired Jahn-Teller distortions during sodiation and desodiation process. In this study, we successfully employ a co-precipitation method to coat MnHCF with a structurally stable high-entropy hexacyanoferrate (HE-HCF), forming a core-shell structured HE-MnHCF. The high-entropy shell enhances the diffusion kinetics of Na+, maintains high capacity even at high current, and significantly improves structural stability by mitigating the Jahn-Teller effect. As a result, HE-MnHCF demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 119.5 mAh g−1 at 0.01 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability, retaining 64.3 % of its capacity after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. This approach offers a novel strategy for stabilizing electrode materials through high-entropy coatings, paving the way for the advancement of cathode materials in SIBs.",

        "title": "Understanding the Role of Mn Substitution for Boosting High-Voltage Na4Fe3-xMnx(PO4)2P2O7 Cathode in Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 is regarded as the most promising polyanionic cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its superior structural stability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benignity. However, the low operating voltage inevitably weakens its competitiveness in energy density. Previous works have tried to enhance its operating voltage by Mn doping, which draws on the design idea of LiFexMn1-xPO4 cathode for lithium-ion batteries, but with little success. In this context, uncovering the role of Mn substitution in Na4Fe3-xMnx(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMxPP) cathode is urgently needed. This work discloses the effect of Mn contents on the structure, sodium storage property, and reaction mechanism of NFMxPP cathode for the first time. Introducing a moderate amount of Mn (0.6 ≤ x ≤ 1.2) into NFMxPP can weaken the Fe-O bonding interaction, thus leading to the full utilization of Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple. As the representative, NFM1.2PP cathode exhibited a high operating voltage of ≈3.3 V with a reversible capacity of 109.2 mAh g-1. Note that a Hard carbon||NFM1.2PP full battery manifests considerably high-capacity retention of 92.3% over 1600 cycles. It is believed that an understanding of the role of Mn substitution in this work will promote the practical application of high voltage NFMxPP cathodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "With exceptional capacity during high‐voltage cycling, P3‐type Na‐deficient layered oxide cathodes have captured substantial attention. Nevertheless, they are plagued by severe capacity degradation over cycling. In this study, tuning and optimizing the phase composition in layered oxides through Li incorporation are proposed to enhance the high‐voltage stability. The structural dependence of layered Na2/3LixNi0.25Mn0.75O2+δ oxides on the lithium content (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) offered during synthesis is investigated systematically on an atomic scale. Surprisingly, increasing the Li content triggers the formation of mixed P2/O3‐type or P3/P2/O3‐type layered phases. As the voltage window is 1.5–4.5 V, P3‐type Na2/3Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 (NL0.0NMO, Rm) material exhibits a sequence of phase transformations throughout the process of (de)sodiation, that is, O3⇌P3⇌O3′⇌O3″. Such complicated phase transitions can be effectively suppressed in the Na2/3Li0.7Ni0.25Mn0.75O2.4 (NL0.7NMO) oxide with P2/P3/O3‐type mixed phases. Consequently, cathodes made of NL0.7NMO exhibit a substantially enhanced cyclic performance at high voltages compared to that of the P3‐type layered NL0.0NMO cathode. Specifically, NL0.7NMO demonstrates an outstanding capacity retention of 98% after 10 cycles at 1 C within 1.5–4.5 V, much higher than that of NL0.0NMO (83%). This work delves into the intricate realm of bolstering the high‐voltage durability of layered oxide cathodes, paving the way for advanced sodium‐ion battery technologies.",

P2-type layered cathodes with low Na ion diffusion barrier attract great attention. However, it suffers structural instability at a high working voltage. Though many attempts were made, the cycle stability of P2-type layered cathodes with a high working voltage is still not satisfactory. In this work, zinc was used as a doping element for modification. When the doping amount is x  = 0.1 (Na_0.7Ni_0.25Mn_0.65Zn_0.1O_2), it presents enhanced cycle stability in the voltage range of 2.5–4.2 V.

Herein, we reveal that annealing in argon rather than conventional air is a universal strategy to comprehensively upgrade the Na-storage performance of Mn-based oxide cathodes. Bulk oxygen vacancies are introduced via this method, leading to reduced Mn valence, lowered Mn 3d-orbital energy level, and formation of the new-concept Mn domains. As a result, the energy density of the model P2-Na0.75Mg0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode increases by ~50% benefiting from the improved specific capacity and operating potential of Mn redox. The Mn domains can disrupt the cooperative J-T distortion, greatly promoting the cycling stability.

However, the complex phase transition caused by interlayer sliding in layered oxides leads to poor cycling stability, which will hinder their further application.

It reveals 132 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C within 2–4 V increasing the energy density to 408 Wh kg−1 and it shows an outstanding rate capability of 90 mAh g−1 at 80 C (84.90% capacity retention after 1,500 cycles at 80 C). In‐situ XRD shows that reasonable design of high‐entropy components in layered material can achieve the purpose of delaying the occurrence of phase transition and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co in transition metal layers can effectively improve the rate performance of the material. This work is of great significance in guiding the design and synthesis of highly stable layered cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries.",

Sodium-ion offers many of these characteristics, however often the system is tailored for energy rather than cycle life. In this work, the effect of synthesis conditions upon the primary and agglomerated secondary particle size and shape of the sodium-ion cathode material NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 was investigated for optimization of energy and cycle life. A two-level full factorial experimental design was utilized to examine how the synthesis parameters (pH, molar ratio of ammonia/metal precursor salt, and stirring speed) affect the physical and electrochemical properties. This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the main effects and interactions of these parameters. The data from multiple synthesis runs were analyzed using statistical methods and regression analysis. This experimental design provided valuable insights into the relationship between synthesis parameters and material properties. Statistical analysis indicates that both physical and electrochemical properties are mainly controlled through pH and NH4OH, while the effects of stirring speed are less pronounced. The optimal synthetic conditions producing the highest cycling performance were extrapolated from the statistical analysis. A validation experiment showed that particles synthesized with optimum parameters displayed a threefold increase in cycling performance together with uniformly distributed particle size and a high tap density.",

        "abstract": "Reliable operation of Na‐ion batteries requires a mastering of the interfacial processes governing intercalation kinetics. Ion desolvation, amongst others, is a crucial phenomenon as far as power applications are envisioned. Studying the intricacies of interfacial processes faces experimental challenges. Here the complementary use of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and operando infrared fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy (IR‐FEWS) combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is reported to investigate the electrode/electrolyte interface of polyanionic Na‐insertion compounds Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF). Through screening of various electrolytes that differ in their solvation energy and viscosity, the existence of an unusual mass uptake/depletion signal is demonstrated at the NVP interfaces only, indicative of a dissimilarity in migration kinetics of solvent molecules between NVP and NVPF interfaces as supported by IR‐FEWS. This finding is rationalized by positing that sodium depletion is caused by the unusually rapid ion diffusion within NVP mediated by an intermediate metastable phase, which leads to opposite Na+ concentration and free solvent molecule gradients at the interface that causes the unusual and anomalous feature observed on EQCM frequency profiles. This feature does not appear with NVPF showing lower ionic diffusion. Altogether, this fundamental study provides valuable fundamental insights into the interface structuring of insertion compounds depending upon their Na+ mobility.",

Post mortem XPS analysis indicates that the electrode-electrolyte interphases formed in presence of TEG are thicker and presumably more protective, inhibiting typical degradation processes of the electrodes.

Herein, a trade-off in tuning anion-reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy-assisted hybrid ester-ether electrolyte. Anion-reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na+ shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester-based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect.

Crystal structures of both compounds were determined using X-ray powder diffraction and Rietveld method refinements, which indicate the occurrence of Ni2+ in the 8g site, and of M3+ in the 4a site of the structure. The structure consists of a three-dimensional anionic framework obtained by the association on MO6, NiO6, and PO4 polyhedra, sharing edges and corners. The resulting three-dimensional structure creates monodimensional channels along the [100] and [010] directions formed by face-shared oxygen polyhedra and occupied by Na+ cations. This nondisordered cationic distribution is confirmed by a significant change of magnetic properties. Thus, both NNAP and NNFP samples show paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at 14 and 19 K, respectively. For the two compounds, thermal stability, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical properties have been also investigated.

Importantly, an anion-derived passivation film is formed via preferential reduction of the anion upon charging, which can effectively suppress further electrolyte reduction. As a structural characteristic of the electrolyte, most anions are coordinated to multiple Na+ cations at high concentration, which shifts the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the anions downward, resulting in preferential anion reduction.

The fabricated ZMO-MT has approximately an inner diameter of 8.5 μm and wall thickness of 1.5 μm. Further, the sample of ZMO-MT displays a large specific surface area of 48.5 m2 g-1. When evaluated as a negative material for Li-ion batteries, ZMO-MT demonstrates an improved cyclic performance with discharge capacities of 750.4 and 535.2 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles, under current densities of 200 and 500 mA g-1, respectively. Meanwhile, ZMO-MT exhibits superior rate performances with high reversible discharge capacities of 614.7 and 465.2 mA h g-1 under high rates of 1000 and 2000 mA g-1, respectively. In sodium ion batteries applications, ZMO-MT delivers excellent high discharge capacities of 102 and 71.4 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles under 100 and 200 mA g-1, respectively. An excellent rate capability of 58.2 mA h g-1 under the current density of 2000 mA g-1 can also be achieved. The promising cycling performance and rate capability could be benefited from the unique one-dimensional mesoporous microtubular architecture of ZMO-MT, which offers a large electrolyte/electrode accessible contact area and short diffusion distance for both of ions and electrons, buffering the volume variation originated from the repeated ion intercalation/deintercalation processes.",

However, intrinsic g-C3N4 exhibits poor electronic conductivity, low reversible Na-storage capacity and insufficient cyclability. Our density functional theory calculation suggests that this is due to a large Na+ ion diffusion barrier in the innate g-C3N4 nanosheet. Here we strategically apply a facile one-pot heating of a mixture of low-cost urea and asphalt to yield stacked multilayer C/g-C3N4 composites with improved Na-storage capacity (about 2 times higher than that of g-C3N4, up to 254 mAh/g), rate capability and cyclability. A C/g-C3N4 sodium-ion full cell (in which sodium rhodizonate dibasic is used as the positive electrode) demonstrates high Coulombic efficiency (~99.8%) and a negligible capacity fading over 14,000 cycles at 1 A/g.

        "abstract": "Micro- and mesoporous carbons are known to be effective anode materials for sodium-ion (Na+) batteries (SIBs). In contrast, macroporous and gigaporous carbons have rarely been studied for this purpose, even though their porous structure may facilitate electrolyte infiltration to enhance cell performance. Here, a series of gigaporous carbon microspheres (GCS) was synthesized by carbonizing gigaporous polymeric microspheres at different temperatures (700–2500 °C) and adopted as anode-active material of SIBs. All GCS samples exhibited a particle size of 10–15 μm and an average pore size of 0.3–0.5 μm. Nevertheless, their specific surface areas decreased over a large range with increasing carbonization temperature from >400 m2 g−1 to <30 m2 g−1. The GCS samples fabricated at higher temperatures demonstrated better electronic conductivity and a larger contribution from Na + insertion/extraction instead of adsorption/desorption to the capacity of constructed cells during charge/discharge. GCS carbonized at 850–1000 °C resulted in cells with the best capacity performance (>300 mAh g−1). The reason is that GCS produced at lower temperatures had insufficient conductivity and underwent limited electrochemical reactions with Na+, leading to a low capacity. On the other hand, an excessively high carbonization temperature produced carbons having a small d-spacing and lacking the beneficial carbonyl groups, which hindered both Na+ insertion/extraction and adsorption/desorption and therefore also reduced the cell capacity.",

        "abstract": "The chemical environments of the interlayer Na sites of layered titanate are finely controlled by the intercalation of n-alkylamine with various alkyl chain lengths to explore an effective way to improve its electrode functionality for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The n-alkylamine intercalation via ion-exchange and exfoliation-restacking routes allows the modification of in-plane structures of layered titanate to be tuned. Among the present n-alkylamine-intercalates, the n-pentylamine-intercalated titanate shows the largest discharge capacity with the best rate characteristics, underscoring the critical role of optimized intracrystalline structure in improving the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate. The creation of turbostratic in-plane structure degrades the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate, indicating the detrimental effect of in-plane structural disorder on electrode activity. 23Na magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates that the n-alkylamine-intercalated titanates possess two different interlayer Na+ sites near ammonium head groups/titanate layers and near alkyl chains. The intercalation of long-chain molecules increases the population of the latter site and the overall mobility of Na+ ions, which is responsible for the improvement of electrode activity upon n-alkylamine intercalation. The present study highlights that the increased population of interlayer metal sites remote from the host layers is effective in improving the electrode functionality of layered metal oxide for SIBs and multivalent ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Compared with the extensively used ester‐based electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) electrode is more compatible with the ether‐based counterpart in sodium‐ion batteries, which can lead to improved cycling stability and robust rate capability. However, the impact of salt anion on the electrochemical performance of HC electrodes has yet to be fully understood. In this study, the anionic chemistry in regulating the stability of electrolytes and the performance of sodium‐ion batteries have been systematically investigated. This work shows discrepancies in the reductive stability of the anionic group, redox kinetics, and component/structure of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with different salts (NaBF4, NaPF6, and NaSO3CF3) in the typical ether solvent (diglyme). Particularly, the density functional theory calculation manifests the preferred decomposition of PF6− due to the reduced reductive stability of anions in the solvation structure, thus leading to the formation of NaF‐rich SEI. Further investigation on redox kinetics reveals that the NaPF6/diglyme can induce the fast ionic diffusion dynamic and low charge transfer barrier for HC electrode, thus resulting in superior sodium storage performance in terms of rate capability and cycling life, which outperforms those of NaBF4/diglyme and NaSO3CF3/diglyme. Importantly, this work offers valuable insights for optimizing the electrochemical behaviors of electrode materials by regulating the anionic group in the electrolyte.",

Tin (Sn) is a promising alloying electrode with high capacity, redox reversibility, and earth abundance. Tin electrodes, however, undergo a series of intermediate reactions exhibiting multiple voltage plateaus upon sodiation/desodiation. Phase transformations related to incomplete sodiation in tin during cycling, in the presence of a frail solid electrolyte interphase layer, can quickly weaken the structural stability. The structural dynamics and reactivity of the electrode/electrolyte interface, being further dependent on the size and morphology of the active material particle in the presence of different electrolytes, dictate the electrode degradation and survivability during cycling. In this study, we paint a comprehensive picture of the underpinnings of the electrochemical and mechanics coupling and electrode/electrolyte interfacial interactions in alloying Sn electrodes. We elicit the fundamental role of electrode/electrolyte complexations in the Sn electrode structure-property-performance relationship based on multimodal analytics, including electrochemical, microscopy, and tomography analyses.",

The capacity originates from a conversion reaction, involving the reduction of transition metals to metallic forms and electrolyte decomposition. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles exhibit multiple redox peaks. The development of attractive negative electrode materials with high energy density, excellent structural stability and safety is crucial to advance the practical applications of sodium-ion batteries in the market.

Herein, an environmental friendly and versatile strategy is proposed to engineer anisotropically curved nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (CNCNs) derived from biosources with hydrosoluble and recyclable flux. After undergoing serious corrosion from the LiCl/KCl binary flux, the resulting CNCNs possess high structural stability. Notably, the CNCNs also possess a rational specific surface area, open porous structure, and abundant accessible edges, which can shorten the ion-diffusion path, provide abundant accessible active sites, and result in less charge-transfer impedance and excellent sodium-ion diffusion coefficient (8.9×10-10  cm2  s-1 ). As a consequence, CNCN electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 361.6 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 .

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are appealing electrode materials for lithium and sodium batteries owing to their high theoretical capacity. However, they are commonly characterized by rather poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, we investigate CoS2, serving as a model compound. We synthesized a porous CoS2/C micro-polyhedron composite entangled in a carbon-nanotube-based network (CoS2-C/CNT), starting from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 as a single precursor. Following an efficient two-step synthesis strategy, the obtained CoS2 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in porous carbonaceous micro-polyhedrons, interwoven with CNTs to ensure high electronic conductivity. The CoS2-C/CNT nanocomposite provides excellent bifunctional energy storage performance, delivering 1030 mAh g-1 after 120 cycles and 403 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles (at 100 mA g-1) as electrode for lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), respectively. In addition to these high capacities, the electrodes show outstanding rate capability and excellent long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles for LIBs and 90% after 200 cycles for SIBs. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals a significant contribution of the partially graphitized carbon to the lithium and at least in part also for the sodium storage and the report of a two-step conversion reaction mechanism of CoS2, eventually forming metallic Co and Li2S/Na2S. Particularly the lithium storage capability at elevated (dis-)charge rates, however, appears to be substantially pseudocapacitive, thus benefiting from the highly porous nature of the nanocomposite.",

        "abstract": "The application of small organic molecules for sodium‐ion batteries is generally plagued by their high solubility, poor conductivity, and sluggish redox dynamics in organic electrolyte, thus developing efficient strategies to restrain solubilization while obtaining fast charge transfer becomes a challenge. Herein, a rational hybridization strategy through hydrogen bond between organic molecule and inorganic substrate has been proposed, employing the terminal –C═O of trisodium 1, 2, 4‐benzenetricarboxylate (TBC) molecule and –OH groups of inorganic Ti3C2Tx MXene, respectively. In general, such a design evidently mitigates the aggregation of both TBC molecules and Ti3C2Tx MXene. Furthermore, the robust hydrogen bonding significantly mitigates the dissolution of TBC and guarantees the robust coupling between them, thus contributing to the integrity of electrode and modifying the electrochemical sodium storage in both half and full cells. Moreover, the systematic kinetic analysis and mechanism detection reveal improved charge transportation and robust two‐electron electrochemical reversibility of the hybrid TBC/Ti3C2Tx. Taken together, this work demonstrates a potential novel strategy toward stable and practical organic battery chemistries through hydrogen bonding with inorganic compounds.",

Particle dispersion is a key physical parameter of electrode materials, and understanding its impact on electrochemical performance is a prerequisite for obtaining high-performance PBAs. In this article, two PBAs samples with different particle dispersion were synthesized through sodium citrate-assisted co-precipitation method by means of staying and stirring. The influence of particle dispersion on electrochemical performance was investigated through polarization curve and AC impedance tests. It was found that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibited excellent rate performance, with a capacity of ~120 mAh g-1 at 1 C rate and a capacity retention of 75 % after 100 cycles. The capacity retention rate could reach 63 % at 5 C rate, far higher than that of PBAs samples with poor particle dispersion. From the perspective of electrochemical kinetics analysis, it has been shown that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibit smaller electrochemical polarization and faster Na+ diffusion reaction kinetics, which are key factors in achieving excellent rate performance.",

        "abstract": "The increasing interest in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) can be traced to sodium abundance, its low cost compared to lithium, and its intercalation chemistry being similar to that of lithium. We report that the electrochemical properties of a promising negative electrode material, Na2Ti3O7, are improved by exfoliating its layered structure and forming 2D nanoscale morphologies, nanoplatelets, and nanosheets. Exfoliation of Na2Ti3O7 was carried out by controlling the amount of proton exchange for Na+ and then proceeding with the intercalation of larger cations such as methylammonium and propylammonium. An optimized mixture of nanoplatelets and nanosheets exhibited the best electrochemical performance in terms of high capacities in the range of 100-150 mA h g-1 at high rates with stable cycling over several hundred cycles. These properties far exceed those of the corresponding bulk material, which is characterized by slow charge-storage kinetics and poor long-term stability. The results reported in this study demonstrate that charge-storage processes directed at 2D morphologies of surfaces and few layers of sheets are an exciting direction for improving the energy and power density of electrode materials for NIBs.",

        "abstract": "P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (P2-NiMn) is one of the promising positive electrode materials for high-energy Na-ion batteries because of large reversible capacity and high working voltage by charging up to 4.5 V versus Na+/Na. However, the capacity rapidly decays during charge/discharge cycles, which is caused by the large volume shrinkage of ca. 23% by sodium deintercalation and following electric isolation of P2-NiMn particles in the composite electrode. Serious electrolyte decomposition at the higher voltage region than 4.1 V also brings deterioration of the particle surface and capacity decay during cycles. To solve these drawbacks, we apply water-soluble sodium poly-γ-glutamate (PGluNa) as an efficient binder to P2-NiMn instead of conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) and examined the electrode performances of P2-NiMn composite electrode with PGluNa binder for the first time. The PGluNa electrode shows Coulombic efficiency of 95% at the first cycle and capacity retention of 89% after 50 cycles, whereas the PVdF electrode exhibits only 80 and 71%, respectively. The alternating current impedance measurements reveal that the PGluNa electrode shows a much lower resistance during the cycles compared with the PVdF one. From the surface analysis and peeling test of the electrodes, the PGluNa binder was found to cover the surface of the P2-NiMn particles and suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and surface degradation. The PGluNa binder further enhance the mechanical strength of the electrodes and suppresses the electrical isolation of the P2-NiMn particles during sodium extraction/insertion. The efficient binder with noticeable adhesion strength and surface coverage of active materials and carbon has paved a new way to enhance the electrochemical performances of high-voltage positive electrode materials for Na-ion batteries.",

These issues can be addressed through suitable structural modifications of PHC materials. Herein, the integration of high-surface-area PHCs with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) was accomplished by a simple electrospinning technique, which resulted in a uniform and reversible SEI layer. In the meantime, the CNFs' mesh provided connectivity and conductivity in the as-integrated electrodes, whereas PHCs offered fast diffusion kinetics and high Na+ ion storage capacity. Additionally, PHC integration with CNFs demonstrated an excellent ICE of 77% and a specific capacity of 505 mAh/g at 25 mA/g. Furthermore, the conjugated microstructure also provided flexibility and stability to the electrode (260 mAh/g after 500 cycles). This remarkable synergy may promote the development of free-standing, flexible, and highly porous properties in a single material for advanced energy storage applications.",

However, the high cost and low carbon yield of thermosetting precursors limit their practical application in SIBs, while low‐cost and high‐yield raw materials exhibit highly ordered carbon structures and narrow interlayer spacing under high‐temperature carbonization. Discarded polyimide materials are inexpensive, which offer a high carbon yield and possess good thermal stability and thermoplasticity, with functional groups of imide rings (−CO−N−CO−) on their main chains. This study recycled and converted polyimide materials into hard carbon materials from discarded engineering plastics, investigating the influence of carbonization temperature on the degree of graphitization, interlayer spacing, and pore structure of the materials to achieve high reversible sodium storage capacity. After carbonization at 1300 °C, the polyimide material exhibited 319 mAh g−1 reversible capacity and excellent electrochemical performance (with a capacity retention of 91.92 % after 100 cycles at a 0.5 C current rate) and rate performance (up to 242.5 mAh g−1 at 2 C).

Further innovations in circular-economy waste loops can facilitate higher economic benefits and lower environmental impacts, where a number of opportunities for improving pyrolytic carbon by choices of precursors, easy regulation of pyrolysis conditions and potential post-treatments. Here we propose a method to synthesize sustainable high-quality nanotube-like pyrolytic carbon using waste pyrolysis gas from the decomposition of waste epoxy resin as precursor, and conduct the exploration of its properties for possible use as a negative electrode material in sodium-ion batteries. The obtained pyrolytic carbon shows better cycling and rate performance than benchmark commercial hard carbon, retaining ∼105 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and exhibiting ∼57 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. Since the slope-dominated nature of pyrolytic carbon leads to high performance dependence on defects and pore structure, we therefore also investigate the preferred design of pore structure via pore-forming by post-treatment. It is found that reversible adsorption/desorption on defect sites and optimal pore structure are highly needed for pyrolytic carbon toward practical applications. This work highlights the potential of waste pyrolysis gas itself as a valuable feedstock for the production of value-added carbon materials.",

However, the relatively low volumetric density and high fragile structure are the obstacles blocking the development of hollow-structured electrode materials. In this work, ball-in-ball structured (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C nanospheres have been synthesized by using NiCo-glycerate as the precursor via solvothermal reaction, which was followed by a carbon coating treatment. In this structural design, hollow cavities are generated between the inner and outer balls to effectively accommodate the volume changes of the metal sulfides in the processes of charging/discharging, while the uniform carbon coating can increase the electrical conductivity and maintain the structural stability during repeated cycling. The Rietveld refinement, in situ X-ray diffraction, and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses provide evidence for an enlarged lattice parameter, weaker Co-S and Ni-S bonding, and a synergistic effect in the (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C towards boosting the conversion reaction and reversible formation of sulfur in the fully charged state, with the sulfur trapped within the composite to additionally account for the superior cycling stability of this material. Capacitive behavior has been verified to dominate the electrochemical reaction, enabling fast charge transport kinetics.

Five Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binders with different molecular weights and degrees of substitution were investigated. The increase in the CMC molecular weight led to an increase in the volume of water necessary for slurry preparation and a decrease in the electrode mass loading. Moreover, the adhesion of the slurry was strongly impacted by the aluminum current collector properties. A high initial Coulombic efficiency, iCE (up to ∼90%), and reversible capacity (up to 334 mAh g-1 at C/10) were obtained in Na half-cells. Post-mortem XPS analyses performed on several electrodes under various conditions allowed a better understanding of the formation and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The genesis of SEI was initially chemically driven: to a small extent, by HC and to a greater extent, by the Na metal. However, SEI formation was mainly governed by the electrochemical-driven degradation of the electrolyte salt and solvent. The SEI layer composed of an inorganic-rich core and an organic-rich shell significantly decreased the resistance of the HC electrode, allowing superior iCE while maintaining high capacity retention (96.2%), after 100 cycles at 1C.",

Herein, we reported a mechanism study of graphene-supported oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 nanotubes (nanowires) as the negative electrode material for sodium ion batteries. Different from the previous reports, the insertion/extraction of Na+ ions leads to almost no changes of titanium valence state but there is a charge redistribution of O 2p orbitals which alters the hybridization between O 2p and Ti 3d states, suggested by the combined electrochemical and X-ray spectroscopic study. Both the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during the reversible sodiation/desodiation process are revealed from the Ti L-edge and O K-edge spectra.

        "title": "Marcasite/pyrite nanocomposites confined in N,S-doped carbon nanoboxes for boosted alkali metal ion storage.",
        "abstract": "FeS2 is a promising electrode material for alkali metal ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. However, it still faces critical issues such as suboptimal rate and cycling performances owing to sluggish charge transport and significant volume variations. Herein, we constructed FeS2 (m-FeS2) and pyrite FeS2 (p-FeS2) nanocomposites embedded in N,S-doped carbon nanoboxes (m/p-FeS2@NSCN) to conquer such challenges. The microstructure design of nanoboxes effectively alleviates the stress caused by the volume expansion of FeS2 during lithiation processes, thereby improving the cycling stability of the FeS2 electrode. The marcasite/pyrite compositing design further increases the electronic conductivity of FeS2 and optimizes ion migration. As expected, the target m/p-FeS2@NSCN exhibits improved rate capability (595.5 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) and robust cycling stability (500 cycles without significant capacity decay at 0.1 A g-1) in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, m/p-FeS2@NSCN also shows excellent battery performances and potential application prospects in the field of sodium-ion batteries. It achieves a capacity of 355 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1 and sustains 800 cycles without noticeable capacity decay at 0.5 A g-1. This work offers valuable guidance for rationally designing high-performance energy storage materials for alkali metal ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Technological advancement has been revolutionized by rechargeable batteries, without which the use of various modern devices would not be possible. Aqueous Na ion batteries have lately garnered much attention, being recognized as a promising alternative to the commonly used Li ion batteries for the large-scale energy storage systems. However, further improvement and optimization of such systems require a more detailed understanding of intercalation mechanisms. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the implementation of the laser-induced current transient (LICT) technique for in situ characterization of battery systems and investigate the interface between Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] model battery electrodes and aqueous electrolytes in contact with aqueous electrolytes. Quite counterintuitively, the LICT method revealed that at the quasi-steady-state the electrode surface stays positively charged within the potential range where the intercalation/deintercalation of sodium as well as of potassium is possible, evidencing that the intercalation mechanism of the alkali-metal cations should be rather complex. Furthermore, the specific shape of the observed current transients indicates that the interfacial processes of intercalation/deintercalation have at least three different relaxation time constants. The relaxation behavior is highly influenced by the nature of the alkali-metal cations-most likely through their different solvation energy. In addition, we outline how the laser-based experiments can intensify detailed in situ investigations of battery systems.",

Herein, we first prepared Na2.60Fe1.70(SO4)3@graphene oxide (GO) composite via a facile solid-phase ball milling strategy, which are Na2.60Fe1.70(SO4)3 particles embedded in cross-linked GO networks. For the cathode of SIBs, the active particles in the material are wrapped with cross-linked GO networks that increases the electrolyte penetration and ion transport channels as well as improves electronic conductivity, resulting in a high operating voltage of 3.74 V and excellent cycle stability (retains over 70 % of capacity after 500 cycles at 8 C). Notably, the as-prepared material could exhibit a reversible capacity of 100 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C as anode for SIBs. Furthermore, the material was first used to assemble symmetric sodium-ion full cell, demonstrating excellent electrochemical performance (achieving 60 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C).

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries have been developed using ionic liquids as electrolytes. Sodium is superior to lithium as a raw material for mass production of large-scale batteries for energy storage due to its abundance and even distribution across the earth. Ionic liquids are non-volatile and non-flammable, which improved the safety of the batteries remarkably. In addition, operation temperatures were extended to higher values, improving the performance of the batteries by facilitating the reaction at the electrode and mass transfer. Binary systems of sodium and quaternary ammonium salts, such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium and N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide, were employed as electrolytes for sodium ion batteries. A series of positive and negative electrode materials were examined to be combined with these ionic liquid electrolytes. A 27 Ah full cell was fabricated employing sodium chromite (NaCrO2 ) and hard carbon as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively. The gravimetric energy density obtained for the battery was 75 Wh kg-1 and its volumetric energy density was 125 Wh L-1 . The capacity retention after 500 cycles was 87 %. Further improvement of the cell performance and energy density is expected on development of suitable electrode materials and optimization of the cell design.",

        "abstract": "Slow ion kinetics of negative electrode materials is the main factor of limiting fast charge and discharge of batteries. Sluggish Na+ kinetics property leads to large electrode polarization, resulting in poor rate and cyclic performances. Herein, an electrode of ultrasmall tin nanoparticles decorated in N, S codoped carbon monolith (TCM) with exceptional high-rate capability and ultrastable cycling behavior for Na-storage is reported. The resulted TCM electrode exhibits an extremely high retention of 96% initial charge capacity after 500 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g-1 . Significantly, when the current density is elevated to an ultrahigh rate of 5000 mA g-1 , a high reversible capacity of 228 mAh g-1 after the 2000th cycle is still maintained. More importantly, the stable and fast Na-storage of TCM is investigated and understood by experimental characterizations and kinetics calculations, including interfacial ion/electron transport behavior, ion diffusion, and quantitative pseudocapacitive analysis. These investigations elucidate that the TCM shows improved ion/electron conductivity and enhanced interfacial kinetics. An entirely new perspective to deep insights into the fast ion/electron transport mechanisms revealed by interfacial kinetics of sodiation/desodiation, which contributes to the profound understanding for developing fast charging/discharging and long-term stable electrodes in sodium-ion batteries, is provided.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) electrodes in sodium‐ion batteries exhibit intrinsic shortcomings such as sluggish reaction kinetics, unstable conversion thermodynamics, and substantial volumetric strain effects, which lead to electrochemical failure. This report unlocks a design paradigm of VSe2−x/C in‐plane heterojunction with built‐in anion vacancy, achieved through an in situ functionalization and self‐limited growth approach. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal the bifunctional role of the Se vacancy in enhancing the ion diffusion kinetics and the structural thermodynamics of NaxVSe2 active phases. Moreover, this in‐plane heterostructure facilitates complete face contact between the two components and tight interfacial conductive contact between the conversion phases, resulting in enhanced reaction reversibility. The VSe2−x/C heterojunction electrode exhibits remarkable sodium‐ion storage performance, retaining specific capacities of 448.7 and 424.9 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at current densities of 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 353.1 mAh g−1 even under the demanding condition of 100 A g−1, surpassing most previous achievements. The proposed strategy can be extended to other V5S8−x and V2O5−x‐based heterojunctions, marking a conceptual breakthrough in advanced electrode design for constructing high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "High‐entropy Prussian blue analogues (HE‐PBAs) show great promise as active materials in Na‐ion batteries, particularly due to their multimetallic synergism that enhances electrochemical performance. This study explores two HE‐PBAs: Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Fe(CN)6 (HE‐PBA‐1) and Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2Fe(CN)6 (HE‐PBA‐2). Both crystallize in monoclinic (P21/n) symmetry, but HE‐PBA‐1, with Cu, exhibits a lower bandgap, lower Na‐ion diffusion barrier, higher [Fe(CN)6] vacancy, and smaller particle size compared to HE‐PBA‐2 with Zn. These factors result in higher power capability for HE‐PBA‐1 due to its enhanced electronic conductivity and Na‐ion diffusivity. Additionally, its higher [Fe(CN)6] vacancy and smaller particle size offer more electrochemical active sites, improving energy characteristics. A Na‐ion full cell with HE‐PBA‐1 as the positive electrode and a mixed‐metallic sodium–copper–iron oxide (NaCuFe‐Oxide) as the negative electrode in a hydrogel electrolyte is assembled. It achieves a specific capacity of 94 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, an energy density of 70 Wh kg−1 at 74 W kg−1, a power density of 375 W kg−1 at 57 Wh kg−1, and excellent durability with 89% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1 within a 0–2 V window.

The structure advantages of the electrode contribute to high electrochemical performance in the ester-based electrolyte, while fast ionic diffusion and favorable capacitive behavior result in the robust sodium storage performance in the ether-based electrolyte. Heterostructure engineering combined with carbonaceous materials shows great promise toward promoting sluggish kinetics, improving electronic conductivity, and mitigating the huge expansion of transition metal sulfide electrodes for high-performance sodium storage. Herein, the iron sulfide-based heterostructures in situ hybridized with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Fe_7S_8/FeS_2/NCNT) have been prepared through a successive pyrolysis and sulfidation approach. The Fe_7S_8/FeS_2/NCNT heterostructure delivered a high reversible capacity of 403.2 mAh g^−1 up to 100 cycles at 1.0 A g^−1 and superior rate capability (273.4 mAh g^−1 at 20.0 A g^−1) in ester-based electrolyte. Meanwhile, the electrodes also demonstrated long-term cycling stability (466.7 mAh g^−1 after 1,000 cycles at 5.0 A g^−1) and outstanding rate capability (536.5 mAh g^−1 at 20.0 A g^−1) in ether-based electrolyte. This outstanding performance could be mainly attributed to the fast sodium-ion diffusion kinetics, high capacitive contribution, and convenient interfacial dynamics in ether-based electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Earth-abundant TiO_2 is a promising negative electrode material for low-cost sodium-ion batteries. Here, authors show that ordered rocksalt NaTiO_2 nanograins are in situ formed by electrochemically cycling with Na^+ ions in anatase TiO_2, which determines the pseudocapacitive high-rate capability. Earth-abundant TiO_2 is a promising negative electrode for low-cost sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high capacity, rapid (dis)charging capability, safe operation potential and nonflammability. Crystalline anatase TiO_2 is not suitable for reversible Na^+ (de)intercalation, but it displays pseudocapacitive response after repeated cycles. Herein, we find and demonstrate that ordered rocksalt (RS) NaTiO_2 nanograins are in situ formed by electrochemically cycling with Na^+ ions in anatase and amorphous TiO_2. The in situ formed RS-NaTiO_2 follows a solid-solution reaction with small volume changes of only 2.0%, that determines the pseudocapacitive “mirror-like” cyclic voltammetry curve with a couple of broad redox peaks at 0.75 V vs. Na^+/Na, a high capacity of 253 mAh g^−1, high-rate capability and thousands of stable cycles. The multistep crystalline-to-amorphous-to-RS transformations are able to be electrochemically activated during the aging process of assembled full cells. Our finding provides a direction for developing unconventional Ti-based high-performance active materials for SIBs with both high energy and power densities.",

        "abstract": "There is a crucial need for low-cost energy storage technology based on abundant sodium ions to realize sustainable development with renewable energy resources. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is applied as a binder in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, PVDF is also known to suffer from a larger irreversible capacity, especially when PVDF is used as the binder of negative electrode materials. In this research, a poly(acrylonitrile)-grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer (PVA-g-PAN) is tested as a binder with Ti-based layered oxides as potential negative electrode materials for SIBs. The chemical stability tests of PVDF and PVA-g-PAN contacted with metallic sodium have been conducted, which reveals that PVDF experiences a defluorination process, while PVA-g-PAN demonstrates excellent chemical stability. Composite electrodes with PVA-g-PAN demonstrate superior electrochemical performances when compared with the PVDF binder, allowing improvement for initial CE, higher rate capability, and long cyclability over 1500 cycles. Detailed characterization of electrodes via soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that the PVA-g-PAN branched structure allows a more uniform distribution of acetylene black with higher coatability, unlocking enhanced rate performances and efficient passivation of Ti-based oxides without the excessive electrolyte decomposition. These findings open a new way to design practical and durable sodium-ion batteries with a high-power density.",

        "abstract": "The abundant reserve and low cost of sodium have provoked tremendous evolution of Na-ion batteries (SIBs) in the past few years, but their performances are still limited by either the specific capacity or rate capability. Attempts to pursue high rate ability with maintained high capacity in a single electrode remains even more challenging. Here, an elaborate self-branched 2D SnS2 (B-SnS2) nanoarray electrode is designed by a facile hot bath method for Na storage. This interesting electrode exhibits areal reversible capacity of ca. 3.7 mAh cm-2 (900 mAh g-1) and rate capability of 1.6 mAh cm-2 (400 mAh g-1) at 40 mA cm-2 (10 A g-1). Improved extrinsic pseudocapacitive contribution is demonstrated as the origin of fast kinetics of an alloying-based SnS2 electrode. Sodiation dynamics analysis based on first-principles calculations, ex-situ HRTEM, in situ impedance, and in situ Raman technologies verify the S-edge effect on the fast Na+ migration and reversible and sensitive structure evolution during high-rate charge/discharge. The excellent alloying-based pseudocapacitance and unsaturated edge effect enabled by self-branched surface nanoengineering could be a promising strategy for promoting development of SIBs with both high capacity and high rate response.",

The as‐prepared TiS2 demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1040 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with the capacity contribution of 521 mA h g−1 in the voltage region below 1.0 V (vs Na/Na+), remarkable initial coulombic efficiency of 95.9% and superior rate capability of 621 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1. The high conductivity of the Ti‐based compounds and nanosized particles generated by chemical conversion reactions could minimize the entropic barrier for the reversible conversion, resulting in high reversibility and ultrafast charge/discharge ability of the electrode.

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) metal sulfides show great promises for their potential applications as electrode materials of sodium ion batteries because of the weak interlayer van der Waals interactions which allow the reversible accommodation and extraction of sodium ions. The sodiation of metal sulfides can undergo a distinct process compared to that of lithiation, which is determined by their metal and structural types. However, the structural and morphological evolution during its electrochemical sodiation is still unclear. Here, we studied the sodiation reaction dynamics of TiS2 by employing in situ transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. During the sodium ion intercalation process, we observed multiple intermediate phases (phase II, phase Ib, and phase Ia), different from its lithiation counterpart, with varied sodium occupation sites and interlayer stacking sequences. Further insertion of Na ions prompted a multi-step extrusion reaction which led to the phase separation of Ti metal from the Na2S matrix, with its 2D morphology expanded to a 3D morphology. In contrast to regular conversion electrodes, TiS2 still maintained a compacted structure after a full sodiation. Frist-principles calculations reveal that the as-identified phases are thermodynamically preferred at corresponding intercalation/extrusion stages compared to other possible phases. The present work provides the fundamental mechanistic understanding of the sodiation process of 2D transition metal sulfides.",

Electrochemical properties of low-crystallized CNS electrodes in dilute and concentrated sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide/ethylene carbonate + dimethyl carbonate (NaTFSA/EC + DMC) were first investigated. From the cyclic voltammograms, both lithium ion and sodium ion can reversibly insert into/from CNSs in all of the electrolytes used here. The cycling stability of CNSs in concentrated electrolytes was better than that in dilute electrolytes for the SIB system. The interfacial charge-transfer resistances at the interface between CNSs and organic electrolytes were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In the Nyquist plots, the semicircles at the middle-frequency region were assigned to the parallel circuits of charge-transfer resistances and capacitances. The interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistances in concentrated organic electrolytes were much smaller than those in dilute electrolytes, and the rate capability of CNS electrodes in sodium salt-concentrated electrolytes might be better than in dilute electrolytes, suggesting that CNSs with concentrated electrolytes are the candidate of SIB negative electrode materials with high rate capability. The calculated activation energies of interfacial sodium-ion transfer were dependent on electrolyte compositions and similar to those of interfacial lithium-ion transfer.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of solvated sodium ions into graphite is a highly reversible process, but leads to large, undesired electrode expansion/shrinkage (“breathing”). Herein, two strategies to mitigate the electrode expansion are studied. Starting with the standard configuration (−) sodium | diglyme (2G) electrolyte | graphite (poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder) (+), the PVDF binder is first replaced with a binder made of the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Second, ethylenediamine (EN) is added to the electrolyte solution as a co‐solvent. The electrode breathing is followed in situ (operando) through electrochemical dilatometry (ECD). It is found that replacing PVDF with CMC is only effective in reducing the electrode expansion during initial sodiation. During cycling, the electrode breathing for both binders is comparable. Much more effective is the addition of EN. The addition of 10 v/v EN to the diglyme electrolyte strongly reduces the electrode expansion during the initial sodiation (+100% with EN versus +175% without EN) as well as the breathing during cycling. A more detailed analysis of the ECD signals reveals that solvent co‐intercalation temporarily leads to pillaring of the graphite lattice and that the addition of EN to 2G leads to a change in the sodium storage mechanism.",

These electrodes also demonstrate charge efficiencies higher than 99.8 % and specific capacities comparable to MXenes electrodes. These outstanding electrochemical performances are further validated at the full-cell level when combined with Na0.44MnO2 positive electrodes.

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion batteries are the most explored 'beyond-Li' battery systems, yet their energy densities are still largely limited by the positive electrode material. Na3FeF6 is a promising Earth-abundant containing electrode and operates through a conversion-type charge-discharge reaction associated with a high theoretical capacity (336 mA h g-1). In practice, however, only a third of this capacity is achieved during electrochemical cycling. In this study, we demonstrate a new rapid and environmentally-friendly assisted-microwave method for the preparation of Na3FeF6. A comprehensive understanding of charge-discharge processes and of the reactivity of the cycled electrode samples is achieved using a combination of electrochemical tests, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetometry, and 23Na/19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) complemented with first principles calculations of NMR properties. We find that the primary performance limitation of the Na3FeF6 electrode is the sluggish kinetics of the conversion reaction, while the methods employed for materials synthesis and electrode preparation do not have a significant impact on the conversion efficiency and reversibility. Our work confirms that Na3FeF6 undergoes conversion into NaF and Fe(s) nanoparticles. The latter are found to be prone to oxidation prior to ex situ measurements, thus necessitating a robust analysis of the stable phases (here, NaF) formed upon conversion.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, research on composite materials with two different energy storage methods, capacitors and batteries, has attracted significant attention and has the potential to enhance energy and power density and long-cycle stability. However, the introduction of double-layer energy storage materials in sodium-ion batteries has been investigated. We prepared composite cathode materials of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) and activated carbon (AC) by physical mixing, which not only increased the specific surface area of the active material for ion adsorption but also improved the conductivity and wettability to reduce the ion transfer impedance. The electrochemical data showed that the electrode with a mass fraction of 3 % AC exhibited superior electrochemical performance compared to the pure NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3 electrode. It retained a discharge specific capacity of 62.8 mA h g−1 at 10 C and showed optimal capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. Simulations were carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 to investigate the kinetic mechanism of the electrochemical reaction. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of AC can accelerate the reaction kinetics at the electrode by suppressing the concentration polarization of sodium ions and ensuring that the active material is more fully utilized, thus increasing the discharge capacity at high multiples. This provides a new direction of inquiry for exploring cathode materials with excellent high-rate performance and long-cycle stability.",

Recently, this have been partly discovered as Na3LiTi5O12 (NTO) phase in the Li4Ti5O12 particle. However, the single-phase NTO material have never been obtained, preventing accurate material characterizations and applications. Here, we successfully realized the NTO material with single-phase by chemical sodium insertion-extraction process. The chemical sodium-inserted LTO material is well converted to pure NTO phase in the single particle level, via following chemical oxidation by water. The purified material was about 97 mol % of NTO as single-phase spinel structure with a = 8.746 Å. The basic lattice framework of prepared NTO was confirmed as same as the LTO. The single-phase NTO electrode show 0.8 V vs Na+/Na of Na-insertion and extraction potential, and 99.4 % of Na-insertion capacity with 99.7 % of coulombic efficiency during 200 cycles of Na-ion half-cell experiment. Further, the Na2Fe2(SO4)3 / NTO full-cell shows 3 V-class stable charge-discharge character during 100 cycles. These excellent stability of Na-insertion and extraction properties of single-phase NTO extends the range of constructing safe and stable high-voltage oxide-based sodium-ion battery cells in practical use.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are considered as an economical electrode material for sodium-ion batteries, which can be synthesized on a large scale through a simple and low-cost co-precipitation method. The physical parameters of PBAs have a significant impact on their electrochemical performance, among which sodium content is considered one of the key factors affecting electrochemical performance. In this study, PBAs with different sodium contents are prepared using sodium citrate-assisted co-precipitation method, and the influence of sodium content on the electrochemical performance is systematically investigated. Furthermore, the morphological and structural changes of cubic and monoclinic PBAs samples after cycling are studied to explore the intrinsic mechanism of how sodium content affects the electrochemical performance. The study reveals that when the sodium content exceeds 1.5, the structure of PBAs will transfer from cubic phase to monoclinic phase. In terms of electrochemical performance, compared to cubic phase, monoclinic phase samples exhibit higher initial capacity, but lower rate capability and cycling performance, and their cycling stability deteriorates more severely with increasing sodium content. The cubic phase exhibits a more stable crystal structure compared to the monoclinic phase after cycling. During the charge-discharge process, the de-intercalation of excessive sodium ions in monoclinic PBAs leads to structural distortion, triggering the phase transition and resulting in the destruction of the crystal structure, which is the fundamental reason for the influence of sodium content on the electrochemical performance.",

Herein, a hybrid electrode, consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon/α-MnS/flake graphite composite (α-MnS@N-C/FG), was prepared via a post-sulfurization route. In the α-MnS@N-C/FG composite, α-MnS nanoparticles that wrapped by N-C layer are uniformly embedded onto FG, forming a novel nanofoam structure. As-obtained α-MnS@N-C/FG shows excellent lithium/sodium storage performance, with a specific capacity of 712 mAh g-1 in the 700th cycle at 1.0 A g-1 or 186.4 mAh g-1 in the 100th cycle at 100 mA g-1 using lithium or sodium foil as the counter electrode, respectively. Moreover, even operated at stern temperature of -20 oC, the α-MnS@N-C/FG can still attain high specific capacity of 350 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g-1 for LIBs. This exceptional electrochemical response is endorsed to the synergetic effect of the smart design of a hybrid nanofoam structure, in which the FG skeleton and N-C coating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode from bottom to up. Accordingly, the enhanced redox kinetics endow the electrode with pseudocapacitive-dominated electrochemical behaviors, thus bringing fast electrode reactions and robust structural stability to the whole electrode.",

        "abstract": "Organic electrodes possess numerous advantages of structure designability, high capacity, and accommodating large cations. However, the capacity of organic electrode materials in sodium-ion batteries remains low, and their solubility in organic electrolytes leads to a shortened lifespan. Researchers are thus concerned about enhancing their performance through compound design. In this study, we successfully improved both the capacity and cycling stability by simply grafting amino acids onto organic compounds (PMCDI). Firstly, the introduction of amino acids facilitated the formation of a more stable layered structure of PMCDI through hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the amino acid groups promoted intermolecular interactions between the organic electrode material and the carboxymethyl cellulose binder, thereby reducing interfacial resistance and significantly enhancing the cycling stability for over 2000 cycles. Secondly, both experimental and computational results revealed that the non-conjugated carboxylic acid group provided Na^+ transport pathways and an additional reversible storage site, leading to an improvement in specific capacity (~300 mA h g^−1). The strategy employed in this work sheds light on the design of organic molecules for future sodium-ion batteries. 有机电极具有结构可设计性强、 容量大、 可容纳大离子等优点. 然而, 在钠离子电池中, 有机电极材料的容量仍然很低, 且其在有机电解质中的高溶解度导致其寿命较短. 如何通过化合物设计来提高其性能一直是研究人员关注的问题. 本研究通过简单方法将氨基酸接枝到有机化合物上, 提高了其容量和循环稳定性. 首先, 氨基酸之间的氢键使其形成更稳定的层状结构; 氨基酸基团在有机电极材料和羧甲基纤维素粘合剂之间形成分子间相互作用, 降低界面阻力, 显著提高循环稳定性, 使得钠离子电池循环次数超过2000次. 其次, 实验和计算结果表明, 氨基酸基团提供了Na^+转运途径和额外的可逆存储位点, 从而提高了比容量(~300 mA h g^−1). 本策略可以启发未来钠离子电池的有机分子设计.",

The abundance of sodium, along with the potential utilization of electrode materials without critical elements in their composition, led to the intensification of research on SIBs. Hard carbon (HC), is identified as the most suitable negative electrode for SIBs. It can be obtained by pyrolysis of eco‐friendly and renewable precursors, such as biomasses, biopolymers or synthetic polymers. Distinct HC properties can be obtained by tuning the precursors and the synthesis conditions, with a direct impact on the performance of SIBs. In this work, an in‐depth overview of how the synthesis parameters of HC affect their properties (porosity, structure, morphology, surface chemistry, and defects) is provided. Several synthesis‐property relationships are established based on a database created using extensive literature data. Moreover, HC properties are correlated with the electrochemical performance (initial Coulombic efficiency (iCE) and reversible capacity) vs. Na, in half‐cells. The Na‐ion storage mechanisms and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation are discussed along with the HC performance in full‐cell devices, as well as the SIB prototypes and a short history of SIBs enterprises.",

Synthesis attempts using both conventional solid-state routes and high-pressure methods were explored for the compositional range 1.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.67. Based on Rietveld refinements against powder X-ray diffraction data, analyses of 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy data, and elemental analysis by electron microprobe, the existence of a confined compositional solid solution (1 ≤ x ≤ 1.3) adopting the CaFe2O4-type postspinel structure is demonstrated. This is contrasted with the NaFexTi2-xO4 system, for which no evidence of a solid solution is observed. However, for all explored synthetic routes of NaFexRu2-xO4 compositions, a trivalent iron oxidation state is maintained. Structural analysis and qualitative bond valence energy landscape models reveal that the progressive integration of iron into the postspinel framework results in narrowed sodium ion diffusion channels, restricting electrochemical deintercalation of sodium. Consequently, the CaFe2O4-type iron-rich compounds explored in this study demonstrate limited potential as positive electrode materials for sodium batteries. It is expected that this fundamental insight will help guide the exploration of alternative NaM2O4-based positive electrode materials with similar structure types.",

The MoS2/SWNT composite films are highly porous, electrically conductive, and mechanically robust due to its percolating carbon nanotube network. When directly employed as the working electrode, they exhibit a specific capacity of >400 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of ∼650 mAh/cm(3). Their mechanical stability allows them to be processed into free-standing films with tunable thickness up to ∼100 μm, corresponding to an areal loading of 15 mg/cm(2). Their high electrical conductivity allows the high volumetric capacity to be retained, even at high thickness, resulting in state-of-the-art areal capacities of >4.0 mAh/cm(2).

We demonstrated that the introduction of melamine played an essential role in the construction of V2O3/NC HSs. Benefitting from the special mesoporous structure and large specific surface area, the as-obtained sample exhibited enhanced conductivity and structural stability. As a proof of concept, well-defined V2O3/NC HSs exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate performance for sodium-ion batteries, and achieved a discharge capacity of 263.8 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, one of the best performances of V-based compounds. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the hollow structure and surface carbon coating.

The preferential occupancy of the alkaline M1 position by Mg2+ ions has been found for the first time - a phenomenon which appears to be opposite to the case of Mg-substituted LiMnPO4, where Mg2+ and Mn2+ reside in the M2 position. Mg solubility in NaMnPO4 is limited in the range of 0.10 < Mg/(Mg + Mn) < 0.15 mole part. Mg-substituted NaMnPO4 is prepared at 200 °C by ionic exchange reactions involving the participation of mixed dittmarite salts, KMn1-xMgxPO4·H2O. The structural aspects of Mg substitution in NaMnPO4 are studied by combination of powder X-ray diffraction using the Rietveld analysis with IR and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

        "abstract": "Metallic state two-dimensional SnS2 nanosheets with expanded lattice spacing and defect-rich structure were synthesized by nickel element intercalating into van der Waals gap of SnS2. They can efficiently enhance the electrochemical performance owing to the change of electron state density and energy band structure. Deeper exploration of foreign doped metal ions location and understanding of the corresponding influences are investigated in this work by experimental results and theoretical calculation. Meanwhile, the optimized architecture has also made great contribution to the enhanced electrochemical performance by in situ growing nanosheets on carbon fibers uniformly. It has the inherent advantages of shorter paths for ion insertion and extraction, larger contact area for more sodium diffusion pathways and superior electrolyte penetration. Benefiting from the Ni intercalated bilayer SnS2, the internal adjustment of electronic state and the enlarged interlayer spacing significantly enhanced electron transport kinetics, which can be explained by the metallic state related properties. The integrated electrode exhibits initial high reversible capacity of 794.9 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, with a stable capacity retention of 666.3 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. The integrated electrode structure can be also beneficial to meet increasing future requirements for different shape and volume-limited devices, such as flexible or foldable electrodes.",

The Mössbauer spectra confirm that iron is trivalent. The impedance measurements indicate that the silver phase is a better conductor than the sodium phase.

        "title": "Electron-Injection-Engineering Induced Phase Transition toward Stabilized 1T-MoS2 with Extraordinary Sodium Storage Performance.",
        "abstract": "Phase transition engineering, with the ability to alter the electronic structure and physicochemical properties of materials, has been widely used to achieve the thermodynamically unstable metallic phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2), although the complex operating conditions and low yield of previous strategies make the large-scale fabrication of 1T-MoS2 a big challenge. Herein, we report a facile electron injection strategy for phase transition engineering and fabricate a composite of conductive TiO chemically bonded to 1T-MoS2 nanoflowers (TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs) on a large scale. The underlying mechanism analysis reveals that electron-injection-engineering triggers a reorganization of the Mo 4d orbitals and results in a 100% phase transition of MoS2 from 2H to 1T. In the TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs composite, the 1T-MoS2 demonstrates a higher electronic conductivity, a lower Na+ diffusion barrier, and a more restricted S release than 2H-MoS2. In addition, conductive TiO bonding successfully resolves the stability challenge of the 1T phase. These merits endow TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs electrodes with an excellent rate capability (650/288 mAh g-1 at 50/20 000 mA g-1, respectively) and an outstanding cyclability (501 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 after 700 cycles) in sodium ion batteries. Such an improvement signifies that this facile and scalable phase-transition engineering combined with a deep mechanism analysis offers an important reference for designing advanced materials for various applications.",

        "title": "Exceptional Sodium-Ion Storage by an Aza-Covalent Organic Framework for High Energy and Power Density Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Redox-active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a new class of material with the potential to transform electrochemical energy storage due to the well-defined porosity and readily accessible redox-active sites of COFs. However, combining both high specific capacity and energy density in COF-based batteries remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of Aza-COF in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Aza-COF is a microporous 2D COF synthesized from hexaketocyclohexane and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine by a condensation reaction, which affords phenazine-decorated channels and a theoretical specific capacity of 603 mA h g-1. The Aza-COF-based electrode exhibits an exceptional average specific capacity (550 mA h g-1), energy density (492 W h kg-1) at 0.1 C, and power density (1182 W kg-1) at 40 C. The high capacity and energy density are attributed to swift surface-controlled redox processes and rapid sodium-ion diffusion inside the porous electrode. Rate capability studies showed that the battery also performs well at high current rates: 1 C (363 mA h g-1), 5 C (232 mA h g-1), 10 C (161 mA h g-1), and 20 C (103 mA h g-1). In addition, the long-term cycling stability test revealed very good capacity retention (87% at 5 C) and Coulombic efficiencies near unity over 500 cycles.",

Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O crystallizes with a monoclinic symmetry, space group P21/c, with a = 5.5415(2), b = 8.3447(3), c = 11.2281(3) Å, β = 100.172(1)°, V = 511.05(3) Å3 and Z = 2. Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O also crystallizes with a monoclinic symmetry, space group P21/c, with a = 12.5050(8), b = 6.4812(4), c = 10.0210(6) Å, β = 106.138(2)°, V = 780.17(8) Å3 and Z = 2. Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O is a new member of the blödite family of compounds, whereas Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O is isostructural with Na2Mg(SO4)2·10H2O. The structure of Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O is built up of [Mn(SO4)2(H2O)4]2− building blocks connected through moderate O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the sodium atoms occupying the large tunnels along the a axis and the manganese atom lying on an inversion center, whereas the structure of Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O is built up of [Ni(H2O)6]2+ and [Na2(SO4)2(H2O)4]2− layers. These layers which are parallel to the (100) plane are interconnected through moderate O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The thermal gravimetric- and the powder X-ray diffraction-analyzes showed that only the nickel phase was almost pure. At a temperature above 300 °C, all the water molecules evaporated and a structural phase transition from P21/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O to C2/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2 was observed. C2/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2 is thermally more stable than Na2Fe(SO4)2 and therefore it would be suitable as the positive electrode for sodium ion batteries if a stable electrolyte at high voltage is developed.",

        "abstract": "For alkali-metal ion batteries, revealing the phase transformation and the ion migration dynamics in the electrodes is vital for understanding how the electrodes work and thereby how we can improve them. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we track the structural evolution and migration dynamics during sodium insertion into TiS2 nanostructures with the lattice fringe resolution. We find that the sodiation process of TiS2 is initiated by an intercalation reaction and followed by a conversion reaction. From the same reaction event, the velocity of intercalation/conversion phase boundary migration is found to be ∼1.0-1.7 nm s-1, while the pristine/intercalation phase boundary migrates at a velocity of ∼2.5 nm s-1. The sodium migration leads to structural fracture to form nanometer-sized domains (∼3 nm) with volume expansion. During migration, Na prefers to transport along specific directions. Furthermore, a superstructured Na0.25TiS2 intermediate phase with ordered Na ions occupied within the (0001) plane is formed at the reaction front, which is different from the common staging phase. These findings help us understand the working principle and the failure mechanism of the sodium ion battery and also provide useful insights into the general ionic doping of transition metal dichalcogenides.",

        "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) have been considered as an alternative class of electrolytes compared to conventional carbonate solvents in rechargeable lithium/sodium batteries. However, the drawbacks of ILs are their reducing ionic conductivity and their large viscosity. Therefore, mixtures of alkyl carbonate solvents with an IL and a sodium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) have been investigated to develop new electrolytes for sodium‐ion batteries. In this work, N‐Butyl‐N‐methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoro‐methanesulfonyl) imide (Py14TFSI) was used as co‐solvent mixing with commercial electrolytes based on the carbonate, i.e. EC‐PC (1:1), EC‐DMC (1:1), and EC‐PC‐DMC (3:1:1). The addition of ionic liquid in the carbonate‐based electrolyte solution results in (i) enhancing ionic conductivity to be comparable with a solvent‐free IL‐based electrolyte, (ii) maintaining the electrochemical stability window, and (iii) IL acted as a retardant rather than a flame‐inhibitor based on the self‐extinguish time (SET) of the mixed electrolyte mixture when exposed to a free flame. All mixed electrolyte systems have been tested in sodium‐coin cells versus Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) and hard carbon (HC) electrodes. The cells show good performances in charge/discharge cycling with a retention > 96 % after 30 cycles (∼90 mAh.g‐1 for NMO and 180 mAh.g‐1 for HC, respectively) demonstrating good interfacial stability and highly stable discharge capacities.",

Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe-PDA-220) with a unique d-π conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly-aminoquinone chains to form Fe-C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the distinctive Fe-C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the π-d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer.

        "abstract": "The performance of electrode material is correlated with the choice of electrolyte, however, how the solvation has significant impact on electrochemical behavior is underdeveloped. Herein, N-heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is investigated to reveal the solvation effect on the performance of sodium-ion batteries in different electrolyte environment. TAPQ cycled in diglyme-based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate-based electrolyte. The function of solvation effect is mainly embodied in two aspects: one is the stabilization of anion intermediate via the compatibility of electrode and electrolyte, the other is the interfacial electrochemical characteristics influenced by solvation sheath structure. By revealing the failure mechanism, this work presents an avenue for better understanding electrochemical behavior and enhancing performance from the angle of solvation effect.",

        "title": "Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of Sodium Ion Transport in NaSICON Electrodes",
        "abstract": "The development of high-performance sodium (Na) ion batteries requires improved electrode materials. The energy and power densities of Na superionic conductor (NaSICON) electrode materials are promising for large-scale energy storage applications. However, several practical issues limit the full utilization of the theoretical energy densities of NaSICON electrodes. A pressing challenge lies in the limited sodium extraction in low Na content NaSICONs, e.g., $\\rm Na_1V^{IV}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 \\leftrightarrow V^{V}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 + 1e^- + 1Na^+$. Hence, it is important to quantify the Na-ion mobility in a broad range of NaSICON electrodes. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo approach bearing the accuracy of first-principles calculations, we elucidate the variability of Na-ion transport vs. Na content in three important NaSICON electrodes, Na$_{\\rm x}$Ti$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, Na$_{\\rm x}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, and Na$_{\\rm x}$Cr$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$. Our study suggests that Na$^+$ transport in NaSICON electrodes is almost entirely determined by the local electrostatic and chemical environment set by the transition metal and the polyanionic scaffold. The competition with the ordering-disordering phenomena of Na-vacancies also plays a role in influencing Na-transport. We link the variations in the Na$^+$ kinetic properties by analyzing the competition of ligand field stabilization transition metal ions and their ionic radii. We interpret the limited Na-extraction at $x = 1$ observed experimentally by gaining insights into the local Na-vacancy interplay. We propose that targeted chemical substitutions of transition metals disrupting local charge arrangements will be critical to reducing the occurrence of strong Na$^+$-vacancy orderings at low Na concentrations, thus, expanding the accessible capacities of these electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "It is a challenge to prepare organic electrodes for sodium-ion batteries with long cycle life and high capacity. The highly reactive radical intermediates generated during the sodiation/desodiation process could be a critical issue because of undesired side reactions. Here we present durable electrodes with a stabilized α-C radical intermediate. Through the resonance effect as well as steric effects, the excessive reactivity of the unpaired electron is successfully suppressed, thus developing an electrode with stable cycling for over 2,000 cycles with 96.8% capacity retention. In addition, the α-radical demonstrates reversible transformation between three states: C=C; α-C·radical; and α-C^− anion. Such transformation provides additional Na^+ storage equal to more than 0.83 Na^+ insertion per α-C radical for the electrodes. The strategy of intermediate radical stabilization could be enlightening in the design of organic electrodes with enhanced cycling life and energy storage capability. Reactive radical intermediates can be a problem leading to fast degradation of organic electrodes in sodium-ion batteries. Here, the authors show a stabilized α-C radical displaying reversible transformations between C=C, α-C radical and α-C anionic states to facilitate long cycling and improved capacity.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides (TMS) have received much attention as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity and excellent redox reversibility. However, their further development is constrained by the dissolution of transition metal ions and substantial volume changes experienced during cycling. Herein, the high-entropy Prussian blue analogues were selenized by the vapor infiltration method, resulting in the formation of a core–shell structured high-entropy selenides (HESe-6). The core–shell structure with voids and abundant selenium vacancies on the surface effectively mitigates bulk expansion and enhances electronic conductivity. Furthermore, the high-entropy property endows an ultra-stable crystal structure and inhibits the dissolution of metal ions. The ex-situ EIS and in-situ XRD results show that HESe-6 is able to be reversibly transformed into highly conductive ultrafine metal particles upon Na+ embedding, providing more Na+ reactive active sites. In addition, despite the incorporation of up to seven different elements, it exhibits minimal phase transitions during discharge/charge cycles, effectively mitigating stress accumulation. HESe-6 could retain an ultralong-term stability of 765.83 mAh g−1 after 1000 loops even at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, when coupled with the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode, it maintains a satisfactory charge energy density of 303 Wh kg−1 after 300 cycles, which shows promising application prospect in the future.",

In this study, a simple and effective strategy is reported to weaken and degrade this process by engineering the intensified surface and near‐surface reactions, which is realized by making use of a sandwich‐type nanoarchitecture composed of graphene as electron channels and few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing. The unique 2D sheet‐shaped hierarchical structure is capable of shortening the ion diffusion length, while the few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing has more accessible surface area and the decreased ion diffusion resistance, evidenced by the smaller energy barriers revealed by the density functional theory calculations. Benefiting from the shortened ion diffusion distance and enhanced electron transfer capability, a high ratio of surface or near‐surface reactions is dominated at a high discharge/charge rate. As such, the composites exhibit the high capacities of 152 and 93 mA h g−1 at 30 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, a high reversible capacity of 684 mA h g−1 and an excellent cycling stability up to 4500 cycles can be delivered. The outstanding performance is attributed to the engineered structure with increased contribution of surface or near‐surface reactions.",

Among them, N-doped FeVO4/Fe2V4O13/HxV2O5 triphase composite nanosheets exhibit enhanced discharge capacities at a high current density and retain a capacity of 115.1 mAh m-2 after 300 cycles. Cyclic voltammetry tests and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests revealed that the reduction/oxidation potential corresponding to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple during cycling was 0.14/0.40 V (vs Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further elucidated the contribution of the Fe3+/Fe2+ valence transition to the capacity of the film electrode, as well as the presence of vanadium in both V5+ and V4+ oxidation states in FF2H-S. During the first cycle, the molar ratios of V5+/V4+ were 2.91, 2.08, and 2.52, respectively. Then, X-ray diffraction tests elucidated the insertion/extraction mechanism of Na+, and FeVO4 had an oversized storage space for Na+. It helped HxV2O5 and Fe2V4O13 to further increase the Na+ transport channels and provided more active sites to facilitate diffusion kinetics (the average DNa+ during the discharge phase was 5.49 × 10-13 cm2 s-1). Moreover, the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on the surface of the triphase nanosheets resulted in the lowest overdischarge and highest Coulombic efficiency under the same conditions. The results demonstrated that multiphase composite films exhibit excellent electrical properties, offering a new perspective for the design of sodium-ion battery electrodes.",

Herein, a novel semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) binder (sodium alginate-g-poly (acrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl acrylate)-boric acid, SA-PAHB) is synthesized by free radical copolymerization grafting and the multiple hydrogen bonding crosslinking (bond energies spanning from − 33.89 to − 45.49 kcal/mol by theoretical calculations), which can effectively mitigate stress in Na+ deintercalation in MoS2 anodes under the synergy of the unique structure of the SIPN, maintaining electrode stability. Simultaneously, the variable hydrogen bonding crosslinking and abundant –NH2 groups greatly facilitate Na+ diffusion and enhance kinetic performance. Leveraging the advantages of SA-PAHB, the electrochemical performance is significantly enhanced compared to traditional SA and grafted SA-based binders. Specifically, MoS2 anodes using SA-PAHB binder exhibit an initial discharge specific capacity of 772.1 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and retain 511.2 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 200 cycles, with no capacity loss.

Herein, a MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 heterojunction uniformly embedded is fabricated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs) as an electrode material for SIBs and KIBs. Cr2 Se3 exhibits spontaneous antiparallel alignment of magnetic moments. Mo2+ doping is employed to regulate the electron spin states of Cr2 Se3 . Moreover, the MoSe2 and Cr2 Se3 heterojunctions induce a lattice mismatch at the heterostructure interface, resulting in spin-polarized states or localized magnetic moments at the interface, potentially contributing to spin-polarized surface capacitance. MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs demonstrate a high capacity of 498 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with good cycling stability (capacity of 405 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1000 cycles). Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations simulate the accumulation of spin-polarized charges at the MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs heterojunction interface, dependent on the surface electron density of the antiferromagnetic Cr2 Se3 and the surface spin polarization near the Fermi level. After regulating the electron spin states through Mo-doping, the band gap of the material decreases.

However, it is still a great challenge to develop suitable electrode materials due to the large radius of Na+. This work demonstrates a strategy to synthesize hierarchical tubular MoS2 via a facial hydrothermal method with the assistance of tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB). The results show that sufficient amounts of TMA+ ions are necessary to form the hierarchical tubular structures of MoS2. The obtained tubular MoS2 displays a high diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions, a high specific capacity of 652.5 mAh/g at the current density of 100 mA/g after 50 cycles, and a good cycling stability (94.2% of the initial capacity can be retained after 100 cycles at 1000 mA/g). In situ XRD during the discharge/charge process displays a reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ into MoS2 layers followed by a conversion-type reaction. Systematic analyses reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to its tubular hierarchical structures with the wall composed of loosely stacked nanosheets, which can provide nearly unobstructed ion transportation paths, sufficient active sites, and enough space to mitigate the effects of the volume change during the discharge/charge process. This synthetic approach can be easily extended to other metal oxides and metal sulfides with hierarchical structures for versatile applications.",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature sodium-ion batteries have attracted increased attention for energy storage due to the natural abundance of sodium. However, it remains a huge challenge to develop versatile electrode materials with favorable properties, which requires smart structure design and good mechanistic understanding. Herein, we reported a general and scalable approach to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) titania-graphene hybrid via electrostatic-interaction-induced self-assembly. Synchrotron X-ray probe, transmission electron microscopy, and computational modeling revealed that the strong interaction between titania and graphene through comparably strong van der Waals forces not only facilitates bulk Na+ intercalation but also enhances the interfacial sodium storage. As a result, the titania-graphene hybrid exhibits exceptional long-term cycle stability up to 5000 cycles, and ultrahigh rate capability up to 20 C for sodium storage. Furthermore, density function theory calculation indicated that the interfacial Li+, K+, Mg2+, and Al3+ storage can be enhanced as well. The proposed general strategy opens up new avenues to create versatile materials for advanced battery systems.",

Herein, we report the first use of highly porous azo-linked polymers (ALPs) as a new redox-active electrode material for rechargeable sodium ion batteries. ALPs are highly cross-linked polymers and therefore eliminate the solubility issue of organic electrodes in common electrolytes, which is prominent in small organic molecules and leads to fast capacity fading. Moreover, the high surface area coupled with the π-conjugated microporous nature of ALPs facilitates electrolyte adsorption in the pores and assists in fast ionic transport and charge transfer rates. An average specific capacity of 170 mA h g-1 at 0.3 C rate was attained while maintaining 96% coulombic efficiency over 150 charge/discharge cycles.",

        "abstract": "Spinel lithium titanate (LTO; Li4Ti5O12) is one of the promising materials for negative electrodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The stable charge-discharge performance of SIB cells using LTO electrodes depends on the reversible Na insertion-extraction mechanism of LTO, where the spinel lattice is expanded with Na insertion, and two phases, Na-inserted LTO (Na-LTO) and Li-inserted LTO (Li-LTO) phases, are generated. These phases are confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the mechanism of the two-phase coexistence with different lattice volumes is yet unclear. Here, we investigate the detailed morphology of the coexisting Na-LTO and Li-LTO phases using in situ XRD measurements and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Na-LTO (a = 8.74 Å) and Li-LTO (a = 8.36 Å) phases are confirmed in both the electrochemically formed Na-inserted LTO electrode and the single-crystalline LTO thin specimen. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface is parallel to the (001) plane, and contains an inevitable lattice mismatch along the interface, while the expansion of the Na-LTO phase can be partially relaxed normal to the interface. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface has interface layers of lattice disordering with a 1-2 nm width, relaxing the lattice mismatch, as opposed to results from the previous scanning TEM observation. How the different lattice volumes at the two-phase interface are relaxed should be the key issue in investigation of the mechanism of Na insertion and extraction in LTO electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides, one kind of electrode material with very high theoretical capacity, have been widely studied for use in lithium and sodium ion batteries. However, there are some problems hindering their applications in electrodes, such as low conductivity and volume expansion. The MOF introduces metals with different coordination strengths into an existing MOF structure, which improves the performance of the electrode to a certain extent. In this paper, Fe/Zn bimetallic MOF rod-like superstructure was prepared based on Ostwald theory. Accompanied by sulfuration, the MOF was effectively combined with MoS2 and GO, and the objective materials Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composites were successfully prepared. The MOF material provides a good frame and an efficient electron transport path, while the robust rGO wall effectively inhibits the pulverization of materials during the lithium/sodium intercalation/escalation courses. This particular material exhibited excellent cycling and rate capability performance when used in Li/Na-ion batteries. When used in Li-batteries, the electrode material delivered a specific capacity of 1598.3 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and remained at 1196.7 mA h g-1 even after about 100 cycles and further exhibited a specific capacity of 368.68 mA h g-1 at the current rate of 5 A g-1 even after 1000 cycles, respectively. As for sodium batteries, these electrode materials exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 1053.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and the reversible capacity was still as high as 592.2 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles. It is perhaps that this composite material with its particular architecture and composition is greatly beneficial for electron transfer and Li/Na ion diffusion. In the repeated physicochemical/nutrifying process, the appropriate distance between adjacent MOFs is of great help in preventing volume changes and thus improving the electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "To achieve both the capacity and stability of metal sulfides simultaneously remains a significant challenge. In this study, we have synthesized the manganese-doped copper sulfide three-dimensional (3D) hollow flower-like sphere (M/CuS-NSC), encapsulated in a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon. The hollow lamellae structure allows the rational self-aggregation process of numerous active surface area enlarged nanosheets, thereby enhancing electrochemical activity. The subsurface framework characterized by CSC bonds enhances the pseudo-capacitive properties. Furthermore, the transformation of sulfur and the isomerization of carbon contribute to the enhancement of sodium ion storage. The incorporation of Mn into CuS lattice increases the interplanar distance, providing additional space for the accommodation of sodium ions. Mn doping facilitates the localization of electrons near the Fermi level, thereby improving conductivity. Additionally, Cu foils coated with M/CuS-NSC-2 engage with the electrolyte and sulfur, initiating the reaction sequence through the formation of Cu9S8. Consequently, M/CuS-NSC-2 exhibits highly reversible capacities of 676.24 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and 511.52 mAh g−1 after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1, with an average attenuation ratio of only 0.009 %.

        "abstract": "The sub‐10 nm metal‐based nanomaterials (SMNs) show great potential for the electrochemical energy storage field. However, their ion storage capacity and stability suffer from severe agglomeration and interface problems. Herein, a universal strategy is reported to synthesize a wide range of SMNs (e.g., metal, nitride, oxide, and sulfides) embedded in free‐standing carbon foam (SMN/FC‐F) composite electrodes by crossing the interfacial confinement of NaCl self‐assembly with the thermal‐mechanical coupling of powder metallurgy. The pressure‐enhanced NaCl self‐assembly interfacial confinement is greatly beneficial to preventing SMN agglomeration and promoting SMNs embedded in FC‐F which originate from the welding of carbon nanosheets. They are confirmed via a series of advanced characterizations including X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and spherical aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, with theoretical computations. Benefiting from the unique structure, SMNs/FC‐F delivers ultrafast and stable ion‐storage kinetics. As a proof‐of‐concept demonstration, the MoS2/FC‐F shows excellent ion storage kinetics and superior long‐term cycling performance for ion storage (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C//MoS2/FC‐F sodium‐ion batteries exhibit a high reversible capacity of 185 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle.).

        "abstract": "As Sodium‐ion battery (SIB) technology progresses toward commercial viability, sustainable end‐of‐life (EOL) management is critical. Methods for recycling key components such as hard carbon (HC), a negative electrode material, remain underexplored. This study introduces a direct and efficient recycling approach for HC from production scrap and EOL cells using “ice‐stripping” followed by a low‐temperature binder negation at 300 °C under nitrogen. The effects of temperature on HC structural integrity and electrochemical performance are comprehensively characterized using XRD, Wide‐Angle X‐ray Scattering (WAXS), and XPS. Heating above 400 °C induces irreversible damage to HC's graphene layers and modifies the carbon surfaces, resulting in poor electrochemical performance. However, HC reclaimed at 300 °C retains near‐pristine electrochemical performance, with capacities of 243 mAh g⁻¹ (scrap) and 228 mAh g⁻¹ (EOL) after 50 cycles. Full‐cell configurations demonstrates robust cycling stability, with 86% and 89% capacity retention after 200 cycles for HC derived from scrap and EOL cells, respectively. This work highlights the potential of lower‐temperature, direct recycling to enable a circular economy for SIBs. The findings set a benchmark for developing sustainable recycling methods for HC and other SIB components.",

The HNCs possess reversible capacities as high as 160 and 142 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 (≈8 C) and 5 A g-1 (≈20 C), respectively, and maintain values of 145 and 123 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles, thus exhibiting excellent rate and long-term cyclic performance. Based on systematic analysis, a new insight into the roles of the different N configurations in Na-ion storage is proposed. The adsorption of Na ions on pyridinic-N (N-6) and pyrrolic-N (N-5) is fully irreversible, whereas the adsorption on graphitic-N (N-Q) is partially reversible and the adsorption on N-oxide (N-O) is fully reversible. More importantly, the N-6/N-Q ratio is an intrinsic parameter that reflects the relationship between the N configurations and carbon textures for N-doped carbons prepared from in situ pyrolysis of organic precursors. The cyclic stability and rate-performance improve with decreasing N-6/N-Q ratio. Therefore, this work is of great significance for the design of N-doped carbon electrodes with high performance for sodium ion batteries.",

In this context, the MoS2/Ti3C2Tx MXene heterostructure is taken as a typical example to reveal the fundamental principle of high sodium storage performance by regulating the terminal groups of Ti3C2Tx. It is demonstrated that MoS2/Ti3C2(OH)x (M/‐(OH)x) heterostructure with a high work function difference generates an enhanced built‐in electric field, which facilitates charge transfer. Moreover, ether‐based electrolytes, when compared to ester‐based electrolytes, provide lower solvation‐free energies and exhibit high compatibility with M/‐(OH)x, resulting in superior rate capability. Notably, COMSOL simulations of sodium ion (Na+) concentration and Na+ flux distributions reveal that the M/‐(OH)x electrode has low concentration polarization and rapid diffusion kinetics in ether‐based electrolytes. Consequently, the combination of M/‐(OH)x heterostructure with the ether‐based electrolyte provides 224.06 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1. Furthermore, the Na3V2(PO4)3/C//M/‐(OH)x full cell demonstrates robust electrochemical performance, delivering 116.49 mAh g−1 after 140 cycles at 1.0 A g−1.

One major challenge in SIBs is that the solubility of SEI species in liquid electrolytes is comparatively higher than the corresponding species formed in Li‐ion batteries. This study sheds new light on the associated capacity losses due to initial SEI formation, SEI dissolution and subsequent SEI reformation, charge leakage via SEI and subsequent SEI growth, and diffusion‐controlled sodium trapping in electrode particles. By using a variety of electrochemical cycling protocols, synchrotron‐based X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC‐MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H‐NMR) spectroscopy, capacity losses due to changes in the SEI layer during different open circuit pause times are investigated in nine different electrolyte solutions. It is shown that the amount of capacity lost depends on the interplay between the electrolyte chemistry and the thickness and stability of the SEI layer. The highest capacity loss is measured in NaPF6 in ethylene carboante mixed with diethylene carbonate electrolyte (i.e., 5 µAh h−1/2pause or 2.78 mAh g·h−1/2pause) while the lowest value is found in NaTFSI in ethylene carbonate mixed with dimethoxyethance electrolyte (i.e., 1.3 µAh h−1/2pause or 0.72 mAh g·h−1/2pause).",

The as-assembled solid-state battery revealed a storage capacity of 74 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C with a specific energy density of 130 Wh kgcathode_active_material-1 and demonstrated an impressive capacity retention of 84% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles. The structure and morphology retention of the cycled electrode and electrolyte through postmortem analysis bolster the electrochemo-mechanical stability of the developed solid cell. The findings reported here on polymer electrolytes persuade expedient solutions for developing ambient temperature solid-state sodium-ion batteries with promising electrochemical performance for commercialization in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues are considered as promising candidates for aqueous sodium-ion batteries providing a decently high energy density for stationary energy storage. However, suppose the operation of such materials under high-power conditions could be facilitated. In that case, their application might involve fast-response power grid stabilization and enable short-distance urban mobility due to fast re-charging. In this work, sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate thin-film electrodes are synthesized via a facile electrochemical deposition approach to form a model system for a robust investigation. Their fast-charging capability is systematically elaborated with regard to the electroactive material thickness in comparison to a ″traditional″ composite-type electrode. It is found that quasi-equilibrium kinetics allow extremely fast (dis)charging within a few seconds for sub-micron film thicknesses. Specifically, for a thickness below ≈ 500 nm, 90% of the capacity can be retained at a rate of 60C (1 min for full (dis)charge). A transition toward mass transport control is observed when further increasing the rate, with thicker films being dominated by this mode earlier than thinner films. This can be entirely attributed to the limiting effects of solid-state diffusion of Na+ within the electrode material. By presenting a PBA model cell yielding 25 Wh kg-1 at up to 10 kW kg-1, this work highlights a possible pathway toward the guided design of hybrid battery-supercapacitor systems. Furthermore, open challenges associated with thin-film electrodes are discussed, such as the role of parasitic side reactions, as well as increasing the mass loading.",

        "abstract": "P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (PNNMO) has been extensively studied because of its desirable electrochemical properties as a positive electrode for sodium-ion batteries. PNNMO exhibits intralayer transition-metal ordering of Ni and Mn and intralayer Na+/vacancy ordering. The Na+/vacancy ordering is often considered a major impediment to fast Na+ transport and can be affected by transition-metal ordering. We show by neutron/X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations that Li doping (Na2/3Li0.05Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, LFN5) promotes ABC-type interplanar Ni/Mn ordering without disrupting the Na+/vacancy ordering and creates low-energy Li–Mn-coordinated diffusion pathways. A structure model is developed to quantitatively identify both the intralayer cation mixing and interlayer cationic stacking fault densities. Quasielastic neutron scattering reveals that the Na+ diffusivity in LFN5 is enhanced by an order of magnitude over PNNMO, increasing its capacity at a high current. Na2/3Ni1/4Mn3/4O2 (NM13) lacks Na+/vacancy ordering but has diffusivity comparable to that of LFN5. However, NM13 has the smallest capacity at a high current. The high site energy of Mn–Mn-coordinated Na compared to that of Ni–Mn and higher density of Mn–Mn-coordinated Na+ sites in NM13 disrupts the connectivity of low-energy Ni–Mn-coordinated diffusion pathways. These results suggest that the interlayer ordering can be tuned through the control of composition, which has an equal or greater impact on Na+ diffusion than the Na+/vacancy ordering.",

        "abstract": "3D composite electrodes have shown extraordinary promise as high mass loading electrode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, they usually show poor rate performance due to the sluggish Na+ kinetics at the heterointerfaces of the composites. Here, a 3D MXene-reduced holey graphene oxide (MXene-RHGO) composite electrode with Ti─O─C bonding at 2D heterointerfaces of MXene and RHGO is developed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the built-in electric fields (BIEFs) are enhanced by the formation of bridged interfacial Ti─O─C bonding, that lead to not only faster diffusion of Na+ at the heterointerfaces but also faster adsorption and migration of Na+ on the MXene surfaces. As a result, the 3D composite electrodes show impressive properties for fast Na+ storage. Under high current density of 10 mA cm-2, the 3D MXene-RHGO composite electrodes with high mass loading of 10 mg cm-2 achieve a strikingly high and stable areal capacity of 3 mAh cm-2, which is same as commercial LIBs and greatly exceeds that of most reported SIBs electrode materials.

        "abstract": "The interest in post-lithium batteries as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries boosted recently due to their substantial abundance, low cost, inherent safety, and sustainability. In recent years, the crucial need for the improvement of battery safety has been emphasized and safety remains a critical barrier for post-lithium technology. Therefore, the thermal stability and reaction enthalpies of electrochemically de-sodiated sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3/C) positive electrode and commercial coconut-shell derived hard carbon (HC) at various states of charge (SOCs) were systematically investigated. This study employed the 3D Tian-Calvet calorimeter (C80) and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA-MS), to gain comprehensive insights into the thermodynamic aspects of these materials. Thermal stability of electrode materials at distinct sodiation / de-sodiation states draws great attention in cell design and is one of the reasons for the strong state of charge (SOC) dependence of the thermal runaway phenomenon, which represents the most critical safety issue for batteries. This combined experimental approach provides a comprehensive understanding of thermal stability and associated reactions in both, sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP) and hard carbon (HC) electrodes. NVP/C reacts with the electrolyte between 150 and 300 °C, releasing ∼400 J/g heat, although it thermally decomposed beyond 150 °C. The sodiated HC initiates decomposition at 100 °C, releasing ∼750 J/g heat in two steps in a reaction to the electrolyte. These data can facilitate optimizing the design of thermal management systems according to the cell's thermal performance.",

For Na│Na symmetric cells as well as for Na│Graphite cells, we find that NaOTf and NaPF6 are the preferred salts followed by NaClO4 and NaFSI, as the latter two lead to more side reactions and increasing impedance. NaTFSI shows the worst performance leading to poor Coulombic efficiency and cycle life. In this case, excessive side reactions lead also to a strong increase in electrode thickness during cycling. In a qualitative order, the suitability of the conductive salts can be ranked as follows: NaOTf≥NaPF6>NaClO4>NaFSI>>NaTFSI. Our results also explain two recent, seemingly conflicting findings on the degree of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on graphite electrodes in sodium-ion batteries (DOI: 10.1021/acsami.6b16536 and 10.1002/aenm.201702724). The contradictory findings are due to the different conductive salts used in both studies.",

        "abstract": "A sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI)-based multifunctional electrolyte is developed by partially replacing NaPF6 salt in the electrolyte to improve the wide temperature range working capability of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2/hard carbon (NNFM111/HC) sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity retention of the SIBs with NaFSI-NaPF6 dual salt electrolyte increases from 47.2% to 75.5% after 250 cycles at 25 oC, and from 51.0% to 82.3% after 80 cycles at 45 oC, and the 1 C discharge capacity retention at the low temperature of -20 oC also increases 26.8%. In the single salt system, NaPF6 effectively passivate the aluminum foil and NaFSI passivate the electrode/electrolyte interface. The synergistic effect of NaPF6 and NaFSI greatly improves the battery performance in a wide temperature range. This NaFSI-based dual salt electrolyte also effectively overcomes the flaws when the SIBs using NaFSI or NaPF6 independently, and makes it more suitable for SIBs, indicating promising prospects in the commercial application of NNFM111/HC SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Framework structured tungsten bronzes serve as promising candidates for electrode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the tungsten bronze framework structure changes drastically as mediated by the sodium ion concentration at high temperatures. While the three-dimensional ion channels facilitate fast ion storage and transport capabilities, the structural instability induced by Na+ migration is a big concern regarding the battery performance and safety, which unfortunately remains elusive. Here, we show the real-time experimental evidence of the phase transitions in framework structured Na0.36WO3.14 (triclinic phase) by applying different external voltages. The Na+-rich (Na0.48WO3, tetragonal phase) or -deficient (NaxWO3, x < 0.36, hexagonal phase) phase nucleates under the positive or negative bias, respectively. Combined with the theoretical calculations, the atomistic phase transition mechanisms associated with the Na+ migration are directly uncovered. Our work sheds light on the phase instability in sodium tungsten bronzes and paves the way for designing advanced SIBs with high-stability.",

        "abstract": "New‐fashioned electrode hosts for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are elaborately engineered to involve multifunctional active components that can synergistically conquer the critical issues of severe volume deformation and sluggish reaction kinetics of electrodes toward immensely enhanced battery performance. Herein, it is first reported that single‐phase CoPS, a new metal phosphosulfide for SIBs, in the form of quantum dots, is successfully introduced into a leaf‐shaped conductive carbon nanosheet, which can be further in situ anchored on a 3D interconnected branch‐like N‐doped carbon nanofiber (N‐CNF) to construct a hierarchical branch‐leaf‐shaped CoPS@C@N‐CNF architecture. Both double carbon decorations and ultrafine crystal of the CoPS in‐this exquisite architecture hold many significant superiorities, such as favorable train‐relaxation, fast interfacial ion‐migration, multi‐directional migration pathways, and sufficiently exposed Na+‐storage sites. In consequence, the CoPS@C@N‐CNF affords remarkable long‐cycle durability over 10 000 cycles at 20.0 A g−1 and superior rate capability. Meanwhile, the CoPS@C@N‐CNF‐based sodium‐ion full cell renders the potential proof‐of‐feasibility for practical applications in consideration of its high durability over a long‐term cyclic lifespan with remarkable reversible capacity. Moreover, the phase transformation mechanism of the CoPS@C@N‐CNF and fundamental springhead of the enhanced performance are disclosed by in situ X‐ray diffraction, ex situ high‐resolution TEM, and theoretical calculations.",

Here, copper sulfide is suggested as a superior electrode material with high capacity, high rate, and long‐term cyclability owing to its unique conversion reaction mechanism that is pulverization‐tolerant and thus induces the capacity recovery. Such a desirable consequence comes from the combined effect among formation of stable grain boundaries, semi‐coherent boundaries, and solid‐electrolyte interphase layers. The characteristics enable high cyclic stability of a copper sulfide electrode without any need of size and morphological optimization.

However, their poor conductivity limits the rate performance and cycle stability of batteries.

This unique structure as well as the narrow-bandgap semiconductor property of SnSe simultaneously meets the requirements of achieving fast ionic and electronic conductivities for alkali-ion batteries. They exhibit high capacity of 463.6 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 for Na-ion batteries and 787.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 for Li-ion batteries over 300 cycles, and also high stability for alkali-ion batteries.",

Here we report a sodium super-ionic conductor structured electrode, sodium vanadium titanium phosphate, which delivers a high specific capacity of 147 mA h g^−1 at a rate of 0.1 C and excellent capacity retentions at high rates. A symmetric sodium-ion full cell demonstrates a superior rate capability with a specific capacity of about 49 mA h g^−1 at 20 C rate and ultralong lifetime over 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, in situ synchrotron diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement are carried out to unravel the underlying sodium storage mechanism and charge compensation behaviour.

        "abstract": "Tin disulfide (SnS2 ) shows promising properties toward sodium ion storage with high capacity, but its cycle life and high rate capability are still undermined as a result of poor reaction kinetics and unstable structure. In this work, phosphate ion (PO4 3- )-doped SnS2 (P-SnS2 ) nanoflake arrays on conductive TiC/C backbone are reported to form high-quality P-SnS2 @TiC/C arrays via a hydrothermal-chemical vapor deposition method. By virtue of the synergistic effect between PO4 3- doping and conductive network of TiC/C arrays, enhanced electronic conductivity and enlarged interlayer spacing are realized in the designed P-SnS2 @TiC/C arrays. Moreover, the introduced PO4 3- can result in favorable intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ and accelerate electrochemical reaction kinetics. Notably, lower bandgap and enhanced electronic conductivity owing to the introduction of PO4 3- are demonstrated by density function theory calculations and UV-visible absorption spectra. In view of these positive factors above, the P-SnS2 @TiC/C electrode delivers a high capacity of 1293.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and exhibits good rate capability (476.7 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 ), much better than the SnS2 @TiC/C counterpart.

        "abstract": "Tailoring materials into different structures offers unprecedented opportunities in the realization of their functional properties. Particularly, controllable design of diverse structured electrode materials is regarded as a crucial step towards fabricating high-performance batteries. Herein, a general biochemistry-directed strategy has been developed to fabricate functional materials with controllable architectures and superior performance. The natural structure of fern (i.e. Cibotium) spores realizes the formation of a three-dimensional hexahedral bio-precursor. Either its core or shell is targeted to be destroyed, resulting in different architectures, from a 3D hollow hexahedron to a 2D hierarchical nanosheet, of the final product. As a case study, sodium vanadium pyrophosphate (i.e. Na7V3(P2O7)4) is employed as the electrochemically active material in this study. The crucial role of controllable damage in the construction of diverse architectures is discussed. Moreover, the relationship between different outside architectures, internal microstructures and the sodium intercalation capabilities of the bio-composites is clarified. Among all the samples, the 2D nanosheet with hierarchical structures has the smallest particle size and the highest surface area, which are favourable for its fast sodium intercalation. As a result, it is capable of high-rate long-term cycling, which achieves a high cycling efficiency of 93% after 500 cycles at 20C. However, a 3D hollow hexahedron has a thick shell and inferior surface characteristics, which greatly limits its sodium transport kinetics and leads to inferior performance. Therefore, the present work not only highlights a general, green and energy-efficient biochemistry-enabled strategy to prepare high-performance electrode materials, but also provides clues to controllably design diverse architectures for functional materials.",

Chains of \"diamond-like\" clusters of molybdenum were evidenced in the [MoO2] layers resulting from the Peierls distortion expected in a two-dimensional triangular lattice formed by transition metal atoms with a d3 electronic configuration. Molybdenum-molybdenum distances as short as 2.58 Å were found in these clusters. The magnetic moment recorded at low temperatures and at room temperature showed that NaMoO2 presents a very low magnetic susceptibility compatible with the localization of the 4d electrons in the Mo-Mo bonds. This localization was confirmed by DFT calculation that showed the NaMoO2 was diamagnetic at 0 K. A sodium battery was built using NaMoO2 as the positive electrode material, and we found that sodium ions can be reversibly deintercalated and intercalated in NaMoO2, indicating that this compound is one of the many phases existing in the NaxMoO2 system.",

Taking advantage of the activity of both Ni and Mn, herein, the P2‐type and Mn‐rich Na0.6Ni0.22Al0.11Mn0.66O2 (NAM) material, known to be an excellent positive electrode, is investigated as a negative electrode. To prove NAM stability as both positive and negative electrode, symmetric cells have been assembled without pre‐sodiation, which showed a reversible capacity of 73 mA h g−1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 82.6 % after 500 cycles. The outstanding cycling performance is ascribed to the high stability of the active material at both the highest and lowest Na‐ion storage plateaus and the rather limited electrolyte decomposition and solid‐electrolyte‐interphase (SEI) formation occurring. The long‐term stability of NAM at both electrodes enables its use as a “reference” electrode for the investigation of other positive and negative electrode materials for SIBs, resembling the role played by lithium titanate (LTO) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) in LIBs.",

In this study, we report the designed synthesis of a multifunctional two-dimensional covalent organic framework featuring hexaazatrinaphthalene cores linked by imidazole moieties and demonstrate its effective performance in sodium ion storage. Benzimidazole-linked covalent organic framework (BCOF-1) was synthesized by a condensation reaction between hexaazatrinaphthalenehexamine (HATNHA) and terephthalaldehyde (TA) and exhibited a high theoretical specific capacity of 392 mA h g–1. BCOF-1 crystallizes, forming eclipsed AA stacking and mesoporous hexagonal one-dimensional channels with high surface area (840 m2 g–1), facilitating fast ionic mobility and charge transfer and enabling high-rate capability at high current rates. BCOF-1 exhibits pseudocapacitive-like behavior with a high specific capacity of 387 mA h g–1, an energy density of 302 W h kg–1 at 0.1 C, and a power density of 682 W kg–1 at 5 C. Our results demonstrate that redox-active COFs have the desired structural and electronic merits to advance the use of organic electrodes in sodium-ion storage toward sustainable and efficient batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-metal batteries (SMBs) using solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show impressive superiority in energy density and safety. As promising candidates for SPEs, solid-state plastic crystal electrolytes (SPCE) based on succinonitrile (SN) plastic crystal could achieve high ion conductivity and wide voltage window. Nonetheless, the notorious SN decomposition reaction on the electrode/electrolyte interface seriously challenges the stable operation of the battery. To address this drawback, we commence with the structural engineering of the polymer chain segments in SPCE and employ intermolecular interactions to optimize the composition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of polymer network design in optimizing the migration behavior of sodium ions in SPCE. The assembled sodium symmetric cells display a high critical current density of up to 2.7 mA cm-2 and stable cycling performance for 700 hours at 0.5 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the Na/SPCE-9/Na3V2(PO4)3 maintains a discharge specific capacity of up to 76.8 mAh g-1 at 10 C and shows impressive long-cycle stability, retaining 86.2 % of initial capacity over 5000 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.9 %. Our work presents a high-performance SPCE with intrinsic safety, providing valuable insights for the future design of solid-state SMBs.",

This strategy involves the homogeneous coating of ZIF-67 polyhedrons onto porous CNT microspheres prepared by spray pyrolysis and further selenization of the composites under an Ar/H2 atmosphere. During the selenization process, the ZIF-67 polyhedrons on the CNT backbone are transformed into N-doped carbon-coated CoSe2 nanorods by a directional recrystallization process, resulting in a homogeneous deposition of CoSe2@NC nanorods on the porous CNT microspheres. Such a unique structure of CoSe2@NC-NR/CNT microspheres facilitates the transport of ions, electrons, and mass and provides a conductive pathway for electrons during electrochemical reactions. Correspondingly, the composite exhibits a superior dual functionality as both an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an electrode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The CoSe2@NC-NR/CNT microspheres exhibit a small Tafel slope (49.8 mV dec-1) and a superior stability for HER. Furthermore, the composite delivers a high discharge capacity of 555 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 and a good rate capability for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Conversion and alloying type negative electrodes attracted huge attention in the present research on lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to the high capacity delivered. Among these, SnO2 is investigated intensively in LIBs due to high cyclability, low reaction potential, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Most of the LIB electrodes are explored in SIBs too due to expected similar electrochemical performance. Though several LIB negative electrode materials successfully worked in SIBs, bare SnO2 shows very poor electrochemical performance in SIB. The reason for this difference is investigated here through combined in operando and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). For this, the electrodes of SnO2 (space group P42/mnm synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal method) were cycled in Na-ion and Li-ion half-cells. The Na/SnO2 half-cell delivered a much lower discharge capacity than the Li/SnO2 half-cell. In addition, higher irreversibility was observed for Na/SnO2 half-cell during electrochemical investigations compared to that for Li/SnO2 half-cell. In operando XAS investigations on the Na/SnO2 half-cell confirms incomplete conversion and alloying reactions in the Na/SnO2 half-cell, resulting in poor electrochemical performance. The difference in the lithiation and sodiation mechanisms of SnO2 is discussed in detail.",

Here, MoSe2 nanosheets perpendicularly anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are studied as an electrode for SIBs and PIBs. Not only does the graphene network serves as a nucleation substrate for suppressing the agglomeration of MoSe2 nanosheets to eliminate the electrode fracture but also facilitates the electrochemical kinetics process and provides a buffer zone to tolerate the large strain. An expanded interplanar spacing of 7.9 Å is conducive to fast alkaline ion diffusion, and the formed chemical bondings (C-Mo and C-O-Mo) promote the structure integrity and the charge transfer kinetics. Consequently, MoSe2@5%rGO exhibits a reversible specific capacity of 458.3 mAh·g-1 at 100 mA·g-1, great cyclability with a retention of 383.6 mAh·g-1 over 50 cycles, and excellent rate capability (251.3 mAh·g-1 at 5 A·g-1) for SIBs. For PIBs, a high first specific capacity of 365.5 mAh·g-1 at 100 mA·g-1 with a low capacity fading of 51.5 mAh·g-1 upon 50 cycles and satisfactory rate property are acquired for MoSe2@10%rGO composite. Ex situ measurements validate that the discharge products are Na2Se for SIBs and K5Se3 for PIBs, and robust chemical bonds boost the structure stability for Na- and K-ion storage. The full batteries are successfully fabricated to verify the practical feasibility of MoSe2@5%rGO composite.",

However, their practical viability is hindered by challenges such as a low specific capacity of the organic electrode materials, or their dissolution in the electrolyte. We herein present a double mitigation strategy to enhance the performance of pillar[5]quinone (P5Q) as positive electrode in sodium batteries. Using 5 M sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in succinonitrile as highly concentrated electrolyte, and encapsulating P5Q in CMK‐3 (Carbon Mesostructured by KAIST with hexagonally ordered rod‐like carbon domains) as templated ordered mesoporous carbon, we achieve a record cycling performance with improved cycling stability even at elevated temperature (40 °C). The P5Q@CMK‐3 composite electrode delivers 430 mAh g−1 specific discharge capacity at 0.2C rate with 90% retention over 200 cycles. This corresponds to an energy density of 831 Wh kg−1 (based on P5Q mass) and surpasses previous reports on pillarquinones. When operated at 40 °C, the P5Q@CMK‐3 composite electrodes deliver a specific discharge capacity of 438 mAh g−1 with 88% capacity retention over 500 cycles (0.02% per cycle).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have become increasingly important as next-generation energy storage systems for application in large-scale energy storage. It is very crucial to develop an eco-friendly and green SIB technique with superior performance for sustainable future use. Replacing the conventional inorganic electrode materials with green and safe organic electrodes will be a promising approach. However, the poor electrochemical kinetics, unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, high solubility of the electrodes in the electrolyte, and large amount of conductive carbon present great challenges for organic SIBs. In this study, the issues of organic electrodes are addressed through atomic-level manipulation of these organic molecules using a series of ultrathin (Å-level) metal oxide coatings (Al2 O3 , ZnO, and TiO2 ). Uniform and precise coatings on the perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylicacid dianhydride by gas-phase atomic layer deposition technique shows a stable interphase, enhanced electrochemical kinetics (71C, 10 A g-1 ), and excellent stability (89%-500 cycles) compared to conventional organic electrode (70%-200 cycles). Further studies reveal that the chemical stability of the metal oxide coating layer plays a critical role in influencing the redox behavior, and improving kinetics of organic electrodes. This study opens a new avenue for developing high-energy organic SIBs with performance equivalent to inorganic counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) need to address inherent limitations such as low energy densities and poor cycle stability. In the paper, a novel yet safe electrochemical method has been employed to insert Ni2+ in pre-prepared films, culminating in the synthesis of Ca-doped β-NiV3O8. The high covalency of the Ni–O bond was expected to enhance the migration rate of Na+, and in turn exhibit a higher ionic conductivity. Various doping amounts of Ca2+ were applied to investigate the differences in the kinetic behavior of β-NiV3O8 film electrodes.

        "abstract": "The effective flow of electrons through bulk electrodes is crucial for achieving high-performance batteries, although the poor conductivity of homocyclic sulfur molecules results in high barriers against the passage of electrons through electrode structures. This phenomenon causes incomplete reactions and the formation of metastable products. To enhance the performance of the electrode, it is important to place substitutable electrification units to accelerate the cleavage of sulfur molecules and increase the selectivity of stable products during charging and discharging. Herein, we develop a single-atom-charging strategy to address the electron transport issues in bulk sulfur electrodes. The establishment of the synergistic interaction between the adsorption model and electronic transfer helps us achieve a high level of selectivity towards the desirable short-chain sodium polysulfides during the practical battery test. These finding indicates that the atomic manganese sites have an enhanced ability to capture and donate electrons. Additionally, the charge transfer process facilitates the rearrangement of sodium ions, thereby accelerating the kinetics of the sodium ions through the electrostatic force. These combined effects improve pathway selectivity and conversion to stable products during the redox process, leading to superior electrochemical performance for room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. Efficient charge transfer in sulfur electrodes is a crucial challenge for sodium-sulfur batteries. Here, the authors developed a machine-learning-assisted approach to quickly identify effective single-atom catalysts that enhance selectivity for short-chain sodium polysulfides, leading to improved battery performance.",

        "abstract": "The authors here report a binder-free electrode based on tin nanoarrays deposited on copper substrate. It is found that the locally formed electrochemically inactive tin-copper alloys work as a glue that bridges tin and copper to survive harsh cycling conditions in sodium ion batteries. The need for high-energy batteries has driven the development of binder-free electrode architectures. However, the weak bonding between the electrode particles and the current collector cannot withstand the severe volume change of active materials upon battery cycling, which largely limit the large-scale application of such electrodes. Using tin nanoarrays electrochemically deposited on copper substrate as an example, here we demonstrate a strategy of strengthening the connection between electrode and current collector by thermally alloying tin and copper at their interface. The locally formed tin-copper alloys are electron-conductive and meanwhile electrochemically inactive, working as an ideal “glue” robustly bridging tin and copper to survive harsh cycling conditions in sodium ion batteries. The working mechanism of the alloy “glue” is further characterized through a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, atomic structural analysis and in situ X-ray diffraction, presenting itself as a promising strategy for engineering binder-free electrode with endurable performance.",

Herein, we design and create Co vacancies at the interface of atomically thin CoSe 2 /graphene heterostructure and obtain Co 1-x Se 2 /graphene heterostructure electrode materials that facilitate significant Na + intercalation pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the Na + adsorption energy is dramatically increased, and the Na + diffusion barrier is remarkably reduced due to the introduction of Co vacancy. The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6 mAh g -1 at 0.1 C, excellent rate capability of 576.5 mAh g -1 at 2.0 C and ultra-long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na + storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies. This work suggests that the creation of cation vacancy could bestow heterostructured electrode materials with pseudocapacitive Na + intercalation for high-capacity and high-rate energy storage.",

Herein, an accessible and economical spin-coating method is proposed to in-situ fabricate Na3V2(PO4)3 film with different thicknesses on graphite discs, whose electrochemical performances are investigated in sodium-ion batteries. The results show that a specific capacity of 167 mA h g−1 at 1 C is obtained in the thinner electrode thanks to the contribution of the graphite substrate. It is also found that the specific capacity of the electrode decreases as the film becomes thicker while the cycling stability and electrochemical kinetics are significantly improved. The capacity retention of 93.8 % is achieved in the thicker electrode after 5000 cycles at 10 C. This work presents a novel idea for designing and building high-performance, economical, and environmentally friendly energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Niobium oxides have fascinated numerous interests for ultrafast sodium‐ion batteries due to their impressive stability, fast pseudocapacitive kinetics, and high safety features. However, the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity and unrevealed mechanisms largely limit their further applications. Here, inspired by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the introduction of conductor heterostructure (Nb2O5/NbSe2) can largely decrease the bulk phase inserted energy of Na+ from 9.88 to −3.54 eV, as well as promote the delocalization of electron, greatly improving the electrical conductivity of Nb2O5. As expected, the as‐obtained orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (T‐Nb2O5‐x‐NbSe2@C) delivers a high conductivity of 3.69 S cm−1, exhibiting a great improvement of four orders magnitude than that of the parent Nb2O5 (1.87 × 10−4 S cm−1). Impressively, T‐Nb2O5‐x‐NbSe2@C possesses a high reversible capacity of 249 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, as well as excellent rate performance of 63 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1, nearly twins the capacity of parent porous Nb2O5. Furthermore, the periodic evolutions of the main peaks for targeted electrodes during repeated charging/discharging processes have been further revealed by in situ XRD, demonstrating a highly reversible inserted/extracted storage mechanism of Na+.

        "abstract": "A sodium-ion battery (SIB) solution is attractive for grid-scale electrical energy storage. Low-cost hexacyanometalate is a promising electrode material for SIBs because of its easy synthesis and open framework. Most hexacyanometalate-based SIBs work with aqueous electrolyte, and interstitial water in the material has been found to strongly affect the electrochemical profile, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here we provide a comparative study of the transition-metal redox in hexacyanometalate electrodes with and without interstitial water based on soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. We found distinct transition-metal redox sequences in hydrated and anhydrated NaxMnFe(CN)6·zH2O. The Fe and Mn redox in hydrated electrodes are separated and are at different potentials, leading to two voltage plateaus. On the contrary, mixed Fe and Mn redox in the same potential range is found in the anhydrated system. This work reveals for the first time how transition-metal redox in batteries is strongly affected by interstitial molecules that are seemingly spectators. The results suggest a fundamental mechanism based on three competing factors that determine the transition-metal redox potentials. Because most hexacyanometalate electrodes contain water, this work directly reveals the mechanism of how interstitial molecules could define the electrochemical profile, especially for electrodes based on transition-metal redox with well-defined spin states.",

        "abstract": "2D layered Sn-based materials have attracted enormous attention due to their remarkable performance in sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, this promising candidate involves a complex Na+ -storage process with multistep conversion-alloying reactions, which induces the uneven dispersion of heterogeneous intermediate accompanied by severe agglomeration of metallic Sn0 , inescapably resulting in poor reaction reversibility with sluggish rate capability and inferior cyclic lifespan. Herein, a delicately layered heterostructure SnSSe/C consisting of defect-rich SnSSe and graphene is designed and successfully achieved via a facile hydrothermal process. The equal anionic substitution of Se in SnSSe crystal can trigger numerous defects, which can not only facilitate Na+ diffusion but also accelerate the nucleation process by inducing quantum-dot-level uniform distribution of heterogeneous intermediates, Na2 Se/Na2 S and Sn0 . Concurrently, in situ formed uniform Na2 Se/Na2 S grain boundaries confined by this unique layered heterostructure may effectively suppress the agglomeration of metallic Sn0 nanograins and boost the reversibility of conversion-alloying reaction. As a result, the SnSSe/C displays significant improvement in Na-storage performance, in terms of remarkable rate capability and ultralong cycling lifespan. This work, focusing on controlling intermediate distribution, provides an effective strategy to boost reaction reversibility, which can be wildly employed in conversion-based electrodes for energy storage regions.",

        "abstract": "The design of synthetic Alluaudite cathode materials has attracted much interest. However, their poor electrochemical activity and the limited kinetics have prevented them from practical applications, both stationary and mobile. Therefore, we provide in this work, a comprehensive study on the effect of combining 3d multivalent elements (Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe2+) and small particle sizes on structural, electrical and electrochemical properties of a series of Na2NixMn2−xFe(PO4)3 Alluaudite phases using a plethora of techniques. We systematically investigated the impact of the crystal structure, morphology and the density of the samples on Na-ion transport and the associated activation energies. Electrochemical performances of the prepared phases were investigated as positive electrode on a Na-ion battery by means of galvanostatic charge/discharge technique. An enhanced electrochemical performance was obtained by improving the composition of the slurry and the optimization of the electrolyte formulation, thus, affecting the electrochemical performances and cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "The small energy density and chemomechanical degradation of layered manganese oxide limit practical application to sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Typically, Na2Mn3O7 shows a low redox plateau at 2.1 V versus Na/Na+, and the oxygen redox reaction at a high voltage causes structural collapse. Herein, a Na vacancy-induced boron doping strategy is demonstrated to improve the properties. Boron is incorporated into selective sites in the lattice in the center of the MnO6 octahedral ring at the O-layer. Bonding of boron in the TM layer enhances the electrochemical activity of low-valence Mn, giving rise to two reversible redox peaks at 2.45 and 2.55 V to enhance the average redox voltage. At the same time, the O 2p chemical state becomes weaker around the Fermi level, thus suppressing oxygen overoxidation for the high charge state and strengthening the layered structure during the redox reactions. The reduced Mn-O covalency and small diffusion barrier energy stemming from bonding of boron in the oxygen layer produce excellent rate characteristics. Modulation of the Mn 3d and O 2p orbital in Na2Mn3O7 by Na vacancies leads to selective doping of boron at different sites, and our results reveal that it is an important strategy for studying transition-metal-oxide-layered electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium‐ion batteries (ASIBs) have recently emerged as a compelling choice for large‐scale energy storage when considering their safe operational characteristics and cost‐effectiveness. Nonetheless, the inadequate electrochemical stability window (ESW) of water (1.23 V) and severe dissolution of electrodes in aqueous electrolytes have proven bottlenecks to enabling high energy density and long lifespan of ASIBs. Here, a molecular crowding electrolyte is introduced, featuring nonflammable polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PED) as a crowding agent and a hydrogen bond receptor to further diminish the water activity. The 4.5 m (mol kg−1) NaClO4‐4 wt% H2O‐96 wt% PED electrolyte displayed an impressive ESW of 3.4 V, all while maintaining a moderate salt concentration of 4.5 m. Meanwhile, this electrolyte demonstrated substantial mitigation of vanadium dissolution in Na3V2(PO4)3. Consequently, in a comprehensive evaluation, the aqueous NaTi2(PO4)3||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell exhibited an energy density of 47 Wh kg−1 at 1 C with a 74% retention after 100 cycles, and displayed negligible capacity decay (≈0.014% per cycle) at 5 C in 1000 cycles with high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. This work offers a universal strategy for the design of aqueous electrolytes with wide ESW and the ability to effectively suppress vanadium dissolution.",

        "abstract": "Harnessing anionic redox reactions is of prime importance for boosting the capacity of sodium-ion batteries. However, quantifying the cyclability of anionic redox reactions is still challenging. Herein, we conduct a qualitative and quantitative investigation of the cationic and anionic redox reactions of a prototype Na-rich layered oxide, namely Na3RuO4, by a combination of bulk-sensitive X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and full-range mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS). We unequivocally reveal that both Ru cations and oxygen anions are involved in the charge compensation process of Na3RuO4. The Ru redox is highly reversible over extended electrochemical cycles; while the cyclability of lattice oxygen redox gradually decreases with the retention of only 36% after 30 cycles, which is mainly responsible for the capacity fading of Na3RuO4. Our findings provide deeper insights into the complex oxygen redox mechanism, which plays a decisive role for designing high-energy Na-rich electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium layered P2-stacking Na 0.67 MnO 2 materials have shown great promise for sodium-ion batteries for their high specific capacity and the abundance of both Na and Mn elements. However, the undesired Jahn-Teller effect of Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ redox couple and multiple biphasic structure transitions during repeated charge/discharge processes of the materials lead to anisotropic structure expansion, cracks, amorphization and rapid capacity decay. Here, by introducing another earth abundant Al element into the transition metal TM layers to decrease the number of Mn 3+ Jahn-Teller centers, we obtain pure P2-type Na 0.67 Al x Mn 1-x O 2 (x=0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) materials by the sol-gel method. We then systematically investigate the Al-doping effect on the long/short range structural evolutions and electrochemical performances by combining in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and solid-state 23 Na nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Our results reveal that Al-doping alleviates the phase transformations thus giving rise to better electrochemical reversibility and cycling life. More importantly, the stronger Al 3+ -O bonds contribute to a larger spacing of the Na + layers, which promotes the Na + transport and improves the rate capability. As a result, a remarkable rate capability of 96 mAh g -1 at the current density of 1200 mA g -1 within 2.0-4.0 V, long cycling stability and high specific capacity of 175 mAh g -1 at 24 mA g -1 are demonstrated in the Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 electrode.",

A solid solution of S/Se in FeS2- xSe x allows it to combine the high capacity of FeS2 and the good diffusion kinetics of FeSe2 together, thereby exhibiting excellent cycle stability (∼220 mA h g-1 after 6000 cycles at 2 A g-1) and superior rate capability (∼210 mA h g-1 at 40 A g-1) within 0.8-3.0 V. These results are much better than those of FeS2 and FeSe2, confirming the advantages of S/Se solid solution, as supported by EIS spectra, DFT calculations, and electronic conductivity. As FeS2- xSe x is paired with the activated carbon (AC) as Na-ion capacitors, this device is also better than sodium-ion batteries of FeS2- xSe x//Na3V2(PO4)3 and sodium-ion capacitors of metal oxides//AC, particularly at high rates.

Here, we report a colloidal strategy to fabricate FeCo-based bimetallic sulfides on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which are expected to display highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysis and sodium storage performances. Specifically, as-screened FeCo8S8 nanosheets (NSs) on rGO originating from suitable tailoring of the Co9S8 matrix with Fe at atomic level exhibited a very low potential difference (0.77 V) at 10 mA cm-2 and negligible voltage loss after 200 cycles as an air electrode for Zn-air batteries. For Na-ion batteries, FeCo8S8 NS/rGO demonstrated a superior high-rate capability (188 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1) with long-term cycling stability. The bifunctional electrocatalytic property and sodium storage performance are not only attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe/Co, but also the optimized catalytic activity and ion transport ability by the in situ rGO hybrid.

However, it remains a great challenge to understand the reaction mechanism of materials upon monovalent‐ion insertion. Here, triclinic Mg3V4(PO4)6/carbon composite (MgVP/C) with high thermal stability is synthesized via ball‐milling and carbon‐thermal reduction method and applied as a pseudocapacitive negative electrode in LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs. In operando and ex situ studies demonstrate the guest ion‐dependent reaction mechanisms of MgVP/C upon monovalent‐ion storage due to different sizes. MgVP/C undergoes an indirect conversion reaction to form Mg0, V0, and Li3PO4 in LIBs, while in SIBs/PIBs the material only experiences a solid solution with the reduction of V3+ to V2+. Moreover, in LIBs, MgVP/C delivers initial lithiation/delithiation capacities of 961/607 mAh g−1 (30/19 Li+ ions) for the first cycle, despite its low initial Coulombic efficiency, fast capacity decay for the first 200 cycles, and limited reversible insertion/deinsertion of 2 Na+/K+ ions in SIBs/PIBs.

Their impact on the viscosity, ionic conductivity and solvation structure was analyzed, revealing that NaFSI‐based electrolytes exhibited a stronger interaction with TEP and less ion‐pairing than the other salts, resulting in the highest ionic conductivity at a concentration of 0.8 m (mol/kg). Galvanostatic cycling experiments showed that none of the electrolyte salts dissolved in TEP forms an efficient passivation layer. However, adding 1 wt.% vinylene carbonate (VC) significantly improved cycling performance for the cells with NaBF4, NaDFOB or NaFSI, but not with NaClO4 or NaPF6. Additionally, NaFSI in TEP with 1 wt.% VC electrolyte solution showed minimal gas evolution during the formation cycling (< 8 mbar).  In a 1 Ah multilayer pouch cell, 0.8 m NaFSI in TEP with 1 wt.% VC showed promising results with 88% capacity retention after 200 cycles.

        "abstract": "High‐entropy layered oxide materials containing various metals that exhibit smooth voltage curves and excellent electrochemical performances have attracted attention in the development of positive electrode materials for sodium‐ion batteries. However, a smooth voltage curve can be obtained by suppression of the Na+‐vacancy ordering, and therefore, transition metal slabs do not need to be more multi‐element than necessary. Here, the Na+‐vacancy ordering is found to be disturbed by dual substitution of TiIV for MnIV and ZnII for NiII in P2‐Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2. Dual‐substituted Na2/3[Ni1/4Mn1/2Ti1/6Zn1/12]O2 demonstrates almost non‐step voltage curves with a reversible capacity of 114 mAh g−1 and less structural changes with a high crystalline structure maintained during charging and discharging. Synchrotron X‐ray, neutron, and electron diffraction measurements reveal that dual‐substitution with TiIV and ZnII uniquely promotes in‐plane NiII–MnIV ordering, which is quite different from the disordered mixing in conventional multiple metal substitution.",

Enrichment of sodium contents in host structures is required to increase the theoretical capacity as electrode materials, and therefore Na-excess compounds are systematically examined in a binary system of Na2 TiO3 -NaMnO2 . After several trials, synthesis of Na-excess compounds with a cation disordered rocksalt structure is successful by adapting a mechanical milling method. Among the tested electrode materials, Na1.14 Mn0.57 Ti0.29 O2 in this binary system delivers a large reversible capacity of ≈200 mA h g-1 , originating from reversible redox reactions of cationic Mn3+ /Mn4+ and anionic O2- /On - redox confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Holes in oxygen 2p orbitals, which are formed by electrochemical oxidation, are energetically stabilized by electron donation from Mn ions. Moreover, reversibility of anionic redox is significantly improved compared with a former study on a binary system of Na3 NbO3 -NaMnO2 tested as model electrode materials.",

In this study, structurally stabilized and aldehyde‐tuned hydrogen‐bonded organic frameworks (HOFs‐8) are designed and prepared to contain arrayed electronegative sites for sodium‐ion storage. Benefitting from the flexible hydrogen bond and unique structural symmetry, HOFs‐8 can achieve efficient utilization of the active sites and fast transport of sodium ions and electrons.

In situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ FT‐IR) and ex situ X‐ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ex situ XPS) analyses are performed to illustrate the mechanism of sodium‐ion storage involving aldehyde‐tuned C═O. Additionally, flexible hydrogen bonds in HOFs materials with unique structural symmetries are investigated to elucidate the mechanism of hydrogen bonding for improving their electrochemical properties. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations verified that HOFs‐8 has excellent Na+ diffusion kinetics, enabling it to demonstrate outstanding rate capability.

In this regard, a simple, template‐free electroplating protocol is reported for designing phase‐pure tin antimonide (TA)‐based negatrode. An optimum control over the potentiostatic electroplating parameters allows the preferential formation of dendritic nanostructures over an electroplated foam‐based current collector. The prepared negatrode and Mn‐based Prussian blue analog positrode in full coin cell format deliver an average nominal working voltage of 3.0 V with a discharge energy density of 342 Wh kg−1. In single‐layer full pouch cell format, an 8.01 mAh capacity (89.89 mAh g−1, 593.3 µAh cm−2) is achieved at an undeformed state and 97.12% capacity is retained at 180° bend condition. In multi‐layer full pouch cell format, a 35.86 mAh capacity (80.58 mAh g−1, 531.2 µAh cm−2) is achieved with 62.77% capacity retention after 200 cycles (0.125 C).

        "abstract": "The layered NaTMO2 (TM = Ni, Fe, Mn) materials with the O3-type structure are attractive as positive electrodes for sodium ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Additionally, Li doping in these materials has been shown to offer substantial enhancements to their electrochemical properties by promoting the formation of intergrowth structures, which intimately integrate the substituent phases. However, the influence of the specific Li content on the structural and electrochemical properties of the intergrowth materials requires investigation. Systematic variation of Li content in NaxLiyNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (NFM-Liy) was conducted to identify the role of Li in modification of the intergrowth structure and electrochemical performance. Li contents of 0.15 and greater generate a layered/layered Na-O3/Li-O’3 intergrowth structure. 7Li and 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray absorption spectroscopy identify that when the total solubility for alkali ions in the layered structure is exceeded, Li continues to form the Li-O’3 phase while the excess Na forms residual sodium compounds such as Na2O. Higher Li content is associated with improved capacity retention in the initial cycles from the superior stability of the mechanically linked Na-O3/Li-O’3 structure that suppresses the P3 to OP2 phase transition during charge. However, high Li contents are associated with increased rates of parasitic side reactions that reduce long-term cycling stability. These side reactions are connected to the instability of the cathode-electrolyte interphase, which can be partially mitigated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating with alumina, which significantly enhances the capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. Overall, we find that the layered/layered Na-O3/Li-O’3 intergrowth structure is able to provide structural stability and suppress undesired phase transformations but is overwhelmed by the increased reactivity of the surface if not protected by surface coating.",

However, the inherent low electrical conductivity and severe volume expansion of SnS_2 lead to poor electrochemical properties, further limiting practical applications. In this work, a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) co-decorated SnS_2 nanoplatelets (SnS_2/NC-rGO) using dopamine (PDA) and graphene oxide (GO) as carbon sources are cleverly designed. SnS_2/NC wrapped with rGO is synthesized via hydrothermal followed by calcination. This design not only increases the electrical conductivity of the composite but also provides more pathways for ions/electrons. Furthermore, the larger specific surface area of the composite allows better contact between the electrolyte and the electrode, which further enhances the redox dynamics of lithium ions/sodium ions. Thanks to this structure, the charge/discharge specific capacity of the SnS_2/NC-rGO composite electrode is 1215.8/1220.7 mAh g^−1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g^−1.

Nanoparticle-on-nanofiber morphology with highly porous carbon nanotube like channels were observed from SEM and TEM images. Nitrogen doped carbon nanoparticles on highly porous carbon nanofiber (N-PCNF) electrodes exhibited excellent cycling and C-rate performance with a high reversible capacity of around 280 mA h g−1 in sodium ion batteries. Moreover, at 1000 mA g−1, a high reversible capacity of 172 mA h g−1 was observed after 300 cycles. The superior electrochemical properties were attributed to a highly porous structure with enlarged d-spacings, enriched defects and active sites due to nitrogen doping. The electrochemical results prove that N-PCNF electrodes are promising electrode materials for high performance sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "TiO2 is widely investigated as a negative electrode for lithium-ion batteries. In sodium-ion batteries, however, the sodiation-desodiation mechanism of TiO2 is still unclear. Here, we report a new sodiation-desodiation mechanism for an anatase TiO2/C electrode in an ionic liquid electrolyte at 90 °C, where it shows a high reversible capacity of 278 mA h g-1. During the first charge process, TiO2 reacts with Na ions to form a Na2TiIITiIVO4 solid solution. During the first discharge process, the solid solution converts into a mixture of TiO2, Na2TiO3, and TiO, with the former two being X-ray amorphous. In the subsequent cycle, the mixture acts as the active material, reversibly reacting with Na ions to re-form the Na2TiIITiIVO4 solid solution. This mechanism, which has not been reported for Na or Li ion insertion-extraction in anatase TiO2, can help understand this promising electrode material and develop safe sodium-ion batteries with high energy density.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (AIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage due to their safe operational properties and low cost. However, AIBs have low specific energy (i.e., <80 Wh kg^−1) and limited lifespans (e.g., hundreds of cycles). Mn-Fe Prussian blue analogues are considered ideal positive electrode materials for AIBs, but they show rapid capacity decay due to Jahn-Teller distortions. To circumvent these issues, here, we propose a cation-trapping method that involves the introduction of sodium ferrocyanide (Na_4Fe(CN)_6) as a supporting salt in a highly concentrated NaClO_4-based aqueous electrolyte solution to fill the surface Mn vacancies formed in Fe-substituted Prussian blue Na_1.58Fe_0.07Mn_0.97Fe(CN)_6 · 2.65H_2O (NaFeMnF) positive electrode materials during cycling. When the engineered aqueous electrolyte solution and the NaFeMnF-based positive electrode are tested in combination with a 3, 4, 9, 10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide-based negative electrode in a coin cell configuration, a specific energy of 94 Wh kg^–1 at 0.5 A g^−1 (specific energy based on the active material mass of both electrodes) and a specific discharge capacity retention of 73.4% after 15000 cycles at 2 A g^−1 are achieved. Mn-based Prussian blue is an ideal positive electrode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries but still suffers from Mn dissolution. Here, the authors introduce an Mn-ion trapping agent as an electrolyte additive to produce a 94 Wh kg−1 Na-ion aqueous battery with a long lifespan.",

        "abstract": "Organic molecular electrode materials are promising candidates in batteries. However, direct application of small molecule materials usually suffers from drastic capacity decay and inefficient utilization of active materials because of their high solubility in organic electrolytes and low electrical conductivity. Herein, a simple strategy is found to address the above issues through coating the small-molecule organic materials on a commercialized carbon-coated aluminum foil (CCAF) as the enhanced electrode. Both the experimental and calculation results confirm that the relatively rough carbon coating on the aluminum foil not only exhibits superior adsorption capacity of small-molecule organic electrode materials with a tight contact interface but also provides continuous electronic conduction channels for the facilitated charge transfer and accelerated reaction kinetics. In addition, the carbon coating also inhibits Al corrosion in electrochemical process. As a result, by using the tetrahydroxy quinone-fused aza-phenazine (THQAP) molecule as an example, the THQAP-CCAF electrode exhibits an excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 220 and 180 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 2 A/g, respectively, and also a remarkable cyclability with a capacity retention of 77.3% even after 1700 cycles in sodium-ion batteries. These performances are much more superior than that of batteries with the THQAP on bare aluminum foil (THQAP-AF). This work provides a substantial step in the practical application of the small-molecule organic electrode materials for future sustainable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Redox‐active organic compounds have received much attention as high‐capacity electrodes for rechargeable batteries. However, the high solubility in organic electrolytes during charge and discharge processes hinders the practical exploitation of organic compounds. This study presents a cobalt‐based metal–organic coordination compound with bifunctional coordinated water (Co‐MOC‐H2O) for sodium‐ion storage. The coordinated water enhances interactions between sodium ions and nitrogen atoms in organic ligands through chelation, activating the inert sodium‐ion storage sites (C=N). Moreover, the stable hydrogen bonded framework formed by the coordinated water molecules prevents the active organic compounds from dissolving into the electrolyte, thereby enhancing cycling stability. With the bifunctional coordinated water molecules, the Co‐MOC‐H2O electrode delivers a high capacity of 403 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 over 600 cycles and exhibits a capacity retention of 77.9% at 2 A g−1 after 1100 cycles.

        "abstract": "Organic electroactive materials represent a new generation of sustainable energy storage technology due to their unique features including environmental benignity, material sustainability, and highly tailorable properties. Here a carbonyl-based organic salt Na2C6O6, sodium rhodizonate (SR) dibasic, is systematically investigated for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. A combination of structural control, electrochemical analysis, and computational simulation show that rational morphological control can lead to significantly improved sodium storage performance. A facile antisolvent method was developed to synthesize microbulk, microrod, and nanorod structured SRs, which exhibit strong size-dependent sodium ion storage properties. The SR nanorod exhibited the best performance to deliver a reversible capacity of ∼190 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C with over 90% retention after 100 cycles. At a high rate of 10 C, 50% of the capacity can be obtained due to enhanced reaction kinetics, and such high electrochemical activity maintains even at 80 °C. These results demonstrate a generic design route toward high-performance organic-based electrode materials for beyond Li-ion batteries. Using such a biomass-derived organic electrode material enables access to sustainable energy storage devices with low cost, high electrochemical performance and thermal stability.",

Even at -20 °C, a high capacity of 175 mAh g -1 (74% of its room temperature capacity) can be maintained at 2 A g -1 . Such electrode retains 90% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. As proved, weak ion solvation/desolvation of tetrahydrofuran greatly facilitates fast ion diffusion at SEI/electrolyte interface and homogeneous SEI with well-distributed NaF and organic components ensures fast Na + diffusion through the SEI layer and stable interface.",

        "abstract": "In this work, two isomers are mixed in different proportions and then alkalized as the organic anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The mixed material, denoted as PN, shows distinct morphology and electrochemical properties, compared to the single-component Na-CPP and Na-CPN. The Initial Coulombic Efficiency (ICE) value obtained by using the mixed PN as anode is higher than that using the single component. And the capacity retention rate of the mixed PN electrode is 92% after 1200 cycles under 935 mA g−1 high current density. This is mainly due to the superior morphology of the mixed PN electrode (the optimal ratio is CPP: CPN = 3: 1, the mass ratio (or molar ratio)), which exhibits more uniform spherical particles, thus increasing the contact area with the electrolyte and ensuring close contact with the conductive carbon. As a result, the ICE and cycle performance is improved because of the reduced irreversible side reactions. As far as we know, this is the first example of mixing two isomers as organic anode materials in traditional SIBs, and this strategy may provide new insights into future development of organic electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbons are considered the most suitable negative electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. Here, authors use electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the spin nature of mechanochemically-modified hard carbons to predict their charge storage mechanism for sodium-ion batteries. Hard carbon is a promising negative electrode material for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries due to the ready availability of their precursors and high reversible charge storage. The reaction mechanisms that drive the sodiation properties in hard carbons and subsequent electrochemical performance are strictly linked to the characteristic slope and plateau regions observed in the voltage profile of these materials. This work shows that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful and fast diagnostic tool to predict the extent of the charge stored in the slope and plateau regions during galvanostatic tests in hard carbon materials. EPR lineshape simulation and temperature-dependent measurements help to separate the nature of the spins in mechanochemically modified hard carbon materials synthesised at different temperatures. This proves relationships between structure modification and electrochemical signatures in the galvanostatic curves to obtain information on their sodium storage mechanism. Furthermore, through ex situ EPR studies we study the evolution of these EPR signals at different states of charge to further elucidate the storage mechanisms in these carbons. Finally, we discuss the interrelationship between EPR spectroscopy data of the hard carbon samples studied and their corresponding charging storage mechanism.",

This process differs from traditional blade or slot-die coating methods, necessitating tailored physical properties of composite slurries to ensure successful deposition. Inadequately optimised slurries result in non-uniform extrusion, and challenges such as nozzle swelling or slumping, result in compromised structural integrity of the print, limiting the resolution. This study focuses on developing slurry design principles by thoroughly characterising the rheology of several water-based hard carbon anode slurry, both in shear and extension. Hard carbon is chosen as a material of significant importance for future sodium-ion batteries, and an example for this optimisation. The slurry composition is tailored to introduce yield stress by incorporating network-forming binder (carrageenan) and additive (carbon nanotubes), effectively reducing spreading, and preserving the printed coating's structure. Validation is performed through printing a large width line and evaluating spread. The same slurry is deposited on a smaller 150 μm nozzle, which introduces die swell and spreading effects. This offers insights for further optimization strategies. The strategies developed in this research for characterizing and optimizing the rheology through formulation lay the groundwork for the advancement of detailed 3D printed electrodes, contributing to the progress of additive manufacturing technologies in the field of battery manufacturing.",

However, sluggishness in the charge/discharge reaction and low capacity are among the major obstacles to development of high-power sodium-ion batteries. Among the electrode materials recently developed for sodium-ion batteries, selenium shows considerable promise because of its high capacity and good cycling ability. Herein, we have investigated the mechanism and kinetics of both sodiation and lithiation reactions with selenium nanotubes, using in situ transmission electron microscopy. Sodiation of a selenium nanotube exhibits a three-step reaction mechanism: (1) the selenium single crystal transforms into an amorphous phase Na0.5Se; (2) the Na0.5Se amorphous phase crystallizes to form a polycrystalline Na2Se2 phase; and (3) Na2Se2 transforms into the Na2Se phase. Under similar conditions, the lithiation of Se exhibits a one-step reaction mechanism, with phase transformation from single-crystalline Se to a Li2Se. Intriguingly, sodiation kinetics is generally about 4-5 times faster than that of lithiation, and the kinetics during the different stages of sodiation is different. Na-based intermediate phases are found to have improved electronic and ionic conductivity compared to those of Li compounds by first-principles density functional theory calculations.",

Detailed analyses demonstrate that Ti3C2Tx undergoes expansion of the interlayer distance during the first sodiation, whereby desolvated Na(+) is intercalated/deintercalated reversibly. The interlayer distance is maintained during the whole sodiation/desodiation process due to the pillaring effect of trapped Na(+) and the swelling effect of penetrated solvent molecules between the Ti3C2Tx sheets. Since Na(+) intercalation/deintercalation during the electrochemical reaction is not accompanied by any substantial structural change, Ti3C2Tx shows good capacity retention over 100 cycles as well as excellent rate capability.",

Here, we demonstrate that electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EG) nanosheets can reversibly store (PF6- ) anions, yielding high charging and discharging voltages of 4.7 and 4.3 V vs. Na+ /Na, respectively. The dual-graphene rechargeable Na battery fabricated using EG as both the positive and negative electrodes provided the highest operating voltage among all Na ion full cells reported to date, together with a maximum energy density of 250 Wh kg-1 . Notably, the dual-graphene rechargeable Na microbattery exhibited an areal capacity of 35 μAh cm-2 with stable cycling behavior. This study offers an efficient option for the development of novel rechargeable microbatteries with ultra-high operating voltage and high energy density.",

Pre-treatment of potassium hydroxide (KOH) plays a crucial role in the enhancement of physical and electrochemical properties of synthesized hard carbon, specifically enhancing the active surface area. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) analysis also supports the enhanced BET surface area and distribution of pores. Raman spectroscopy shows the carbonized product as hard carbon. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provides the presence of oxygen-functionalized hard carbon. XRD pattern confirms the amorphous nature of the carbon. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates the charge transfer kinetics, which also shows that the charge transfer resistance of HC-800K7 is minimal among all KOH-pre-treated samples. An initial specific capacity of 320 mAhg^−1 has been recorded for the HC-800K7 sample at 0.1 Ag^−1 current rate. After 500 cycles, the reversible charge capacity is found to retain at 231 mAhg^−1. It gives 73.13% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Cyclic voltammetry shows the formation of SEI at the first few cycles and thereafter the SEI stabilized. HC-800K7 delivers high capacity and longer cycle stability. The results show that KOH activation enhances the electrochemical performance of the material.",

Expanded graphite has been employed in enhancing the transport kinetics. However, high-performance graphite should be synthesized at high temperatures when using traditional methods, which inevitably increases the total cost of material production. To tackle the kinetic issue for SIBs, we develop a three-dimensional network of graphene during catalytic graphitization in carbon electrodes at a temperature as low as 450 °C by using Prussian blue as a precursor. Furthermore, a strategy is proposed to enhance the transport ability of the Na-ion in the network by controlling the diffusion distance of the Fe cluster and the distance between Prussian blue particles, leading to optimized performance with both excellent high-rate performance (167 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1) and high charging capacity (390 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1). The results provide insights into the engineering of ionic transport properties through low-temperature catalytic graphitization in electrodes for SIBs and help design high-performance and low-cost electrodes for large-scale energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "We report on single-phase Na_ x V_2(PO_4)_3 compositions (1.5 ≤  x  ≤ 2.5) of the Na super ionic conductor type, obtained from a straightforward synthesis route. Typically, chemically prepared c-Na_2V_2(PO_4)_3, obtained by annealing an equimolar mixture of Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 and NaV_2(PO_4)_3, exhibits a specific sodium-ion distribution (occupancy of the Na(1) site of only 0.66(4)), whereas that of the electrochemically obtained e-Na_2V_2(PO_4)_3 (from Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3) is close to 1. Unlike conventional Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3, when used as positive electrode materials in Na-ion batteries, the Na_ x V_2(PO_4)_3 compositions lead to unusual single-phase Na^+ extraction/insertion mechanisms with continuous voltage changes upon Na^+ extraction/insertion. We demonstrate that the average equilibrium operating voltage observed upon Na^+ deintercalation from single-phase Na_2V_2(PO_4)_3 is increased up to an average value of ~3.70 V versus Na^+/Na (thanks to the activation of the V^4+/V^5+ redox couple) compared to 3.37 V versus Na^+/Na in conventional Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3, thus leading to an increase in the theoretical energy density from 396.3 Wh kg^–1 to 458.1 Wh kg^–1. Electrochemical and chemical Na^+ deintercalation from c-Na_2V_2(PO_4)_3 enables complete Na-ion extraction, increasing energy density. Single-phase Na_ x V_2(PO_4)_3 compositions obtained by annealing mixtures of Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 and NaV_2(PO_4)_3 enable the complete electrochemical extraction of Na^+ through the activation of the V^4+/V^5+ couple. This results in a substantial increase in the energy density of such Na super ionic conductor electrodes when used in sodium batteries.",

        "abstract": "Non-aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SiBs) are a viable electrochemical energy storage system for grid storage. However, the practical development of SiBs is hindered mainly by the sluggish kinetics and interfacial instability of positive-electrode active materials, such as polyanion-type iron-based sulfates, at high voltage. Here, to circumvent these issues, we proposed the multiscale interface engineering of Na_2.26Fe_1.87(SO_4)_3, where bulk heterostructure and exposed crystal plane were tuned to improve the Na-ion storage performance. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations suggested that the heterostructure of Na_6Fe(SO_4)_4 phase facilitated ionic kinetics by densifying Na-ion migration channels and lowering energy barriers. The (11-2) plane of Na_2.26Fe_1.87(SO_4)_3 promoted the adsorption of the electrolyte solution ClO_4^− anions and fluoroethylene carbonate molecules, which formed an inorganic-rich Na-ion conductive interphase at the positive electrode. When tested in combination with a presodiated FeS/carbon-based negative electrode in laboratory- scale single-layer pouch cell configuration, the Na_2.26Fe_1.87(SO_4)_3-based positive electrode enables an initial discharge capacity of about 83.9 mAh g^−1, an average cell discharge voltage of 2.35 V and a specific capacity retention of around 97% after 40 cycles at 24 mA g^−1 and 25 °C. Sluggish kinetics is a major challenge for iron-based sulfate electrode materials. Here, the authors report multiscale interface engineering to build continuous Na-ion transfer channels at all length scales by designing ionic conductors inside bulk and low-electron-density exposed crystal surfaces.",

Various characterizations reveal that size-controllable VS4 nanoparticles can be successfully anchored on the surface of graphene sheets (GSs) by a simple cationic-surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method. When used as an electrode material for sodium-ion batteries, these VS4 @GS nanocomposites show large specific capacity (349.1 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles), excellent long-term stability (84 % capacity retention after 1200 cycles), and high rate capability (188.1 mAh g-1 at 4000 mA g-1 ). A large proportion of the capacity was contributed by capacitive processes. This remarkable electrochemical performance was attributed to synergistic interactions between nanosized VS4 particles and a highly conductive graphene network, which provided short diffusion pathways for Na+ ions and large contact areas between the electrolyte and electrode, resulting in considerably improved electrochemical kinetic properties.",

        "abstract": "Metallic phase molybdenum sulfide (1T‐MoS2) is considered as an attractive electrode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its abundant active sites, metallic conductivity and high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, the thermodynamic unstable characteristic under natural conditions makes 1T‐MoS2 difficult to synthesize directly, which greatly hinders its further applications. Herein, an electron modulated and phosphate radical stabilized strategy is employed to construct stable 1T‐rich MoS2 (1T‐P‐MoS2). The PO43− groups are intercalated into MoS2 via a simple one‐step synthesis process, which enlarges the interlayer spacings and improves the insertion/extraction kinetics of Na+. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments demonstrate that the PO43− can give partial electrons to Mo upon PO43− intercalation, which triggers the reorganization of Mo 4d orbitals, resulting in a spontaneous phase transition of MoS2 from 2H to 1T phase, thereby enhancing the electrical conductivity of MoS2. The obtained 1T‐P‐MoS2 exhibits ultra‐fast charged properties (up to 277.1 mAh g−1 at 40 A g−1, discharged/charged within 25 s) and excellent cycling performance (up to 498.9 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1 A g−1).

Herein, we propose a new concept to stabilize oxygen redox activity by using oxygen-storage materials as an efficient buffer supplying and receiving oxygen during alkali ion intercalation. As a proof-of-concept, the study is focused on CeO2 as a modifier of sodium nickel-manganese oxide with a three-layer sequence, P3-Na2/3Ni1/2Mn1/2O2.

However, these materials typically suffer from poor capacity, unstable cycling performance, and sluggish Na+ kinetics. Herein, we explore a manganese‐based layered transition metal oxide (NaxN0.25Mn0.75O2) and show by X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and high‐angle annular dark‐field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF‐STEM) that careful variation of the sodium content can instigate the formation of a biphasic intergrowth. This intergrown P2/P3 material offered a higher capacity than its monophasic P2 counterpart due to the P3 structure having greater low‐voltage Mn3+/4+ redox. Further, the intergrowth material offers greatly enhanced kinetics and cycling stability when compared to single‐phase P3 material, due to the stabilizing nature of the P2 structure, elucidated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and operando synchrotron X‐ray diffraction. These results highlight the beneficial effect that the intergrowth structure has on the electrochemical performance of high‐manganese content positive electrode for future sodium‐ion batteries.",

This is interpreted as a thinner SEI layer which led to a shorter Na+ diffusion pathway, faster Na + reaction kinetics, and a better electrochemical performance overall. This work proposes a strategy to utilize cotton textiles as a biomass source along with a mechanistic insight for further optimization toward sustainable hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Great expectation is placed on sodium-ion batteries with high rate capability to satisfy multiple requirements in large-scale energy storage systems. However, the large ionic radius and high mass of Na+ hamper its kinetics in the case of diffusion-controlled mechanisms in conventional electrodes. In this study, a unique intercalation pseudocapacitance has been demonstrated in low-vacancy copper hexacyanoferrate, achieving outstanding rate capability. The minimization of the [Fe(CN)6 ] vacancy enables unhindered diffusion pathways for Na+ and little structural change during the Fe2+ /Fe3+ redox reaction, eliminating solid-state diffusion limits. Moreover, the Cu+ /Cu2+ couple is unexpectedly activated, realizing a record capacity for copper hexacyanoferrate. A capacity of 86 mAh g-1 is obtained at 1 C, of which 50 % is maintained under 100 C and 70 % is achieved at 0 °C. Such intercalation pseudocapacitance might shed light on exploiting high-rate electrodes among Prussian blue analogs for advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Rationally designing the electrolyte system toward improving the electrochemical performance, especially the rate capability, of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is very important for accelerating their large-scale commercialization. Herein, it is shown that by refining the molar ratio of two ether solvents, namely dimethoxyethane (DME) and 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (MeTHF), a binary solvent electrolyte system forms a sodium ion solvation structure that facilitates high rate charge/discharge of hard carbon (HC) electrodes. It is demonstrated that the boosted rate capability can be attributed to the enhanced sodium ion transportation and desolvation kinetics, resulting from the participation of weak-coordinating MeTHF molecule with low steric hindrance in the sodium ion solvation sheath, which weakens the interaction between sodium ion and solvent molecules/anions through electron density regulation at the bond critical points (BCPs). The thin and uniform solid electrolyte interphase film on HC electrodes formed in such an ether-based electrolyte is also beneficial for improving the rate performance and cycling stability. The results of the present study shed more light on how the electron density engineering at the BCPs in sodium ion solvation sheath affects the rate capability of HC electrodes and promote its practical application prospect in future sodium-based battery chemistries.",

        "abstract": "The development of highly stable and strongly active electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and overall water splitting (OWS) is critical in sustainable energy storage and conversion systems. Here, a new electrode material N-Fe-C@Nb2CTx is introduced, with a layered sandwich structure consisting of N-doping Fe-MOF derived-nanorods (Fe-C) and Nb2CTx MXenes. Specifically, Nb2CTx obtained by etching Nb2AlC with HF acid is used as the main body to construct the layered sandwich structure with Fe-C as the filler. Benefiting from this structure, Fe-MOF grows in situ within Nb2CTx, which restrains MXenes aggregation and stacking and also alleviates the bulk effect of sodium-ion embedding/de-embedding, thus improving its stability. Again, the more exposed active sites from the layered sandwich structure and N-doping introduction ensure high reactivity as electrode materials. In addition, Fe-C nanorods strengthen the linkage between the Nb2CTx layers and N-doping enhances the ion/electron transport rate, thereby boosting the effective mass transfer and electrical conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Fe-C and N-doping help increase the density of states (DOS) and material electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the generated oxygen species (*OH and *O) in OER are captured by in situ FT-IR test. As a result, the N-Fe-C@Nb2CTx electrochemical test displays good electrochemical performance in SIBs and OWS.",

Herein, we tailor a highly matched heterostructure (MgTi3O7@Na2Ti3O7) via a facile in situ synthesis method. The similar crystal structures of Na2Ti3O7 and MgTi3O7 creat continuous Na+ diffusion channels at the heterointerface, and the interactions at the interface creat a built-in interface electric field with a direction from MgTi3O7 to Na2Ti3O7. As a result, the particular heterointerface enable rapid Na+ diffusion in the MgTi3O7@Na2Ti3O7 electrode. The heterostructure engineering regulate the electrochemical reaction mechanism, leading to the solid solution reaction in the MgTi3O7@Na2Ti3O7 electrode, facilitating rapid Na+ transport. Therefore, the MgTi3O7@Na2Ti3O7 electrode exhibits an excellent rate capability (123 mAh/g at 20 C) and cycling performance. This work highlights the importance of a heterointerface with continuous channels in overcoming Na+ transport limitations in electrodes and could serves as a guide for designing a heterointerface for high-power sodium-ion batteries.",

The studies on bond valence sum maps show that NFPM has high Na+ conductivity because the large volumes of MoO4 groups make the interstitial channels wider, thus making the energy barrier of Na+ diffusion decrease along these channels. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that NFPM has high electronic conductivity because the contribution of Mo 4d orbitals on the formation of the bottom of the conduction band makes the connected MoO4 groups take part in electron transport. Electrochemical tests exhibit that NFPM can deliver a capacity of ∼80 mAh g-1 with good reversible cyclability utilizing the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple. In situ X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that NFPM undergoes one-phase reaction mechanism in the process of charge and discharge.",

        "abstract": "We report on a detailed structural versus electrochemical property investigation of the corncob-derived non-graphitizable carbons prepared at different carbonization temperatures using a combination of structural characterization methodology unique to this field. Non-graphitizable carbons are currently the most viable option for the negative electrode in sodium-ion batteries. However, many challenges arise from the strong dependence of the precursor’s choice and carbonization parameters on the evolution of the carbon matrix and its resulting electrochemistry. We followed structure development upon the increase in carbonization temperature with thorough structural characterization and electrochemical testing. With the increase of carbonization temperature from 900 to 1600 °C, our prepared materials exhibited a trend toward increasing structural order, an increase in the specific surface area of micropores, the development of ultramicroporosity, and an increase in conductivity. This was clearly demonstrated by a synergy of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and electron-energy loss spectroscopy techniques. Three-electrode full cell measurements confirmed incomplete desodiation of Na+ ions from the non-graphitizable carbons in the first cycle due to the formation of a solid–electrolyte interface and Na trapping in the pores, followed by a stable second cycle. The study of cycling stability over 100 cycles in a half-cell configuration confirmed the observed high irreversible capacity in the first cycle, which stabilized to a slow decrease afterward, with the Coulombic efficiency reaching 99% after 30 cycles and then stabilizing between 99.3 and 99.5%. Subsequently, a strong correlation between the determined structural properties and the electrochemical behavior was established.",

Here the authors report that tensile-strained MoSe2 can pass on the strain to its sodiated product Mo, and thus regulate the Gibbs free energy in the charging process to enable the reversible sodium storage. Manipulating the reversible redox chemistry of transition metal dichalcogenides for energy storage often faces great challenges as it is difficult to regulate the discharged products directly. Herein we report that tensile-strained MoSe_2 (TS-MoSe_2) can act as a host to transfer its strain to corresponding discharged product Mo, thus contributing to the regulation of Gibbs free energy change (Δ G ) and enabling a reversible sodium storage mechanism. The inherited strain results in lattice distortion of Mo, which adjusts the d-band center upshifted closer to the Fermi level to enhance the adsorbability of Na_2Se, thereby leading to a decreased Δ G of the redox chemistry between Mo/Na_2Se and MoSe_2. Ex situ and in situ experiments revealed that, unlike the unstrained MoSe_2, TS-MoSe_2 shows a highly reversible sodium storage, along with an evidently improved reaction kinetics.

However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple-coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4- is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6- in PC-based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+-FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+-PC and participation of SN and PF6- anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3 Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4% after 1000 cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long-term cycling stability of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Two chemically synthesized defective graphene materials with distinctly contrasting extended structures and surface chemistry are used to prepare sodium-ion battery electrodes. The difference in electrode performance between the chemically prepared graphene materials is qualified based on correlations with intrinsic structural and chemical dissimilarities. The overall effects of the materials' physical and chemical discrepancies are quantified by measuring the electrode capacities after repeated charge/discharge cycles. Solvothermal synthesized graphene (STSG) electrodes produce capacities of 92 mAh/g in sodium-ion batteries after 50 cycles at 10 mA/g, while thermally exfoliated graphite oxide (TEGO) electrodes produce capacities of 248 mAh/g after 50 cycles at 100 mA/g. Solid-state 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is employed to locally probe distinct sodium environments on and between the surface of the graphene layers after charge/discharge cycles that are responsible for the variations in electrode capacities. Multiple distinct sodium environments of which at least 3 are mobile during the charge-discharge cycle are found in both cases, but the majority of Na is predominantly located in an immobile site, assigned to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. Mechanisms of sodium insertion and extraction on and between the defective graphene surfaces are proposed and discussed in relation to electrode performance. This work provides a direct account of the chemical and structural environments on the surface of graphene that govern the feasibility of graphene materials for use as sodium-ion battery electrodes.",

Tin sulfide (SnS2) is regarded as an attractive negative candidate for NIBs and KIBs thanks to its superior power density, high-rate performance and natural richness. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics, the enormous volume change and the decomposition of polysulfide intermediates limit its practical application. Herein, microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template-assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K-based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well-confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change. The effect of the carbon additives (Super P/C65) on the electrochemical properties were investigated thoroughly.

Resulting from a molecular sieving effect of zeolite channels and size-shrunken ionic domains in Nafion, the as-prepared coating layer reject hydrated Na^+ ions and allow fast dehydrated Na^+ permeance. 200 cycles of Na_2MnFe(CN)_6//NaTi_2(PO_4)_3 full cells can be achieved in a practically feasible 2 m aqueous electrolyte. Aqueous sodium-ion batteries are known for poor rechargeability because of the competitive water decomposition reactions and the high electrode solubility. Improvements have been reported by salt-concentrated and organic-hybridized electrolyte designs, however, at the expense of cost and safety. Here, we report the prolonged cycling of ASIBs in routine dilute electrolytes by employing artificial electrode coatings consisting of NaX zeolite and NaOH-neutralized perfluorinated sulfonic polymer. The as-formed composite interphase exhibits a molecular-sieving effect jointly played by zeolite channels and size-shrunken ionic domains in the polymer matrix, which enables high rejection of hydrated Na^+ ions while allowing fast dehydrated Na^+ permeance. Applying this coating to electrode surfaces expands the electrochemical window of a practically feasible 2 mol kg^–1 sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate aqueous electrolyte to 2.70 V and affords Na_2MnFe(CN)_6//NaTi_2(PO_4)_3 full cells with an unprecedented cycling stability of 94.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C.

In the absence of a mechanistic understanding of how presodiation affects the surface of an electrode material, packaging optimization is restricted. Focusing on interfaces, we illustrate the working principle of presodiation in virtue of short-circuiting internal circuits. The presodiated carbon nanotubes (PS-CNTs) provide a thin, denser, and more robust solid electrolyte interfacial layer, enabling a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), high power density, and cycling stability with the merits of uniformly distributed NaF. As a result, our assembled sodium-ion battery (SIB) full cell with PS-CNT has an ICE of 91.6% and an energy density of 226 Wh kg-1, which was superior to the pristine CNT control electrode (ICE of 42.9% and energy density of 163 Wh kg-1).

        "abstract": "Although layered vanadium oxides are extensively studied for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), their broader application is hindered by the instability of their bulk‐phase structure, sluggish electron/ion‐transfer kinetics, and insufficient active sites. Herein, a novel synergistic strategy is proposed to modulate the electronic structure of VO by incorporating Na+ cations into deep V─O layers (D‐NVOx), resulting in significant structural modifications such as enlarged lattice spacing, the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies, and disordering of the V─O layers. Comprehensive analytical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that this synergy induces reversible Na+ pseudocapacitive intercalation and reconstructs low‐energy barrier channels, thereby accelerating Na‐ion diffusion kinetics. Moreover, the oxygen vacancies dramatically boost electronic conductivity and reinforce structural stability. The reduced crystallinity and lattice distortion result in dense nanointerfaces, potentially widening diffusion channels and providing additional active sites for fast surface Na‐ion storage. Owing to these merits, the D‐NVOx electrode achieves a high specific capacity (505 mAh g‒1 at 0.05 A g‒1), outstanding cyclic stability (96% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 2.0 A g‒1), and superior rate performance (280 mAh g‒1 at 5.0 A g‒1).

        "abstract": "Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their sustainability and structural tunability. However, many OEMs suffer from low specific capacity and poor cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule called 2,3,8,9,14,15-hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN-6OH) with catechol/ortho-quinone coupling functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. Through extensive analysis using density functional theory (DFT) calculation, ATR-FTIR, and Raman techniques, we have determined that the abundant coupling function groups and imine redox-active moieties on HATN-6OH enable a nine-electron transfer mechanism, resulting in a high specific capacity for sodium ion storage. Furthermore, the π-π coupling interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN-6OH molecules contribute to its resilient structural and chemical stability during cycling. As a result, our HATN-6OH electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacity (554 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), excellent rate capability (202 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and stable long-term cycling performance (73% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 10 A g-1) in SIBs.

        "abstract": "Due to the seamless interfaces between solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and electrode materials, SPEs-based all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries (ASSSIBs) are considered promising energy storage systems. However, the sluggish Na+ transport and uncontrollable Na dendrite propagation still hinder the practical application of SPEs-based ASSSIBs. Herein, Ca-doped CeO2 (Ca-CeO2) nanotube framework is synthesized and integrated with poly (ethylene oxide) methyl ether acrylate-perfluoropolyether copolymer (PEOA-PFPE), resulting in multifunctional solid nanocomposite electrolytes (namely SNEs, i.e., PEOA-PFPE/Ca-CeO2). Our investigations demonstrate that the fluorous effect incurred by the fluorine-containing PEOA-PFPE and the oxygen vacancy effect induced by the Ca-CeO2 framework could synergistically promote the dissociation of sodium salt, ultimately enhancing the Na+ mobility in SNEs. Besides, the resultant SNEs construct rapid Na+ transport channels and homogenize the Na deposition in SNEs/Na interface, which effectively prevents the Na dendrite growth. Furthermore, the assembled carbon-coated sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP@C)||PEOA-PFPE/Ca-CeO2||Na coin cell delivers impressive rate capability of 97.9 mA h g-1 at 2 C and outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention of 84.3% after 300 cycles at 1 C.

However, the energy density of SIBs is often evaluated based solely on the capacities and cell voltages of active materials in half‐cell configurations, neglecting engineering considerations for full‐cell configurations. This study investigates the effects of electrode composition and the balance in capacities between positive and negative electrodes (N/P ratio) on the performance of full‐cell configurations, using Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and hard carbon (HC) as representative electrode materials. Through a systematic analysis, an optimal composition for NVP and HC electrodes is proposed, considering areal capacity and capacity retention during full‐cell operations. Additionally, the importance of balancing the N/P ratio and the necessity of presodiation techniques to achieve high‐energy‐density SIBs are underscored.

        "abstract": "Owing to their high discharge capacities, P2‐type transition metal layered oxides have attracted attention for use as positive electrode materials in Na‐ion batteries. However, owing to the Na‐deficient compositions of these oxides, additional Na+ must be supplied using a Na‐metal negative electrode to attain a high capacity in a half‐cell configuration. In this study, solid Na2CO3 powder was introduced into the P2‐Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 composite positive electrode as a sacrificial salt to compensate for the Na deficiency. Na+ was supplied through the electrochemical oxidative decomposition of Na2CO3 during the initial charging process; the decomposition mechanism responsible for this process was investigated in detail. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry confirmed that Na2CO3 was oxidatively decomposed in combination with the decomposition of the ethylene carbonate electrolyte. This reaction produced CO2, wherein the carbon source was derived from both Na2CO3 and the electrolyte. Consequently, Na+ supplementation improved the reversible capacity of the Na‐ion full cell. This study offers practical insights and a mechanistic understanding of the pre‐doping technique for Na‐free negative electrodes. This approach also compensates for the irreversible reductive capacity in a process that can be easily applied to practical sodium‐ and lithium‐ion batteries and capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Here, the sodium storage mechanism in commercial grade hard carbon with a low surface area is comprehensively investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, and in situ Raman spectroscopy for fresh and cycled electrodes. The reversible shift of the carbon G‐band peak on Raman spectra and substantial change of the charge‐transfer resistance in the sloping region of the voltage profile indicates the intercalation of sodium ions into hard carbon, whereas the low‐voltage plateau is associated with the pore‐filling process. In situ Raman analysis at low frequencies reveals that the pore filling is progressed via formation of small sodium clusters in closed pores. Prolonged cycling demonstrates that intercalation is stable and consistent throughout multiple charge–discharge cycles. The transition from intercalation to pore filling strongly affects the diffusion behavior, leading to considerably slower diffusivity at low voltage. The EIS effectively differentiates the contribution of adsorption to charge storage. The gradual growth of the solid‐electrolyte interphase layer affects the rise of the interfacial resistance as cycling progresses. In combination with the slower diffusivity, the low‐voltage plateau region strictly impedes fast de/sodiation and eventually causes capacity fade.",

        "abstract": "NAtrium SuperIonic CONductor (NASICON) structured phosphate framework compounds are attracting a great deal of interest as suitable electrode materials for “rocking chair” type batteries. Manganese-based electrode materials are among the most favored due to their superior stability, resource non-criticality, and high electrode potentials. Although a large share of research was devoted to Mn-based oxides for Li- and Na-ion batteries, the understanding of thermodynamics and phase formation in Mn-rich polyanions is still generally lacking. In this study, we investigate a bifunctional Na-ion battery electrode system based on NASICON-structured Na1+2xMnxTi2–x(PO4)3 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.5). In order to analyze the thermodynamic and phase formation properties, we construct a composition–temperature phase diagram using a computational sampling by density functional theory, cluster expansion, and semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo methods. The results indicate finite thermodynamic limits of possible Mn concentrations in this system, which are primarily determined by the phase separation into stoichiometric Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (x = 1.0) and NaTi2(PO4)3 for x < 1.0 or NaMnPO4 for x > 1.0. The theoretical predictions are corroborated by experiments obtained using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy on solid-state and sol–gel prepared samples. The results confirm that this system does not show a solid solution type behavior but phase-separates into thermodynamically more stable sodium ordered monoclinic α-Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (space group C2) and other phases. In addition to sodium ordering, the anti-bonding character of the Mn–O bond as compared to Ti–O is suggested as another important factor governing the stability of Mn-based NASICONs. We believe that these results will not only clarify some important questions regarding the thermodynamic properties of NASICON frameworks but will also be helpful for a more general understanding of polyanionic systems.",

However, sodium (Na) metal electrode suffers low cyclic stability due to the naturally‐formed unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, 3D network polymer, poly‐bis(3‐(2‐methylaziridin‐1‐yl) propanoate (PBMP) is synthesized, for mechanically robust gel polymer electrolyte (GPE), in which the tertiary‐amine functional group with low‐valence N prefers to react with Na metal to produce a thin and ion‐conducive SEI, realizing Na+ fast and uniform plating/stripping. The assembled Na/GPE/Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery shows an ultrahigh capacity retention of 97.8% after 2000 cycles under 2 mA cm−2, which is the top‐level of GPE‐SMB. This work provides a new strategy to construct advanced SEI by regulating functional groups of network polymer for GPE‐SMBs with high safety.",

        "abstract": "Antimony (Sb) is recognized as a potential electrode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its huge reserves, affordability, and high theoretical capacity (660 mAh·g^−1). However, Sb-based materials experience significant volume expansion during cycling, leading to comminution of the active substance and limiting their practical use in SIBs. Therefore, the volume expansion issue of Sb-based materials during charging/discharging must be solved to create high-performance SIBs. This paper presents a detailed review of structural engineering of Sb-based electrode materials, focusing on the performance effects of different kinds of structures on advanced performance SIBs. Finally, the future development and the challenges of Sb-based materials are prospected. This paper can provide specific perspectives on the structure construction and optimization of Sb-based anode materials, so as to promote the rapid development and practical applications of SIBs.

Here, ultrathin nanoribbons of sodium titanate (M-NTO, NaTi1.5O8.3) and potassium titanate (M-KTO, K2Ti4O9) were successfully synthesized by a simultaneous oxidation and alkalization process of Ti3C2 MXene. Benefiting from the suitable interlayer spacing (0.90 nm for M-NTO, 0.93 nm for M-KTO), ultrathin thickness (<11 nm), narrow widths of nanoribbons (<60 nm), and open macroporous structures for enhanced ion insertion/extraction kinetics, the resulting M-NTO exhibited a large reversible capacity of 191 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 for sodium storage, higher than those of pristine Ti3C2 (178 mAh g-1) and commercial TiC derivatives (86 mAh g-1). Notably, M-KTO displayed a superior reversible capacity of 151 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and 88 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 300 mA g-1 and long-term stable cyclability over 900 times, which outperforms other Ti-based layered materials reported to date. Moreover, this strategy is facile and highly flexible and can be extended for preparing a large number of MXene-derived materials, from the 60+ group of MAX phases, for various applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, and electrocatalysts.",

An eco‐friendly and biodegradable sodium‐ion secondary battery (SIB) is developed through extensive material screening followed by the synthesis of biodegradable electrodes and their seamless assembly with an unconventional biodegradable separator, electrolyte, and package. Each battery component decomposes in nature into non‐toxic compounds or elements via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation, with all of the biodegradation products naturally abundant and eco‐friendly. Detailed biodegradation mechanisms and toxicity influence of each component on living organisms are determined. In addition, this new SIB delivers performance comparable to that of conventional non‐degradable SIBs.

The PDCs were obtained by pre-pyrolysing peat at 300–800 °C, removing impurities with base–acid solution treatment and thereafter post-pyrolysing the materials at temperatures (T) from 1000 to 1500 °C. By modification of pre- and post-pyrolysis temperatures we obtained hard carbons with low surface areas, optimal carbonization degree and high electrochemical Na+ storage capacity in SIB half-cells. The best results were obtained when pre-pyrolysing peat at 450 °C, washing out the impurities with KOH and HCl solutions and then post-pyrolysing the obtained carbon-rich material at 1400 °C. All hard carbons were electrochemically characterized in half-cells (vs. Na/Na+) and capacities as high as 350 mA h g−1 at 1.5 V and 250 mA h g−1 in the plateau region (E < 0.2 V) were achieved at charging current density of 25 mA g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 80%.",

        "abstract": "Effective recycling technologies represent a solution to the sustainability and environmental consequences of spent rechargeable batteries. Here, the authors show a bipolar electrode design that allows not only good electrochemical performance but a closed loop of material use for sodium ion batteries. Large-scale applications of rechargeable batteries consume nonrenewable resources and produce massive amounts of end-of-life wastes, which raise sustainability concerns in terms of manufacturing, environmental, and ecological costs. Therefore, the recyclability and sustainability of a battery should be considered at the design stage by using naturally abundant resources and recyclable battery technology. Herein, we design a fully recyclable rechargeable sodium ion battery with bipolar electrode structure using Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 as an electrode material and aluminum foil as the shared current collector. Such a design allows exceptional sodium ion battery performance in terms of high-power correspondence and long-term stability and enables the recycling of ∼100% Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 and ∼99.1% elemental aluminum without the release of toxic wastes, resulting in a solid-component recycling efficiency of >98.0%. The successful incorporation of sustainability into battery design suggests that closed-loop recycling and the reutilization of battery materials can be achieved in next-generation energy storage technologies.",

However, the development of flexible electrodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is still limited due to the intricate production methods and the relatively high-cost of current collectors such as graphene/graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes. Here, the hierarchical 3D electronic channels wrapped large-sized Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 is designed and fabricated by a simple electrospinning technique. As flexible electrode material, it exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability, together with ultrafast electronic conductivity and high Na-ion diffusion coefficients for SIBs, leading to superior electrochemical performances. A high reversible specific capacity of 116 mA h g-1 (nearly 99% of the theoretical specific capacities) can be obtained at the current density of 0.1 C. Even after a 300-fold current density increased (30 C), the discharge specific capacity of the flexible electrode still remains 63 mA h g-1 . Such an effective concept of fabricating 3D electronic channels for large-sized particles is expected to accelerate the practical applications of flexible batteries at various systems.",

        "abstract": "Fast‐charging ability of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is mainly determined by a highly effective redox reaction rate. However, traditional metal@carbon composites rarely achieve atom‐level dispersion at high density, resulting in poor reaction rates. Herein, supported by the introduction of carbon vacancies, abundant C─S/C─O chemical bonds are successfully established in a carbon carrier. Then, plenty of Sb single atoms (Sb SA/PC) are first anchored with a high loading of 31.4 wt%, achieving a high yield of 210.56 g per batch. Benefiting from dense Sb─O─C/Sb─S─C interfacial chemical bonds, Sb─S2O coordination configurations are firmly confined in the interior of carbon. Surprisingly, the conductivity of Sb SA/PC‐2 is approximately 2.2 × 107 times greater than that of pristine Sb2S3. Consequently, Sb SA/PC‐2 exhibits ultrahigh fast‐charging capability (201.7 mAh g−1 at 20.0 A g−1) and ultralong cycling life (364.4 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 after 5000 cycles). Theoretical calculations reveal that the fast‐charging capability can be attributed to the low migration barrier and increased number of active sites. Moreover, owing to the structural integrity of Sb single atoms, phase separation is effectively inhibited. This work is anticipated to open an avenue toward designing advanced electrode materials for ultrafast‐charging SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Highlights One-dimensional elongated TiS_2-modified and S-doped TiO_2/C nanofibers electrode was synthesized through electrospinning, which exhibited a high specific capacity, excellent cyclic stability, and rate capability in sodium-ion battery. An enhanced pseudo-capacitive capacity because of S doping and TiS_2 decoration contributes to noticeable sodium storage performance. High capacity of 161 mAh g^−1 (at 3000 mA g^−1) after 1500 cycles and 58 mAh g^−1 (at 10,000 mA g^−1) after 10,000 cycles is delivered outstandingly. Pseudo-capacitive mechanisms can provide higher energy densities than electrical double-layer capacitors while being faster than bulk storage mechanisms. Usually, they suffer from low intrinsic electronic and ion conductivities of the active materials. Here, taking advantage of the combination of TiS_2 decoration, sulfur doping, and a nanometer-sized structure, as-spun TiO_2/C nanofiber composites are developed that enable rapid transport of sodium ions and electrons, and exhibit enhanced pseudo-capacitively dominated capacities. At a scan rate of 0.5 mV s^−1, a high pseudo-capacitive contribution (76% of the total storage) is obtained for the S-doped TiS_2/TiO_2/C electrode (termed as TiS_2/S-TiO_2/C). Such enhanced pseudo-capacitive activity allows rapid chemical kinetics and significantly improves the high-rate sodium storage performance of TiO_2. The TiS_2/S-TiO_2/C composite electrode delivers a high capacity of 114 mAh g^−1 at a current density of 5000 mA g^−1. The capacity maintains at high level (161 mAh g^−1) even after 1500 cycles and is still characterized by 58 mAh g^−1 at the extreme condition of 10,000 mA g^−1 after 10,000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for grid‐scale energy storage, however, the sluggish ion‐diffusion kinetics brought by the large radius of Na+ seriously limits the performance of SIBs, let alone at low temperatures. Herein, a confined acid–base pair self‐assembly strategy to synthesize unusual Ti0.88Nb0.88O4−x@C for high‐performance SIBs operating at room and low temperatures is proposed. The confinement self‐assembly of the acid–base pair around the micelles and confined crystallization by the carbon layer realize the formation of ordered and stoichiometric mesoporous frameworks with opened ion channels. Thus, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4−x@C exhibits rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics at 25 and −40 °C, which are one order higher than that of the nonporous one. A high reversible capacity of 233 mAh g−1, excellent rate (a specific capacity of 103 mAh g−1 at 50 C), and cycling performances (<0.03% fading per cycle) can be observed at 25 °C. More importantly, even at −40 °C, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4–x@C can still deliver the 161 mAh g−1 capacity, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 60% and outstanding cycling stability (99 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C after 500 cycles). It is believed this strategy opens a new avenue for constructing novel mesoporous electrode materials for low‐temperature energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries based on Prussian Blue Analogues (PBA) are considered as promising and scalable candidates for stationary energy storage systems, where longevity and cycling stability are assigned utmost importance to maintain economic viability. Although degradation due to active material dissolution is a common issue of battery electrodes, it is hardly observable directly due to a lack of in operando techniques, making it challenging to optimize the performance of electrodes. By operating Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] and Na2Co[Fe(CN)6] model electrodes in a flow-cell setup connected to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, in this work, the dynamics of constituent transition-metal dissolution during the charge-discharge cycles was monitored in real time. At neutral pHs, the extraction of nickel and cobalt was found to drive the degradation process during charge-discharge cycles. It was also found that the nature of anions present in the electrolytes has a significant impact on the degradation rate, determining the order ClO4- > NO3- > Cl- > SO42- with decreasing stability from the perchlorate to sulfate electrolytes. It is proposed that the dissolution process is initiated by detrimental specific adsorption of anions during the electrode oxidation, therefore scaling with their respective chemisorption affinity. This study involves an entire comparison of the effectiveness of common stabilization strategies for PBAs under very fast (dis)charging conditions at 300C, emphasizing the superiority of highly concentrated NaClO4 with almost no capacity loss after 10 000 cycles for Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6].",

This study identified Na5/6[Ni1/3Mn1/6Fe1/6Ti1/3]O2 as an optimal composition for use as an O3-type positive electrode material in Na-ion batteries on the basis of a comprehensive phase diagram, where the end members of the triangular phase diagram were Na2/3[Ni1/32+Mn2/34+]O2, Na2/3[Ni1/32+Ti2/34+]O2, and the hypothetical composition Na4/3[Ni1/32+Fe2/33+]O2. By investigating the effects of the partial substitution of Mn4+ with Fe3+ and Ti4+ within the Na(2/3+x)[Ni1/3Mn(2/3–x–y)FexTiy]O2 system, we optimized the capacity, working potential, and cycle performance. Substitution with Fe enhanced the discharge capacity due to the increased Na+ content in the initial composition, although it also led to a reduced cycling stability derived from irreversible Fe migration to the Na layers. In contrast, substitution with Ti improved the working potential and cycling stability, although an excessive Ti content caused capacity degradation with cycling. We found that the O3-type Na5/6[Ni1/3Mn1/6Fe1/6Ti1/3]O2 demonstrated an excellent cycle stability with minimal capacity loss over 250 cycles, which was attributed to the suppression of irreversible transition metal migration.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a high‐entropy strategy has attracted extensive attention and is applied to the preparation of electrode materials for energy storage batteries, aiming to improve electrochemical performance. It is found that adjusting the conformational entropy of the material can significantly enhance ion and electron transport efficiency, as well as improve the structural stability of the host material. However, there still remains a lack of deep understanding into the high‐entropy strategy, specifically regarding how this approach can alter the intrinsic properties of the material. In this work, the Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 is designed and prepared as a model material with higher entropy, and ultimately, an optimized sample of Na3.9Fe2.6V0.1Mn0.1Cu0.1Mg0.1(PO4)2(P2O7) is achieved. The results indicate that increasing the entropy value of the material notably enhances its crystal structure, diffusion kinetics, and interfacial stability. Consequently, this optimized sample demonstrates deep insertion/extraction of 2.8 Na+, yielding an impressively high capacity of 122.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, alongside an ultra‐high rate capability of 100C. Remarkably, it also sustains performance over 14 000 cycles at 50C. This study underscores a method for fabricating high‐performance electrode materials through the implementation of the entropy strategy.",

        "abstract": "The abundance of sodium has recently sparked considerable interest in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Their similarity to conventional lithium-ion technology is obvious; however, the cell chemistry often significantly deviates. Graphite, although being the standard negative electrode in Li-ion batteries, is largely inactive for Na-ion storage in conventional non-aqueous carbonate-based electrolytes, for example. Very recently, it has been demonstrated that graphite can be activated for Na-ion storage in cells with ether-based electrolytes. The storage mechanism is based on co-intercalation of solvent molecules along with the Na-ions, forming ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). This process is highly reversible but yet poorly understood. Here, we provide a comprehensive study on the formation and the stability of t-GICs. A series of ether solvents are being discussed: linear glymes with different chain lengths (mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraglyme), several derivatives with side groups as well as tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a cyclic ether and one crown ether. We show that the redox potentials shift depending on the ether chain length and mixing of ethers might enable tailoring of the redox behaviour. The inferior behaviour of triglyme is likely due to the less ideal ion coordination. Complementary experiments with lithium are made and demonstrate the superior behaviour of sodium. We find that the increase in graphene layer spacing during intercalation only slightly depends on the chain length and is in the range of 250%, and still mechanical stability is preserved. We further show the t-GICs possess chemical stability and demonstrate that the kinetically favoured charge transfer is probably due to the absence of a solid electrolyte interphase.",

        "abstract": "Herein, a rational design of SnS2 nanosheets confined into bubble‐like carbon nanoreactors anchored on N,S doped carbon nanofibers (SnS2@C/CNF) is proposed to prepare the self‐standing electrodes, which provides tunable void space on carbon fibers for the first time by introducing hollow carbon nanoreactors. The SnS2@C/CNF provides the stable support with greatly enhanced ion and electron transport, alleviates aggregation and volume expansion of SnS2 nanosheets, and promotes the formation of abundant exposed edges and active sites. The volume balance between SnS2 nanosheets and hollow carbon nanoreactors is reached to accommodate the expansion of SnS2 during cycles by controlling the thickness of SnO2 shells, which achieves the best space utilization. The doping of N,S elements enhances the wettability of the carbon nanofiber matrix to electrolyte and Li ions and further improves the electrical conductivity of the whole electrode. Thus, the SnS2@C/CNF benefits greatly in structural stability and pseudocapacitive capacity for improved lithium/sodium storage performance. As a result of these improvements, the self‐standing SnS2@C/CNF film electrodes exhibit the highly stable capacity of 964.8 and 767.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, and excellent capacity retention of 87.4% and 82.4% after 1000 cycles at high current density for lithium‐ion batteries and sodium‐ion batteries, respectively.",

For sodium‐ion electrodes, however, an amorphous solid may be more advantageous as a result of the open framework to facilitate ion insertion and the ability to tolerate volumetric changes. Herein, it is shown that the Na+ insertion properties of amorphous VO2 (a‐VO2) are superior to those of crystalline VO2(B). Amorphous VO2 exhibits a linear voltage characteristic over a 3 V range (4.0 to 1.0 V vs Na/Na+) leading to a reversible capacity as high as 400 mAh g−1 and rapid redox kinetics, which is attributed to its pseudocapacitive nature. The linear voltage characteristic over 3 V affords the opportunity of fabricating a symmetric Na‐ion battery in which the a‐VO2 material serves as both the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Such a symmetric battery offers safer operation in terms of overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, high charge/discharge current abuse, and long‐term usage. The results suggest that amorphous transition metal oxides may offer advantageous attributes for rapid, safe, and energy‐dense storage.",

Herein, for the first time, layered NaxMO2 (M=Cu, Fe, Mn) cathodes are successfully prepared by directly using concentrated chalcopyrite ores as precursor. Greatly, the impurity elements like Si and Ca are found to be crucial in tailoring the phase structure of as-obtained layered oxides as P2 or O3 type, which removes away the traditional concern that the impurities may restrict the utilization of natural ores. More interestingly, a certain amount of Ca element remained in the Na sites through a self-doping process endows the P2-type products with enhanced structural stability. In half-cells, P2-type NaxMO2 with self-doped Ca element shows superior rate capability and cycling stability (56 mAh g-1 at 5 C, 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C). In contrast, less impurity elements are favorable for O3-type oxides to achieve high capacity of 107 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 84% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 2 C. This new strategy would efficiently shorten the process for preparing electrode materials and open a feasible route to construct cheap and durable SIBs.",

        "title": "Post‐Substitution Modulated Robust Sodium Layered Oxides",
        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxides feature in high capacity and diverse composition, however, are plagued by various issues including limited kinetics and interfacial instability with residual alkali. Conventional substitution/doping and heterogeneous coating are promising to tackle the problems of bulk and surface, respectively, but normally insufficient to address both. Herein, a post‐substitution strategy is proposed to modify primary sodium‐layered‐oxide particles that can simultaneously deal with bulk and surficial issues. As a typical example, post Ti‐substitution for O3‐NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is successfully performed by adjusting thermodynamic driving force, resulting in depth‐controllable Ti infusion from surface to bulk, as proved by energy dispersive spectroscopy maps collected at the cross‐section. Residual alkali species are efficiently diminished and benefited from the surface‐to‐bulk osmotic reaction, significantly improving Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, remarkable enhancements in reversible capacity (135 mAh g−1 at C/10), rate capability (74% retention at 5 C), and long‐term cycling stability (80% retention after 300 cycles at 2 C) are achieved by manipulating gradient‐like Ti distribution in a primary particle that brings with increased kinetics and strengthened interfacial stability, surpassing those given by rough heterotic coating and homogeneous Ti‐substitution. Such post‐substitution is expected to provide a universal strategy to modify primary layered‐oxide particles for developing advanced cathode materials of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Tremendous efforts are put forward to develop novel high-performance electrodes for Na-ion batteries (SIBs) in order to replace commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Graphite, the most versatile anode for LIBs, fails to accommodate Na+ions owing to the poor thermodynamic stability of the binary graphite intercalation compound. This study aims to exfoliate the layers of graphite through a simple mechanical process at different time intervals (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 h) and examine the potential candidate for Na-storage in the presence of carbonate-based electrolytes. This study reports that ball milling plays a vital role in the performance of the graphite in Na-storage. The graphite exfoliated for 80 h (EG-80h) rendered an excellent reversible capacity of 209 mAh g-1 with coulombic efficiency of >99% after 100 cycles in EC-based electrolyte. In situ impedance analysis is performed to validate the charge storage mechanism and Na-ion kinetics. The performance of EG-80h in a full-cell assembly is evaluated with a carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, which exhibited an initial capacity of ≈75 mAh g-1 and energy density of 201 Wh kg-1. In addition, the adaptability of the NVPC/EG-80h cell at different temperatures is examined from -10 to 50 °C, displaying excellent performance in both high and low-temperature conditions.",

        "abstract": "Stacking order plays a key role in defining the electrochemical behavior and structural stability of layer-structured cathode materials. However, the detailed effects of stacking order on anionic redox in layer-structured cathode materials have not been investigated specifically and are still unrevealed. Herein, two layered cathodes with the same chemical formula but different stacking orders: P2-Na0.75 Li0.2 Mn0.7 Cu0.1 O2 (P2-LMC) and P3-Na0.75 Li0.2 Mn0.7 Cu0.1 O2 (P3-LMC) are compared. It is found that P3 stacking order is beneficial to improve the oxygen redox reversibility compared with P2 stacking order. By using synchrotron hard and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopies, three redox couples of Cu2+ /Cu3+ , Mn3.5+ /Mn4+ , and O2- /O- are revealed to contribute charge compensation in P3 structure simultaneously, and two redox couples of Cu2+ /Cu3+ and O2- /O- are more reversible than those in P2-LMC due to the higher electronic densities in Cu 3d and O 2p orbitals in P3-LMC. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals that P3-LMC exhibits higher structural reversibility during charge and discharge than P2-LMC, even at 5C rate. As a result, P3-LMC delivers a high reversible capacity of 190.3 mAh g-1 and capacity retention of 125.7 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles. These findings provide new insight into oxygen-redox-involved layered cathode materials for SIBs.",

Li^+/Li. Recent advances in nanostructuring of the Sb_2S_3 anode provide an effective way of mitigating the challenges of structure conversion and volume expansion upon lithiation/sodiation that severely hinder the Sb_2S_3 cycling stability. In this context, we report uniformly sized colloidal Sb_2S_3 nanoparticles (NPs) as a model Sb_2S_3 anode material for LIBs and SIBs to investigate the effect of the primary particle size on the electrochemical performance of the Sb_2S_3 anode. We found that compared with microcrystalline Sb_2S_3, smaller ca . 20–25 nm and ca . 180–200 nm Sb_2S_3 NPs exhibit enhanced cycling stability as anode materials in both rechargeable LIBs and SIBs. Importantly, for the ca . 20–25 nm Sb_2S_3 NPs, a high initial Li-ion storage capacity of 742 mAh g^−1 was achieved at a current density of 2.4 A g^−1. At least 55% of this capacity was retained after 1200 cycles, which is among the most stable performance Sb_2S_3 anodes for LIBs.",

Furthermore, a detailed electrochemical kinetic calculation manifests the Li/Na/K-ions storage capability is mainly ascribed to the introduction of sulfur in graphene aerogel (GA) to enlarge the interlayer distance, the 3D interconnected network with porous structure providing sufficient space to accommodate volumetric expansion and short transport pathway for electrons/alkali-ions.

Nevertheless, achieving good dispersion of metal-like GeTe in anode materials remains a significant challenge. Herein, hybrid GeTe/graphene (GeTe/G) is proposed as a highly efficient anode for LiBs and SiBs by facile ball milling. Pulverized GeTe is effectively anchored on peeled graphene sheets that can accelerate Li+ transport in electrodes as predicted by theoretical calculations and thus result in improved overall electrochemical performance. For instance, GeTe/G possesses a high reversible capacity of 478 mAh g-1 under 0.1 A g-1 in the 300th cycle. Moreover, by further cross-linking the GeTe/G using carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber pyrolysis from cotton cellulose, the as-prepared three-dimensional (3D) flexible anode possesses macropores that acted as positive channels favorably for ion transport. Remarkably, the as-prepared flexible 3D GeTe/G/CNT electrode with a thickness of 1050 μm exhibits a high reversible capacity of 451.4 mAh g-1 (4.38 mAh cm-2) vs Li+/Li and 372.5 mAh g-1 (2.08 mAh cm-2) vs Na+/Na, respectively, in the second cycle under 0.1 A g-1.

This model provides an effective approach not only to revealing the relationship between the thickness of Sb nanofilm and its Na+ storage properties, but also to uncovering the impact of C layer on Na+ storage performance of Sb nanofilm. Through sputtering C layer on Sb nanofilm, the volume expansion of Sb nanofilm during sodiation process was effectively buffered.

Herein, we report the hydrothermally synthesized self-assembled interconnected nanosheets of WO3 microspheres possessing admirable sodium storage in terms of cycling stability and acceptable rate capability. Benefitting from the interconnected nature of the nanosheets with a hollow interior, the WO3 microspheres exhibited a high sodiation capacity of 431 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and an excellent rate performance of 60 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 with an impressive coulombic efficiency of around 99%. Importantly, even after continuous cycling with increasing current densities, a specific capacity as high as 220 mA h g−1 could be recovered at a current density of 50 mA g−1, suggesting excellent sodium storage reversibility.",

        "abstract": "It is still a challenging task to develop a facile and scalable process to synthesize porous hybrid materials with high electrochemical performance. Herein, a scalable strategy is developed for the synthesis of few-layer MoS2 incorporated into hierarchical porous carbon (MHPC) nanosheet composites as anode materials for both Li- (LIB) and Na-ion battery (SIB). An inexpensive oleylamine (OA) is introduced to not only serve as a hinder the stacking of MoS2 nanosheets but also to provide a conductive carbon, allowing large scale production. In addition, a SiO2 template is adopted to direct the growth of both carbon and MoS2 nanosheets, resulting in the formation of hierarchical porous structures with interconnected networks. Due to these unique features, the as-obtained MHPC shows substantial reversible capacity and very long cycling performance when used as an anode material for LIBs and SIBs, even at high current density. Indeed, this material delivers reversible capacities of 732 and 280 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 A g(-1) in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The results suggest that these MHPC composites also have tremendous potential for applications in other fields.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive study is conducted on hard carbon (HC) series samples by tuning the graphitic local microstructures systematically as an anode for SIBs in both carbonate- (CBE) and glyme-based electrolytes (GBE). The results reveal more detailed charge storage characters of HCs on the LVP section. 1) The LVP capacity is closely related to the prismatic surface area to the basal plane as well as the bulk density, regardless of electrolyte systems. 2) The glyme-sodium ion complex can facilitate sodium ion delivery into the internal closed pores of the HCs along with not well-ordered graphitic structures. 3) The glyme-mediated sodium ion-storage behavior causes significant decreases in both surface film resistance and charge transfer resistance, leading to enhanced rate capability. 4) The LVP originates from the formation of pseudo-metallic sodium nanoclusters, which are the same in a CBE and GBE. These results provide insight into the sodium ion-storage behaviors of HCs, particularly on the interrelationship between graphitic local microstructures and electrolyte systems. In addition, a high-performance HC anode with a plateau capacity of ≈300 mA h g-1 is designed based on the information, and its workability is demonstrated in a full-cell SIB device.",

        "title": "Regulating the “core-shell” microstructure of hard carbon through sodium hydroxide activation for achieving high-capacity SIBs anode",
        "abstract": "Pore structure engineering has been acknowledged as suitable approach to creating active sites and enhancing ion transport capabilities of hard carbon anodes. However, conventional porous carbon materials exhibit high BET and surface defects. Additionally, the sodium storage mechanism predominantly occurs in the slope region. This contradicts practical application requirements because the capacity of the plateau region is crucial for determining the actual capacity of batteries. In our work, we prepared a novel “core-shell” carbon framework (CNA1200). Introducing closed pores and carboxyl groups into coal-based carbon materials to enhance its sodium storage performance. The closed pore structure dominates in the “core” structure, which is attributed to the timely removal of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to prevent further formation of active carbon structure. The presence of closed pores is beneficial for increasing sodium ion storage in the low-voltage plateau region. And the “shell” structure originates from coal tar pitch, it not only uniformly connects hard carbon particles together to improve cycling stability, but is also rich in carboxyl groups to enhance the reversible sodium storage performance in slope region. CNA1200 has excellent electrochemical performance, it exhibits a specific capacity of 335.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1 with ICE = 51.53 %. In addition, CNA1200 has outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 91.8 % even when cycling over 200 times. When CNA1200 is used as anode paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, it demonstrates a capacity of 109.54 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and capacity retention of 94.64 % at 0.5 C. This work provides valuable methods for regulating the structure of sodium-ion battery (SIBs) anode and enhances the potential for commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted widespread attention as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity, various bonding types, metallic characteristics, and low cost. However, their sluggish reaction kinetics and inferior capacity decay severely hamper their application. Designing TMPs with novel nano/microstructures effectively overcomes these challenges. Herein, Nickel Phosphide/Copper Phosphide embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni2P/Cu3P@NC) was synthesized by carbonization and phosphidation process. When used as an SIB anode, Ni2P/Cu3P@NC exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 530 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.2 A/g, 428 mAh/g after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A/g, and good rate capability (334 mAh/g at 2.0 A/g). Ex-situ XRD combined with in-situ EIS confirm the irreversible conversion mechanism. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that the heterointerface formed between Ni2P and Cu3P serves as a channel for fast ion delivery and promotes Na+ storage performance.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal borides, named as MBenes, are receiving increasing attention in energy storage fields due to their structure-and-composition diversities and high electrical conductivities. Expanding the family of hexagonal MBenes to non-transition metal borides, we report two hexagonal IIA metal M2B2-typed MBenes and demonstrate the feasibility of exfoliation and application as anode materials for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and Na-ion batteries (SIBs) using ab initio calculations. The predicted 2D Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 monolayers exhibit robust thermal and mechanical stabilities, inherent metallic properties, electrical conductivities, and excellent electrode performance. The outstanding theoretical specific capacities of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 for Li/Na ions reach up to 764/527 and 859/527 mA h g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the average open-circuit voltages (OCVs) of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 range from 0.275 to 0.395 V, indicating their suitability for anode materials. Additionally, the low diffusion energy barriers of Mg2B2 and Ca2B2 for Li/Na ions at delithiated/desodiated states (27/14 and 16/12 meV) and lithiated/sodiated states (187/58 and 52/34 meV) illustrate their excellent charge-discharge capabilities. These intriguing findings demonstrate the superior performance of the predicted IIA metal boride monolayers as promising anode materials for LIBs and SIBs and break through the limitations of transition metal MBenes as anode materials in terms of overall performance. Our study opens the door to the application of the main group metal MBenes in ion energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Graphite is known as the most successful anode material found for Li‐ion batteries. However, unfortunately, graphite delivers an ordinary capacity as anode material for the next‐generation Na‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to difficulties in intercalating larger Na+ ions in between the layers of graphene due to incompatible d‐spacing. The methodologies investigated in deriving suitable anode structures for SIBs are found to be either less effective, expensive, or rather too complex in most cases. Herein, a simple strategy is introduced to derive suitable anode materials for SIBs through a modified electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. The introduced exfoliation process is able to graft Fe3O4 (magnetite) on graphite allowing the structure to expand, supporting a swift intercalation and deintercalation of Na ions. The synthesized magnetite‐functionalized graphene nanoplatelets are identified as a well‐suited anode material for SIBs, with its efficient intercalation obtained through the expanded interlayer spacing of 3.9 Å and the surface redox pseudocapacitive activity attained through the surface‐grafted magnetite. The effectiveness of the synthesized is reflected in the obtained high discharge capacitance of 420 mAh g−1, with 96% capacitive retention over 1000 cycles. The study opens new opportunities for prospective low‐cost anode materials for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "TiO2 anatase has emerged as a promising anode for Na-ion batteries (SIBs). However, widespread use of this anode is severely limited by a series of factors that need to be identified and understood to further improve their electrochemical response. Here, we have taken benefit from the versatility of a self-assembly seeding-assisted method to obtain a variety of uniform high-surface-area undoped TiO2 anatase nanostructures. Electrodes built from these uniform nanostructures in combination with a safe ionic liquid electrolyte have allowed a systematic study on some of the factors that determine the electrochemical activity of Na-ion anatase anodes. Interestingly, the inherent low penetrability of the ionic liquid electrolyte has resulted in an unexpected asset to clarify large differences in Na+ uptake by different nanostructures. Basically, solid electrolyte interface (SEI) effects were maximized and therefore clearly separated from electrochemical reactions strictly associated with the anatase anode. Thus, for electrodes built from nanostructures that preserved their initial conformation after cycling, the first discharge showed Na+ uptakes well-beyond those of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple. This large uptake has been associated with an apparent reversible reaction that operates below ca. 0.5–0.7 V and an irreversible mechanism that operates at lower voltages (ca. 0.3 V). However, for electrodes built from nanostructures that favored SEI formation, the irreversible reaction associated with the plateau at ca. 0.3 V was not observed during the first discharge. In accordance, the total Na+ uptake did not reach values beyond those of the corresponding Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple. Irreversibility, in this case, is associated with SEI formation. Our results also establish the strong effect that size at different scale levels has in the electrochemical response of anatase anodes for SIBs (changes from ca. 6 to 11 nm in crystal sizes and from 50 to 80 in nanostructure sizes led to pronounced differences). This result emphasizes that any conclusions on mechanistic studies other than size effects must be done under strict control on size at various scales (size as a strict control variable at crystal level and nanostructure or in more general terms aggregate scale levels). Finally, we have found that at 30 and 60 °C the performance of the best of the electrodes, with the low-flammable and low-volatile ionic liquid electrolyte, is comparable to that of similar nanostructures immersed in their Li-ion electrolyte counterparts. This result is promising, as in stationary applications where SIBs could replace Li-ion batteries, large accumulation of storage components imposes more strict safety criteria. Basically, power criteria can be relaxed in response to more strict safety criteria.",

In practical applications, it is crucial to synthesize the high-capacity/reversible nanostructured Fe_2GeS_4-based negative electrodes through an easily executable method. In this study, a two-step synthesis method to prepare nanostructured Fe_2GeS_4 anchored on graphite (Fe_2GeS_4/G-15%) was employed: the commercial FeS, S, and Ge powders were mixed and heated, and then graphite was added for ball milling. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that there is a strong interaction between the nanostructured Fe_2GeS_4 powder and the exfoliated graphite, forming a highly stable nanocomposite material, which is beneficial for improving the reversible charge-discharge performance of the material. When used as a negative electrode material for SIBs, the prepared Fe_2GeS_4/G-15% exhibited a capacity of 665.5 mAh g^−1 during the second cycle at 0.1 A g^−1 and could maintain a capacity of 519 mAh g^−1 even after the 60th cycle.

This liquid is more safe in operation and penetrates through the electrode more homogeneously than sodium metal. This method is easily extended to other titanium-based materials, and provides a possibility for large industrial applications.",

        "title": "Constructing High‐Content Sb Atomic Clusters and Robust Sb─O─C Bond in Sb/C Composites for Ultrahigh Rate and Long‐Term Sodium Storage",
        "abstract": "Constructing Sb atomic clusters with obvious size effect in Sb/C composites has great potential for boosting electrochemical reactivity toward ultrahigh rate and long‐term sodium storage. However, how to balance the contradiction between ultra‐small size of Sb atomic clusters and high loading in a specific Sb/C composite is an unprecedented challenge. Here, a facile in situ vaporization‐reduction strategy is presented for preparing Sb atomic clusters@N, S co‐doped carbon networks (Sb ACs@NSC). Featuring the high content of Sb atomic clusters (45.30 wt%, ICP) with superior electrochemical activity, robust Sb─O─C bond and N, S co‐doped conductive carbon matrix, the Sb ACs@NSC electrode possessed ultrafast electrochemical kinetics and impressive long‐term cycling stability for providing unprecedented rate capability of 245.7 mAh g−1 at ultrahigh rate of 80 A g−1 and maintaining highlighted capacity of 306.7 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles under 10 A g−1, outperforming all reported Sb‐based materials for SIBs. The DFT calculations further revealed that the Sb─O─C bond and N, S co‐doped carbon matrix are beneficial for stable adsorption capabilities and fast electrochemical kinetics of Na+. The designing compromised dense Sb atomic clusters and powerful interface bond will light on developing advanced atomic materials for energy storage and conversion.",

        "title": "A comprehensive study of the multiple effects of Y/Al substitution on O3-type NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 with improved cycling stability and rate capability for Na-ion battery applications.",
        "abstract": "O3-NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 layered oxide has attracted increasing attention as one of the most promising materials for Na-ion battery applications due to air stability and environmental friendliness, but the complex phase transitions and inferior cycling stability are extremely challenging to overcome. Cation substitution has been widely used to stabilize crystal structures and improve electrochemical performance for SIBs. Based on past experimental results, it was discovered that the transition metal-oxygen bond energy of the introduced dopant is an important factor for optimizing electrochemical performance. In this study, we validated our hypothesis that yttrium (Y)-which possesses high bond energy for oxygen-is most likely to be an ideal doping element by conducting a comparative study of substituting Mn in O3-NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 layered oxide with aluminum (Al) and Y through elemental doping. As hypothesized, the electrochemical properties of NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 have increased markedly by introducing a small amount of Y and Al, and the Y-doped materials showed superior rate performance and cycling stability due to enhanced Na+ diffusion reaction kinetics and layered structure stability. Furthermore, the substitution of Y for Mn can improve thermal stability and alleviate phase transformations. The improvement mechanism of Y substitution can be attributed to a larger d-spacing and stronger metal-oxygen bond. These results suggest that structural modulation is an effective strategy to reinforce electrochemical properties of layered oxides and provides some guidance about designing promising electrode materials.",
