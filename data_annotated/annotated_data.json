        "Embedding the functional nanostructures into a lightweight nanocarbon framework is very promising for developing high performance advanced electrodes for rechargeable batteries. Here, to realize workable capacity, core-shell (FeSe2 /C) nanostructures are embedded into carbon nanotube (CNT) framework via a facile wet-chemistry approach accompanied by thermally induced selenization. The CNT framework offers 3D continuous routes for electronic/ionic transfer, while macropores provide adequate space for high mass loading of FeSe2 /C. However, the carbon shell not only creates a solid electronic link among CNTs and FeSe2 but also improves the diffusivity of sodium ions into FeSe2 , as well as acts as a buffer cushion to accommodate the volume variations. These unique structural features of CNT/FeSe2 /C make it an excellent host for sodium storage with a capacity retention of 546 mAh g-1 even after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 . Moreover, areal and volumetric capacities of 5.06 mAh cm-2 and 158 mAh cm-3 are also achieved at high mass loading 16.9 mg cm-2 , respectively. The high performance of multi-benefited engineered structure makes it a potential candidate for secondary ion batteries, while its easy synthesis makes it extendable to further complex structures with other morphologies (such as nanorods, nanowires, etc.) to meet the high energy demands.",
        "Layered manganese-based cathode materials are of great interest due to their high specific capacities for sodium ion batteries. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and the inevitable phase transition are detrimental for achieving considerable cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, a P2-type manganese oxide nanoplate cathode material modified by Mo-substitution with oriented stacking structure and exposed {010} active facets is reported. The manganese oxide nanoplate cathode yields remarkable capacity retention of 87.8% after 1200 cycles at 10C (2000 mA g-1). The specific power density is estimated as high as 530 W Kg-1 with a specific discharge capacity 143.9 mA h g-1 at 1C and 89.6% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances can be attributed to the efficient chemical modification and the unique structural features of the present manganese oxide nanoplate. Mo-modification can endow manganese oxide cathode with enlarged lattice space and average oxidation state and thus favorable Na+ diffusion to inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and improve the structure stability, thereby achieving an extremely long cycling life. Multilayer oriented stacking nanoplate structure with exposed {010} active facets is also beneficial for providing more surface active sites and shortening the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better rate capability.",
        "We report a new sodium-ion battery formed by coupling a NaFePO(4) cathode and a nanocomposite tin-carbon (Sn-C) sodium-alloying anode. The NaFePO(4) cathode is obtained by Li-Na conversion of a LiFePO(4) cathode directly in the full cell employing the Sn-C anode and a sodium-ion electrolyte. The results show that the unique approach adopted here is capable of successfully and efficiently converting LiFePO(4) into NaFePO(4) in a sodium-ion battery operating at a voltage of 3 V, with a maximum reversible capacity of 150 mAh g(-1), high reversibility, and high rate capability.",
        "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application.",
        "Heterostructure engineering is one of the most promising modification strategies toward improving sluggish kinetics for the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a systemic investigation on the different types of heterostructure interfaces' effects of discharging products (Na2O, Na2S, Na2Se) on the rate performance. First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant. The experimental evidence confirms that the metal sulfide/metal selenide (SnS/SnSe2) hierarchical anode exhibits outstanding rate performance, where the normalized capacity at 10 A g-1 compared to 0.1 A g-1 is 45.6%. The proposed design strategy in this work is helpful to design high rate performance anodes for advanced battery systems.",
        "As a promising cathode material of sodium-ion battery, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) possesses a theoretically high capacity and working voltage to realize high energy storage density. However, it still suffers from poor cycling stability mainly incurred by the undesirable P2-O2 phase transition. Herein, the electrochemically active Fe3+ ions are introduced into the lattice of NNMO, forming Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3- xFe xO2 ( x = 0, 1/24, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6) to effectively stabilize the P2-type crystalline structure. In such Fe-substituted materials, both Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples take part in the redox reactions, and the P2-O2 phase transition is well restrained during cycling, as verified by ex situ X-ray diffraction. As a result, the optimized Na2/3Ni1/3Mn7/12Fe1/12O2 (1/12-NNMF) has a long-term cycling stability with the fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 300 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the 1/12-NNMF delivers excellent rate capabilities (65 mA h g-1 at 25 C) and superior low-temperature performance (the capacity retention of 94% at -25 °C after 80 cycles) owing to the enhanced Na diffusion upon Fe doping, which is deduced by the studies of electrode kinetics. More significantly, the 1/12-NNMF also displays remarkable sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with an LS-Sb@G anode, thus implying the possibility of their practical application.",
        "Graphene‐based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene‐based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore‐forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in‐plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene‐based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene‐based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.",
        "Heteroatom incorporation can effectively suppress the phase transition of layered sodium-ion battery cathode, but heteroatom behaviors during operating conditions are not completely understood at the atomic scale. Here, density functional theory calculations are combined with experiments to explore the mitigation behavior of Mg dopant and its mechanisms under operating conditions in P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. The void formed by Na extraction will pump some Mg dopants into Na layers from TM layers, and the collective diffusion of more than one Mg ion most likely occurs when the Mg content is relatively high in the TM layer, finally aggregating to form Mg-enrich regions (i.e., Mg segregation) apart from Ni vacancies. The void-pump-effect-induced Mg segregation effectively suppresses the P2-O2 phase transition owing to the stronger Mg-O electrostatic attraction that enhances the integrate of two adjacent oxygen layers and prevents the crack growth by mitigating the lattice volume variation under high-voltage cycling. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of heteroatom mitigation behavior in layered cathodes at the atomic level for next-generation energy storage technologies.",
        "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as a prime candidate for large-scale energy storage, and developing high performance anode materials is one of the main challenges for advanced SIBs. Novel structured Sn-MoS2 -C@C microspheres, in which Sn nanoparticles are evenly embedded in MoS2 nanosheets and a thin carbon film is homogenously engineered over the microspheres, have been fabricated by the hydrothermal method. The Sn-MoS2 -C@C microspheres demonstrate an excellent Na-storage performance as an anode of SIBs and deliver a high reversible charge capacity (580.3 mAh g-1 at 0.05 Ag-1 ) and rate capacity (580.3, 373, 326, 285.2, and 181.9 mAh g-1 at 0.05, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Ag-1 , respectively). A high charge specific capacity of 245 mAh g-1 can still be achieved after 2750 cycles at 2 Ag-1 , indicating an outstanding cycling performance. The high capacity and long-term stability make Sn-MoS2 -C@C composite a very promising anode material for SIBs.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) show great application prospect in large-scale energy storage. P2-type manganese-based layered oxides have received special attention by virtue of their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environment friendliness. However, the water sensitivity and limited cycling stability hinder their application, especially the underlying mechanisms for the above two issues are still unclear. In this work, copper substitution is used to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and affect the corresponding lattice structure. The water sensitivity and charge compensation mechanism were carefully investigated. Results demonstrate that water sensitivity of the electrode is related to the order of Na+/vacancy in the Na interlayers since water molecules are more easily inserted into the charged state electrodes, but the tendency for the uptake water does not increase with Na+ extraction. Furthermore, Mn2+ forms on the surface of electrodes in the initial discharge process, and the redox reaction in the bulk are predominantly between Mn3+ and Mn4+. Cu-substituted in TM layer affects the arrangement of Na+/vacancy and suppresses the Mn2+ formation on the Na0.7Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 electrode that results in superior air stability and better storage properties.",
        "Combining the advantages of dual-ion batteries (DIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), we herein develop a superior sodium-based dual-ion battery (Na-DIB) based on the PTCDA organic anode and ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte. The system shows the highest specific discharge capacity of 177 mAh g-1 at 0.5C and excellent capacity retention over 100% at 2C after 200 cycles. Notably, even at an ultrahigh rate of 20C, the battery still maintains a considerable capacity of 60 mAh g-1 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) close to 100 and 94% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the self-discharge of the system has been investigated and shown to have an extremely low value of 0.18% h-1. Consequently, this work presents an excellent Na-DIB system, which could be a promising candidate for large-scale applications.",
        "The low-cost and scalable sodium ion (Na-ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium-ion batteries. To compensate the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high-voltage anode-free configuration composing a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high-voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high-voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode-free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg-1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250 cycles) for 4.0 V-class anode-free cells and a substantially reduced cost in a sustainable way.",
        "Hard carbon is currently considered the most promising anode candidate for room temperature sodium ion batteries because of its relatively high capacity, low cost, and good scalability. In this work, switchgrass as a biomass example was carbonized under an ultrahigh temperature, 2050 °C, induced by Joule heating to create hard carbon anodes for sodium ion batteries. Switchgrass derived carbon materials intrinsically inherit its three-dimensional porous hierarchical architecture, with an average interlayer spacing of 0.376 nm. The larger interlayer spacing than that of graphite allows for the significant Na ion storage performance. Compared to the sample carbonized under 1000 °C, switchgrass derived carbon at 2050 °C induced an improved initial Coulombic efficiency. Additionally, excellent rate capability and superior cycling performance are demonstrated for the switchgrass derived carbon due to the unique high temperature treatment.",
        "In this article, we report NiSe2 nanooctahedra as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). They exhibit outstanding long-term cyclic stability (313 mAh/g after 4000 cycles at 5 A/g) and excellent high-rate capability (175 mAh/g at 20 A/g). Besides, the initial Coulombic efficiency of NiSe2 is also very impressive (over 90%). Such remarkable performances are attributed to good conductivity, structural stability, and the pseudocapacitive behavior of the NiSe2. Furthermore, the sodium ion storage mechanism of NiSe2 is first investigated by in situ XRD and ex situ XRD. These highlights give NiSe2 a competitive strength for rechargeable SIBs.",
        "The solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) film in a sodium-ion battery is closely related to capacity fading and cycling stability of the battery. However, there are few studies on the SEI film of sodium-ion batteries and the mechanism of SEI film formation is unclear. The mechanism for the reduction of ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), vinylene carbonate (VC), ethylene sulfite (ES), 1,3-propylene sulfite (PS), and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC) is studied by DFT. The reaction activation energies, Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, and structures of the transition states are calculated. It is indicated that VC, ES, and PS additives in the electrolyte are all easier to form organic components in the anode SEI film by one-electron reduction. The priority of one-electron reduction to produce organic SEI components is in the order of VC>PC>EC; two-electron reduction to produce the inorganic Na2 CO3 component is different and follows the order of EC>PC>VC. Two-electron reduction for sulfites ES and PS to form inorganic Na2 SO3 is harder than that of carbonate ester reduction. It is also suggested that the one- and two-electron reductive decomposition pathway for FEC is more feasible to produce inorganic NaF components.",
        "MnO2 is shown for the first time to be electrochemically active as a conversion anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Space-confined ultrafine (UF)-MnO2, with an average crystal size of 4 nm, synthesized using a porous silicon dioxide templated hydrothermal process exhibits a high reversible sodiation capacity of 567 mA h g(-1), in contrast to the negligible activity shown by the aggregates of larger (14 nm) MnO2 nanocrystallites. The remarkably enhanced sodiation activity of the UF-MnO2 is attributable to its greatly reduced crystal size, which facilitates diffusion of Na ions, along with high surface energy arising from extensive heterogeneous interfacial bonding with the SiO2 surrounding. The UF-MnO2 anode exhibits an exceptional rate and cycle performance, exhibiting >70% capacity retention after 500 cycles. In operando synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structural analysis reveals combined charge-storage mechanisms involving conversion reaction between Mn(III) and Mn(II) oxides, Mn(III)-O1.5 + Na(+) + e(-)- ↔ 1/2Na2O + Mn(II)-O, and non-Mn-centered redox reactions. The finding suggests a new strategy for \"activating\" the potential electrochemical electrode materials that appear inactive in the bulk form.",
        "Sodium (Na) ion batteries (SIBs) promise low‐cost energy storage systems but are still restricted by insufficient energy density. Introducing oxygen (O) redox into the design of the Na‐storage cathode is presently considered an effective avenue to generate extra capacity in solving the energy density bottleneck. The succeeding issues are how to overcome the irreversible electrochemical behavior accompanied by O release. Meanwhile, the O redox chemistry and subsequent structural evolution remain ambiguous so far. Here, we deliberate on the O redox mechanism in Na‐storage transition metal oxides. Challenges associated with the reaction irreversibility and structural collapse are summarized by virtue of the advanced characterization techniques. Beyond that, strategies that potentially enhance the electrochemical properties of O redox and future research perspectives on exploring useable O redox cathode materials are outlined.",
        "Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium-ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na-free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.",
        "Tin disulfide (SnS2) has emerged as a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs) due to its unique layered structure, high theoretical capacity, and low cost. Conventional SnS2 nanomaterials are normally synthesized using hydrothermal method, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale up for mass production. In this study, we develop a simple solid-state reaction method, in which the carbon-coated SnS2 (SnS2/C) anode materials were synthesized by annealing metallic Sn, sulfur powder, and polyacrylonitrile in a sealed vacuum glass tube. The SnS2/C nanospheres with unique layered structure exhibit a high reversible capacity of 660 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) and maintain at 570 mAh g(-1) for 100 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.14% per cycle, demonstrating one of the best cycling performances in all reported SnS2/C anodes for NIBs to date. The superior cycling stability of SnS2/C electrode is attributed to the stable nanosphere morphology and structural integrity during charge/discharge cycles as evidenced by ex situ characterization.",
        "High gravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density energy storage devices are highly desirable due to the rapid development of electric vehicles, and portable and wearable electronic equipment. Electrospinning is a promising technology for preparing freestanding electrodes with high gravimetric and volumetric energy density. However, the energy density of the traditional electrospun electrodes is restricted by the low mass loading of active materials (e.g. 20%-30 wt%). Herein, a biomimetic strategy inspired by the phenomenon of the sticky spider web is demonstrated as a high performance anode, which simultaneously improves the gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Freestanding carbon nanofiber (CNF) membranes containing over 50 wt% of bismuth were prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. Membranes consisting of CNF network structures bonded tightly with active Bi cluster materials, resulting in excellent mechanical protection and a fast charge transport path, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. The composite membrane delivers high reversible capacity (483 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 200 cycles) and high rate performance (242 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1) as a lithium-ion battery anode. For use as a sodium ion battery, the composite membrane also shows a high reversible specific capacity of 346 mA h g-1 and outstanding cycling performance (186 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 after 100 cycles). This work offers a simple, low cost and eco-friendly method for fabricating free-standing and binder-free composite electrodes with high loading used in LIBs and SIBs.",
        "A Na2Ti3O7 nanotube-assembled three-dimensional spider-web architecture is synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The self-similar network architecture exhibits an excellent performance as an anode for a room temperature sodium ion battery without any additives (e.g. binder, conducting agent) for the first time.",
        "Single‐layered MoS2 is a promising anode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) due to its high capacity and isotropic ion transport paths. However, the low intrinsic conductivity and easy‐agglomerated feature hamper its applications. Here, a charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy that Co2+ replaces Mo4+ in the doping form to endow MoS2 layers with negative charges, thus inducing electrostatic repulsion, together with the insertion of gaseous groups, to drive interlayer expansion which once breaks the confinement of interlayer van der Waals force, single‐layered MoS2 is obtained and uniformly dispersed into carbon matrix arising from the transformation of carbonaceous gaseous groups under high vapor pressure, is proposed. Co atom doping helps enhance the intrinsic conductivity of single‐layered MoS2. Carbon matrix effectively prevents agglomeration of single‐layered MoS2. The doped Co atoms can be fully transformed into ultrasmall Co nanoparticles during conversion reaction, which enables strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance and thus significantly boosts ion transport and storage. Consequently, the prepared material delivers superb Li/Na/K‐ion storage performances, which are best in the reported MoS2‐based anodes. The proposed charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy provides a novel perspective for preparing single‐layered MoS2, which shows huge potential for energy storage.",
        "The phase transition and lattice parameter evolution of O3 structure commonly occurs in O3-type sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes, which might enlarge the voltage hysteresis and lower the energy efficiency. Given that the cost is one of the issues discouraging the application of SIBs in large-scale energy storage, here we focus on Co/Ni-free NaxCu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 (x = 0.8, 0.85, 0.9) and propose a convenient strategy to reduce the voltage hysteresis. It is found that when the Na content is 0.8, the highest energy efficiency of 95.4% after activation is achieved (2.5-4.0 V, 50 mA g-1, the 50th cycle), in addition to a satisfactory capacity retention (about 0.056% decay per cycle). The further characterizations reveal that Na0.8Cu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 owns a gentle O3-P3 phase transition process and does not undergo O3 phase lattice parameter evolution. The key point lies in the attainability of the O3/P3 composite of the material. This work will provide a simple strategy for the rational design of O3-type cathodes with a high energy efficiency and might offer inspiration to search for layered oxides with a higher O3/P3 critical Na content through element adjustments.",
        "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted wide attention because of their prospect on grid-scale electrical regulation and cost-effectiveness of sodium. In this regard, iron oxides (FeOx) are considered as one of the most promising anode candidates due to its high theoretical capacity and low cost. Unfortunately, the utilization of FeOx anodes suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and significant lattice variation, causing insufficient rate performance and fast capacity degradation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In this study, Mn ions are incorporated through interstitial sites into Fe3O4 lattice to form the Mn-incorporated Fe3O4/graphene (M-Fe3O4/G) composites through a facile hydrothermal method. Confirmed by the XRD Rietveld refinement and the first principle calculation, Mn occupation into the body structure can effectively condense the electron density around Fermi lever and thus contributes to the increased electrical conductivity and improved electrochemical properties. Accordingly, the M0.1Fe2.9O4/G composite demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 439.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 over 200 cycles. Even at a high current density of 1 A g-1, the M-Fe3O4/G composites remain stable for over 1200 cycles, delivering a capacity of 210 mAh g-1. Coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3-type cathode, the Mn incorporated Fe3O4/G composites demonstrate a good suitability in full SIBs (161.2 mAh g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles). The regulation of Mn ions in Fe3O4 lattice provides insights on the optimization of metal oxides anode candidates for their application in SIBs.",
        "Red phosphorus (P) has attracted intense attention as promising anode material for high‐energy density sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs), owing to its high sodium storage theoretical capacity (2595 mAh g−1). Nevertheless, natural insulating property and large volume variation of red P during cycling result in extremely low electrochemical activity, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, the authors demonstrate a rational strategy to improve sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) ‐derived nitrogen‐doped microporous carbon matrix (denoted as P@N‐MPC). When used as anode for NIBs, the P@N‐MPC composite displays a high reversible specific capacity of ≈600 mAh g−1 at 0.15 A g−1 and improved rate capacity (≈450 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.02% per cycle). The superior sodium storage performance of the P@N‐MPC is mainly attributed to the novel structure. The N‐doped porous carbon with sub‐1 nm micropore facilitates the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and improves the conductivity of the encapsulated red P. Furthermore, the porous carbon matrix can buffer the volume change of red P during repeat sodiation/desodiation process, keeping the structure intact after long cycle life.",
        "Sodium ion batteries (NIB, NAB, SIB) are attracting interest as a potentially lower cost alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIB), with readily available and geographically democratic reserves of the metal. Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture.",
        "Cellulose is a promising natural bio-macromolecule due to its abundance, renewability and low cost. Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles. The excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability indicate MrGO-CNF a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "Present day lithium ion batteries face challenges regarding the sustainability, cost, and natural resource availability of their components. Sodium has been shown to be a complementary energy storage material, providing usable volumetric energy density. In designing sodium ion batteries (SIBs), hard carbon is used at the anode in place of graphite, due to the necessary micro domain structure needed to store sodium ions. Coal char is a low cost material and viable source of hard carbon. The use of coal char in SIBs also provides a high value, secondary use pathway for the abundant char component of coal.\n In this work, flash pyrolyzation is explored as a novel approach for coal char synthesis for SIB anodes using a Utah local bituminous coal. During flash pyrolyzation, char is heated in a drop-tube furnace at 1000 oC/s vs. the traditional slow pyrolyzation approach where char is heated at 20 oC/min. Flash pyrolyzed (FP) char has a surface structure that is vastly different in comparison to the slow pyrolyzed (SP) char (Figure 1.), larger d-spacing (FP d-spacing = 0.379 nm, SP d-spacing = 0.364 nm) and a smaller closed micropore diameter (FP micropore = 1.52 nm, SP micropore = 1.91 nm), as concluded from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, respectively.\n The SIB performance of FP char vs. SP char is tested and compared in ether-based and ester-based electrolytes. FP char performs better as a SIB anode than SP char in both electrolytes. Additionally, both char anodes achieve higher reversible capacity and better initial coulombic efficiencies (ICE) in an ether-based vs. ester-based electrolyte. When FP char is combined with an ether-based electrolyte, a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh/g is achieved, whereas a SP char with an ester-based electrolyte cell has a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 72.5 mAh/g, when both cells are cycled at 50 mA/g (sodium metal half-cells). FP ether cells also perform with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 64%, but SP ester cells only show an ICE value of 52%. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the FP cells is attributed to differences in surface/bulk structure due to the high heating rate. The improvement in char anode performance in ether-based cells is likely due to the formation of a thinner solid-electrolyte interphase and/or improved sodiation due to an ether-based electrolyte.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",
        "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",
        "Engineering of 3D graphene/metal composites with ultrasmall sized metal and robust metal–graphene interfacial interaction for energy storage application is still a challenge and rarely reported. In this work, a facile top‐down strategy is developed for the preparation of SnSb‐in‐plane nanoconfined 3D N‐doped porous graphene networks for sodium ion battery anodes, which are composed of several tens of interconnected empty N‐graphene boxes in‐plane firmly embedded with ultrasmall SnSb nanocrystals. The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations. Moreover, this top‐down strategy can enable new paths to the low‐cost and high‐yield synthesis of 3D graphene/metal composites for applications in energy‐related fields and beyond.",
        "P2-type layered oxides based on the elements Fe and Mn have attracted great interest as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathode materials owing to their inexpensive metal constituents and high specific capacity. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

        "As an alternative system of rechargeable lithium ion batteries, sodium ion batteries revitalize researchers' interest due to the low cost, abundant sodium resources, and similar storage mechanism to lithium ion batteries. VS4 has emerged as a promising anode material for SIBs due to low cost and its unique linear chains structure that can offer potential sites for sodium storage. Herein, we present the growth of VS4 on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as SIBs anode for the first time. The VS4/rGO anode exhibits promising performance in SIBs. It delivers a reversible capacity of 362 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and a good rate performance. We also investigate the sodium storage behavior of the VS4/rGO. Different than most transition metal sulfides, the VS4/rGO composite experiences a three-step separation mechanism during the sodiation process (VS4 to metallic V and Na2S, then the electrochemical mechanism is akin to Na-S). The VS4/rGO composite proves to be a promising material for rechargeable SIBs.",
        "Hard carbon (HC) is an attractive anode material for low cost and high energy density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), however, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) limits its practical battery application. To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process. More importantly, this presodiation reaction is very mild, highly eﬃcient and can be widely extended to a variety of Na-storage materials, offering a new route to develop high performance Na-storage materials for practical battery applications.",
        "Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been taken much attention for various applications, such as catalyst, energy storage, and electronics. However, the lack of effective exfoliation methods for obtaining 2D materials in a large quantity has been one of the technical barriers for the real applications. We report a facile liquid-phase exfoliation method to improve the exfoliation efficiency for single-layer MoS2 sheets in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) with a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) assistant. The concentration of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets was greatly improved compared to that achieved with conventional liquid-phase exfoliation methods using NMP solvent. We demonstrate stable operation of sodium-ion battery by using the exfoliated MoS2 and MoS2-rGO composite as anode materials.",
        "Sodium resources are inexpensive and abundant, and hence, sodium-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).",
        "To improve lithium and sodium ion battery technology, it is imperative to understand how the properties of the different components are controlled by their chemical structures. Operando structural studies give us some of the most useful information for understanding how batteries work, but it remains difficult to separate out the contributions of the various components of a battery stack (e.g., electrodes, current collectors, electrolyte, and binders) and examine specific materials. We have used operando X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) to study specific components of an essentially unmodified working cell and extract detailed, space-resolved structural information on both crystalline and amorphous phases that are present during cycling by Rietveld and pair distribution function (PDF) methods. We illustrate this method with the first detailed structural examination of the cycling of sodium in a phosphorus anode, revealing surprisingly different mechanisms for sodiation and desodiation in this promising, high-capacity anode system.",
        "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance.",

        "Emerging sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium‐ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion‐storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali‐ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best‐performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na‐ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172 W kg−1 at an energy density of 181.5 Wh kg−1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode). The Na‐ion pouch cell also shows stable ultralong‐term cycling (9000 h or 5142 cycles) and demonstrates the promising potential of such materials as sustainable, scalable anodes for beyond Li‐batteries.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for grid-level energy storage due to the high natural abundance of sodium and low material cost of sodium compounds. Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively. In a cycling performance test, after 500 deep cycles, the capacity of BP/rGO anodes stabilized at 1250 and 640 mAh/g at 1 and 40 A/g, respectively, which marks a significant performance improvement for sodium-ion battery anodes.",
        "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large‐scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high‐rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite‐type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+‐diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as‐synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well‐matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full‐cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of ≈10 kW kg−1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23 kW kg−1, an energy density of 58 Wh kg−1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high‐power SIB for large‐scale applications in the future.",
        "Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) possess ordered accessible nano-channels. When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.",
        "Pyrite (FeS2) has been considered as one of the most potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost, environmentally friendly features and high theoretical capacity. However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs. The results demonstrate the potential applications of FeS2/CNS in SIBs with low-cost, high power density and long cycling life.",
        "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries have been considered as one of the most promising types of batteries, beyond lithium-ion batteries, for large-scale energy storage applications. However, their deployment hinges on the development of new anode materials, since it has been shown that many important anode materials employed in lithium ion batteries, such as graphite and silicon, are inadequate for sodium-ion batteries. We have simply prepared novel SnS/C nanocomposites through a top-down approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Their electrochemical performance has been significantly improved when compared to bare SnS, especially in terms of cycling stability and rate capabilities. SnS/C nanocomposites exhibit excellent capacity retention, at various current rates, and deliver capacities as high as 400 mA h g−1 even at the high current density of 800 mA g−1 (2C). Ex situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and operando X-ray absorption near edge structure studies have been performed in order to unravel the reaction mechanism of the SnS/C nanocomposites.",
        "Antimony/carbon (Sb@C) microspheres are initially synthesized via a facile self-catalyzing solvothermal method, and their applicability as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries is investigated. The structural and morphological characterizations reveal that Sb@C microspheres are composed of Sb nanoparticles (∼20 nm) homogeneously encapsulated in the C matrix. The self-catalyzing solvothermal mechanism is verified through comparative experiments by using different raw materials. The as-prepared Sb@C microspheres exhibit superior sodium storage properties, demonstrating a reversible capacity of 640 mAh g(-1), excellent rate performance, and an extended cycling stability of 92.3% capacity retention over 300 cycles, making them promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "Hard carbon (HC) is the most promising candidate for sodium-ion battery anode materials. Several material properties such as intensity ratio of the Raman spectrum, lateral size of HC crystallite (La ), and interlayer distance (d002 ) have been discussed as factors affecting anode performance. However, these factors do not reflect the bulk property of the Na+ intercalation reaction directly, since Raman analysis has high surface sensitivity and La and d002 provide only one-dimensional crystalline information. Herein, it was proposed that the crystallite interlayer area (Ai ) defined using La , d002 , and stacking height (Lc ) governs Na+ intercalation behavior of various HCs. It was revealed that various wood-derived HCs exhibited the similar total capacity of approximately 250 mAh g-1 , whereas the Na+ intercalation capacity (Ci ) was proportional to Ai with the correlation coefficient of R2 =0.94. The evaluation factor of Ai was also adaptable to previous reports and strongly correlated with their Ci , indicating that Ai is more widely adaptable than the conventional evaluation methods.",
        "Sodium ion batteries possess several advantages for large-scale energy storage, such as low cost and enhanced safety. However, graphite or other anode materials are not satisfactory because the large radius of Na+ hinders their embedding and removal in the charge and discharge processes. Recently, a biphenylene network (BPN), a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has been synthesized. In this paper, we reveal the potential possibility of BPN as a Na storage material. The theoretical results indicate the advantages of BPN as a sodium battery anode. The maximum specific capacity (413 mA h g-1) is larger than that of the graphite-Li system (372 mA h g-1). With low Na+ diffusion barrier (<0.6 eV) and small volume expansion in the charging process (∼26%), BPN presents superiority to the graphite-Na system. Our findings show new insights into Na storage in BPN and provide guidance for the use of a BPN anode in sodium ion batteries.",

Moreover, large-area carbon membranes with low contact resistance are fabricated by simply stacking and carbonizing leaves, a promising strategy toward large-scale sodium-ion battery developments.",
        "Na-based layered transition metal oxides with an O3-type structure are considered promising cathodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, rapid capacity fading, and poor rate performance caused by serious structural changes and interfacial degradation hamper their use. In this study, a NaPO3 surface modified O3-type layered NaNi1/3 Fe1/3 Mn1/3 O2 cathode is synthesized, with improved high-voltage stability through protecting layer against acid attack, which is achieved by a solid-gas reaction between the cathode particles and gaseous P2 O5 . The NaPO3 nanolayer on the surface effectively stabilizes the crystal structure by inhibiting surface parasitic reactions and increasing the observed average voltage. Superior cyclic stability is exhibited by the surface-modified cathode (80.1% vs 63.6%) after 150 cycles at 1 C in the wide voltage range of 2.0 V-4.2 V (vs Na+ /Na). Moreover, benefiting from the inherent ionic conduction of NaPO3 , the surface-modified cathode presents excellent rate capability (103 mAh g-1  vs 60 mAh g-1 ) at 10 C. The outcome of this study demonstrates a practically relevant approach to develop high rate and durable sodium-ion battery technology.",
        "The utilization of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to enhance performance, but as yet it has rarely been reported. Taking the MoO(3-x) nanosheet anode as an example, for the first time we demonstrate the benefits of OVs on SIB performance. Moreover, the benefits at deep-discharge conditions can be further promoted by an ultrathin Al2O3 coating. A series of measurements show that the OVs increase the electric conductivity and Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and the promotion from ultrathin coating lies in the effective reduction of cycling-induced solid-electrolyte interphase. The coated nanosheets exhibited high reversible capacity and great rate capability with the capacities of 283.9 (50 mA g(-1)) and 179.3 mAh g(-1) (1 A g(-1)) after 100 cycles.

        "The further improvement of sodium ion battery requires the elucidation of the mechanisms pertain to reversibility, which allows the novel design of electrode structure. Here, through a hydrogel-embedding method, we are able to confine the growth of few-layer SnS2 nanosheets between nitrogen- and sulfur-doped carbon nanotube (NS-CNT) and amorphous carbon. The obtained carbon-sandwiched SnS2 nanosheets demonstrate excellent sodium storage properties. In operando small angle X-ray scattering combined with the ex situ X-ray absorption near edge spectra reveal that the redox reactions between SnS2/NS-CNT and sodium ion are highly reversible. On the contrary, the nanostructure evolution is found to be irreversible, in which the SnS2 nanosheets collapse, followed by the re-generation of SnS2 nanoparticles. This work provides operando insights into the chemical environment evolution and structure change of SnS2-based anodes, elucidating its reversible reaction mechanism, and illustrates the significance of engineered carbon support in ensuring the electrode structure stability.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), as one of the potential candidates for grid-scale energy storage systems, are required to tackle extreme weather conditions. However, the all-weather SIBs with a wide operation-temperature range are rarely reported. Herein, we propose a wide-temperature SIB, which involves a carbon-coated Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a Bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme-based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na + can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de-solvent process.  Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na + diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low-temperature behavior. Even at -70 °C, this battery still delivers 70.19% of the room-temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature up to 100 °C. These encourage results might shed light on the exploration of wide-temperature SIBs.",
        "Sodium is globally available, which makes a sodium-ion rechargeable battery preferable to a lithium-ion battery for large-scale storage of electrical energy, provided a host cathode for Na can be found that provides the necessary capacity, voltage, and cycle life at the prescribed charge/discharge rate. Low-cost hexacyanometallates are promising cathodes because of their ease of synthesis and rigid open framework that enables fast Na(+) insertion and extraction. Here we report an intriguing effect of interstitial H2O on the structure and electrochemical properties of sodium manganese(II) hexacyanoferrates(II) with the nominal composition Na2MnFe(CN)6·zH2O (Na2-δMnHFC). The newly discovered dehydrated Na2-δMnHFC phase exhibits superior electrochemical performance compared to other reported Na-ion cathode materials; it delivers at 3.5 V a reversible capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) in a sodium half cell and 140 mAh g(-1) in a full cell with a hard-carbon anode. At a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the half-cell capacity is 120 mAh g(-1), and at 0.7 C, the cell exhibits 75% capacity retention after 500 cycles.",
        "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",
        "Black phosphorus (BP) has recently aroused researchers' great interest as promising anode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), owing to its high theoretical capacity (2596 mAh g-1) and good electric conductivity (about 300 S m-1). However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles.",
        "To solve the problem of large volume change and low electronic conductivity of earth-abundant ilmenite used in rechargeable Na-ion batteries (SIBs), an anode of tiny ilmenite FeTiO3 nanoparticle embedded carbon nanotubes (FTO⊂CNTs) has been successfully proposed. By introducing a TiO2 shell on metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) nanorods by sol-gel deposition and subsequent solid-state annealing treatment of these core-shell Fe-MOF@TiO2, such well-defined FTO⊂CNTs are obtained. The achieved FTO⊂CNT electrode has several distinct advantages including a hollow interior in the hybrid nanostructure, fully encapsulated ultrasmall electroactive units, flexible conductive carbon matrix, and stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) of FTO in cycles. FTO⊂CNT electrodes present an excellent cycle stability (358.8 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1) and remarkable rate capability (201.8 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1) with a high Coulombic efficiency of approximately 99%. In addition, combined with the typical Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to constitute full SIBs, the assembled FTO⊂CNT//Na3V2(PO4)3 batteries are also demonstrated with superior rate capability and a long cycle life.",
        "Liquid plasma, produced by nanosecond pulses, provides an efficient and simple way to fabricate a nanocomposite architecture of Co3O4/CNTs from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and clusters of Co3O4 nanoparticles in deionized water. The crucial feature of the composite's structure is that Co3O4 nanoparticle clusters are uniformly dispersed and anchored to CNT networks in which Co3O4 guarantees high electrochemical reactivity towards sodium, and CNTs provide conductivity and stabilize the anode structure. We demonstrated that the Co3O4/CNT nanocomposite is capable of delivering a stable and high capacity of 403 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles where the sodium uptake/extract is confirmed in the way of reversible conversion reaction by adopting ex situ techniques. The rate capability of the composite is significantly improved and its reversible capacity is measured to be 212 mA h g(-1) at 1.6 A g(-1) and 190 mA h g(-1) at 3.2 A g(-1), respectively. Due to the simple synthesis technique with high electrochemical performance, Co3O4/CNT nanocomposites have great potential as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "The development of feasible, scalable, and environmentally-safe electrode materials that provide stable cycling performance are critical for success of beyond lithium rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. With respect to the sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes constituting of transition metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), poor cycle stability and fast capacity degradation, due to low electronic conductivity and dissolution of chemical species in the electrolyte, hinders use of these promising layered materials as SIB anodes. Herein we report chemical functionalization in MoS2 nanosheets with polymer-derived silicon oxycarbide or SiOC with the aim to preserve MoS2 from dissolution in the SIB organic electrolyte, without compromising its role in sodiation and desodiation processes. Our results suggest that a MoS2–SiOC composite electrode is effective in bringing improved cycle stability to sodium-ion cycling over neat MoS2 even after 100 cycles.",
        "It is of great importance to exploit electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with low cost, long life, and high-rate capability. However, achieving quick charge and high power density is still a major challenge for most SIBs electrodes because of the sluggish sodiation kinetics. Herein, uniform and mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres are synthesized via a facile one-step polyvinylpyrrolidone assisted method. By controlling the voltage window, the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres present excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs. It delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 692 mA h g-1 . The NiS2 anode also exhibits excellent high-rate capability (253 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ) and long-term cycling performance (319 mA h g-1 capacity remained even after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 ). A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. The impressive electrochemical performance reveals that the NiS2 offers great potential toward the development of next generation large scale energy storage.",
        "The emerging sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising candidates expected to complement lithium‐ion batteries and diversify the battery market. However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high‐rate performance and long‐cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1) and ultralong cycling life (>3000 circulations at 0.5 A g−1), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA‐based cathode materials.

        "All‐solid‐state sodium ion batteries (AS3iBs) are highly sought after for stationary energy storage systems due to their suitable safety and stability over a wide temperature range. Hard carbon (HC), which is low cost, exhibits a low redox potential, and a high capacity, is integral to achieve a practical large‐scale sodium‐ion battery. However, the energy density of the battery utilizing this anode material is hampered by its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, two strategies, namely i) additional pyrolysis and ii) presodiation by thermal decomposition of NaBH4, are explored to improve the ICE of pristine HC. Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations elucidate that the thermal treatment increases the Csp2 content in the HC structure, while the presodiation supplies the sodium to occupy the intrinsic irreversible sites. Consequently, presodiated HC exhibits an outstanding ICE (>99%) compared to the thermally treated (90%) or pristine HC (83%) in half‐cell configurations. More importantly, AS3iB using presodiated HC and NaCrO2 as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits a high ICE of 92% and an initial discharge energy density of 294Whkgcathode−1$294\\ {\\rm Wh}\\ {\\rm{kg}}_{{\\rm{cathode}}}^{ - 1}$ .",
        "High-power, long-life carbon-coated TiO2 microsphere electrodes were synthesized by a hydrothermal method for sodium ion batteries, and the electrochemical properties were evaluated as a function of carbon content. The carbon coating, introduced by sucrose addition, had an effect of suppressing the growth of the TiO2 primary crystallites during calcination. The carbon coated TiO2 (sucrose 20 wt % coated) electrode exhibited excellent cycle retention during 50 cycles (100%) and superior rate capability up to a 30 C rate at room temperature. This cell delivered a high discharge capacity of 155 mAh g(composite)(-1) at 0.1 C, 149 mAh g(composite)(-1) at 1 C, and 82.7 mAh g(composite)(-1) at a 10 C rate, respectively.",
        "Symmetric sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage owing to the simplified manufacture and wide abundance of sodium resources. However, most symmetric SIBs suffer from suppressed energy density. Here, a superior congeneric Na4V2(PO4)3 anode is synthesized via electrochemical preintercalation, and a high energy density symmetric SIB (Na3V2(PO4)3 as a cathode and Na4V2(PO4)3 as an anode) based on the deepened redox couple of V4+/V2+ is built for the first time. When measured in half cell, both electrodes show stabilized electrochemical performance (over 3000 cycles). The symmetric SIBs exhibit an output voltage of 3.0 V and a cell-level energy density of 138 W h kg-1. Furthermore, the sodium storage mechanism under the expanded measurement range of 0.01-3.9 V is disclosed through an in situ X-ray diffraction technique.",
        "We report the fabrication of 3D flower-like MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth as a binder-free anode for sodium ion battery. Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the ALD TiO2 layer can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of MoS2. The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",
        "Ultrafine niobium oxide nanocrystals/reduced graphene oxide (Nb2O5 NCs/rGO) was demonstrated as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery with high rate performance and high cycle durability. Nb2O5 NCs/rGO was synthesized by controllable hydrolysis of niobium ethoxide and followed by heat treatment at 450 °C in flowing forming gas. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that Nb2O5 NCs with average particle size of 3 nm were uniformly deposited on rGO sheets and voids among Nb2O5 NCs existed. The architecture of ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs anchored on a highly conductive rGO network can not only enhance charge transfer and buffer the volume change during sodiation/desodiation process but also provide more active surface area for sodium ion storage, resulting in superior rate and cycle performance. Ex situ XPS analysis revealed that the sodium ion storage mechanism in Nb2O5 could be accompanied by Nb(5+)/Nb(4+) redox reaction and the ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs provide more surface area to accomplish the redox reaction.",
        "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",
        "Electrodes with higher Na + storage capability and cycling stability are vital to improve the energy density and rate capability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a coral-like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional carbon framework ( FeP@NC ). Due to the highly continuous N-doped carbon framework and a spring-buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra-stable cycling performance at 10 A g -1 with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the FeP nanoparticles go through a refining-recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na + storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This paper holds a new feasibility insight mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.",

However, its poor electrical conductivity, combined with its degraded cycling performance, restricts its practical application. Herein, Bi microsphere coated with nitrogen-doped carbon (Bi@NC) was synthesized. Owing to the unique Bi crystals and nitrogen-doped carbon layer, the obtained Bi@NC anode exhibited satisfactory cycling stability and superior rate capability. Moreover, after assembling Bi@NC anode with Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 @C cathode to full battery, excellent sodium storage performance was obtained (57 mA h g -1 after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g -1 ).",

Now, a molecular design concept is presented for improving the stability of organic compounds for battery electrodes. The molecular design of the investigated compound, [2.2.2.2]paracyclophane‐1,9,17,25‐tetraene (PCT), can stabilize the neutral state by local aromaticity and the doubly reduced state by global aromaticity, resulting in an anode material with extraordinarily stable cycling performance and outstanding performance under fast‐charge/discharge conditions, demonstrating an exciting new path for the development of electrode materials for SIBs and other types of batteries.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries are promising futuristic large-scale energy-storage devices because of the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the development and commercialization of the sodium-ion battery solely depends on the use of high-capacity electrode materials. Among the various metal oxides, SnO2 has a high theoretical specific capacity for sodium-ion battery. However, the enormous volume expansion and low electrical conductivity of SnO2 hinder its capability to reach the predicted theoretical value. Although different nanostructured designs of electrode materials like SnO2 nanocomposites have been studied, the effects of other cell components like electrolyte and binder on the specific capacity and cyclic stability are yet to be understood. In the present study, we have investigated the synergistic effect of electrolyte and binder on the performance enhancement of SnO2 supported on the intertwined network structure of reduced graphene oxide partially open multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrid as anode in sodium-ion battery. Our result shows that sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate as the electrolyte solvent offers a high specific capacity of 688 mAh g–1 and a satisfactory cyclic stability for 500 cycles. This is about 56% enhancement in specific capacity compared to the use of poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder and propylene carbonate as the electrolyte solvent. The present study provides a better understanding of the synergistic role of electrolyte and binder for the development of metal-oxide-based electrode materials for the advancement of the commercialization of sodium-ion battery.",

The AP-SIB exhibits not only high safety, high rate performance, and ultralong cycle life but also zero-strain characteristics due to the inverse volume change of the phosphate cathode and anode during charge and discharge cycles, offering a safer and cycle-stable Na-ion technology for electric storage applications.",

        "Antimony- (Sb) based materials have been considered as one of promising anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate sodium inserting potentials. So far, the reported energy density and cycling stability of the Sb-based anodes for SIBs are quite limited and need to be significantly improved. Here, we develop a novel Sb/C hybrid encapsulating the Sb nanorods into highly conductive N and S codoped carbon (Sb@(N, S-C)) frameworks. As an anode for SIBs, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid maintains high reversible capacities of 621.1 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, and 390.8 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling.",

        "Prussian blue attracts the attention of many researchers as a promising candidate for use in sodium-ion battery cathodes due to its open frameworks and high working potential. However, the interstitial water in its crystal structure and its poor electronic conductivity limits its performance in practical sodium-ion batteries. Here, acid-assisted ball milling synthesis was employed as a versatile method for the production of surface-modified Prussian blue. With (CH3COO)2Fe being used as the raw material, the Prussian blue produced using ball milling synthesis was modified by the carboxyl functional group on its surface, which resulted in lower interstitial water content and enhanced electrochemical cycling performance. In addition, ball milling synthesis provided the as-prepared Prussian blue with a large surface area, improving its electrochemical rate performance. When used as the cathode of sodium-ion batteries, as-prepared Prussian blue delivered a specific capacity of 145.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and 113.7 mAh g−1 at 1 C, maintaining 54.5% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 170 mA g−1). Furthermore, a solid-state sodium-ion battery was mounted, with as-prepared Prussian blue being employed as the cathode and Na metal as the anode, which delivered a high specific capacity of 128.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C.

        "The anode/electrolyte interface behavior, and by extension, the overall cell performance of sodium‐ion batteries is determined by a complex interaction of processes that occur at all components of the electrochemical cell across a wide range of size‐ and timescales. Single‐scale studies may provide incomplete insights, as they cannot capture the full picture of this complex and intertwined behavior. Broad, multiscale studies are essential to elucidate these processes. Within this perspectives article, several analytical and theoretical techniques are introduced, and described how they can be combined to provide a more complete and comprehensive understanding of sodium‐ion battery (SIB) performance throughout its lifetime, with a special focus on the interfaces of hard carbon anodes. These methods target various length‐ and time scales, ranging from micro to nano, from cell level to atomistic structures, and account for a broad spectrum of physical and (electro)chemical characteristics. Specifically, how mass spectrometric, microscopic, spectroscopic, electrochemical, thermodynamic, and physical methods can be employed to obtain the various types of information required to understand battery behavior will be explored.

        "Sodium‐ion batteries are now considered as a low‐cost alternative to lithium‐ion technologies for large‐scale energy storage applications; however, their safety is still a matter of great concern for practical applications. In this paper, a safer sodium‐ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb‐based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb‐based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications.",
        "Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are interesting as one of the alternative metal-ion battery systems to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance and low cost of potassium. We have herein investigated Sn4P3/C composite as a novel anode material for PIBs. The electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 384.8 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and a good rate capability of 221.9 mA h g-1, even at 1 A g-1. Its electrochemical performance is better than any anode material reported so far for PIBs. It was also found that the Sn4P3/C electrode displays a discharge potential plateau of 0.1 V in PIBs, slightly higher than for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) (0.01 V), and well above the plating potential of metal. This diminishes the formation of dendrites during cycling, and thus Sn4P3 is a relatively safe anode material, especially for application in large-scale energy storage, where large amounts of electrode materials are used. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism of the Sn4P3/C composite as PIB anode is proposed.

        "To design a high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode, binary zinc phosphides (ZnP2 and Zn3P2) were synthesized by a facile solid-state heat treatment process, and their Na storage characteristics were evaluated. The Na reactivity of ZnP2 was better than that of Zn3P2. Therefore, a C-modified ZnP2-based composite (ZnP2-C) was fabricated to achieve better electrochemical performance. To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",
        "P2‐type layered oxide material Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is a competitive candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it suffers from the strong P2–O2 phase transition during charging to the high voltage regime, rendering drastic volume variations and poor cycling performance. Here, a Quasi‐zero strain P2‐Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 cathode is synthesized, which reflects the vanishing P2–O2 transition with a volume change as low as 0.49%, thus resulting in the material an excellent cycling performance (83.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C). The low‐volume strain can be attributed to two aspects: (1) the Mg2+ riveted in the Na layer can act as a “pillar” to stabilize the crystal structure under the condition of sodium removal, thus restricting the structural changes under high voltage. (2) The entry of Li+ into the transition metal (TM) layer can mitigate the electron localization in the highly desodiation state and can effectively immobilize the coordination oxygen atoms, thus suppressing the slip of P2–O2 transition. This study not only provides a new insight of Li and Mg synergetic substitution effect on the structural stability of P2‐type cathode, but also an efficient avenue for developing cathode materials of SIBs with ultralow bulk strain.",
        "Rational fabrication of anode electrodes for sodium-ion batteries remains a challenge due to the problem of sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, large volume expansion etc. Significant efforts, such as fabricating carbon composites and novel nanostructures, have been devoted to the development of anode materials.

Note that it shows one of the best long-term cycling properties reported to date for MoS2-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. This regulation strategy may offer new insights into the fabrication of high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can develop cost-effective and safe energy storage technology for substantial energy storage demands. In this work, we have developed manganese oxide (α-MnO2) nanorods for SIB applications. The crystal structure, which is crucial for high-performance energy storage, is examined systematically for the metal oxide cathode. The intercalation of sodium into the α-MnO2 matrix was studied using the theoretical density functional theory (DFT) studies. The DFT studies predict Na ions’ facile diffusion kinetics through the MnO2 lattice with an attractively low diffusion barrier (0.21 eV). When employed as a cathode material for SIBs, MnO2 showed a moderate capacity (109 mAh·g–1 at C/20 current rate) and superior life cyclability (58.6% after 800 cycles) in NaPF6/EC+DMC (5% FEC) electrolyte. It shows a much higher capacity of 181 mAh·g–1 (C/20 current rate) in NaClO4/PC (5% FEC) electrolyte, though it suffers fast capacity fading (11.5% after 800 cycles). Our findings show that high crystallinity and hierarchical nanorod morphology of the MnO2 are responsible for better cycling performance in conjunction with fast and sustained charge-discharge behaviors.",
        "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C‒S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 Å for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g‒1. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage.",
        "Formation of vanadium oxide nanofilm-coated graphene oxide (GO) is achieved by thermally induced explosive disintegration of a microcrystalline ammonium peroxovanadate-GO composite. GO sheets isolate the microcrystalline grains and capture and contain the microexplosion products, resulting in the deposition of the nanoscale products on the GO. Thermal treatment of the supported nanofilm yields a sequence of nanocrystalline phases of vanadium oxide (V3O7, VO2) as a function of temperature. This is the first demonstration of microexplosive disintegration of a crystalline peroxo compound to yield a nanocoating. The large number of recently reported peroxide-rich crystalline materials suggests that the process can be a useful general route for nanofilm formation. The V3O7@GO composite product was tested as a sodium ion battery anode and showed high charge capacity at high rate charge-discharge cycling (150 mAh g-1 at 3000 mA g-1 vs 300 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1) due to the nanomorphology of the vanadium oxide.",
        "The rational design of anode materials is a challenge in developing sodium ion batteries. Alloy anodes provide high gravimetric and volumetric capacities but suffer the short cycle life as a result of the continuous and accumulated pulverization, resulting from a large volume change during the cycling process. Herein, using pure Sn, an irreversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (SnO), and a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (Sn4P3) as samples, we demonstrate that the pulverization and aggregation of the alloy anode can be partially recovered and the accumulation of pulverization and aggregation during charge/discharge cycles can be terminated using a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction. The cycling stability of three Sn-based anodes increases in order of Sn4P3 > SnO > Sn. The enhancement in Sn4P3 can be attributed to a reversible reaction of Sn4P3 + 9Na ↔ 4Sn + 3Na3P, which repairs the cracks, damage, and aggregation of Sn particles that occurred in the alloy process of 4Sn + 15Na ↔ Na15Sn4 during cycling and, hence, terminates the pulverization. The repair mechanism looks like the self-healing feature in nature, where the damage can be healed by itself. Therefore, the suggested mechanism can be called self-healing, while the repaired anode can be termed as the self-healing anode. The use of self-healing strategies to build an electrode architecture is new and highly desirable because it can increase the cycle life and provide a general approach toward stable electrode materials.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundance and wide distribution of sodium resources. Various solutions have been successfully applied to revolve the large-ion-size-induced battery issues at the mid-to-low current density range. However, the fast-charging properties of SIBs are still in high demand to accommodate the increasing energy needs at large to grid scales. Herein, a core-shell Co2VO4/carbon composite anode is designed to tackle the fast-charging problem of SIBs. The synergetic effect from the stable spinel structure of Co2VO4, the size of the nanospheres, and the carbon shell provide enhanced Na+ ion diffusion and electron transfer rates and outstanding electrochemical performance. With an ultrahigh current density of 5 A g-1, the Co2VO4@C anode achieved a capacity of 135.1 mAh g-1 and a >98% capacity retention after 2000 cycles through a pseudocapacitive dominant process. This study provides insights for SIB fast-charging material design and other battery systems such as lithium-ion batteries.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",
        "The incorporation of oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 has been studied as a promising way to accelerate the transport of electrons and Na+ ions, which is important for achieving excellent electrochemical properties for anatase TiO2. However, wittingly introducing oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 for sodium-ion anodes by a facile and effective method is still a challenge. In this work, we report an innovative method to introduce oxygen vacancies into the urchin-like N-doped carbon coated anatase TiO2 (NC-DTO) by a facile plasma treatment. The superiorities of the oxygen vacancies combined with the conductive N-doped carbon coating enable the obtained NC-DTO of greatly improved sodium storage performance. When served as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, the NC-DTO electrode shows superior electrochemical performance (capacity: 272 mA h g-1 at 0.25 C, capacity retention: 98.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, as well as ultrahigh capacity: 150 mA h g-1 at 15 C). Density functional theory calculations combined with experimental results suggest that considerably improved sodium storage performance of NC-DTO is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity from the N-doped carbon layer as well as narrowed band gap and lowered sodiation energy barrier from the introduction of oxygen vacancies. This work highlights that introducing oxygen vacancies into TiO2 by plasma is a promising method to enhance the electrochemical property of TiO2, which also can be applied to different metal oxides for energy storage devices.",
        "Layered O3-type sodium oxides (NaMO2 , M=transition metal) commonly exhibit an O3-P3 phase transition, which occurs at a low redox voltage of about 3 V (vs. Na+ /Na) during sodium extraction and insertion, with the result that almost 50 % of their total capacity lies at this low voltage region, and they possess insufficient energy density as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Therefore, development of high-voltage O3-type cathodes remains challenging because it is difficult to raise the phase-transition voltage by reasonable structure modulation. A new example of O3-type sodium insertion materials is presented for use in NIBs. The designed O3-type Na0.7 Ni0.35 Sn0.65 O2 material displays a highest redox potential of 3.7 V (vs. Na+ /Na) among the reported O3-type materials based on the Ni2+ /Ni3+ couple, by virtue of its increased Ni-O bond ionicity through reduced orbital overlap between transition metals and oxygen within the MO2 slabs. This study provides an orbital-level understanding of the operating potentials of the nominal redox couples for O3-NaMO2 cathodes. The strategy described could be used to tailor electrodes for improved performance.",
        "The dual-ion battery (DIB) system has attracted great attention owing to its merits of low cost, high energy, and environmental friendliness. However, the DIBs based on sodium-ion electrolytes are seldom reported due to the lack of appropriate anode materials for reversible Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, a new sodium-ion based DIB named as MoS2 /C-G DIB using penne-like MoS2 /C nanotube as anode and expanded graphite as cathode is constructed and optimized for the first time. The hierarchical MoS2 /C nanotube provides expanded (002) interlayer spacing of 2H-MoS2 , which facilitates fast Na+ insertion/extraction reaction kinetics, thus contributing to improved DIB performance. The MoS2 /C-G DIB delivers a reversible capacity of 65 mA h g-1 at 2 C in the voltage window of 1.0-4.0 V, with good cycling performance for 200 cycles and 85% capacity retention, indicating the feasibility of potential applications for sodium-ion based DIBs.",
        "Symmetric sodium ion batteries possess the promising features such as low cost, easy-manufacturing process, and facile recycling post-process, which are suitable for the application of large-scale stationary energy storage. Herein, we proposed a symmetric sodium ion battery based on dual-electron reactions of NASICON structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 material. The Na3MnTi(PO4)3 electrode can deliver a stable capacity up to 160 mAh g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 97 % at 0.1 C by utilizing the redox reactions of Ti3+/4+, Mn2+/3+ and Mn3+/4+. It is the first time to investigate the symmetric sodium-ion full-cell using Na3MnTi(PO4)3 as both cathode and anode in the organic electrolyte, demonstrating the excellent reversibility and cycling performance with the voltage plateaus about 1.4 V and 1.9 V. The full-cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 75 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and an energy density of 52 Wh kg-1. In addition, both ex-situ XRD analysis and the first-principle calculations are employed to investigate the sodiation mechanism and structural evolution. The current research provides a feasible strategy for the symmetric sodium-ion batteries to achieve high energy density.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a top alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale renewable energy storage units due to their low cost and the abundance of sodium-bearing precursors in the earth's mineral deposits. However, the development of anode materials for SIBs to date has been mainly limited to carbonaceous materials with minimal research devoted to high capacity alloy-based materials. In this study, an antimony (Sb)/carbon (C) electrode with ~30 nm Sb nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly encapsulated in interconnecting one-dimensional (1D) 400 nm carbon fibers (denoted as SbNP@C) was fabricated using a simple and scalable electrospinning method. This binder-free, current collector-free SbNP@C electrode demonstrated high capacity and stable long-term cycling performance at various current densities. The SbNP@C electrode showed an initial total capacity of 422 mAh/gelectrode and retained 350 mAh/gelectrode after 300 deep charge-discharge cycles under 100 mA/gSb. Moreover, because of the efficient 1D sodium-ion transport pathway and the highly conductive network of SbNP@C, the electrode preserved high overall capacities even when cycled at high currents, extending its usability to high power applications.",
        "Maintaining structural stability is a great challenge for high-capacity conversion electrodes with large volume change but is necessary for the development of high-energy-density, long-cycling batteries. Here, we report a stable phosphorus anode for sodium ion batteries by the synergistic use of chemically bonded phosphorus-carbon nanotube (P-CNT) hybrid and cross-linked polymer binder. The P-CNT hybrid was synthesized through ball-milling of red phosphorus and carboxylic group functionalized carbon nanotubes. The P-O-C bonds formed in this process help maintain contact between phosphorus and CNTs, leading to a durable hybrid. In addition, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose-citric acid binder was used to form a robust electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a stable cycling capacity of 1586.2 mAh/g after 100 cycles, along with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.7% and subsequent cycling efficiency of ∼99%. The unique electrode framework through chemical bonding strategy reported here is potentially inspirable for other electrode materials with large volume change in use.",
        "Although lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology has prevailed for years, the growing pressure and increased cost of lithium sources urge the rapid development of other promising energy storage devices. As a low-cost alternative, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with similar properties of electrochemical reaction have caught researchers’ attention. Nevertheless, great challenges of inferior reversible capacity and poor lifespan induced by the bigger ionic radius of sodium ions still exist. To solve these problems, improvements to anode materials prove to be an effective way. Herein, the latest research on promising anodes in SIBs is summarized, and the further prospects are also illustrated."
