        "text": "Sodium ion batteries possess several advantages for large-scale energy storage, such as low cost and enhanced safety. However, graphite or other anode materials are not satisfactory because the large radius of Na+ hinders their embedding and removal in the charge and discharge processes. Recently, a biphenylene network (BPN), a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has been synthesized. In this paper, we reveal the potential possibility of BPN as a Na storage material. The theoretical results indicate the advantages of BPN as a sodium battery anode. The maximum specific capacity (413 mA h g-1) is larger than that of the graphite-Li system (372 mA h g-1). With low Na+ diffusion barrier (<0.6 eV) and small volume expansion in the charging process (\u223c26%), BPN presents superiority to the graphite-Na system. Our findings show new insights into Na storage in BPN and provide guidance for the use of a BPN anode in sodium ion batteries.",

        "text": "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",

        "text": "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C\u2012S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 \u00c5 for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g\u20121. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage.",

The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2.

Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",

However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs.

Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles.

The P-CNT hybrid was synthesized through ball-milling of red phosphorus and carboxylic group functionalized carbon nanotubes. The P-O-C bonds formed in this process help maintain contact between phosphorus and CNTs, leading to a durable hybrid.

To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process.

Here, through a hydrogel-embedding method, we are able to confine the growth of few-layer SnS2 nanosheets between nitrogen- and sulfur-doped carbon nanotube (NS-CNT) and amorphous carbon. The obtained carbon-sandwiched SnS2 nanosheets demonstrate excellent sodium storage properties. In operando small angle X-ray scattering combined with the ex situ X-ray absorption near edge spectra reveal that the redox reactions between SnS2/NS-CNT and sodium ion are highly reversible. On the contrary, the nanostructure evolution is found to be irreversible, in which the SnS2 nanosheets collapse, followed by the re-generation of SnS2 nanoparticles. This work provides operando insights into the chemical environment evolution and structure change of SnS2-based anodes, elucidating its reversible reaction mechanism, and illustrates the significance of engineered carbon support in ensuring the electrode structure stability.",

        "text": "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",

Thermal treatment of the supported nanofilm yields a sequence of nanocrystalline phases of vanadium oxide (V3O7, VO2) as a function of temperature. This is the first demonstration of microexplosive disintegration of a crystalline peroxo compound to yield a nanocoating.

However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).",

The CNT framework offers 3D continuous routes for electronic/ionic transfer, while macropores provide adequate space for high mass loading of FeSe2 /C.

However, achieving quick charge and high power density is still a major challenge for most SIBs electrodes because of the sluggish sodiation kinetics. Herein, uniform and mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres are synthesized via a facile one-step polyvinylpyrrolidone assisted method. By controlling the voltage window, the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres present excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs. It delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 692 mA h g-1 . The NiS2 anode also exhibits excellent high-rate capability (253 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ) and long-term cycling performance (319 mA h g-1 capacity remained even after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 ). A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. The impressive electrochemical performance reveals that the NiS2 offers great potential toward the development of next generation large scale energy storage.",

We demonstrated that the Co3O4/CNT nanocomposite is capable of delivering a stable and high capacity of 403 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles where the sodium uptake/extract is confirmed in the way of reversible conversion reaction by adopting ex situ techniques.

Space-confined ultrafine (UF)-MnO2, with an average crystal size of 4 nm, synthesized using a porous silicon dioxide templated hydrothermal process exhibits a high reversible sodiation capacity of 567 mA h g(-1), in contrast to the negligible activity shown by the aggregates of larger (14 nm) MnO2 nanocrystallites. The remarkably enhanced sodiation activity of the UF-MnO2 is attributable to its greatly reduced crystal size, which facilitates diffusion of Na ions, along with high surface energy arising from extensive heterogeneous interfacial bonding with the SiO2 surrounding. The UF-MnO2 anode exhibits an exceptional rate and cycle performance, exhibiting >70% capacity retention after 500 cycles.

        "text": "Present day lithium ion batteries face challenges regarding the sustainability, cost, and natural resource availability of their components. Sodium has been shown to be a complementary energy storage material, providing usable volumetric energy density. In designing sodium ion batteries (SIBs), hard carbon is used at the anode in place of graphite, due to the necessary micro domain structure needed to store sodium ions. Coal char is a low cost material and viable source of hard carbon. The use of coal char in SIBs also provides a high value, secondary use pathway for the abundant char component of coal.\n In this work, flash pyrolyzation is explored as a novel approach for coal char synthesis for SIB anodes using a Utah local bituminous coal. During flash pyrolyzation, char is heated in a drop-tube furnace at 1000 oC/s vs. the traditional slow pyrolyzation approach where char is heated at 20 oC/min. Flash pyrolyzed (FP) char has a surface structure that is vastly different in comparison to the slow pyrolyzed (SP) char (Figure 1.), larger d-spacing (FP d-spacing = 0.379 nm, SP d-spacing = 0.364 nm) and a smaller closed micropore diameter (FP micropore = 1.52 nm, SP micropore = 1.91 nm), as concluded from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, respectively.\n The SIB performance of FP char vs. SP char is tested and compared in ether-based and ester-based electrolytes. FP char performs better as a SIB anode than SP char in both electrolytes. Additionally, both char anodes achieve higher reversible capacity and better initial coulombic efficiencies (ICE) in an ether-based vs. ester-based electrolyte. When FP char is combined with an ether-based electrolyte, a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh/g is achieved, whereas a SP char with an ester-based electrolyte cell has a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 72.5 mAh/g, when both cells are cycled at 50 mA/g (sodium metal half-cells). FP ether cells also perform with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 64%, but SP ester cells only show an ICE value of 52%. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the FP cells is attributed to differences in surface/bulk structure due to the high heating rate. The improvement in char anode performance in ether-based cells is likely due to the formation of a thinner solid-electrolyte interphase and/or improved sodiation due to an ether-based electrolyte.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

Alloy anodes provide high gravimetric and volumetric capacities but suffer the short cycle life as a result of the continuous and accumulated pulverization, resulting from a large volume change during the cycling process. Herein, using pure Sn, an irreversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (SnO), and a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (Sn4P3) as samples, we demonstrate that the pulverization and aggregation of the alloy anode can be partially recovered and the accumulation of pulverization and aggregation during charge/discharge cycles can be terminated using a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction. The cycling stability of three Sn-based anodes increases in order of Sn4P3 > SnO > Sn. The enhancement in Sn4P3 can be attributed to a reversible reaction of Sn4P3 + 9Na \u2194 4Sn + 3Na3P, which repairs the cracks, damage, and aggregation of Sn particles that occurred in the alloy process of 4Sn + 15Na \u2194 Na15Sn4 during cycling and, hence, terminates the pulverization. The repair mechanism looks like the self-healing feature in nature, where the damage can be healed by itself. Therefore, the suggested mechanism can be called self-healing, while the repaired anode can be termed as the self-healing anode. The use of self-healing strategies to build an electrode architecture is new and highly desirable because it can increase the cycle life and provide a general approach toward stable electrode materials.",

This diminishes the formation of dendrites during cycling, and thus Sn4P3 is a relatively safe anode material, especially for application in large-scale energy storage, where large amounts of electrode materials are used. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism of the Sn4P3/C composite as PIB anode is proposed.

However, the low intrinsic conductivity and easy\u2010agglomerated feature hamper its applications. Here, a charge\u2010driven interlayer expansion strategy that Co2+ replaces Mo4+ in the doping form to endow MoS2 layers with negative charges, thus inducing electrostatic repulsion, together with the insertion of gaseous groups, to drive interlayer expansion which once breaks the confinement of interlayer van der Waals force, single\u2010layered MoS2 is obtained and uniformly dispersed into carbon matrix arising from the transformation of carbonaceous gaseous groups under high vapor pressure, is proposed. Co atom doping helps enhance the intrinsic conductivity of single\u2010layered MoS2. Carbon matrix effectively prevents agglomeration of single\u2010layered MoS2. The doped Co atoms can be fully transformed into ultrasmall Co nanoparticles during conversion reaction, which enables strong spin\u2010polarized surface capacitance and thus significantly boosts ion transport and storage. Consequently, the prepared material delivers superb Li/Na/K\u2010ion storage performances, which are best in the reported MoS2\u2010based anodes. The proposed charge\u2010driven interlayer expansion strategy provides a novel perspective for preparing single\u2010layered MoS2, which shows huge potential for energy storage.",

But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high\u2010rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite\u2010type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+\u2010diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as\u2010synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na\u2010diglyme]+ co\u2010intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well\u2010matched.

        "text": "Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) possess ordered accessible nano-channels. When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.",

To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed.

        "text": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",

Several material properties such as intensity ratio of the Raman spectrum, lateral size of HC crystallite (La ), and interlayer distance (d002 ) have been discussed as factors affecting anode performance. However, these factors do not reflect the bulk property of the Na+ intercalation reaction directly, since Raman analysis has high surface sensitivity and La and d002 provide only one-dimensional crystalline information. Herein, it was proposed that the crystallite interlayer area (Ai ) defined using La , d002 , and stacking height (Lc ) governs Na+ intercalation behavior of various HCs. It was revealed that various wood-derived HCs exhibited the similar total capacity of approximately 250\u2005mAh\u2009g-1 , whereas the Na+ intercalation capacity (Ci ) was proportional to Ai with the correlation coefficient of R2 =0.94.

To tackle this problem, pore\u2010forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in\u2010plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene.

In this regard, iron oxides (FeOx) are considered as one of the most promising anode candidates due to its high theoretical capacity and low cost. Unfortunately, the utilization of FeOx anodes suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and significant lattice variation, causing insufficient rate performance and fast capacity degradation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In this study, Mn ions are incorporated through interstitial sites into Fe3O4 lattice to form the Mn-incorporated Fe3O4/graphene (M-Fe3O4/G) composites through a facile hydrothermal method. Confirmed by the XRD Rietveld refinement and the first principle calculation, Mn occupation into the body structure can effectively condense the electron density around Fermi lever and thus contributes to the increased electrical conductivity and improved electrochemical properties. Accordingly, the M0.1Fe2.9O4/G composite demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 439.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 over 200 cycles. Even at a high current density of 1 A g-1, the M-Fe3O4/G composites remain stable for over 1200 cycles, delivering a capacity of 210 mAh g-1. Coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3-type cathode, the Mn incorporated Fe3O4/G composites demonstrate a good suitability in full SIBs (161.2 mAh g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles). The regulation of Mn ions in Fe3O4 lattice provides insights on the optimization of metal oxides anode candidates for their application in SIBs.",

However, wittingly introducing oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 for sodium-ion anodes by a facile and effective method is still a challenge. In this work, we report an innovative method to introduce oxygen vacancies into the urchin-like N-doped carbon coated anatase TiO2 (NC-DTO) by a facile plasma treatment. The superiorities of the oxygen vacancies combined with the conductive N-doped carbon coating enable the obtained NC-DTO of greatly improved sodium storage performance. When served as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, the NC-DTO electrode shows superior electrochemical performance (capacity: 272 mA h g-1 at 0.25 C, capacity retention: 98.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, as well as ultrahigh capacity: 150 mA h g-1 at 15 C). Density functional theory calculations combined with experimental results suggest that considerably improved sodium storage performance of NC-DTO is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity from the N-doped carbon layer as well as narrowed band gap and lowered sodiation energy barrier from the introduction of oxygen vacancies.

Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis.

The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature.

Due to the highly continuous N-doped carbon framework and a spring-buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra-stable cycling performance at 10 A g -1 with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the FeP nanoparticles go through a refining-recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na + storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 \u00c5, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance.

Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture.",

        "text": "Sodium-ion batteries are promising futuristic large-scale energy-storage devices because of the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the development and commercialization of the sodium-ion battery solely depends on the use of high-capacity electrode materials. Among the various metal oxides, SnO2 has a high theoretical specific capacity for sodium-ion battery. However, the enormous volume expansion and low electrical conductivity of SnO2 hinder its capability to reach the predicted theoretical value. Although different nanostructured designs of electrode materials like SnO2 nanocomposites have been studied, the effects of other cell components like electrolyte and binder on the specific capacity and cyclic stability are yet to be understood. In the present study, we have investigated the synergistic effect of electrolyte and binder on the performance enhancement of SnO2 supported on the intertwined network structure of reduced graphene oxide partially open multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrid as anode in sodium-ion battery. Our result shows that sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate as the electrolyte solvent offers a high specific capacity of 688 mAh g\u20131 and a satisfactory cyclic stability for 500 cycles. This is about 56% enhancement in specific capacity compared to the use of poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder and propylene carbonate as the electrolyte solvent. The present study provides a better understanding of the synergistic role of electrolyte and binder for the development of metal-oxide-based electrode materials for the advancement of the commercialization of sodium-ion battery.",

In this paper, a safer sodium\u2010ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb\u2010based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge\u2013discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0\u20134.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb\u2010based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium\u2010ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium\u2010ion batteries for large\u2010scale energy storage applications.",

        "text": "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application.",

Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance.",

The reaction activation energies, Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, and structures of the transition states are calculated. It is indicated that VC, ES, and PS additives in the electrolyte are all easier to form organic components in the anode SEI film by one-electron reduction. The priority of one-electron reduction to produce organic SEI components is in the order of VC>PC>EC; two-electron reduction to produce the inorganic Na2 CO3 component is different and follows the order of EC>PC>VC. Two-electron reduction for sulfites ES and PS to form inorganic Na2 SO3 is harder than that of carbonate ester reduction.

Electrospinning is a promising technology for preparing freestanding electrodes with high gravimetric and volumetric energy density.

Herein, a biomimetic strategy inspired by the phenomenon of the sticky spider web is demonstrated as a high performance anode, which simultaneously improves the gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Freestanding carbon nanofiber (CNF) membranes containing over 50 wt% of bismuth were prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. Membranes consisting of CNF network structures bonded tightly with active Bi cluster materials, resulting in excellent mechanical protection and a fast charge transport path, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. The composite membrane delivers high reversible capacity (483 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 200 cycles) and high rate performance (242 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1) as a lithium-ion battery anode. For use as a sodium ion battery, the composite membrane also shows a high reversible specific capacity of 346 mA h g-1 and outstanding cycling performance (186 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 after 100 cycles).

Moreover, the benefits at deep-discharge conditions can be further promoted by an ultrathin Al2O3 coating. A series of measurements show that the OVs increase the electric conductivity and Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and the promotion from ultrathin coating lies in the effective reduction of cycling-induced solid-electrolyte interphase.

First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant.

Here, density functional theory calculations are combined with experiments to explore the mitigation behavior of Mg dopant and its mechanisms under operating conditions in P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. The void formed by Na extraction will pump some Mg dopants into Na layers from TM layers, and the collective diffusion of more than one Mg ion most likely occurs when the Mg content is relatively high in the TM layer, finally aggregating to form Mg-enrich regions (i.e., Mg segregation) apart from Ni vacancies. The void-pump-effect-induced Mg segregation effectively suppresses the P2-O2 phase transition owing to the stronger Mg-O electrostatic attraction that enhances the integrate of two adjacent oxygen layers and prevents the crack growth by mitigating the lattice volume variation under high-voltage cycling. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of heteroatom mitigation behavior in layered cathodes at the atomic level for next-generation energy storage technologies.",

Here, a Quasi\u2010zero strain P2\u2010Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 cathode is synthesized, which reflects the vanishing P2\u2013O2 transition with a volume change as low as 0.49%, thus resulting in the material an excellent cycling performance (83.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C).

(2) The entry of Li+ into the transition metal (TM) layer can mitigate the electron localization in the highly desodiation state and can effectively immobilize the coordination oxygen atoms, thus suppressing the slip of P2\u2013O2 transition.

However, the interstitial water in its crystal structure and its poor electronic conductivity limits its performance in practical sodium-ion batteries. Here, acid-assisted ball milling synthesis was employed as a versatile method for the production of surface-modified Prussian blue. With (CH3COO)2Fe being used as the raw material, the Prussian blue produced using ball milling synthesis was modified by the carboxyl functional group on its surface, which resulted in lower interstitial water content and enhanced electrochemical cycling performance. In addition, ball milling synthesis provided the as-prepared Prussian blue with a large surface area, improving its electrochemical rate performance. When used as the cathode of sodium-ion batteries, as-prepared Prussian blue delivered a specific capacity of 145.3 mAh g\u22121 at 0.2 C and 113.7 mAh g\u22121 at 1 C, maintaining 54.5% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 170 mA g\u22121).

(1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2.

P2-type manganese-based layered oxides have received special attention by virtue of their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environment friendliness.

In this work, copper substitution is used to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and affect the corresponding lattice structure. The water sensitivity and charge compensation mechanism were carefully investigated. Results demonstrate that water sensitivity of the electrode is related to the order of Na+/vacancy in the Na interlayers since water molecules are more easily inserted into the charged state electrodes, but the tendency for the uptake water does not increase with Na+ extraction. Furthermore, Mn2+ forms on the surface of electrodes in the initial discharge process, and the redox reaction in the bulk are predominantly between Mn3+ and Mn4+. Cu-substituted in TM layer affects the arrangement of Na+/vacancy and suppresses the Mn2+ formation on the Na0.7Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 electrode that results in superior air stability and better storage properties.",

        "text": "The phase transition and lattice parameter evolution of O3 structure commonly occurs in O3-type sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes, which might enlarge the voltage hysteresis and lower the energy efficiency. Given that the cost is one of the issues discouraging the application of SIBs in large-scale energy storage, here we focus on Co/Ni-free NaxCu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 (x = 0.8, 0.85, 0.9) and propose a convenient strategy to reduce the voltage hysteresis. It is found that when the Na content is 0.8, the highest energy efficiency of 95.4% after activation is achieved (2.5-4.0 V, 50 mA g-1, the 50th cycle), in addition to a satisfactory capacity retention (about 0.056% decay per cycle). The further characterizations reveal that Na0.8Cu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 owns a gentle O3-P3 phase transition process and does not undergo O3 phase lattice parameter evolution. The key point lies in the attainability of the O3/P3 composite of the material. This work will provide a simple strategy for the rational design of O3-type cathodes with a high energy efficiency and might offer inspiration to search for layered oxides with a higher O3/P3 critical Na content through element adjustments.",

Therefore, development of high-voltage O3-type cathodes remains challenging because it is difficult to raise the phase-transition voltage by reasonable structure modulation. A new example of O3-type sodium insertion materials is presented for use in NIBs. The designed O3-type Na0.7 Ni0.35 Sn0.65 O2 material displays a highest redox potential of 3.7\u2005V (vs. Na+ /Na) among the reported O3-type materials based on the Ni2+ /Ni3+ couple, by virtue of its increased Ni-O bond ionicity through reduced orbital overlap between transition metals and oxygen within the MO2 slabs. This study provides an orbital-level understanding of the operating potentials of the nominal redox couples for O3-NaMO2 cathodes. The strategy described could be used to tailor electrodes for improved performance.",

However, the Jahn-Teller effect and the inevitable phase transition are detrimental for achieving considerable cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, a P2-type manganese oxide nanoplate cathode material modified by Mo-substitution with oriented stacking structure and exposed {010} active facets is reported. The manganese oxide nanoplate cathode yields remarkable capacity retention of 87.8% after 1200 cycles at 10C (2000 mA g-1). The specific power density is estimated as high as 530 W Kg-1 with a specific discharge capacity 143.9 mA h g-1 at 1C and 89.6% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances can be attributed to the efficient chemical modification and the unique structural features of the present manganese oxide nanoplate. Mo-modification can endow manganese oxide cathode with enlarged lattice space and average oxidation state and thus favorable Na+ diffusion to inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and improve the structure stability, thereby achieving an extremely long cycling life. Multilayer oriented stacking nanoplate structure with exposed {010} active facets is also beneficial for providing more surface active sites and shortening the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better rate capability.",

However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high\u2010rate performance and long\u2010cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g\u22121 at 2.5 A g\u22121) and ultralong cycling life (>3000 circulations at 0.5 A g\u22121), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA\u2010based cathode materials.

To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na-free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.",

However, it still suffers from poor cycling stability mainly incurred by the undesirable P2-O2 phase transition. Herein, the electrochemically active Fe3+ ions are introduced into the lattice of NNMO, forming Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3- xFe xO2 ( x = 0, 1/24, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6) to effectively stabilize the P2-type crystalline structure. In such Fe-substituted materials, both Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples take part in the redox reactions, and the P2-O2 phase transition is well restrained during cycling, as verified by ex situ X-ray diffraction. As a result, the optimized Na2/3Ni1/3Mn7/12Fe1/12O2 (1/12-NNMF) has a long-term cycling stability with the fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 300 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the 1/12-NNMF delivers excellent rate capabilities (65 mA h g-1 at 25 C) and superior low-temperature performance (the capacity retention of 94% at -25 \u00b0C after 80 cycles) owing to the enhanced Na diffusion upon Fe doping, which is deduced by the studies of electrode kinetics. More significantly, the 1/12-NNMF also displays remarkable sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with an LS-Sb@G anode, thus implying the possibility of their practical application.",

The leaching behavior of Ni, Mn, Co, Al and Cu from treated cathode active materials, which are separated from a commercial LIB pack in hybrid electric vehicles, is investigated with ammoniacal leaching agents based on ammonia, ammonium carbonate and ammonium sulfite. Ammonium sulfite as a reductant is necessary to enhance leaching kinetics particularly in the ammoniacal leaching of Ni and Co. Ammonium carbonate can act as a pH buffer so that the pH of leaching solution changes little during leaching. Co and Cu can be fully leached out whereas Mn and Al are hardly leached and Ni shows a moderate leaching efficiency. It is confirmed that the cathode active materials are a composite of LiMn2O4, LiCoxMnyNizO2, Al2O3 and C while the leach residue is composed of LiNixMnyCozO2, LiMn2O4, Al2O3, MnCO3 and Mn oxides. Co recovery via the ammoniacal leaching is believed to gain a competitive edge on convenitonal acid leaching both by reducing the sodium hydroxide expense for increasing the pH of leaching solution and by removing the separation steps of Mn and Al.",

        "text": "The 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to a trio of pioneers of the modern lithium-ion battery. Here, Professor Arumugam Manthiram looks back at the evolution of cathode chemistry, discussing the three major categories of oxide cathode materials with an emphasis on the fundamental solid-state chemistry that has enabled these advances. Lithium-ion batteries have aided the portable electronics revolution for nearly three decades. They are now enabling vehicle electrification and beginning to enter the utility industry. The emergence and dominance of lithium-ion batteries are due to their higher energy density compared to other rechargeable battery systems, enabled by the design and development of high-energy density electrode materials. Basic science research, involving solid-state chemistry and physics, has been at the center of this endeavor, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. With the award of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to the development of lithium-ion batteries, it is enlightening to look back at the evolution of the cathode chemistry that made the modern lithium-ion technology feasible. This review article provides a reflection on how fundamental studies have facilitated the discovery, optimization, and rational design of three major categories of oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries, and a personal perspective on the future of this important area.",

        "text": "Oxygen vacancies (OV) are native defects in transition metal (TM) oxides and their presence has a critical effect on the physicochemical properties of the oxide. Metal oxides are commonly used in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathodes and there is still a lack of understanding of the role of OVs in LIB research field. Here, we report on the behavior of OVs in a single-crystal LIB cathode during the non-equilibrium states of charge and discharge. We found that microcrack evolution in a single crystal occurs due to OV condensation in specific crystallographic orientations generated by the continuous migration of OVs and TM ions. Moreover, understanding the effects of the presence and diffusion of OVs in metal oxides enables the elucidation of most of the conventional mechanisms of capacity fading in LIBs and provides new insights for new electrochemical applications.",

The Ge nanorod networks were observed to self-replicate their tetrahedron structures and form a diamond cubic lattice-like inner network. After etching and subsequent carbon coating, the treated Ge nanostructures provide good electrical conductivity and are resistant to gradual deterioration, resulting in superior electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs, with a charge capacity retention of 96% after 100 cycles and a high specific capacity of 1360\u2005mA h g^\u22121 at 1\u2005C and a high-rate capability with reversible capacities of 1080 and 850\u2005mA h g^\u22121 at the rates of 5 and 10\u2005C, respectively. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the fast electron transport and good strain accommodation of the carbon-filled Ge microflower-on-nanostem hybrid electrode.",

Then, Li is recovered from the raffinate as Li2CO3 with the purity of 99.2% by precipitation method. Finally, organic load phase is stripped with 0.5M H2SO4, and the cathode material LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 is directly regenerated from stripping liquor without separating metal individually by co-precipitation method. The regenerative cathode material LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 is miro spherical morphology without any impurities, which can meet with LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 production standard of China and exhibits good electrochemical performance.

The movement of lithium ions into and out of electrodes is central to the operation of lithium-ion batteries. Although this process has been extensively studied at the device level, it remains insufficiently characterized at the nanoscale level of grain clusters, single grains and defects. Here, we probe the spatial variation of lithium-ion diffusion times in the battery-cathode material LiCoO_2 at a resolution of \u223c100\u00a0nm by using an atomic force microscope to both redistribute lithium ions and measure the resulting cathode deformation. The relationship between diffusion and single grains and grain boundaries is observed, revealing that the diffusion coefficient increases for certain grain orientations and single-grain boundaries. This knowledge provides feedback to improve understanding of the nanoscale mechanisms underpinning lithium-ion battery operation.",

Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm\u22123 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high\u2010rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm\u22123 at 15 C, and superior long\u2010term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C. This excellent electrochemical performance proves the feasibility of utilizing Te as a high\u2010volumetric\u2010capacity active material for storage of K+ ions and will advance the practical application of KIBs.",

        "text": "High-tap-density silicon nanomaterials are highly desirable as anodes for lithium ion batteries, due to their small surface area and minimum first-cycle loss. However, this material poses formidable challenges to polymeric binder design. Binders adhere on to the small surface area to sustain the drastic volume changes during cycling; also the low porosities and small pore size resulting from this material are detrimental to lithium ion transport. This study introduces a new binder, poly(1-pyrenemethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PPyMAA), for a high-tap-density nanosilicon electrode cycled in a stable manner with a first cycle efficiency of 82%-a value that is further improved to 87% when combined with graphite material. Incorporating the MAA acid functionalities does not change the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) features or lower the adhesion performance of the PPy homopolymer. Our single-molecule force microscopy measurement of PPyMAA reveals similar adhesion strength between polymer binder and anode surface when compared with conventional polymer such as homopolyacrylic acid (PAA), while being electronically conductive. The combined conductivity and adhesion afforded by the MAA and pyrene copolymer results in good cycling performance for the high-tap-density Si electrode.",

The layered morphology and polymer to ceramic transformation on MoS_2 surfaces was confirmed by use of electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. Tested as thick film electrode in a Li-ion battery half-cell, SiCN-MoS_2 showed the classical three-stage reaction with improved cycling stability and capacity retention than neat MoS_2. Contribution of conversion reaction of Li/MoS_2 system on overall capacity was marginally affected by the presence of SiCN while Li-irreversibility arising from electrolyte decomposition was greatly suppressed. This is understood as one of the reasons for decreased first cycle loss and increased capacity retention. SiCN-MoS_2 in the form of self-supporting paper electrode (at 6\u2005mg\u00b7cm^\u22122) exhibited even better performance, regaining initial charge capacity of approximately 530\u2005mAh\u00b7g^\u22121 when the current density returned to 100\u2005mA\u00b7g^\u22121 after continuous cycling at 2400\u2005mA\u00b7g^\u22121 (192\u2005mAh\u00b7g^\u22121). MoS_2 cycled electrode showed mud-cracks and film delamination whereas SiCN-MoS_2 electrodes were intact and covered with a uniform solid electrolyte interphase coating. Taken together, our results suggest that molecular level interfacing with precursor\u2013derived SiCN is an effective strategy for suppressing the metal-sulfide/electrolyte degradation reaction at low discharge potentials.",

We use valence energy-loss spectroscopy to track both solvated and intercalated ions, with electronic structure fingerprints of the solvated ions identified using an ab initio nonlinear response theory. Equipped with the new electrochemical cell holder, nanoscale spectroscopy and theory, we have been able to determine the lithiation state of a LiFePO4 electrode and surrounding aqueous electrolyte in real time with nanoscale resolution during electrochemical charge and discharge. We follow lithium transfer between electrode and electrolyte and image charging dynamics in the cathode. We observe competing delithiation mechanisms such as core-shell and anisotropic growth occurring in parallel for different particles under the same conditions. This technique represents a general approach for the operando nanoscale imaging of electrochemically active ions in the electrode and electrolyte in a wide range of electrical energy storage systems.",

        "text": "Though high entropy oxides have been explored as possible conversion-type negative electrodes for Li-ion batteries, the roles of the different elements remain unclear. Here the authors determine the behavior of each element during electrochemical cycling and connect it to the nanoscale structure. High entropy oxides (HEOs) with chemically disordered multi-cation structure attract intensive interest as negative electrode materials for battery applications. The outstanding electrochemical performance has been attributed to the high-entropy stabilization and the so-called \u2018cocktail effect\u2019. However, the configurational entropy of the HEO, which is thermodynamically only metastable at room-temperature, is insufficient to drive the structural reversibility during conversion-type battery reaction, and the \u2018cocktail effect\u2019 has not been explained thus far. This work unveils the multi-cations synergy of the HEO Mg_0.2Co_0.2Ni_0.2Cu_0.2Zn_0.2O at atomic and nanoscale during electrochemical reaction and explains the \u2018cocktail effect\u2019. The more electronegative elements form an electrochemically inert 3-dimensional metallic nano-network enabling electron transport. The electrochemical inactive cation stabilizes an oxide nanophase, which is semi-coherent with the metallic phase and accommodates Li^+ ions. This self-assembled nanostructure enables stable cycling of micron-sized particles, which bypasses the need for nanoscale pre-modification required for conventional metal oxides in battery applications. This demonstrates elemental diversity is the key for optimizing multi-cation electrode materials.",

However, its reaction mechanisms are still controversial. In this work, we find that different from the conventional beliefs that a formation of an intermediate phase Li2FeS2 and then Fe/Li2S composites at the initial discharge, it undergoes a one-step reaction (FeS2 \u2192 Fe + Li2S) or a two-step reaction (FeS2 \u2192 FeS + Li2S\u2192 Fe + Li2S), which depends on current rate and temperature. In the charge process, it undergoes a two-step reaction: a phase transition Fe + Li2S \u2192 FeS at about 1.74 V; a generation of elemental sulfur (Li2S \u2192 S, 2.30 V). FeS is a mackinawite phase which is formed on the interface of Li2S via a hetero-epitaxial growth. In the subsequent cycles, it is a combination reaction behavior of FeS and S. The reaction mechanism suggests that FeS2 suffers from the challenges of conversion reaction materials both FeS and S, such as big volume change, voltage hysteresis, and polysulfide dissolution. These findings would help understand the intrinsic capacity fading of FeS2 and provide guidelines to improve its electrochemical performances.",

Recently, Si nanostructures-based lithium-ion battery anode, with sophisticated structure designs and process development, has made significant progress. However, low cost and scalable processes to produce these Si nanostructures remained as a challenge, which limits the widespread applications. Herein, we demonstrate that Si nanoparticles with controlled size can be massively produced directly from low grade Si sources through a scalable high energy mechanical milling process. In addition, we systematically studied Si nanoparticles produced from two major low grade Si sources, metallurgical silicon (\u223c99 wt % Si, $1/kg) and ferrosilicon (\u223c83 wt % Si, $0.6/kg). It is found that nanoparticles produced from ferrosilicon sources contain FeSi2, which can serve as a buffer layer to alleviate the mechanical fractures of volume expansion, whereas nanoparticles from metallurgical Si sources have higher capacity and better kinetic properties because of higher purity and better electronic transport properties. Ferrosilicon nanoparticles and metallurgical Si nanoparticles demonstrate over 100 stable deep cycling after carbon coating with the reversible capacities of 1360 mAh g(-1) and 1205 mAh g(-1), respectively. Therefore, our approach provides a new strategy for cost-effective, energy-efficient, large scale synthesis of functional Si electrode materials.",

The insights enable new dimensions in choosing dopants for stabilized cathode surface. Despite the importance of studying the instability of delithiated cathode materials, it remains difficult to underpin the degradation mechanism of lithium-rich cathode materials due to the complication of combined chemical and structural evolutions. Herein, we use state-of-the-art electron microscopy tools, in conjunction with synchrotron X-ray techniques and first-principle calculations to study a 4 d -element-containing compound, Li_2Ru_0.5Mn_0.5O_3. We find surprisingly, after cycling, ruthenium segregates out as metallic nanoclusters on the reconstructed surface. Our calculations show that the unexpected ruthenium metal segregation is due to its thermodynamic insolubility in the oxygen deprived surface. This insolubility can disrupt the reconstructed surface, which explains the formation of a porous structure in this material. This work reveals the importance of studying the thermodynamic stability of the reconstructed film on the cathode materials and offers a theoretical guidance for choosing manganese substituting elements in lithium-rich as well as stoichiometric layer-layer compounds for stabilizing the cathode surface.",

Here, we propose the use of a sulfur-based cathode material, amorphous MoS3 and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) composite, which can be substituted for the pure sulfur-based cathodes. In order to enhance kinetics and stability of the electrodes, we intentionally pulverize the microsized MoS3 sheet into nanosheets and form an ultrathin nano-SEI on the surface using in situ electrochemical methods. Then, the pulverized nanosheets are securely anchored by the oxygen functional group of r-GO. As a result, the electrochemically treated MoS3/r-GO electrode shows superior performance that surpasses pure sulfur-based electrodes; it exhibits a capacity of about 900 mAh g-1 at a rate of 5C for 2500 cycles without capacity fading. Moreover, a full-cell battery employing the MoS3/r-GO cathode with a silicon-carbon composite anode displays a 3-5 times higher energy density (1725 Wh kg-1/7100 Wh L-1) than present LIBs.",

In this study, a hydrometallurgical route for the recovery of lithium fluoride was proposed. Lithium and cobalt could be first selectively leached into solution using formic acid and hydrogen peroxide. By investigating the effects of leaching temperature, time, stoichiometric ratio, H2O2 concentration and solid-to-liquid ratio, the leaching efficiency of Li and Co could reach 99.90% and 99.96%, respectively. Meanwhile, the evaluation of leaching kinetics and calculation of apparent activation energies revealed that the leaching process fitted chemical control satisfactorily. After further fractional precipitation, a high purity of 99.0% lithium fluoride could be finally obtained, thus achieving the effective recovery of spent material from the lithium-ion battery.",

When using alginate as a binder, porous silicon nanowires exhibited superior electrochemical performance and long cycle life as anode material in a lithium ion battery. Even after 250 cycles, the capacity remains stable above 2000, 1600, and 1100 mAh/g at current rates of 2, 4, and 18 A/g, respectively, demonstrating high structure stability due to the high porosity and electron conductivity of the porous silicon nanowires. A mathematic model coupling the lithium ion diffusion and the strain induced by lithium intercalation was employed to study the effect of porosity and pore size on the structure stability. Simulation shows silicon with high porosity and large pore size help to stabilize the structure during charge/discharge cycles.",

The use of removable or sacrificial templates is an effective and easy route to synthesize hollow materials. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of mesoporous silicon hollow nanocubes (m-Si HCs) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOF) as an anode material with outstanding electrochemical properties. The m-Si HC architecture with the mesoporous external shell (\u223c15 nm) and internal void (\u223c60 nm) can effectively accommodate volume variations and relieve diffusion-induced stress/strain during repeated cycling. In addition, this cube architecture provides a high electrolyte contact area because of the exposed active site, which can promote the transportation of Li ions. The well-designed m-Si HC with carbon coating delivers a high reversible capacity of 1728 mAhg-1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 80.1% after the first cycle and an excellent rate capability of >1050 mAhg-1 even at a 15 C-rate. In particular, the m-Si HC anode effectively suppresses electrode swelling to \u223c47% after 100 cycles and exhibits outstanding cycle stability of 850 mAhg-1 after 800 cycles at a 1 C-rate. Moreover, a full cell (2.9 mAhcm-2) comprising a m-Si HC-graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode exhibits remarkable cycle retention of 72% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C-rate.",

The morphology and porosity of the as-synthesized SiGe alloy can be controlled effectively by adjusting the sacrificial Al content of the precursor. With an Al content of 80%, the 3D-NP SiGe presents uniformly coral-like structure with continuous ligaments and hierarchical micropores and mesopores, which leads to a high reversible capacity of 1158 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g-1 with excellent rate capacity.

However, current FSE fabrication methods suffer from insufficient mechanical stability, electrochemical performance, or industrial adoptability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable camphene-assisted fabrication method that allows simultaneous casting and templating of FSEs comprising common LIB materials with a performance superior to their foil-cast counterparts. These porous, lightweight, and robust electrodes simultaneously enable enhanced rate performance by improving the mass and ion transport within the percolating conductive carbon pore network and eliminating current collectors for efficient and stable Li+ storage (>1000 cycles in half-cells) at increased gravimetric and areal energy densities. Compared to conventional foil-cast counterparts, the camphene-derived electrodes exhibit \u223c1.5\u00d7 enhanced gravimetric energy density, increased rate capability, and improved capacity retention in coin-cell configurations. A full cell containing both a free-standing anode and cathode was cycled for over 250 cycles with greater than 80% capacity retention at an areal capacity of 0.73 mA h/cm2. This active-material-agnostic electrode fabrication method holds potential to tailor the morphology of flexible, current-collector-free electrodes, thus enabling LIBs to be optimized for high power or high energy density Li+ storage. Furthermore, this platform provides an electrode fabrication method that is applicable to other electrochemical technologies and advanced manufacturing methods.",

Despite intensive research on the morphological evolution of polycrystalline nickel\u2010rich materials, its practical investigation at the electrode and cell levels is still rarely discussed. Herein, an intrinsic limitation of polycrystalline nickel\u2010rich cathode materials in high\u2010energy full\u2010cells is discovered under industrial electrode\u2010fabrication conditions. Owing to their highly unstable chemo\u2010mechanical properties, even after the first cycle, nickel\u2010rich materials are degraded in the longitudinal direction of the high\u2010energy electrode. This inhomogeneous degradation behavior of nickel\u2010rich materials at the electrode level originates from the overutilization of active materials on the surface side, causing a severe non\u2010uniform potential distribution during long\u2010term cycling. In addition, this phenomenon continuously lowers the reversibility of lithium ions. Consequently, considering the degradation of polycrystalline nickel\u2010rich materials, this study suggests the adoption of a robust single\u2010crystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a feasible alternative, to effectively suppress the localized overutilization of active materials. Such an adoption can stabilize the electrochemical performance of high\u2010energy lithium\u2010ion cells, in which superior capacity retention above \u224880% after 1000 cycles at 45 \u00b0C is demonstrated.",

The present work reports a versatile oxygen-deficient LiV3O8 (D-LVO) nanosheet that was synthesized successfully via a facile oxygen-deficient hydrothermal reaction followed by thermal annealing in Ar. When used as a cathode material for LIB, the prepared D-LVO nanosheets display remarkable capacity properties at various current densities (a capacity of 335, 317, 278, 246, 209, 167, and 133 mA h g-1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 mA g-1, respectively) and excellent lithium-ion storage stability, maintaining more than 88% of the initial reversible capacity after 200 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The outstanding electrochemical properties are believed to arise largely from the introduction of tetravalent V (\u223c15% V4+) and the attendant oxygen vacancies into LiV3O8 nanosheets, leading to intrinsic electrical conductivity more than 1 order of magnitude higher and lithium-ion diffusion coefficient nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of LiV3O8 without detectable V4+ (N-LVO) and thus contributing to the easy lithium-ion diffusion, rapid phase transition, and the excellent electrochemical reversibility. Furthermore, the more uniform nanostructure, as well as the larger specific surface area of D-LVO than N-LVO nanosheets may also improve the electrolyte penetration and provide more reaction sites for fast lithium-ion diffusion during the discharge/charge processes.",

However, multiple processes occurring at the cathode/electrolyte interface lead to overall performance degradation. One key failure mechanism is the dissolution of transition metals from the cathode. This work presents results combining scanning electrochemical microscopy with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to examine cathode degradation products. Our effort employs a LiMn2O4 (LMO) thin film as a model cathode to monitor the Mn dissolution process without the potential complications of conductive additive and polymer binders. We characterize the electrochemical behavior of LMO degradation products in various electrolytes, paired with ICP and EPR, to better understand the properties of Mn complexes formed following metal dissolution. We find that the identity of the lithium salt anions in our electrolyte systems [ClO4\u2013, PF6\u2013, and (CF3SO2)2N\u2013] appears to affect the Mn dissolution process significantly as well as the electrochemical behavior of the generated Mn complexes. This implies that the mechanism for Mn dissolution is at least partially dependent on the lithium salt anion.",

Taking advantage of the properties of high-entropy materials, we have designed a highly ion-conductive solid electrolyte by increasing the compositional complexity of a known lithium superionic conductor to eliminate ion migration barriers while maintaining the structural framework for superionic conduction. The synthesized phase with a compositional complexity showed an improved ion conductivity. We showed that the highly conductive solid electrolyte enables charge and discharge of a thick lithium-ion battery cathode at room temperature and thus has potential to change conventional battery configurations. Description Editor\u2019s summary Solid electrolytes have been developed to allow solid-state batteries to compete with liquid electrolyte batteries, but there is still a challenge in ensuring good contact with the electrodes, which thus limits the thickness of electrodes that can be used in practice. Li et al. applied the principles of high-entropy materials to improve upon the properties of existing electrolytes through the sensible partial substitution of addition elements. The authors demonstrate the incorporation of their materials into a cathode structure, which provides the high ionic conductivity required for solid-state battery applications. \u2014MSL Adding composition complexity to a known crystal framework enables millimeter-thick battery electrodes.",

        "text": "\"Fast-charging\" lithium-ion batteries have gained a multitude of attention in recent years since they could be applied to energy storage areas like electric vehicles, grids, and subsea operations. Unfortunately, the excellent energy density could fail to sustain optimally while lithium-ion batteries are exposed to fast-charging conditions. In actuality, the crystal structure of electrode materials represents the critical factor for influencing the electrode performance. Accordingly, employing anode materials with low diffusion barrier could improve the \"fast-charging\" performance of the lithium-ion battery. In this Review, first, the \"fast-charging\" principle of lithium-ion battery and ion diffusion path in the crystal are briefly outlined. Next, the application prospects of \"fast-charging\" anode materials with various crystal structures are evaluated to search \"fast-charging\" anode materials with stable, safe, and long lifespan, solving the remaining challenges associated with high power and high safety. Finally, summarizing recent research advances for typical \"fast-charging\" anode materials, including preparation methods for advanced morphologies and the latest techniques for ameliorating performance. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the ongoing breakthroughs for \"fast-charging\" anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Intercalated materials (niobium-based, carbon-based, titanium-based, vanadium-based) with favorable cycling stability are predominantly limited by undesired electronic conductivity and theoretical specific capacity. Accordingly, addressing the electrical conductivity of these materials constitutes an effective trend for realizing fast-charging. The conversion-type transition metal oxide and phosphorus-based materials with high theoretical specific capacity typically undergoes significant volume variation during charging and discharging. Consequently, alleviating the volume expansion could significantly fulfill the application of these materials in fast-charging batteries.",

Two dimensional X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the reaction distribution is happened in lower porosity electrodes. Our developed 6-probe method can measure electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes. The ionic conductivity is decreased for lower porosity electrodes, which governs the reaction distribution of composite electrodes and their performances.",

        "text": "Due to its high specific capacity, silicon anode has gained interest on a global scale as the anode of next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, it is challenging for silicon anodes to replace graphite anodes for widespread use due to the inevitable volume expansion and SEI film development generated by silicon during the lithiation/delithiation process. Among these, the advancement of nanotechnology has sped up the development of silicon anodes. This paper reviews nanotechnology applied in the Si anode to improve the battery performance. The volume expansion of Si is effectively decreased by reducing the volume of the silicon anode in order to increase its specific surface area. Additionally, the smaller negative electrode reduces the distance traveled by lithium ions, greatly increasing the silicon negative electrode's efficiency. At present, the main silicon nano-anode materials include nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets, nanotubes, nanoporous materials and so on. It is hoped that this review will provide a deep prospect introduction to the nano-silicon anode. Pure silicon nanoparticles and silicon nanowires, and new nanomaterials composed of them with graphite, graphene, metals, etc.",

This study represents the first experimental examination of the negative electrode properties of HB. HB was synthesized via cation exchange from MgB2. The confirmation of HB synthesis was achieved through various spectroscopic experiments, including synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in addition to direct observation using transmission electron microscopy. The HB electrode was prepared by mixing the HB powder sample with conductive additive carbon black and a polymer binder. A test cell was assembled with the HB electrode as the working electrode, and lithium metal as the counter and reference electrodes, and its battery electrode properties were evaluated. Although reversible charge-discharge curves with good reversibility were observed, the reversible capacity was 100 \u00b1 20 mA h g-1 which is significantly smaller than the theoretical predictions. Nitrogen gas adsorption experiments were performed on the HB powder sample to determine the specific surface area indicating that the HB sheets were stacked together. It is plausible to consider that this stacking structure led to a reduced lithium-ion storage capacity compared to the theoretical predictions.",

Here, a new electrophoretic deposition Co3O4/graphene (EPD Co3O4/G) hybrid electrode is developed to improve the electrochemical performance. Through EPD, Co3O4 nanocubes can be homogeneously embedded between graphene sheets to form a sandwich-like structure. Owing to the excellent flexibility of graphene and a large number of voids in this sandwich-like structure, the structural integrity and unobstructed conductive network can be maintained during cycling. Moreover, the electrode kinetics has proved to be a fast surface-controlled lithium storage process. As a result, the Co3O4/G hybrid electrode exhibits high specific capacity and excellent electrochemical cycling performance. The Co3O4/G hybrid electrode was also further studied by in situ electrochemical XRD to understand the relationship of its structure and performance: (1) The observed LixCo3O4 indicates an intermediate of possible small volume change in the first discharging. (2) The theoretical capacity achievement of the Co3O4 in hybrid electrode was evidenced. (3) The correlation between the electrochemical performance and the structural evolution of the Co3O4/G hybrid electrode was discussed detailedly.",

Herein, a facile solution-based strategy is exploited to incorporate phosphorus into the pores of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) derived carbon hosts under a mild temperature. With this method, the blocky RP is etched into the form of polyphosphides anions (PP, mainly P5 - ) so that it can easily diffuse into the pores of porous carbon hosts. Especially, the indelible crystalline surface phosphorus can be effectively avoided, which usually generates in the conventional vapor-condensation encapsulation method. Moreover, highly-conductive ZIF-8 derived carbon hosts with any pore smaller than 3 nm are efficient for loading PP and these pores can alleviate the volume change well. Finally, the composite of phosphorus encapsulated into ZIF-8 derived porous carbon exhibits a significantly improved electrochemical performance as lithium-ion battery anode with a high capacity of 786 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 , a good stability within 700 cycles at 1 A g-1 , and an excellent rate performance.",

However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, it is expected to revive the development of layered lithium-rich cathode materials to resolve our increasing dependence on high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we reviewed recent research progresses and in-depth understandings of structure characterizations and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium-rich manganese-based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarized the proposed reaction mechanisms on both the cationic redox reaction of transition-metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discussed opportunities and challenges facing the future development of LLRM cathode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.",

Additionally, spent LIBs should be recycled to achieve a circular economy and supply resources for new LIBs or other products. Especially the recycling of the active material of the electrodes is the focus of current research. Existing approaches for recycling (e.g., pyro-, hydrometallurgy, or flotation) still have their drawbacks, such as the loss of materials, generation of waste, or lack of selectivity. In this study, we test the behavior of commercially available LiFePO4 and two types of graphite microparticles in a dielectrophoretic high-throughput filter. Dielectrophoresis is a volume-dependent electrokinetic force that is commonly used in microfluidics but recently also for applications that focus on enhanced throughput. In our study, graphite particles show significantly higher trapping than LiFePO4 particles. The results indicate that nearly pure fractions of LiFePO4 can be obtained with this technique from a mixture with graphite.",

While new solid electrolytes (SEs) have been developed with high enough ionic conductivities, SSBs with long operational life are still rarely reported. Therefore, on the way to high-performance and long-life ASSBs, a better understanding of the complex degradation mechanisms, occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces is pivotal. While the lithium metal/solid electrolyte interface is receiving considerable attention due to the quest for high energy density, the interface between the active material and solid electrolyte particles within the composite cathode is arguably the most difficult to solve and study. In this work, multiple characterization methods are combined to better understand the processes that occur at the LiCoO2 cathode and the Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte interface. Indium and Li4Ti5O12 are used as anode materials to avoid the instability problems associated with Li-metal anodes. Capacity fading and increased impedances are observed during long-term cycling. Postmortem analysis with scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that electrochemically driven mechanical failure and degradation at the cathode/solid electrolyte interface contribute to the increase in internal resistance and the resulting capacity fading. These results suggest that the development of electrochemically more stable SEs and the engineering of cathode/SE interfaces are crucial for achieving reliable SSB performance.",

        "text": "Modern studies of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathode materials employ a large range of experimental and theoretical techniques to understand the changes in bulk and local chemical and electronic structures during electrochemical cycling (charge and discharge). Despite its being rich in useful chemical information, few studies to date have used 17O NMR spectroscopy. Many LIB cathode materials contain paramagnetic ions, and their NMR spectra are dominated by hyperfine and quadrupolar interactions, giving rise to broad resonances with extensive spinning sideband manifolds. In principle, careful analysis of these spectra can reveal information about local structural distortions, magnetic exchange interactions, structural inhomogeneities (Li+ concentration gradients), and even the presence of redox-active O anions. In this Perspective, we examine the primary interactions governing 17O NMR spectroscopy of LIB cathodes and outline how 17O NMR may be used to elucidate the structure of pristine cathodes and their structural evolution on cycling, providing insight into the challenges in obtaining and interpreting the spectra. We also discuss the use of 17O NMR in the context of anionic redox and the role this technique may play in understanding the charge compensation mechanisms in high-capacity cathodes, and we provide suggestions for employing 17O NMR in future avenues of research.",

        "text": "This article demonstrates the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of tungsten nitride using tungsten hexacarbonyl [W(CO)6] and ammonia [NH3] and its use as a lithium-ion battery anode. In situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), ellipsometry and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements are carried out to confirm the self-limiting behaviour of the deposition. A saturated growth rate of ca. 0.35 \u00c5 per ALD cycle is found within a narrow temperature window of 180-195 \u00b0C. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) vibrational spectroscopy is used to determine the reaction pathways of the surface bound species after each ALD half cycle. The elemental presence and chemical composition is determined by XPS. The as-deposited material is found to be amorphous and crystallized to h-W2N upon annealing at an elevated temperature under an ammonia atmosphere. The as-deposited materials are found to be n-type, conducting with an average carrier concentration of ca. 10(20) at room temperature. Electrochemical studies of the as-deposited films open up the possibility of this material to be used as an anode material in Li-ion batteries. The incorporation of MWCNTs as a scaffold layer further enhances the electrochemical storage capacity of the ALD grown tungsten nitride (WNx). Ex situ XRD analysis confirms the conversion based reaction mechanism of the as-grown material with Li under operation.",

Though much attention has been paid to this issue, the behavior of Mn dissolution has not been clearly revealed. In this work, by using a refined in-situ UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) technique, we monitored the concentration changes of dissolved Mn ions in liquid electrolyte from LMO at different state of charge (SOC), confirming the maximum dissolution concentration and rate at 4.3 V charged state and Mn2+ as the main specie in the electrolyte. Through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we revealed that Mn dissolution process is highly related to surface structure evolution, solvent decomposition and lithium salt. These results will contribute to understanding TM dissolution mechanisms in working conditions as well as the design of stable cathode.",

        "text": "The global energy crisis, consumption of fossil fuels, and the associated environmental issues have stimulated extensive interest in searching for sustainable energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in mobile devices, hybrid, and electric vehicles. Electrode-electrolyte interface has a strong impact on battery capacity decrease and long-term cycling stability. In order to improve fundamental understanding of the involved phenomena to accelerate the rational design of cathode materials and stable interface, Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O2 (NCM) is a cathode material for rechargeable LIB and also a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Their battery performance and catalytic activity are highly correlated to their structures. Multiple processes occurring at the cathode/electrolyte interface led to overall performance degradation. One failure mechanism is the dissolution of transition metals from the cathode. Our efforts employ thin film as a model cathode to monitor the Mn dissolution. Using LiMn2O4 and NCM as cathode materials, we will focus on electrochemical characterization, cation mixing, oxygen evolution, and thin film deposition with controlled crystal structures and composition. We will further introduce our work employing the scanning electrochemical microscope to study LIBs degradation and cathode-electrolyte interface in situ and in real-time.",

The IL-based electrolyte is characterized in terms of conductivity and viscosity at various temperatures, revealing a Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) trend. Lithium half-cells employing the Sn-C anode and NMC cathode in the Pyr14 TFSI-LiTFSI electrolyte are investigated by galvanostatic cycling at various temperatures, demonstrating the full compatibility of the electrolyte with the selected electrode materials. The NMC and Sn-C electrodes are combined into a cathode-limited full cell, which is subjected to prolonged cycling at 40\u2009\u00b0C, revealing a very stable capacity of about 140\u2005mAh\u2009g(-1) and retention above 99\u2009% over 400 cycles. The electrode/electrolyte interface is further characterized through a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations upon cell cycling. The remarkable performances reported here definitively indicate that IL-based lithium ion cells are suitable batteries for application in electric vehicles.",

        "text": "Performance of lithium-ion batteries at sub-ambient temperatures are extremely restricted by the resistive interphases originated from electrolyte decomposition, especially on the anode surface. This work reports a novel strategy that anode interphase of low impedance is constructed by applying an electrolyte additive dimethyl sulfite (DMS). Electrochemical measurements indicate that the as-constructed interphase provides graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cells with excellent lower temperature performance, outperforming the interphase constructed by 1,3,2-Dioxathiolane 2,2-dioxide (DTD), a common commercially used electrolyte additive. Spectral characterizations in combination with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the improved performance is attributed to the unique molecular structure of DMS, which presents appropriate reduction activity and constructs the more stable and ionically conductive anode interphase, due to the weaker combination of its reduction product with lithium ions than DTD. This rational design of interphases via additive structure has been proven to be a low cost but rather effective approach to tailor the performances of lithium-ion batteries.",

Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art Ni\u2010rich layered oxides (LiNi1\u2010x\u2010yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium\u2010ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron\u2010based X\u2010ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature\u2010dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid\u2010state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high\u2010energy/power density lithium\u2010ion batteries.",

Although the discovery and optimization of battery active materials has been the subject of extensive study since the 1980s, the most disruptive advancements of commercial LIBs in the past decade stem instead from overall cell design and engineering. In pursuit of higher energy density and fast-charging capability, strategies focused on tuning the properties of composite electrode architectures (e.g., porosity, conductivity, tortuosity, spatial heterogeneity) by restructuring the inactive component matrix of LIB electrode films have recently garnered attention. This perspective explores recent advances in electrode design through an applied lens, emphasizing synthetic platforms and future research directions that are scalable, commercially feasible, and applicable to a wide range of active materials. We introduce and critically assess recently proposed strategies for structuring electrode architectures, including spatial gradients of local composition and microstructure; metal-foil current collector alternatives; and electrode templating techniques, evaluating both achievements in battery performance and commercial applicability. Coupled with improved active materials, new electrode architectures hold promise to unlock next generation LIBs.",

Flash pyrolysis heats char in a drop-tube furnace at 1000 \u00b0C/s, contrasting with traditional slow pyrolysis, where heating occurs at 20 \u00b0C/min. The char produced via flash pyrolysis (FP char) exhibits a markedly different surface structure compared to slow pyrolyzed (SP) char, with larger d-spacing (FP d-spacing = 0.379 nm, SP d-spacing = 0.364 nm) and a smaller closed micropore diameter (FP micropore = 1.52 nm, SP micropore = 1.91 nm), as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis.\n\nThe performance of SIBs using FP char versus SP char was tested in ether-based and ester-based electrolytes. FP char outperformed SP char as a SIB anode in both electrolytes. Furthermore, both char anodes demonstrated higher reversible capacity and improved initial coulombic efficiencies (ICE) with ether-based compared to ester-based electrolytes.

In this study, we introduce an innovative technique to create pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) using microwave irradiation, which supports prospects for rapid and large-scale production. Although directly carbonizing CNFs via microwave treatment is typically challenging due to their poor microwave absorption, we discover that a small quantity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) serves as an effective initiator. When microwaved, rGO releases exceptionally high energy, causing local ultrahigh temperatures and heating rates, thereby enabling the swift carbonization of CNFs and the formation of pre-sodiated carbon materials within seconds. The sodium content in the carbonaceous materials, derived from the sodium-ion carboxyl groups in CNFs, creates advantageous sites for sodiation/desodiation, enhancing the electrochemical performance of the sodium-integrated carbonaceous anode. Utilizing microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) as an anode for SIBs achieves a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1, maintaining a capacity of 340 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles.

However, its practical applications are constrained by its low intrinsic conductivity and its propensity to agglomerate. This study introduces a charge-driven interlayer expansion technique where Co2+ substitutes for Mo4+ as a dopant, endowing the MoS2 layers with negative charges. This creates electrostatic repulsion and, combined with the insertion of gaseous groups, induces interlayer expansion that disrupts the interlayer van der Waals force, resulting in single-layered MoS2 uniformly dispersed in a carbon matrix. This dispersion derives from the transformation of carbonaceous gaseous groups under high vapor pressure. Co atom doping enhances the intrinsic conductivity of single-layered MoS2, and the carbon matrix effectively prevents agglomeration. During the conversion reaction, the doped Co atoms are transformed into ultrasmall Co nanoparticles, which enhance spin-polarized surface capacitance, thereby significantly improving ion transport and storage. As a result, the developed material exhibits exceptional Li/Na/K-ion storage performance, ranking among the top for MoS2-based anodes. This charge-driven interlayer expansion strategy offers a new approach for creating single-layered MoS2 with substantial potential for energy storage applications.",

Additionally, the slow movement of these ions within electrodes hinders rapid sodiation in SIBs. Addressing this challenge, introducing an electronic drive at the electrodes through chemical modifications offers a promising solution. In this study, we introduce SIB anodes based on three isostructural COFs that have similar Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but distinct Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. The variations in LUMO levels have been deliberately engineered by incorporating electron-deficient substitutes (phenyl, tetrazine, and bispyridine-tetrazine) into the COF modules.

It is therefore important to eliminate these unwanted defect structures to improve battery performance. In this study, we present a method that involves applying a soft-carbon coating to free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which significantly reduces the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups in hard carbon.

We explore why researchers assert that an equilibrium series of phase transitions, as described by phase diagrams, does not occur, and instead describe how sodiation/desodiation progresses through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. Recent modeling insights reveal how these transitions significantly affect the mechanical properties of the alloy, altering the bonding and arrangement of atoms from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like.\" Subsequently, we examine sodiation reactions in SnO2, arguing that despite extensive experiments focusing on the synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the precise sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. In contrast to Sn and Sn alloys, which can achieve near-theoretical capacities early in cycling, SnO2 never reaches the theoretical 1398 mAh g(-1) capacity due to incomplete Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reactions.

This paper introduces a Quasi-zero strain P2-Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 cathode, which exhibits a minimized P2\u2013O2 transition with only a 0.49% volume change, leading to excellent cycling stability (83.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C). The reduced volume strain is due to two factors: (1) Mg2+ ions in the Na layer act as \"pillars,\" stabilizing the crystal structure during sodium removal and limiting structural changes at high voltage, and (2) Li+ insertion into the transition metal layer reduces electron localization in high desodiation states and immobilizes coordinating oxygen atoms, thus preventing P2\u2013O2 transition slippage.

The excellent sodium storage performance of P@N-MPC mainly stems from its innovative structure. The N-doped porous carbon with micropores smaller than 1 nm enables the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and enhances the conductivity of the encapsulated red P. Moreover, the porous carbon matrix can accommodate the volume changes of red P during repeated sodiation/desodiation cycles, maintaining structural integrity over an extended cycle life.",

This study examines the leaching behavior of Ni, Mn, Co, Al, and Cu from processed cathode active materials, which are extracted from a commercial LIB pack in hybrid electric vehicles, using ammoniacal leaching agents derived from ammonia, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium sulfite. Ammonium sulfite acts as a reductant to improve the leaching kinetics, particularly for Ni and Co in the ammoniacal leaching process. Ammonium carbonate serves as a pH buffer, ensuring that the leaching solution's pH remains relatively stable during the process. Co and Cu demonstrate complete leaching, while Mn and Al show minimal leaching and Ni has a moderate leaching efficiency. The cathode active materials are confirmed to be a composite of LiMn2O4, LiCoxMnyNizO2, Al2O3, and C, whereas the leach residue consists of LiNixMnyCozO2, LiMn2O4, Al2O3, MnCO3, and Mn oxides. The recovery of Co via ammoniacal leaching is considered to have a competitive advantage over traditional acid leaching by reducing the cost associated with sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment and eliminating the need for Mn and Al separation steps.",
