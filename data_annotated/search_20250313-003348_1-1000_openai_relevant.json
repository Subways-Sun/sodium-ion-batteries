        "abstract": "Rechargeable solid-state Na metal batteries (SSNMB) can offer high operational safety and energy density. However, poor solid-solid contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte can dramatically increase interfacial resistance and Na dendrite formation, even at low current rates. Therefore, we developed a carbon-fiber-supported liquid Na-K alloy anode that ensures close anode-electrolyte contact, enabling superior cycle stability and rate capability. We then demonstrated the first cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) characterization of an SSNMB, capturing the evolution of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and revealing both crystalline and amorphous phases, which could facilitate ion transport and prevent continuous side reactions. By enhancing contact between the Na-K alloy and solid-state electrolyte, these symmetric cells are capable of cycling for over 800 h without notable increased polarization and enable an unprecedented critical current density (CCD) at 40 mA cm-2. Our liquid Na-K alloy approach offers a promising strategic avenue toward commercial SSNMBs.",

        "abstract": "Rational construction of nanosized anode nanomaterials is crucial to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Metallic selenides have been widely investigated as promising electrode materials for metal-ion batteries based on their relatively high theoretical capacity. However, rapid capacity decay and structural collapse resulting from the larger-sized Na+ /K+ greatly hamper their application. Herein, a bimetallic selenide (MoSe2 /CoSe2 ) encapsulated in nitrogen, sulfur-codoped hollow carbon nanospheres interconnected reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO@MCSe) are successfully designed as advanced anode materials for Na/K-ion batteries. As expected, the significant pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior substantially contributes to superior rate capability. Specifically, it achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 311 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 in NIBs and 310 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 in KIBs. A combination of ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy tests reveals the phase transition of rGO@MCSe in NIBs/KIBs. Unexpectedly, they show quite different Na+ /K+ insertion/extraction reaction mechanisms for both cells, maybe due to more sluggish K+ diffusion kinetics than that of Na+ . More significantly, it shows excellent energy storage properties in Na/K-ion full cells when coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F and PTCDA@450 °C cathodes. This work offers an advanced electrode construction guidance for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Cellulose, as it has high content and low cost along with the absence of heteroatoms, can well balance the cost and structural consistency issues raised by mass production. Herein, the cellulose-derived hard carbon as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries with high performance has been prepared by a one-step direct carbonization process using pure cellulose as a precursor in the temperature range of 900–1400 °C. Moreover, the effect of carbonization temperature on the microstructure and the sodium battery storage properties of cellulose-derived hard carbon was investigated by structural and morphological characterization, as well as electrochemical performance testing. The results show that the CHC-1300 electrode material displays a high reversible capacity of 373.2 mAh g−1 at 30 mA g−1, and exhibits a desirable cycling stability with 89.7 % capacity retention even after 200 cycles. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry technique (CV) at different scan rates and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) have been employed to explore the sodium storage mechanism and sodium storage kinetics of cellulose-derived hard carbon. The results exhibit that the rate performance of the electrode material would be affected by the low apparent diffusion coefficient of sodium ions in the plateau region. Besides, a full-cell has been assembled with CHC-1300 as the anode and Na0.83Mg0.11Ni0.22Mn0.63O2 (NMNM) as the cathode.

        "abstract": "Sluggish reaction kinetics induced by the inferior solid-state ion diffusion and poor conductivity of electrode materials currently conflict with increasing fast-charge needs for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion mechanism. Herein, mesoporous, conductive, thin-wall three-dimension (3D) skeletons of molybdenum nitride (meso-Mo2N) were established and employed as anodes to facilitate rate performance for SIBs. Mesoporous channels (～9.3 nm) with very thin walls (＜8 nm) and conductive networks in meso-Mo2N enable the rapid Na+/Li+ infiltrability/diffusivity and smooth electron transfer, respectively. The fast ion diffusion/transfer ability is confirmed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, cyclic voltammetry tests with higher ion-diffusion dominated capacity and larger Na+ diffusion coefficient. Consequently, meso-Mo2N exhibited a superior rate capability and a stable specific capacity of 158 mAh g-1 (after 1000 cycles) at 1 A g-1 for SIBs, surpassing nonporous Mo2N and even the previously reported Mo2N. Furthermore, the proof of concept can be also extended to enhanced Li storage. Such mesostructured design with 3D mesoporous, conductive thin wall of electrodes is a promising strategy for achieving fast-charging and high-performance Na/Li storage.",

The optimized P-Bi@C-700 (annealed at 700 °C) demonstrates 359.8 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1. In situ/ex situ characterization and density functional theory calculations verified that this P-Bi@C-700 relieves the volume expansion, facilitates Na+/electron transport, and possesses an alloying-type storage mechanism. Notably, P-Bi@C-700 also achieved 360.8 and 370.3 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 under 0 and 60 °C conditions, respectively. Na3V2(PO4)3//P-Bi@C-700 exhibits a capacity of 359.7 mAh g-1 after 260 cycles at 1 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gradually being recognized as viable solutions for large-scale energy storage because of their inherent safety as well as low cost. However, despite recent advancements in water-in-salt electrolyte technologies, the challenge of identifying anode materials with sufficient specific capacity persists, complicating the wider adoption of these batteries. This study introduces an innovative and straightforward approach for synthesizing vanadium oxide laser-scribed graphene (VOx-LSG) composites, which function as effective anode materials in aqueous sodium-ion batteries. By combining a rapid laser-scribing technique with precise thermal control, the method not only allows for changing the morphology of the vanadium oxide, but also tuning its oxidation state. This is achieved while embedding these electrochemically active particles within a highly conductive graphene scaffold. When paired with a Prussian blue-based cathode (Na1.88Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.97) in a concentrated NaClO4-based aqueous electrolyte, the battery’s charge storage mechanism is found to be largely surface-controlled, leading to exceptional rate performance. The full cell demonstrates specific capacities of 128 mA h/g@0.05 A/g and 65.6 mA h/g@1 A/g, with an energy density of 47.7 W h/kg, outperforming many existing aqueous sodium-ion batteries. This strategy offers a promising path forward for integrating efficient, eco-friendly, and low-cost anode materials into large energy storage devices and systems.",

The interlayer doped Ca2+ effectively enlarges the interlayer spacing, while the in situ-formed CaSe templates induce the formation of hierarchical pore structures and intrinsic defects, significantly providing fast Na+ diffusion channels and abundant active sites and thus enhancing the sodium storage kinetics.

Herein, self‐supporting nitrogen‐doped and carbon‐coated 1T/2H mixed‐phase MoS2 nanosheets with rich sulfur vacancies on carbon cloth (C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC) are synthesized through a hydrothermal method and Ar/NH3 radio‐frequency (RF) plasma treatment process. Density‐functional‐theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that after Ar/NH3 RF plasma treatment, nitrogen‐doping and etching effects are realized, which combine with carbon‐coating significantly reduce the phase transition energy of 1T‐MoS2, thus triggering the phase transition and enabling the stable existence of the highly active 1T‐MoS2. As a result, the C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC exhibits outstanding sodium storage performance, with initial charge–discharge capacities of 701.0/797.0 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively.

However, its low conductivity and poor rate performance have limited its practical application.

Both experimental and theoretical results confirm that iron (Fe) doping at octahedral sites within spinel structures is a critical factor in enhancing rate performance. The decreased bandgap and enlarged ion transport spacing originate in Fe doping. This effectively facilitates the electron and Na-ion (Na+) transport during discharge/charge processes, delivering an impressive rate capability of 402.9 mAh g-¹ at 3 A g-¹. The FexCo3-xO4 NPs demonstrate remarkable cycling stability. They maintain a high specific capacity of 786.2 mAh g-¹ even after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-¹, with no noticeable capacity fading. When assembled into a Na-ion full cell, a remarkable discharge capacity of 105 mAh g-1 with stable cycling performance is attained.

Herein, a novel water‐soluble concentrated imidazolium functionalized poly(ionic liquid), poly(oxycarbonylmethylene 1‐allyl‐3‐methyimidazolium) (PMAI) is synthesized, and evaluated it as binder in LIB/SIB. PMAI‐based anodic‐half cell exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving higher capacities (297 mAhg−1 at 1C for LIBs and 250 mAhg−1 at 60 mAg−1 for SIBs) and good cycle stability (80 % capacity retention after 750 cycles for LIBs; 96% capacity retention after 200 cycles for SIBs), compared to PVDF binder. In addition, PMAI/Gr delivers a higher discharge capacity of 85 mAhg−1 than PVDF/Gr with 47 mAhg−1 at 5C. PMAI‐containing electrodes show better rate capability at different current densities than PVDF binder in LIB/SIB. The enhanced ion diffusion coefficient, lower resistance and decreased activation energy of desolvation, are ascribed to densely polar ionic liquid groups along the polymer and formation of a functionalized SEI via binder reduction. The novel PMAI binder's design and full‐cell examination confirm its potential in secondary‐ion battery applications.",

        "abstract": "Superior high‐rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium‐ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record‐high capacity of 279 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Featuring a high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundant resources, sodium metal has emerged as an ideal anode material for sodium ion batteries. However, the real feasibility of sodium metal anodes is still hampered by the uncontrolled sodium dendrite problems. Herein, an artificial three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel is fabricated by a direct-ink writing 3D printing technology and further adopted as the matrix of Na metal to deliver a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT sodium metal anode. Upon cycling, the V2CTx/rGO-CNT electrode can yield a superior cycling life of more than 3000 h (2 mA cm-2, 10 mAh cm-2) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.54%. More attractively, it can even sustain a stable operation over 900 h at 5 mA cm-2 with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 50 mAh cm-2. In situ and ex situ characterizations and density functional theory simulation analyses prove that V2CTx with abundant sodiophilic functional groups can effectively guide the sodium metal nucleation and uniform deposition, thus enabling a dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, a full cell pairing a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C-rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.27 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1. This work not only clarifies the superior Na deposition chemistry on the sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel electrode but also offers an approach for fabricating advanced Na metal anodes via a 3D printing method.",

        "abstract": "The shortage of high-capacity anode materials with long cycling stability is the main roadblock to the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The advantages of transition metal selenides are high theoretical capacity, safety and ease of design, which gradually make them potential substitute materials for the anodes of a new generation of SIBs. However, the low intrinsic conductivity of transition metal selenides and the serious powderization during charge and discharge processes restrict their rate performance and cycling stability in SIBs. Herein, bimetallic selenide ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is fabricated by in situ selenation of a rhombic dodecahedron structured metal-organic framework (MOF) containing Zn/Mo salt. Such a heterojunction and structural regulation effectively promote sodium ion transportation. Furthermore, the porous and hierarchical ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is capable of adapting to the volume stress generated by sodium ion (de)insertion. Specifically, in SIB half-cell measurement, a comparable capacity of 401.8 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1 can be achieved by ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. Additionally, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC polyhedron delivers a high capacity of 345.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 (1500 cycles). Electrochemical kinetics analysis is performed in detail. In SIB full battery applications, the cell shows an impressive energy density of 175.1 W h kg-1. This research broadens the development prospect of transition metal selenides as anodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are still confronted with several major challenges, including low energy and power densities, short‐term cycle life, and poor low‐temperature performance, which severely hinder their practical applications. Here, a high‐voltage cathode composed of Na3V2(PO4)2O2F nano‐tetraprisms (NVPF‐NTP) is proposed to enhance the energy density of SIBs. The prepared NVPF‐NTP exhibits two high working plateaux at about 4.01 and 3.60 V versus the Na+/Na with a specific capacity of 127.8 mA h g−1. The energy density of NVPF‐NTP reaches up to 486 W h kg−1, which is higher than the majority of other cathode materials previously reported for SIBs. Moreover, due to the low strain (≈2.56% volumetric variation) and superior Na transport kinetics in Na intercalation/extraction processes, as demonstrated by in situ X‐ray diffraction, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, and cyclic voltammetry at varied scan rates, the NVPF‐NTP shows long‐term cycle life, superior low‐temperature performance, and outstanding high‐rate capabilities. The comparison of Ragone plots further discloses that NVPF‐NTP presents the best power performance among the state‐of‐the‐art cathode materials for SIBs. More importantly, when coupled with an Sb‐based anode, the fabricated sodium‐ion full‐cells also exhibit excellent rate and cycling performances, thus providing a preview of their practical application.",

        "abstract": "The significance of exploring optimal electrode materials cannot be overstated, particularly in mitigating the critical issues posed by sluggish redox kinetics, significant volume variations, and severe structural collapse resulting from the insertion and extraction of sodium ions. These efforts are crucial for enhancing the longevity and rapid charging capabilities of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a defect engineering strategy for the in situ encapsulation of single‐phase ternary iron phosphoselenide into porous carbon by robust chemical bonds with the formation of rod‐like multicavity nanohybrids (FePSe3@C) is presented. The incorporation of Se atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the central metal Fe atom and enhances the intrinsic electrical conductivity, but also generates numerous additional reaction sites and accelerates the reaction kinetics of FePSe3@C, as corroborated by theoretical calculations and kinetic analysis. Notably, the FePSe3@C demonstrates an outstanding rate capability of 321.7 mAh g−1 even at 20 A g−1 and long cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The sodium‐ion full cell, pairing the FePSe3@C anode with the Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode, exhibits a remarkable energy density of 202 Wh kg−1, demonstrating its practical applicability. This work provides a controllable defect and morphology engineering strategy to construct advanced materials with fast charge transfer for high‐power/energy SIBs.",

Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt‐based metal–organic framework nanowires (Co‐NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co‐NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ion flux as a strong ion redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F‐rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10 µL carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co‐NWS|Cu half‐cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500 h. Remarkably, the full cell shows a long‐term life span (over 1500 cycles with 92% capacity retention) at high current density in the carbonate electrolyte. This work opens up a strategy for developing dendrite‐free, low‐cost, and long‐life‐span sodium metal batteries in carbonate‐based electrolytes.",

Similar to silicon anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performance of red phosphorus is plagued by the large volume variation upon sodiation. Here we perform in situ transmission electron microscopy analysis of the synthesized red-phosphorus-impregnated carbon nanofibers with the corresponding chemo-mechanical simulation, revealing that, the sodiated red phosphorus becomes softened with a “liquid-like” mechanical behaviour and gains superior malleability and deformability against pulverization. The encapsulation strategy of the synthesized red-phosphorus-impregnated carbon nanofibers has been proven to be an effective method to minimize the side reactions of red phosphorus in sodium-ion batteries, demonstrating stable electrochemical cycling. Our study provides a valid guide towards high-performance red-phosphorus-based anodes for sodium-ion batteries.

In the composite, the generated built-in electric field at MoS2 and CoS heterointerfaces is beneficial for elevating the electron conductivity, thus expediting the Na-ion transport rate. Moreover, different redox potentials between MoS2 and CoS can effectively mitigate the mechanical strain induced by repeated Na+ de-/intercalation, thus ensuring the structural integrity.

Consequently, the resulting MoS2/CoS@CC electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles, and prominent rate performance (366 mA h g-1 at 8.0 A g-1). Theoretical calculations also confirm that the establishment of a MoS2/CoS heterojunction can powerfully promote the electron conductivity, thereby enhancing the Na-ion diffusion kinetics.",

        "abstract": "The formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on HC composite electrodes plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance and operational stability of sodium (Na+) ion batteries. It has been demonstrated that for HC anodes improved electrochemical performance, e.g., increase in coulombic efficiency (CE) and improved rate performance have been achieved in ether‐based electrolytes. Here, we investigate spray‐coated HC composite electrodes charged at low and high current rates in 1 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) in diglyme using half‐cell experiments. The pristine and cycled HC anodes were examined in terms of conductivity and their electrochemical properties after cycling. In 1 M NaPF6 ether‐based electrolyte, the spray‐coated HC composite electrodes reached a discharge capacity of 431 mA h g−1 at 0.1C that stays constant for 40 cycles, which is substantially higher than that obtained in carbonate‐based electrolytes. We investigated the formed interphase using scanning (electrochemical) probe microscopy (S(E)PM), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS), revealing distinct differences for longer cycling and at varying current rates which indicates that the properties of the formed SEI layers are influenced by the formation conditions.",

        "abstract": "Flexible sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a prior energy supply for the future wearable electronic devices. And red phosphorus (P) with high theoretical capacity (2596 mAh/g) is regarded as an optimal candidate for SIB anode. However, the huge volume expansion of red P during the sodiation/desodiation process deteriorates the structural integrity of electrodes, resulting in the rapid capacity fading, which hinders the successful deployment of red P in the flexible SIB anodes. Herein, we propose a rapid and scalable method to fabricate the flexible P-based electrodes, which is similar with the common blade-coating method. The three-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix from monodispersed CNT solution with robust mechanical strength ensures the structural integrity of the flexible electrode during the long cyclic process. As a result, the flexible P/C-CNTs electrode using as SIB anode delivers a reversible capacity (calculated based on the whole mass of the electrodes, 35 wt% P in electrode) of 442 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 100 cycles, together with 83 % capacity retention.

        "abstract": "Insertion of substances (such as atoms/molecules/ions) into the interlayer spaces of graphite to increase its layer separation is found to be extremely useful for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Therefore, expanded graphitic systems are the obvious choice as anode material for both lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Hard carbon-based materials altogether give a decent electrochemical performance, as well as allow structural integrity for long-term use. Herein, we report a facile route to prepare free-standing vanadium oxide doped carbon microfibers (V@CMFs) films. The V@CMFs show ∼ 200 % expansion in the graphitic interlayer distances while accommodating minute deformations in the final compound which is further theoretically verified as the stage-1 type dilute graphite intercalation compound (GICs) with pillar-like structures. Best battery performance was obtained for the 1 % doped (V1@CMFs) sample, with an initial discharge capacity of 1501.8 and 703.4 mAhg−1, reversible capacities of 1253.8 and 288.7 mAhg−1 at 20 mAg−1, and rate capabilities i.e., 362.4 and 108.1 mAhg−1 at 1600 mAg−1, for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The results revealed that the rate capability and the reversible specific capacity of the 1 % vanadium oxide doped carbon microfibers (V1@CMFs) are significantly superior compared to the pristine and previous reports. Here, the incorporation of just 1 % vanadium oxide acts as a pillar, enhancing the stability and conductivity of the carbon. Thus, the present work highlights the utility of molecularly doped GICs as potential anode materials for LIBs/SIBs.",

        "title": "Enhanced Sodium Ion Storage in Interlayer Expanded Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes.",
        "abstract": "We report an effective approach of utilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an active anode material in sodium ion batteries by expanding the interlayer distance in a few outer layers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The performance enhancement was investigated using a density functional tight binding (DFTB) molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that a sodium atom forms a stable bonding with the partially expanded MWCNT (PECNT) with the binding energy of -1.50 eV based on the density functional theory calculation with van der Waals correction, where a sodium atom is caged between the two carbon hexagons in the two consecutive MWCNTs. Wave function and charge density analyses show that this binding is physisorption in nature. This larger exothermic nature of binding energy favors the stable bonding between the PECNT and a sodium atom, and thereby, it helps to enhance the electrochemical performance. In the experimental works, partial opening of the MWCNT with the expanded interlayer has been designed by the well-known Hummer's method. It has been found that the introduction of functional groups causes a partial opening of the outer few layers of a MWCNT, with the inner core remaining undisturbed. The enhanced performance is due to an expanded interlayer of carbon nanotubes, which provide sufficient active sites for the sodium ions to adsorb as well as to intercalate into the carbon structure. The PECNT shows a high specific capacity of 510 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1, which is about 2.3 times the specific capacity obtained for a pristine MWCNT at the same current density. This specific capacity is higher when compared to other carbon-based materials. The PECNT also shows a satisfactory cyclic stability at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for 100 cycles. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, an alternative perspective for the storage of sodium ions in MWCNTs is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

The resulting materials exhibited superior performance as the anode in lithium ion batteries (LIBs): they provide high reversible specific capacity (1144 mAh/g), excellent cyclability (nearly no capacity loss after 1000 cycles) and rate performance (805 mAh/g at 15 A/g). In addition, the hierarchical NiO/Ni/Graphene composites demonstrated promising performance as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Such a superior lithium and sodium storage performance is derived from the well-designed hierarchical hollow ball-in-ball structure of NiO/Ni/Graphene composites, which not only mitigates the volume expansion of NiO during the cycles but also provides a continuous highly conductive graphene matrix to facilitate the fast charge transfer and form a stable SEI layer.",

        "abstract": "As a promising anode material for Na‐metal batteries, the practical application of Na metal is severely hindered due to the formation of the notorious dendrite and unstable solid‐electrolyte interface (SEI). To address these issues, a direct‐ink writing (DIW) 3D printing technology is proposed to construct an artificial 3D hierarchical porous sodiophilic Nb2CTx/reduced graphene‐oxide (Nb2CTx/rGO) aerogel monolith, which is employed as the matrix of Na metal anode. Benefiting from the homogeneous ion flux and exceptional sodiophilic features, the Nb2CTx nanoflakes embedded within the 3D scaffold regulate the uniform deposition of metallic Na with a stable SEI layer, achieving an ultralong cycle lifespan of 3000 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2 and an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.68% over extended lifespan of 7064 h. Further, the in‐depth characterization analysis proves that the formed stable SEI layer consists of an inorganic NaF accumulated in the inner layer and loosely‐bound organic species in the outer layer. Remarkably, when integrated into a Na metal full cell, the reversible capacity reaches 90.22 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1.

The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by V O /V S and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge-transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x and Li/Na through heterostructure.

        "abstract": "Sodium-based dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) have become a new type of energy storage device with great application value because of their high operating voltage, high energy density, and low cost. However, transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) anodes show unsatisfactory Na+ electrochemical performance owing to the low intrinsic conductivity and inferior ion transport kinetics. Here, an elaborate design is developed to prepare a composite of WSSe nanosheets supported on a 3D cross-networked porous carbon skeleton (WSSe@CPCS), which possesses en-rich anion vacancies and WSSe with expanded inter-layer spacing, as well as an interconnected porous structure. As a result, the WSSe@CPCS anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibits preeminent reversible capacities, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capability. The systematic electrochemical kinetic analysis and density functional theory results further show that the effect of anion vacancies and CPCS synergistically enhances the conductivity and reduces charge transfer resistance, thus making a great contribution to fast reaction kinetics. Finally, the implementations of the WSSe@CPCS anode in progressive SIB and DIB full-cell configurations exhibit satisfactory performance, which reveals their widely practical application. This research will provide an exciting approach to designing advanced defect-structured tungsten-based TMD materials for SIBs, DIBs, and even a broad range of energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon materials are preferred as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their abundance, low price, and environmental friendliness. However, doping-based modification usually induces low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), which seriously affects the practical application of carbon materials. In this work, Fe-modified N/S co-doped porous carbon is prepared using the salt template method. Fe, N, and S are uniformly distributed on the porous carbon to form an interwoven network structure, providing abundant active sites. Moreover, during the electrochemical reaction, FeNx effectively catalyzes the generation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film, which reduces the consumption of Na+ in the side reaction, leading to a high initial coulombic efficiency, and at the same time, the stabilized SEI film accelerates the diffusion of electrons and ions, effectively enhancing the multiplication rate performance. The NFSC exhibits a high specific capacity (371.3 mAh/g) by the co-coordination strategy and a high ICE (85.9 %). This study provides new ideas for research based on the modification of carbon materials.",

        "abstract": "With hollow cubic CoSn(OH)6 as the precursor and flake ZIFs as the skeleton, a bimetallic selenide SCS consisting of CoSe2 and SnSe was prepared by selenidation, which showed excellent sodium storage performance. The high capacity and excellent cycle stability of SCS are closely related to its structure. The SCS prepared in this work is composed of isolated nanosheets, on which cubic nanoparticles are evenly distributed. The nanosheets composed of CoSe2 and MOF-derived carbon is assembled into a grid structure that acts as a support and separator, ensuring the electrical contact of active materials during the cycle, and reducing the agglomeration of active sodium storage nanoparticles. Cubic nanoparticles also inhibit the collapse and disordered accumulation of nanosheets during the middle temperature selenidation process. The isolated card-shaped structure helps to maintain the stability of electrode structure, and the composition of bimetallic selenides provides high sodium storage capacity. At high current density of 5 ​A ​g−1, the discharge capacity of SCS can maintain 335 mAh·g−1 after 500 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted more interest as an alternative to Lithium-ion batteries because of the abundance and cost effectiveness. However, searching for suitable anode materials with high-rate and stable cycling performance is still needed to promote their practical application. Herein, three-dimensional Na2Ti3O7 nanowire arrays with enriched surface vacancies endowed by phosphorus doping are reported. When evaluated as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, the electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 290 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, good rate capability (50 mAh g-1 at 20 C), and stable cycling capability (98% capacity retention over 3100 cycles at 20 C). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the unique nanowire arrays and phosphorus doping. The rational structures can provide convenient channels to facilitate ions/electrons transport and improve the capacitive contributions. Moreover, the phosphorus-doping-induced surface vacancies not only provide more active sites but also improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of Na2Ti3O7, which will enable the electrode materials with excellent sodium storage performance.

        "abstract": "Room-temperature Na ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention because of the widely available, abundant sodium resources and potentially low cost. Currently, the challenge of the NIB development is due primarily to the lack of a high-performance anode, while the Na metal anode holds great promise considering its highest specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and lowest anodic potential. However, an uneven deposit, relatively infinite volume change, and dendritic growth upon plating/stripping cycles cause a low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and severe safety concerns. Here, a stable Na carbonized wood (Na-wood) composite anode was fabricated via a rapid melt infusion (about 5 s) into channels of carbonized wood by capillary action. The channels function as a high-surface-area, conductive, mechanically stable skeleton, which lowers the effective current density, ensures a uniform Na nucleation, and restricts the volume change over cycles. As a result, the Na-wood composite anode exhibited flat plating/stripping profiles with smaller overpotentials and stable cycling performance over 500 h at 1.0 mA/cm2 in a common carbonate electrolyte system. In sharp comparison, the planar Na metal electrode showed a much shorter cycle life of 100 h under the same test conditions.",

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most promising candidates for sodium-ion battery anodes, hard carbons suffer from inferior rate performance owing to limited ion transfer rate and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. In this work, novel carbon nanosheets (CNS) with hexagonal ordered conical macropores are prepared. The CNS has a very thin thickness of approximately 370 nm, and the conical pores are penetrated through the whole nanosheet, forming well-connected ion transport freeway. In addition, the carbon microcrystal structure and interlayer spacing can be well tailored by adjusting the carbonization temperature, thereby controlling the sodium storage behavior of carbon electrodes. These structural merits endow CNS with accelerated ion transfer, minimized ion diffusion distance and fast electrochemical kinetics. Consequently, the CNS presents superior electrochemical performance. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 298 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1; and after repeated charge/discharge for 500 times at 1 A g−1, its capacity remains 195 mA h g−1, with no rapid capacity loss. More importantly, CNS exhibits outstanding rate capability. Even under a very high current density of 2 A g−1, it still displays a large capacity of 210 mAh g−1, higher than most of state-of-the-art carbon anodes.",

However, the infeasibility of graphite and silicon electrodes in sodium-ion storage makes it urgent to develop high-performance anode materials. Herein, α-MnSe nanorods derived from δ-MnO2 (δ-α-MnSe) are constructed as anodes for SIBs. It is verified that α-MnSe will be transferred into β-MnSe after the initial Na-ion insertion/extraction, and δ-α-MnSe undergoes typical conversion mechanism using a Mn-ion for charge compensation in the subsequent charge-discharge process. First-principles calculations support that Na-ion migration in defect-free α-MnSe can drive the lattice distortion to phase transition (alpha → beta) in thermodynamics and dynamics. The formed β-MnSe with robust lattice structure and small Na-ion diffusion barrier boosts great structure stability and electrochemical kinetics. Hence, the δ-α-MnSe electrode contributes excellent rate capability and superior cyclic stability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles and low decay rate of 0.0267% per cycle. Na-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 281.2 Wh·kg-1 and outstanding cyclability demonstrate the applicability of δ-α-MnSe anode.",

In this work, a simple electrospinning method has been used to synthesize In2S3/C nanofibers for the first time. In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can not only deliver a high initial reversible specific capacity of 696.4 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, but also shows ultra-long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.5% after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the In2S3/C nanofibers electrode can exhibit a high initial reversible specific capacity (393.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 97.3% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties mainly benefited from In2S3 being encapsulated by a carbon matrix, which buffers the volume expansion and significantly improves the conductivity of the composite. Furthermore, the structural evolution of In2S3 during the first lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes has been illustrated by ex situ XRD. The results confirm that the reaction mechanism of In2S3 in both LIBs and SIBs can be summarized as conversion reactions and alloying reactions, which provide theoretical support for the development of In2S3 in the field of electrochemistry.",

        "abstract": "Owing to several advantages of metallic sodium (Na), such as a relatively high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, wide availability, and low cost, Na metal batteries are being extensively studied, which are expected to play a major role in the fields of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to utilizing MXene-based materials for suppressing Na dendrites, achieving a stable cycling of Na metal anodes remains extremely challenging due to, for example, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the severe side reactions. Herein, a g-C3N4 layer was attached in situ on the Ti3C2 MXene surface, inducing a surface state reconstruction and thus forming a stable hetero-interphase with excellent sodiophilicity between the MXene and g-C3N4 to inhibit side reactions and guide uniform Na ion flux. The 3D construction can not only lower the local current density to facilitate uniform Na plating/stripping but also mitigate volume change to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interphase. Thus, the 3D Ti3C2 MXene@g-C3N4 nanocomposite enables much enhanced average CEs (99.9% at 1 mA h cm-2, 0.5 mA cm-2) in asymmetric half cells, long-term stability (up to 700 h) for symmetric cells, and stable cycling (up to 800 cycles at 2 C), together with outstanding rate capability (up to 20 C), of full cells.

The sodium (Na) has abundant resources in the earth's crust and its physicochemical properties are similar to Li, which ensure that sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as a substitute for LIBs in certain fields. Unfortunately, the lower energy density of SIBs limits its application range. Therefore, studying high specific capacity anode materials to improve the energy density of batteries is an important direction of SIBs. Red‐phosphorus (P)‐based anode materials are ideal candidates for high energy density SIBs because of their high theoretical specific capacity and suitable working voltage. However, the red‐P‐based anode materials for SIBs meet intractable challenges in terms of the poor electrical conductivity and huge volume changes during cycling, resulting in inferior electrochemical performances. In this article, the research progress of red‐P‐based anode material for SIBs in recent years, including the red‐P/carbon composite, element‐doped composite, metal phosphide, and stable interface design, is reviewed. Herein, the decisive role is highlighted that composite design with highly conductive carbon materials plays in addressing the challenges associated with red‐P‐based anodes and a perspective on their development direction is given.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries are a promising alternative to lithium ion technology, however their sluggish sodiation kinetics currently hinder performance. Here the authors fabricate ultrathin layered tin(II) sulfide nanostructures displaying a pseudocapacitance contribution for high capacity sodium ion anodes. Sodium-ion batteries are a potentially low-cost and safe alternative to the prevailing lithium-ion battery technology. However, it is a great challenge to achieve fast charging and high power density for most sodium-ion electrodes because of the sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here we demonstrate a high-capacity and high-rate sodium-ion anode based on ultrathin layered tin(II) sulfide nanostructures, in which a maximized extrinsic pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. The graphene foam supported tin(II) sulfide nanoarray anode delivers a high reversible capacity of ∼1,100 mAh g^−1 at 30 mA g^−1 and ∼420 mAh g^−1 at 30 A g^−1, which even outperforms its lithium-ion storage performance. The surface-dominated redox reaction rendered by our tailored ultrathin tin(II) sulfide nanostructures may also work in other layered materials for high-performance sodium-ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), particularly for large-scale applications. Alloy-type anode materials for sodium-ion batteries are esteemed as prospective candidate materials for sodium-ion anodes, owing to their elevated theoretical capacity, heightened utilization efficiency, and minimal production of insulating byproducts. However, the severe volume changes and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics can lead to irreversible particle fragmentation and reaggregation phenomena, ultimately resulting in electrode degradation. Additionally, repetitive volume changes can cause an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This study presents the synthesis of chloride-ion-modulated bimetallic SnSb/C nanoparticle anode materials, highlighting the following advantages: (i) Designing a bimetallic SnSb alloy structure serves to buffer the structural stresses generated during sodium insertion/extraction processes, effectively mitigating particle fracture phenomena induced by electrode material expansion/contraction. (ii) Nanostructuring both alloy materials enables the full utilization of active materials and shortens diffusion pathways, thereby significantly enhancing the diffusion rate of sodium ions. (iii) Introducing a carbonaceous matrix serves to alleviate self-agglomeration phenomena of the material during charge/discharge cycles, enhancing the material's conductivity and structural stability. (iv) Utilizing chloride-ion interface modification to achieve a chloride-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) enhances battery performance.",

        "abstract": "The development of advanced electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is crucial for the progression of energy storage technologies. In this study, we successfully fabricated V_5S_8/CoS nanoparticles confined within self-supported carbon nanofibers (CNFs) using a facile electrospinning method followed by a sulfidation process. Extensive characterization of the resulting V_5S_8/CoS-CNFs revealed their unique structural attributes, featuring a one-dimensional nanofiber morphology with enhanced Na^+ transport pathways. In addition, V_5S_8 and CoS are typical semiconductors and have greater compatibility at the interface, which can enhance the synergistic effect in the composite. These V_5S_8/CoS-CNFs exhibited a remarkable reversible capacity of 201 mAh g^−1 even at a high current density of 5 A g^−1, along with a stable cycling performance of 165 mAh g^−1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g^−1. The incorporation of both V_5S_8 and CoS within the nanofiber structure substantially enhanced the pseudocapacitance effect, thereby improving sodium storage capabilities. The exceptional electrochemical properties of the binder-free V_5S_8/CoS-CNFs anode can be attributed to its heterogeneous composition embedded within CNFs. This composition effectively boosts the rate of sodium ion diffusion by generating a built-in electric field (BEF) at the V_5S_8 and CoS interface, alleviating volume stress during charge–discharge processes and enhancing overall conductivity. Our findings underscore the potential of V_5S_8/CoS-CNFs as high-performance anode materials for SIBs, offering valuable insights into the design and development of advanced electrode materials for future energy storage applications.",

When evaluated as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, the Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 /CFC electrode manifests an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high discharge capacity of 1541.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a good capacity retention of 80.1% at 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles.

The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively.

The large reversible capacity of 105 mA h g-1 is also achieved even at a high rate of 10C, indicating high-rate capability. Besides, the full-cells using this nanocomposite as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode exhibit long-term cycle-life and high-power properties, indicating the expected merits of layered/spinel mixed phases.

The gravimetric capacity is found to be 50 mA h/g for bulk Fe3O4 (50 nm average crystallite size) and 100 mA h/g─about a tenth of the theoretical prediction for complete conversion─for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (8.7 nm average particle size), respectively. A fundamental and mechanistic study of material evolution as functions of DoD and SoC shows that Fe3O4 does not allow electrochemical incorporation of Na+ ions into the empty cation positions of the inverse spinel structure, leading to our assertion that electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions to conversion of the Fe3O4 anode in sodium-ion batteries is nonviable. A density functional theory investigation points to the impracticality of the intercalation of Na+ ions into Fe3O4 and further validates our experimental findings. We propose several possible mechanisms corresponding to the observed low capacity, including formation of solid electrolyte interphases with unfavorable properties and adsorption of Na+ ions onto surfaces of nanoparticles and/or at heterointerfaces in Fe3O4 composite electrodes in a NaPF6-based electrolyte system.",

It delivers a high reversible capacity of 597.5 and 175 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 and 5.0 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation. All above results prove that the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite has a good prospect of application as an anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The practical application of hard carbon in sodium‐ion batteries is limited by insufficient reversible capacity and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which are caused by the lack of active sites and unstable electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a biomass‐derived hard carbon material based on tea stems is proposed, which exhibits an ultrahigh ICE of 90.8%. This remarkable ICE is attributed to the presence of an inorganic‐rich, thin, and robust solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. Furthermore, the material demonstrates excellent cycling stability, showing a capacity retention of 99.5% after 500 cycles at 280 mA g−1. Additionally, when it works as the anode material in a sodium‐ion full cell without presodiation, it reaches a high energy density of 212 Wh kg−1 and a superior stability, e.g., retaining 93.1 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 91.3%. The sodium storage capacity of this material is primarily attributed to a combined adsorption‐intercalation/filling effect as confirmed by in situ XRD and ex situ Raman analyses. These findings make this biomass‐derived hard carbon material a promising candidate for commercial application of sodium‐ion batteries, achieving high performance at low cost.",

Herein, with the assistance of a simple calcination method and common raw materials, the environmentally friendly and nontoxic N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 composite is directly synthesized and proved to be a potential anode material for NIBs. The composite demonstrates a high reversible charge capacity of 446.2 mAh g−1 and a safe and suitable average voltage of 0.69 V, together with application potential in full cells (discharge capacity of 98.4 mAh g−1 and long cycle performance of 300 cycles at 1000 mA g−1). In addition, the sodium‐ion storage mechanism of N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 is subsequently studied through air‐insulated ex situ characterizations of X‐ray diffraction (XRD), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, and is found to be rather different from previous reports on borate anode materials for NIBs and lithium‐ion batteries. The reaction mechanism is deduced and proposed as: Zn3B2O6 + 6Na+ + 6e− ⇋ 3Zn + B2O3 ∙ 3Na2O, which indicates that the generated boracic phase is electrochemically active and participates in the later discharge/charge progress.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfide‐based anodes usually suffer from huge volumetric change and sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering their application for long‐term and high‐power/energy sodium‐ion batteries. Herein, a new design of CoS2‐xSex (0≤x≤2) nanocrystals with highly controllable selenium substitution and S, Se‐codoped graphene immobilization (CoS2‐xSex@SG) is proposed to tune the reaction kinetics and structural stability. The nanocrystal‐on‐graphene structure and robust C─S &C─Se bonding rivets between CoS2‐xSex and SG greatly improve the structural stability of the CoS2‐xSex@SG. Electrochemical performance, kinetic analysis, and theoretical calculation reveal that Se substitution plays a double‐edged role in sodium storage: the increase of Se substitution content enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics but decreases the Na‐storage capacity. When the Se substitution content is 0.4, the CoS1.6Se0.4@SG electrode demonstrates the best performance: high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.5%), ultrahigh rate capability (412.8 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1), and ultra‐stable cycling performance (97.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). In situ/ex situ measurements further unveil that the conversion reaction between Co0 and Na2S/Na2Se generates the micro‐scaled CoSe2–CoS2 heterostructure, synergistically improving the Na‐storage active sites and reaction kinetics. This work provides a controllable anion substitution strategy to balance the Na+ storage active sites and kinetics with potential applications for high‐power/energy sodium‐ion batteries.",

Here, the authors report a source-template synthetic strategy to prepare carbon-coated MoS_1.5Te_0.5 nanocables and their use as anode active materials in Na-based dual ion cells. Sodium-based dual-ion batteries have received increased attention owing to their appealing cell voltage (i.e., >3 V) and cost-effective features.

In this work, the electrochemical properties of CuS anode material has been successfully enhanced by its composite formation using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The CuS nanoparticles are distributed evenly in the exfoliated g-C3N4 matrix rendering higher electronic conductivity and space for volume alterations during the repeated discharge/charge cycles. The 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite when used as an anode for lithium ion coin cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 478.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 1000 cycles which is better than that reported for CuS composites with any other carbon-based matrix. The performance is equally impressive when 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite is used as an anode in a sodium ion coin cell and a reversible capacity of 408 mA h g−1 is obtained at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 800 cycles. A sodium ion full cell with NVP cathode and 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite anode has been fabricated and cycled for 100 runs at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1. It can be inferred that the g-C3N4 matrix improves the ion transfer properties, alleviates the volume alteration happening in the anode during the discharge/charge process and also helps in preventing the leaching of polysulfides generated during the electrochemical process.",

        "abstract": "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two-stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na-Sb alloys than Li-Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large-volume-change electrode materials.",

Sn nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon layers were distributed uniformly on the surfaces of the N-doped carbon nanotubes. The electrochemical performances of the composites were systematically investigated as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The composite electrode could attain a good reversible capacity of 398.4 mAh g-1 when discharging at 100 mA g-1, with capacity retention of 67.3% and very high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 150 cycles. This good cycling performance, when compared to only 17.5 mAh g-1 delivered by bare Sn particles prepared via the same method without the presence of N-doped carbon, could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of the precursor SnO2 on the substrate of N-doped carbon tubes with three-dimensional structure, which provides more reaction sites to reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, further facilitating Na+-ion diffusion and relieves the huge volume expansion during charging/discharging. These outcomes imply that such a Sn/C composite would provide more options as an anode candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Major challenges in developing 2D transition-metal disulfides (TMDs) as anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) lie in rational design and targeted synthesis of TMD-based nanocomposite structures with precisely controlled ion and electron transport. Herein, a general and scalable solvent-exchange strategy is presented for uniform dispersion of few-layer MoS2 (f-MoS2 ) from high-boiling-point solvents (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethyl formaldehyde (DMF), etc.) into low-boiling-point solvents (water, ethanol, etc.). The solvent-exchange strategy dramatically simplifies high-yield production of dispersible MoS2 nanosheets as well as facilitates subsequent decoration of MoS2 for various applications. As a demonstration, MoS2 -decorated nitrogen-rich carbon spheres (MoS2 -NCS) are prepared via in situ growth of polypyrrole and subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting from its ultrathin feature, largely exposed active surface, highly conductive framework and excellent structural integrity, the 2D core-shell architecture of MoS2 -NCS exhibits an outstanding reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, achieving high initial discharge capacity of 1087.5 and 508.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , capacity retentions of 95.6% and 94.2% after 500 and 250 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 , for lithium/sodium ion storages, respectively.",

During the synthesis process of SiO2 templates, the abundant surface functional groups of CDs interact strongly with the functional groups (hydroxyl groups, etc.) possessed by silicic acid and TEOS, thereby inhibiting the growth of SiO2 spheres. By changing the content of CDs added, the size of the SiO2 template changes accordingly. A series of nano-hollow carbon spheres were prepared through high-temperature treatment of as-obtained SiO2 spheres coated with PDA and then acid washing. Among them, HCN-60 with optimized size and hollow structure exhibited excellent potassium/sodium storage performance. This research provides a new idea for the rational design of high-performance carbon anodes.",

        "abstract": "Autonomic self-healing (SH), namely, the ability to repair damages from mechanical stress spontaneously, is polarizing attention in the field of new-generation electrochemical devices. This property is highly attractive to enhance the durability of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) or Na-ion batteries (SIBs), where high-performing anode active materials (silicon, phosphorus, etc.) are strongly affected by volume expansion and phase changes upon ion insertion. Here, we applied a SH strategy, based on the dynamic quadruple hydrogen bonding, to nanosized black phosphorus (BP) anodes for Na-ion cells. The goal is to overcome drastic capacity decay and short lifetime, resulting from mechanical damages induced by the volumetric expansion/contraction upon sodiation/desodiation. Specifically, we developed novel ureidopyrimidinone (UPy)-telechelic systems and related blends with poly(ethylene oxide) as novel and green binders alternative to the more conventional ones, such as polyacrylic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, which are typically used in SIBs. BP anodes show impressively improved (more than 6 times) capacity retention when employing the new SH polymeric blend. In particular, the SH electrode still works at a current density higher than 3.5 A g–1, whereas the standard BP electrode exhibits very poor performances already at current densities lower than 0.5 A g–1. This is the result of better adhesion, buffering properties, and spontaneous damage reparation.",

However, its electrochemical performance at high rates is still not acceptable. Herein, we synthesized a TiO2/C nanofiber material by the electrospinning method, and introduced air plasma treatments to modify the obtained material. Characterization results indicate that after the plasma treatments, the C fibers may have reacted with the plasma, and the surface areas of the nanofibers are increased. Electrochemical tests show this plasma treatment may be beneficial to the rate performance. The TiO2/C nanofiber with plasma treatment could deliver a high redox capacity of 191 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a very high rate of 10C (3300 mA g−1). The superior effects of the plasma treatment on the rate performance may provide new insights for developing better materials for practical sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Achieving commercial viability for more sustainable sodium‐ion batteries (SIB) necessitates reducing the environmental impact of production, particularly originating from electrode drying and the use of toxic solvents like N‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (NMP). This study presents the dry‐processing of commercial P2‐type Na0.75Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.50O2 (NFM) via the DRYtraec® process, aiming to lower the binder content of 1 wt.% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and eliminating the need for electrode drying and NMP recovery. Assessments of electrode morphology and active material crystallinity were conducted to gauge the effects of mechanical stress during processing. The resulting cathodes, loaded at a commercially relevant 2.3‐2.7 mAh cm‐2 loading, were successfully paired with aqueous‐processed hard carbon (HC) anodes, demonstrating stable performance in full‐cells. Comparative analysis with entirely wet‐processed electrodes revealed comparable capacity accessibility and comparable long‐term stability. This showed the competitiveness of dry‐processed cathodes. Finally, the integration of NMP‐free, dry‐processed cathodes and aqueous‐processed anodes was scaled to the commercially relevant prototype pouch‐cell. The cell demonstrates stable cycling for 400 cycles with an energy density of 102 Wh kg‐1 as well as reduced processing costs and environmental footprint.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon, with its abundant resources, low cost, and high specific capacity, is wildly accepted as the most promising anode material of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, current half-cell test method for assessing the available specific capacity of hard carbon faces challenges. Typically, the constant voltage or low current discharge strategy is typically adopted at the end of the discharge process to minimize the influence of polarization. Unfortunately, owing to the potential of constant voltage or low current discharge stage is close to the sodium deposition potential, there is a risk of sodium plating on hard carbon anode, making the sodiation capacity from half-cell test is difficult to be fully employed in full-cell system. In light of this, this work proposes an improved half-cell test strategy that fits the dQ/dV curve of the desodiation process of hard carbon at over-sodiated states, allowing for a more accurate determination of the available capacity of the hard carbon. Moreover, the reliability of this strategy is verified in 21700 cylindrical cells through different anode capacity design. This work provides a reliable methodology for capacity design of hard carbon anode in practical full-cell system and accelerates the commercialization of SIBs.",

This unique design enables the electrode to possess good structural stability, superior charge transfer kinetics, and low polarization.

The oxygenic groups suppress pitch softening and molecular rearrangement during carbonization, resulting in a highly disordered structure and substantially closed pores in the obtained HC materials. As a result, the optimized HC materials achieve a specific capacity of 321.7 mAh g-1 with a significant 80.5% increase over typical pitch-based carbon materials, along with a high initial Coulombic efficiency up to 88.5 and 88.3% capacity retention after 600 cycles.

        "abstract": "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) anode holds the merits of high capacity (∼660 mA h/g) and good conductivity (2.5 × 106 S m−1). Nevertheless, it still suffers from uncontrolled volumetric expansion (VE: 390 %) during cycling. Herein, a 3D honeycombed carbon structure is designed to regulate the huge VE to obtain Sb@C composite. It can deliver an unparalleled reversible capacity with fantastic long-term cycling stability (500 mA g−1@1050 mA h/g@5000 cycles@99.9 % retention) during 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V voltage window. In-situ XRD patterns profoundly clarify the mechanism for excess Na-storage as double reaction processes: alloying/de-alloying (Sb + 3Na ⇋ Na3Sb) during 2.5 ∼ 0.01 V and Na-plating/stripping into/from C skeleton (C + 9Na ⇋ Na9C) during 0.01 ∼ -0.05 V. Furthermore, electrochemical performance in different electrolytes (ether and ester) are much better cycling capacity and stability. In-situ EIS tests verify the far lower polarization throughout an entire charge–discharge in ether electrolyte during 2.5 ∼ -0.05 V. In addition, during Na-plating process, it is confirmed that Sb@C possesses lower binding energy (−2.19 eV) and diffusion energy barrier (0.2943 eV) by theoretical calculation. Hence, this work is inspiring in electrode materials design for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",

In the field of energy storage, sodium-ion batteries have been limited by the lack of appropriate anode materials, and hard carbon stands out as the most promising candidate. Therefore, this study focuses on the preparation of biomass-derived carbons from three invasive plant species, namely Spartina alterniflora Loisel., Solidago canadensis L., and Erigeron canadensis L., through high-temperature carbonization. The resulting biomass carbons are then subjected to cleaning and activation processes to prepare sodium-ion anode materials. The internal structure of the materials was characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and BET. The materials exhibited a significant amount of pore structures, with interlayer spacing around 0.37 nm, which is larger than the original graphite interlayer spacing. The plant anode materials were assembled into full batteries for cyclic charge/discharge tests. The results show that all three anode materials have good multiplicative performance and excellent cyclable charge/discharge. After 100 cycles at a current of 50 mA in the voltage range of 0–3.0 V, the reversible capacities of the three materials reached 245.3, 207.19, and 227.12 mAh/g, respectively.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered one of the most promising anode candidates for sodium ion batteries but suffers from a moderate rate performance. Here, we design microporous carbon nanospheres using a novel hybrid monomer that simultaneously involves an organic moiety and an inorganic moiety as the starting unit. The inorganic moiety forms a continuous network, which serves as a 3D scaffold and a nanometer-scale template, then supports the off-collapse of the carbon skeleton and creates a well-developed microporous structure. In addition, the graphite microcrystal structure can be tailored by adjusting the heating treatment temperatures. The electrochemical study demonstrates that the microporous carbon nanospheres show dominant capacitive sodium storage behavior, thus presenting an outstanding rate performance. Even if a very high current density of 10 A g-1 is applied, the hard carbon anode can deliver a large capacity of 127 mAh g-1 with a considerable plateau capacity of 53 mAh g-1, which has rarely been obtained in previous publications. Besides, the carbon anode has a good cycling stability, and the capacity reached 210 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with a current density of 1 A g-1, showing no dramatic capacity loss.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion batteries are being pursued as viable alternatives to lithium (Li)-ion batteries because of their reasonable cost and enormous potential in application scale-up for energy storage systems in the future. However, it is difficult to identify electrode materials capable of accommodating the large ionic radius of Na-ions which makes Na-ion batteries exhibit slower intercalation kinetics than Li-ion batteries. Spinel ferrite is of interest because of its high theoretical capacity derived from multiple oxidation states. Herein, CoFe_2O_4 nanoparticles were successfully prepared using the ball milling technique, followed by calcination at 700℃ and 800℃ with varying calcination time. CoFe_2O_4 calcined at 700℃ for 2 h exhibited a uniform distribution of small particles (0.12 μm) and crystallites (45.89 nm). The electrode possesses high reversible capacity (178 mAh g^−1 at 0.1 C rate), reasonable cyclability (140 mAh g^−1 after 100 cycles) with 79% capacitive retention. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the CoFe_2O_4 electrode may be ascribed to its homogeneous distribution and fine particle size, which in turn decrease the Na-ion pathway and accelerate Na-ion transport within the electrode material.",

Here, for the first time, calcium lignosulfonate (LSCa), one papermaking waste, is explored as a novel low‐cost precursor for carbon materials of SIBs. The optimized LSCa‐derived carbon delivers a high reversible capacity of 317 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 with ~60% plateau capacity, and it retains a capacity of 170 mA h g−1 even at 3000 mA g−1.

        "abstract": "Tin oxide (SnO) is considered one of the most promising metal oxides for utilization as anode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of its ease of synthesis, high specific gravimetric capacity, and satisfactory cycling performance. However, to aim at practical applications, the Coulombic efficiency during cycling needs to be further improved, which requires a deeper knowledge of its working mechanism. Here, a microflower-shaped SnO material is synthesized by means of an ultrafast ionic liquid-assisted microwave method. The as-prepared SnO anode active material exhibits excellent cycling performance, good Coulombic efficiency as well as a large capacity delivered at low potential, which is fundamental to maximize the energy output of SIBs. These overall merits were never reported before for pure SnO anodes (i.e., not in a composite with, for example, graphene). Additionally, by combining ex situ XRD and XPS, it is clearly demonstrated for the first time that the Sn-Na alloy, which is formed during the initial sodium sodiation, desodiates in two successive but fully separated steps. Totally different from the previous report, the pristine SnO phase is not regenerated upon desodiation up to 3 V vs Na/Na+. The newly disclosed reaction route provides an alternative view of the complex reaction mechanism of these families of metal oxides for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Highly porous carbon materials with a rationally designed pore structure can be utilized as reservoirs for metal or nonmetal components. The use of small-sized metal or metal compound nanoparticles, completely encapsulated by carbon materials, has attracted significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing sodium ion storage properties. These materials have the ability to mitigate structural collapse caused by volume expansion during the charging process, enable short ion transport length, and prevent polysulfide elution. In this study, a concept of highly porous carbon-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres, which serve as excellent reservoir materials is suggested and a porous microsphere is developed by encapsulating iron sulfide nanocrystals within the highly porous carbon-coated CNTs using a sulfidation process. Furthermore, various sulfidation processes to determine the optimal method for achieving complete encapsulation are investigated by comparing the morphologies of diverse iron sulfide-carbon composites. The fully encapsulated structure, combined with the porous carbon, provides ample space to accommodate the significant volume changes during cycling. As a result, the porous iron sulfide-carbon-CNT composite microspheres exhibited outstanding cycling stability (293 mA h g-1 over 600 cycles at 1 A g-1 ) and remarkable rate capability (100 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Amorphous carbon holds great promise as anode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its cost‐effectiveness and good performance. However, its sodium storage mechanism, particularly the insertion process and origin of plateau capacity, remains controversial. Here, an extended adsorption/insertion‐filling sodium storage mechanism is proposed using petroleum coke‐derived amorphous carbon as a multi‐microcrystalline model. Combining in situ X‐ray diffraction, in situ Raman, theoretical calculations, and neutron scattering, the effective storage form and location of sodium ions in amorphous carbon are revealed. The sodium adsorption at defect sites leads to a high‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium insertion process occurs in both the pseudo‐graphite phase (d 002 > 0.370 nm) and graphite‐like phase (0.345 ≤ d 002 < 0.370 nm) rather than the graphite phase, contributing to low‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium filling into accessible closed pores forms quasi‐metallic sodium clusters, contributing to plateau capacity. The threshold of the effective interlayer spacing for sodium insertion is extended to 0.345 nm, breaking the consensus of insertion interlayer threshold and enhancing understanding of closed pore filling. The extended adsorption/insertion‐filling mechanism explains the sodium storage behavior of amorphous carbon with different microstructures, providing theoretical guidance for the rational design of high‐performance amorphous carbon anodes.",

Nevertheless, due to a lack of direct atomistic observation, the detailed understanding of fundamental intercalation behavior and Bi2S3's (de)sodiation mechanisms remains unclear. Here, by employing in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy, consecutive electron diffraction coupled with theoretical calculations, it is not only for the first time identified that Bi2S3 exhibits specific ionic transport pathways preferred to diffuse along the (110) direction instead of the (200) plane, but also tracks their real‐time phase transformations (de)sodiation involving multi‐step crystallographic tuning. The finite‐element analysis further disclosed multi‐reaction induced deformation and the relevant stress evolution originating from the combined effect of the mechanical and electrochemical interaction.

        "abstract": "As a promising pathway toward low-cost, long-duration energy storage, rechargeable sodium batteries are of increasing interest. Batteries that incorporate metallic sodium as anode promise a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g-1 , and low reduction potential of -2.71 V. The high reactivity and poor electrochemical reversibility of sodium anodes render sodium metal anode (SMA) cells among the most challenging for practical implementation. Here, the failure mechanisms of Na anodes are investigated and the authors report that loss of morphological control is not the fundamental cause of failure. Rather, it is the inherently poor anchoring/root structure of electrodeposited Na to the electrode substrate that leads to poor reversibility and cell failure. Poorly anchored Na deposits are prone to break away from the current collector, producing orphaning and poor anode utilization. Thin metallic coatings in a range of chemistries are proposed and evaluated as SMA substrates. Based on thermodynamic and ion transport considerations, such substrates undergo reversible alloying reactions with Na and are hypothesized to promote good root growth-regardless of the morphology. Among the various options, Au stands out for its ability to support long Na anode lifetime and high reversibility (Coulombic Efficiency > 98%), for coating thicknesses in the range of 10-1000 nm. As a first step toward evaluating practical utility of the anodes, their performance in Na||SPAN cells with N:P ratio close to 1:1 is evaluated.",

In addition, rapid charge-discharge battery systems require electrolytes with high Na-ion transport properties. Herein, we demonstrate a stable and high-rate sodium-metal battery enabled by a nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solution composed of a weakly coordinating polyanion-type Na salt, poly[(4-styrenesulfonyl)-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (poly(NaSTFSI)) copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in a propylene carbonate solution. It was found that this concentrated polyelectrolyte solution exhibited a remarkably high Na-ion transference number (tNaPP = 0.9) and a high ionic conductivity (σ = 1.1 mS cm-1) at 60 °C. Furthermore, the surface of the Na electrode was modified with polyanion chains anchored via the partial decomposition of the electrolyte. The surface-tethered polyanion layer effectively suppressed the subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte, thereby enabling stable Na deposition/dissolution cycling.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted worldwide attention as potential alternatives for large scale stationary energy storage due to the rich reserves and low cost of sodium resources. However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is restricted by unsatisfying capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel mechanism of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer is proposed by fabricating a graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of heterostructures between ultrafine SnO2 and Co3O4 could enhance the charge transfer of interfaces owing to the internal electric field. The pseudocapacitive effect, which is led by the high specific area and the existence of ultrafine nanoparticles, takes on a feature of fast faradaic surface charge-transfer. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages of the heterostructures and the pseudocapacitive effect, the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode achieved a high reversible capacity of 461 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Additionally, at a high current density of 1 A g-1, a high reversible capacity of 241 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles is obtained. A full cell coupled by the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was also constructed, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 310.3 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1. This method of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer may pave the way for the development of high performance sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The major difficulties for the development of flexible energy storage batteries lie in the scalable manufacture of high-performance flexible electrodes with bending tolerance. In the present study, large-scale CNT films are prepared by a continuous production method and used to fabricate a self-supported flexible high-capacity conversion anode with ultra-long cycling life by the in situ growth of NiCo2S4 nanosheets tightly anchored on the CNTs. The CNTs produced via such a scalable method have interconnected porous channels, providing a large contact area between the active materials and electrolyte facilitating the electrochemical conversion reaction of NiCo2S4. An ultra-high rate capability is achieved in terms of a capacity of 280 mA h g-1 at 20 A g-1. The interlaced construction of NiCo2S4 nanosheets with CNTs and firm anchoring on the CNT film result in a remarkable ultra-long cyclability of the NiCo2S4/CNT electrode with a capacity retention rate of 96% after 7500 cycles. A flexible full battery device is further established with the NiCo2S4/CNT anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/CNT cathode with the sealed package of PDMS, exhibiting good cycling stability and mechanical durability under different bending states.

        "abstract": "The construction of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) with a high energy and a long lifespan is significant and still challenging. Here, sulfur-defective vanadium sulfide/carbon fiber composites (D-V5S8/CNFs) are designed and fabricated by a facile electrospinning method, followed by sulfuration treatment. The unique architecture, in which V5S8 nanoparticles are confined inside the carbon fiber, provides a short-range channel and abundant adsorption sites for ion storage. Moreover, enlarged interlayer spacings could also alleviate the volume changes, and offer small vdW interactions and ionic diffusion resistance to store more Na and K ions reversibly and simultaneously. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that sulfur defects can effectively facilitate the adsorption behavior of Na+ and K+ and offer low energy barriers for ion intercalation. Taking advantage of the functional integration of these merits, the D-V5S8/CNF anode exhibits excellent storage performance and long-term cycling stability. It reveals a high capacity of 462 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in SIBs, while it is 350 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in PIBs, as well as admirable long-term cycling characteristics (190 mA h g-1/17 000 cycles/5 A g-1 for SIBs and 165 mA h g-1/3000 cycles/1 A g-1 for PIBs).

However, in addition to being costly and time-consuming, existing strategies for synthesizing sulfides/graphene composites often involve complicated procedures. It is therefore essential to develop a simple yet scalable pathway to construct sulfide/graphene composites for practical applications. Here, we highlight a one-step, template-free, high-throughput “self-bubbling” method for producing MoS2/graphene composites, which is suitable for large-scale production of sulfide/graphene composites. The final product featured MoS2 nanoflakes distributed in three-dimensional macroporous monolithic graphene. Moreover, this unique MoS2/graphene composite achieved remarkable electrochemical performance when being applied to Na-ion battery anodes; namely, excellent cycling stability (474 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) and high rate capability (406 mA h g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and 359 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1).

However, its practical application is hindered by low conductivity and significant volume variation during cycling, leading to poor rate capability and cycling stability. Herein, a novel composite consisting of Bi2Se3 nanoplates deposited on carbon cloth (CC) and encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been designed and synthesized. The composite structure combines the advantages of the Bi2Se3 nanoplates, CC substrate, and rGO encapsulation, leading to enhanced electrochemical properties. The physical vapor deposition of Bi2Se3 nanoplates onto CC ensures a high loading of active material, while the rGO encapsulation provides a conductive and stable framework for the composite. This synergistic design allows for improved electron and ion transport, as well as efficient accommodation of the volume changes during cycling. In LIBs, the composite demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 467.5 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 120 cycles. Moreover, it displays an outstanding rate capability, delivering a capacity of 398.6 mAh/g at 5.0 A/g.

This composite involves the incorporation of novel ternary-Ni-Bi-S/binary-Ni-S nanomaterials onto exfoliated graphite nanosheets (Ni3Bi2S2/NiS-G) through a facile ball-milling process. Our combined experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the interactions between graphite nanosheets and the layered structure of Ni3Bi2S2/NiS, along with the discharge products of Na2S, play pivotal roles in enhancing the Na+ diffusion rate and stability of the hierarchical configuration anode.

However, it generally suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which is closely related to the formation process of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the impact of different electrolyte salts on the electrochemical performance and SEI formation of a commercial HSAC anode is studied. It is found that the use of NaCF3SO3 enables much higher ICE (69.28%) and reversible capacity (283 mA h g-1) of the HSAC anode compared with the NaPF6 electrolyte (59.65%, 243 mA h g-1). Through comprehensive characterizations, the improvement in electrochemical performance facilitated by NaCF3SO3 could be attributed to the reduced amount of NaxC and the thinner SEI formed on the surface of HSAC during the initial cycle, which not only provides extra active sites for Na+ storage but also contributes to the promoted ICE. This work not only provides a deeper understanding of the role of electrolyte salt in SEI formation in the HSAC anode but also proposes a new method to further promote the ICE of the HSAC anode in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising candidate as an anode for sodium-ion batteries because of its low potential and high specific capacity. It has two main disadvantages. First, it experiences 490% volumetric expansion during sodiation, which leads to particle pulverization and substantial reduction of the cycle life. Second, it has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10–14 S cm–1. Both issues can be addressed by ball milling RP with a carbon matrix to form a composite of electronically conductive carbon and small RP particles, less susceptible to pulverization. Through this procedure, however, the resulting particle-size distribution of the RP particles is difficult to determine because of the presence of the carbon particles. Here, we quantify the relationship between the RP particle-size distribution and its cycle life for the first time by separating the ball-milling process into two steps. The RP is first wet-milled to reduce the particle size, and then the particle-size distribution is measured via dynamic light scattering. This is followed by a dry-milling step to produce RP–graphite composites. We found that wet milling breaks apart the largest RP particles in the range of 2–10 μm, decreases the Dv90 from 1.85 to 1.26 μm, and significantly increases the cycle life of the RP. Photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm the successful formation of a carbon coating, with longer milling times leading to more uniform carbon coatings. The RP with a Dv90 of 0.79 μm mixed with graphite for 48 h delivered 1354 mA h g–1 with high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and cyclability (88% capacity retention after 100 cycles). These results are an important step in the development of cyclable, high-capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

The results of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrated that the synergy of BP and Ti3C2 based on a stable interfacial interaction simultaneously reduces the resistances from both electron and Na+ transport, resulting in the impressive electrochemical performance of the BP/Ti3C2 composite in sodium-ion batteries.

However, a lack of suitable anode materials has become a key obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here we explore the potential of the two-dimensional (2D) Y-C space and identify a novel anode material for SIBs, a new Y4C3 sheet with P3̄m1 crystal symmetry, by means of first-principles swarm structure calculations. This Y4C3P3̄m1 structure has rather good kinetic and thermodynamic stability, possesses intrinsic metallicity, and remains metallic after adsorbing Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the SIB cycle. Remarkably, a Y4C3 sheet as an anode for SIBs possesses the essential properties of a high specific capacity (∼752 mA h g-1), a low barrier energy (∼0.1 eV), and suitable open-circuit voltage (0-0.15 V). These characteristics are comparable and even superior to those of another known 2D Y2C anode material, indicating that the Y4C3 sheet can act as an appealing new candidate as an anode material for SIBs and offering new insights into the 2D Y-C space.",

Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (μ-Sn) as a model.

This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the \"hot spots\", promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565 mAh g-1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g-1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of ~3.5 mAh cm-2 after 100 cycles.

However, a major concern in SMBs is the formation of dendrites on the Na metal anode, which can potentially cause short circuits and compromise safety. Herein, to address this issue, we propose a novel approach to create a protective layer by decorating Na surface with NaI particles. This protective layer exhibits a high Young’s modulus and excellent sodium ion transference ability. As a result, the lifespan of the Na/NaI||Na/NaI cell is significantly extended to 850 h at 0.5 mA cm^−2/1 mAh cm^−2. Furthermore, when the Na/NaI anode is combined with a Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 (NVP) cathode, the full cell retains 83 mAh g^−1 (approximately 94% of its initial capacity) even after 1500 cycles at 5 C. Overall, this work presents a simple and effective method for establishing a protective layer on the Na surface, thereby enabling the realization of long lifespan and stable SMBs.",

        "abstract": "The unique 2D-layered structure of tin (II) sulfide (SnS) compounds has led to the emergence of strong intensities, showcasing their significant potential in lithium (LIBs) and sodium (SIBs) ion batteries. However, the commercialization process of SnS compounds remain hindered due to the poor cycle stability caused by its substantial volume expansion during cycling in battery applications. In this study, a simple and scalable synthesis of ultra-thin composite with a well-connected structure SnS/N-doped carbon/SnS (SnS/NC/SnS) is reported. The structure is directly derived from layered tin chalcogenides (A2Sn3S7·xH2O, where A represents an organic cation). Within this configuration, SnS nanosheets are decorated on the N-doped carbon material. The composite exhibits an expanded layer of 9.7 Å, enabling rapid movement of Na+ ions (approximately 7 times the diffusion coefficient of bulk SnS). This expansion also aids in accommodating volume changes during the discharging and charging processes. Concurrently, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the structure maintains a relatively stable state at the interlayer spacing mentioned. The SnS/NC/SnS composite material exhibited significant potential for application in both SIBs and LIBs. In SIBs, it demonstrated excellent long-term cyclic stability, maintaining a capacity of 190 mA h g−1 even under high current density conditions of 2.5 A g−1 after 300 cycles. In LIBs, it exhibit a superior discharge capacity of 990 mA h g−1 and retains 94.1 % of its capacity after 150 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. Notably, this synthesis method is versatile, as the interlayer spacing can be adjusted by varying the type of organic cations used in the process.",

        "title": "Rock-Salt MnS0.5Se0.5 Nanocubes Assembled on N-Doped Graphene Forming van der Waals Heterostructured Hybrids as High-Performance Anode for Lithium- and Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Manganese-based chalcogenides would be of latent capacity in serving as anodes for assembling lithium- and/or sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their large theoretical capacity, low price, and low-toxicity functionality, while the low electroconductivity and easy agglomeration behavior may impede their technical applications. Here, a solid-state solution of MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes in rock-salt phase has been synthesized for the first time at a relatively low temperature from the precursors of Mn(II) acetylacetonate with dibenzyl dichalcogens in oleylamine with octadecene, and the MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes have been assembled with N-doped graphene to form a new kind of heterostructured nanohybrids (shortened as MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids), which are very potential for the fabrication of metal-ion batteries including LIBs and/or SIBs. Investigations revealed that there have been dense vacancies generated and active sites increased via nonequilibrium alloying of MnS and MnSe into the solid-solution MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with segregation and defects achieved in the low-temperature solution synthetic route. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doped graphene forming heterojunction interfaces between MnS0.5Se0.5 and N-doped graphene would efficiently enhance their electroconductivity and avoid agglomeration of the active MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with considerably improved electrochemical properties. As a result, the MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids delivered superior Li/Na storage capacities with outstanding rate performance as well as satisfactorily lasting stability (1039/457 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs/SIBs). Additionally, full-cell LIBs of the anodic MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G constructed with cathodic LiFePO4 (LFP) further confirmed the promising future for their practical application.",

        "abstract": "MXenes are mentioned in many applications due to their unique properties. However, the traditional etching method has a lengthy synthesis time, dangerous process, and high cost. Molten salt etching is not only short in time but also safe and simple, laying a good foundation for industrialization. Here, we compare the traditional F‐containing etching method with the molten salt etching method. Transmission electron microscopy elemental mapping images and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the Ti3C2Tx surface end of traditional etching is terminated by –F, while the Ti3C2Tx surface end of molten salt etching is terminated by –Cl. Finally, the sodium‐ion batteries are fabricated and the performance difference of the three etching methods is compared. The results show that the capacity of 102.1 mAh g–1 can still be reached when the molten salt etching MXene material returns to 0.1 A g–1 after the current density of 5 A g–1. After 500 cycles at 1 A g–1, there is no significant loss of capacity and the Coulomb efficiency is close to 100%. This work describes that molten salt etching MXene has comparable sodium storage capacity to conventional F‐containing etched MXene, making it a potential candidate for the production of large‐scale sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have attracted much attention due to integrating the high energy density of battery and high out power of supercapacitors. However, rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics in cathode is counterbalanced with sluggish anode, hindering the further advancement and commercialization of SIHCs. Here, aiming at conversion-type metal sulfide anode, taking typical VS2 as an example, a comprehensive regulation of nanostructure and electronic properties through NH4 + pre-intercalation and Mo-doping VS2 (Mo-NVS2 ) is reported. It is demonstrated that NH4 + pre-intercalation can enlarge the interplanar spacing and Mo-doping can induce interlayer defects and sulfur vacancies that are favorable to construct new ion transport channels, thus resulting in significantly enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the introduction of NH4 + and Mo-doping enhances the electronic conductivity, lowers the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ , and produces stronger d-p hybridization to promote conversion kinetics of Na+ intercalation intermediates. Consequently, Mo-NVS2 delivers a record-high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 and an ultra-stable cycle life of over 20 000 cycles. The assembled SIHCs achieve impressive energy density/power density of 98 Wh kg-1 /11.84 kW kg-1 , ultralong cycling life of over 15000 cycles, and very low self-discharge rate (0.84 mV h-1 ).",

Herein, a hybrid sodium-ion supercapacitor, involving a carbon-coated nano-NaTi2 (PO4 )3 -based battery anode and an activated-carbon-based capacitive cathode, is developed to combine desalination and energy storage in one device. On charge, the supercapacitor removes salt in a flowing saltwater electrolyte through Cl- electrochemical adsorption at the cathode and Na+ intercalation at the anode. Discharge delivers useful electric energy and regenerates the electrodes. This supercapacitor can be used not only for energy storage with promising electrochemical performance (i.e., high power, high efficiency, and long cycle life), but also as a desalination device with desalination capacity of 146.8 mg g-1 , much higher than most reported capacitive and battery desalination devices. Finally, we demonstrate renewables to usable electric energy and desalted water through combining commercial photovoltaics and this hybrid supercapacitor.",

Herein, we investigate the factors that influence the co-intercalation potential of graphite and find that the tuning of the voltage as large as 0.38 V is achievable by adjusting the relative stability of ternary graphite intercalation compounds and the solvent activity in electrolytes. The feasibility of graphite anode in sodium ion batteries is confirmed in conjunction with Na_1.5VPO_4.8F_0.7 cathodes by using the optimal electrolyte. The sodium ion battery delivers an improved voltage of 3.1 V, a high power density of 3863 W kg^−1_both electrodes, negligible temperature dependency of energy/power densities and an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.007% per cycle over 1000 cycles, which are among the best thus far reported for sodium ion full cells, making it a competitive choice in large-scale energy storage systems. Graphite is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries but suffers from the high co-intercalation potential.

        "abstract": "Currently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are favored by scientific researchers because of their abundance, low cost, and high safety. Furthermore, hard carbon has a low-voltage plateau and a high sodium storage capacity when used as the anode material in SIBs. Given its affordability and variety of sources, biomass hard carbon has gained interest. However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of biomass hard carbon significantly hinders its development. Therefore, the waste biomass black locust wood was used to prepare hard carbon at different carbonization temperatures, and the carbonization temperature suitable for black locust wood was selected to modify the precursor with 6-M HCl to study the effect of acid treatment on the microstructure of carbon materials and their electrochemical properties. The experimental results proved that the HCl-pretreated hard carbon could increase the carbon layer spacing, increase more surface active sites that favor Na^+ storage, and decrease the specific surface area. HC-1500 and HHC-1500 possessed a first cycle charge specific capacity of 319.6 mAh/g and 382.3 mAh/g, respectively, with an increase in the first-circle Coulombic efficiency (ICE) from 62 to 67% and also had a significant improvement in the cycling performance. Therefore, treating waste biomass with hydrochloric acid is a direct and effective method to modify hard carbon and improve its electrochemical performance. Graphical abstract Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are popular due to their low cost, safety, and abundant materials. Biomass-derived hard carbon, particularly from locust wood, shows promise as an anode material but suffers from low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE). Acid treatment with 6M HCl before carbonization improves its microstructure, increases sodium storage sites, and boosts ICE from 62% to 67%. The treated hard carbon (HC-1500 and HHC-1500) demonstrates enhanced charge capacity (319.6 mAh/g and 382.3 mAh/g) and better cycling performance, making this method effective for improving electrochemical properties.",

        "abstract": "Metal phosphides exhibit high energy densities as hosts for lithium/sodium storage owing to their conversion reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, they typically suffer from inferior reversibility and cyclability because of the dissolution of polyphosphides and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. Herein, a series of dual‐bond confined MXene‐MxPy‐G composites have been fabricated, in which MxPy nanoparticles are strongly bound with MXene and graphene nanosheets via Ti─P and C‐P bonds. On one hand, the dual‐bond confinement offers strong adsorption to trap polyphosphides, greatly stabilizing the conversion‐formed products during cycling. On the other hand, dual‐bond immobilization largely promotes electron transfer and ion diffusion, facilitating the reversibility of conversion reactions. As anticipated, these MXene‐MxPy‐G hybrids demonstrate superb lithium/sodium‐storage performance. Particularly, as an anode for lithium‐ion batteries, the MXene‐Sn4P3‐G delivers a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.1% and a high reversible capacity of 1058.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Even tested at high rates of 1.0/2.0 A g−1, it can still maintain high reversible capacities of 820.6/726.5 mAh g−1 after 1450 cycles. When applied in pouch full‐cells and sodium‐ion batteries, it also shows extended cyclic lifespans of 350 and 1200 cycles. This work provides new insights to improve the reversibility and cyclability of conversion‐type anodes.",

In this study the impact of the biomass source on the structural and electrochemical properties of hard carbons is unraveled by using different, representative types of biomass as examples. The systematic structural and electrochemical investigation of hard carbons derived from different sources-namely corncobs, peanut shells, and waste apples, which are representative of hemicellulose-, lignin- and pectin-rich biomass, respectively-enables understanding and interlinking of the structural and electrochemical properties.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting novel nanomaterials with fast and durable sodium/potassium ion storage capability is key to alleviate the application limitations of lithium-ion batteries. Herein, a novel energy storage material based on cobalt metaphosphate nanosheet arrays self-supported on carbon cloths [Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC] is fabricated by a two-step strategy. This rationally designed strategy avoids the preparation of the complex {Co[O2P(OtBu)2]2}n precursor, which significantly simplifies the synthesis process. The active CC acts not only as an electrically conductive substrate as usual but also as a functional basis to suppress PH3-involved reaction and to promote HPO3-involved reaction during the phosphating process, contributing to the formation of Co(PO3)2. The mutual cross-linked porous Co(PO3)2 nanosheets vertically grow on the surface of activated CC, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport among the electrodes. Sodium ion storage analysis for the Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC electrode reveals a multi-step reaction mechanism with high reversibility, as reflected by the high reversible capacity (667 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cyclability (with almost no capacity decay over 500 cycles). This novel electrode is also well capable of storing potassium ions, exhibiting high reversible capacity, which outperforms most reported anodes for potassium-ion batteries.

Herein, a simple process is demonstrated to improve the sodium storage performance of TiO2 by fabricating a 1D, multichannel, porous binary-phase anatase-TiO2 -rutile-TiO2 composite with oxygen-deficient and high grain-boundary density (denoted as a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x ) via electrospinning and subsequent vacuum treatment. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 matrix enables enhanced intrinsic electronic conductivity and fast sodium-ion diffusion kinetics. The porous structure offers easy access of the liquid electrolyte and a short transport path of Na+ through the pores toward the TiO2 nanoparticle. Furthermore, the high density of grain boundaries between the anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 offer more interfaces for a novel interfacial storage. The a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x shows excellent long cycling stability (134 mAh g-1 at 10 C after 4500 cycles) and superior rate performance (93 mAh g-1 after 4500 cycles at 20 C) for sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NaIBs) are increasingly being envisioned for grid-scale energy storage systems because of cost advantages. However, implementation of this vision has been challenged by the low energy densities delivered by most NaIB cathodes. Toward addressing this challenge, the authors report the synthesis and characterization of a new iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 cathode using a novel facile hydrothermal route. The synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Obtained discharge capacity in half-cell configuration lies from 119 to 125 to 130 mAh/g at C/10 while tested using three different electrolyte formulations, DMC-EC-PC, DEC-EC, and EC-PC, respectively. The synthesized cathodes were also evaluated in full-cell configurations, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 80 mAh/g with NaTi2(PO4)3MWCNT as the anode. Ionic diffusivity and interfacial charge transfer kinetics were also evaluated as a function of temperature and sodium concentration, which revealed that electrochemical rate performances in this material were limited by charge transfer kinetics. To understand the heat generation mechanism of the Na/Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 half-cell during charge and discharge processes, an electrochemical isothermal calorimetry measurement was carried out at different current rates for two different temperatures (25 and 45°C). The results showed that the amount of heat generated was strongly affected by the operating charge/discharge state, C-rate, and temperature. Overall, this work provides a new synthesis route for the development of iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2-based high-performance sodium cathode material aimed at providing a viable pathway for the development and deployment of large-scale energy storage based on sodium battery systems.",

        "title": "Engineering Ultrathin Carbon Layer on Porous Hard Carbon Boosts Sodium Storage with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency.",
        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has been widely adopted as the anode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). However, it is troubled by a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to its porous structure. Herein, a graphitized and ultrathin carbon layer coating on HC is proposed to solve this challenge. The as-prepared porous carbon material coated with an ultrathin carbon layer composite (PCS@V@C) exhibits a cavity structure, which is prepared by using bis(cyclopentadienyl) nickel (CP-Ni) as the carbon source for outer coating, glucose carbon spheres as porous carbon, and introducing a silica layer to facilitate the coating process. When utilized as the anode for NIBs, the material shows an ICE increase from 47.1% to 85.3%, and specific capacity enhancement at 0.1 A g-1 from 155.3 to 216.7 mA h g-1. Moreover, its rate capability and cycling performance are outstanding, demonstrating a capacity of 140.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1, and a retaining capacity of 225.6 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 100% at the second cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the PCS@V@C is attributed to the ultrathin carbon layer, which is beneficial for the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Therefore, this study provides a feasible surface modification method for the preparation of anode materials for NIBs with high specific capacity and ICE.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional lithium-ion technology, due to the abundance of sodium resources. Still, major drawbacks for the commercial application of SIBs lie in the slow kinetic processes and poor cycling performance of the devices. In this work, a hybrid nanocomposite of Sb2O3 nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene nanoribbons (GNR) is implemented as anode material in SIBs. The obtained Sb2O3/N-GNR anode delivers a reversible specific capacity of 642 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and exhibits a good rate capability. Even after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1, the specific capacity is maintained at about 405 mA h g−1. Such good Na storage performance is mainly ascribed to the beneficial effect of N doping for charge transfer and to the improved microstructure that facilitates the Na+ diffusion through the overall electrode.",

        "abstract": "Anode-free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are regarded as the \"ceiling\" for current sodium-based batteries. However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high-voltage cathode and anode-free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion-stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+-solvent and Na+-anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0 V-class layered oxide cathode from -40 °C to 60 °C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi-layer anode-free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at -30 °C.

The high performance is achieved by doping Ni2⁺ loading NC and etching with KOH, which generates vacancy defects, enhances structural stability, and accelerates ion-diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the fully-printed ARSIBs (F-NTP//NVNPF/NCK) with high specific capacity (60.37 mAh g-1), amazing energy density (72.44 Wh kg-1), and excellent cycle performance, are fabricated using screen-printing technique based on the NVNPF/NCK cathode and NaTi1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3 (F-NTP) anode.

However, the TMS anodes often suffer from poor electronic conductivity, low ionic diffusion and large volume expansion during Li/Na-ion intercalation significantly impairing the Li/Na-storage performance. Herein, a long chain heterostructure composed of the Co_9S_8 and SnS are first reported, which can generate rich phase interfaces, and small crystal domains. The unique structure can facilitate the properties of reactivity, conductivity and ionic diffusion. In addition, the heterostructure surface is modified by the N-doped carbon (N-DC@(CoSn)S), successfully improving the structural stability.

However, the practical application of SIHCs is hindered by the lack of advanced anode materials that exhibit fast ion diffusion kinetics and robust structures. Herein, a novel design featuring a nano-sized Fe3O4 is developed, that is double-reinforced by porous carbon derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the inner core support and N, P-co-doped carbon from a polymer decomposition as the outer shell, resulting in a robust pencil-like core-shell structural composite (Fe3O4/NPC). The Fe3O4 nanograins and abundant surface groups containing N and P reduce the charge/electron transfer distance and provide numerous pseudocapacitive active sites, guaranteeing high energy output and superior rate capability. The optimized core-shell structure and interconnected carbon framework effectively accommodate volume changes, prevent nanoparticle agglomeration, and facilitate ion/electron transport, thereby ensuring structural integrity and rapid kinetics. In testing, Fe3O4/NPC demonstrated superior cycling durability, retaining 86.6% of its initial capacity after 2500 cycles in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Impressively, the assembled SIHC achieved a notable energy density of 147.1 W h kg-1 and maintained 92% capacity after 8000 cycles.",

In this work, erythrocyte-like CuS microspheres with an elastic buffering layer of ultrathin polyaniline (PANI) were synthesized through one-step self-assembly growth, followed by in situ polymerization of aniline. When CuS@PANI is used as anode electrode in SIBs, it delivers high capacity, ultrahigh rate capability (500 mAh g^−1 at 0.1 A g^−1, and 214.5 mAh g^−1 at 40 A g^−1), and superior cycling life of over 7500 cycles at 20 A g^−1. A series of in/ex situ characterization techniques were applied to investigate the structural evolution and sodium-ion storage mechanism. The PANI swollen with electrolyte can stabilize solid electrolyte interface layer, benefit the ion transport/charge transfer at the PANI/electrolyte interface, and restrain the size growth of Cu particles in confined space. Moreover, finite element analyses and density functional simulations confirm that the PANI film effectively buffers the volume expansion, suppresses the surface pulverization, and traps the polysulfide. Erythrocyte-like CuS microspheres were encapsulated in ultrathin polyaniline (PANI) layer coating. PANI swollen by electrolytes stabilizes solid electrolyte interface layer and benefits the ion transport and charge transfer at the PANI/electrolyte interface.

        "abstract": "Overcoming the sluggish reaction kinetics and volume effects of metal sulfides as anodic materials for sodium-ion batteries remains a challenging task. In this study, a multistep template-engaged strategy is employed for the first time to fabricate hierarchical double-shells NiS/SnS@nitrogen doped carbon (NiS/SnS@NC) nanoboxes, utilizing NiSn(OH)6 cubes as starting templates. The synergistic combination of sophisticated sulfide components and the double-shell structure effectively mitigates volume variation, reduces nanoparticle cohesion, and enhances electrode reaction kinetics. Notably, NiS/SnS@NC exhibits outstanding stability under high current density while maintaining a high capacity. Comprehensive kinetics analysis reveals that the enhanced sodium storage of NiS/SnS@NC can be attributed to its low interface reaction resistance, significant capacitive contribution, and rapid mass-transfer kinetics. The stepwise (de)sodiation processes of the NiS/SnS@NC anode are elucidated through various in/ex-situ characterization techniques, confirming the alternating reaction activity alternations between two components, which acts as a self-buffering and self-conductivity mechanism to enhance sodium storage. Finally, a practical application is demonstrated, where a well-designed NiS/SnS@NC||Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C full cell shows promising performance, achieving a high capacity of 265 mAh/g after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A/g.

        "title": "Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in-depth analysis of the two-dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Carbon fibrous materials are the promising candidate for the anode of flexible sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries due to the structural advantages. However, the progress of mechanically robust anode materials with high electrochemical properties is still unsatisfactory for the flexible electrodes. Herein, the comprehensive design of the morphology with unique multi-channel hollow 1D/1D carbon nanotube/carbon nanofiber network and the lattice structure of carbon with S/N co-doping has been proposed. Benefiting from the enlarged interlayer spacing and the flexible fibrous network, the S/N doped carbon nanotube/carbon nanofiber composites (CNT/SNCF) possess not only high conductivity but also good structural stability during sodiation and potassiation processes. When used as anode materials in SIBs and PIBs, the free-standing CNT/SNCF electrodes exhibit high discharge capacities (274.1 and 212.5 mA h g-1 at 1 A/g after 1000 cycles, respectively), superior cycle stability (150.4 and 100.1 mA h g-1 at 5 A/g after 5000 cycles, respectively) and rate performance (109.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A/g and 108.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A/g, respectively), showing great prospects in flexible energy storage devices.",

However, TMSs anode materials suffer from challenges such as substantial volume expansion, undesired side reactions, and poor active reaction dynamics. Herein, we propose a novel synthesis method that integrates metal salt-assisted polymer-blowing technique with in situ selenization strategy to fabricate multidimensional porous 3D carbon nanosheet frameworks modified by cobalt diselenide nanoparticles (CoSe2-CNF). Such unique architecture bestows intimate structural interconnectivity with high mechanical strength and abundant ion diffusion channels on CoSe2-CNF, exhibiting remarkable reversible capacity and fast-charging capability within diverse electrolyte systems. For instance, the CoSe2-CNF anode in ether electrolyte exhibits prominent rate performance of 349 mAh/g at 15 A/g. Sodium storage mechanism and fast electrochemical kinetics in the discharge/charge processes are investigated by in situ XRD and in situ EIS techniques. Additionally, DFT calculations are utilized to analyze the electrochemical differences observed in various electrolyte systems. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4) (NVP) cathodes, the full batteries also afford enhanced reversible capacity of 105 mAh/g over 100 cycles. The proposed structural engineering for CoSe2-CNF is beneficial for designing fast-charging energy storage devices.",

One of the main challenges for sodium-ion batteries, however, is the poor electrolyte stability, which leads to rapid capacity fade during cycling. Recent advances in the lithium-ion-battery field have expanded our understanding of electrolyte compositions and stability, paving the way for better sodium-ion-battery electrolytes. Two of the most promising new classes of electrolytes are evaluated herein with a sodium layered-oxide cathode, for the first time: a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) composed of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethyl ether, and tetrafluoropropyl ether and a \"highly fluorinated\" electrolyte (HFE) composed of 20% fluoroethylene carbonate with a lithium difluorophosphate additive. With a combination of electrochemical and post-mortem characterization techniques, the stability of each electrolyte is assessed with the O3-type Na(Ni0.3Fe0.4Mn0.3)O2 cathode and sodium metal anode. Both electrolytes significantly improve the surface and bulk stability of the cathode, but only the LHCE has a meaningful improvement on sodium metal stability. For the purpose of developing a long-lasting, sodium-ion full cell, both classes of electrolyte show great promise.",

        "abstract": "It is widely known that transition-metal oxides, including Mn_3O_4, suffer from volume expansion and poor conductivity and thus, result in unsatisfactory cycling stability in the sodium-ion batteries. One approach to overcome these issues is to use reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels as a potential matrix to support the Mn_3O_4 electrode during the sodiation/desodiation process. In this study, Mn_3O_4/rGO aerogels are prepared by the hydrothermal process, followed by the freeze-drying process without further heat treatment. The reduction of graphite oxide, deposition of Mn_3O_4 nanoparticles, and formation of a three-dimensional network of rGO nanosheets can all occur concurrently during the synthesis process, ensuring an even distribution of Mn_3O_4 nanoparticles on the rGO sheet. The Mn_3O_4/rGO aerogels exhibit a good electrochemical sodium storage performance when tested as an anode material. In the initial cycle, the Mn_3O_4/rGO aerogels delivered a high discharge capacity of 947 mAh g^−1 and sustained a capacity of 283 mAh g^−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g^−1 after 100 cycles, with a large Coulombic efficiency of ~ 99%. The excellent cycling stability and improved discharge capacity of the electrode could be due to the hierarchical structures of rGO with nanosized Mn_3O_4, which can expedite more ion and electron transporting channels from various directions, provide high interfacial sodium storage, and prevent the structure from collapsing. The electrochemical results indicate that the Mn_3O_4/rGO aerogels can be further explored for the development of sodium-ion batteries and the synergistic effect contributed by both rGO aerogel and Mn_3O_4 nanoparticles offers an alternative strategy to mitigate the issues associated with Mn_3O_4.",

        "abstract": "While Sb-based anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attractive for their high gravimetric capacities, they suffer from poor cyclability and sluggish charge storage kinetics due to large volume changes and multiple phase transformations. In this study, we developed a multi-structured Cu_2Sb/Sb_2O_3/Cu/Cu_2O nanocomposite by a simple one-step dealloying strategy. As an anode material for SIBs, this nanocomposite exhibits good cycling performance, maintaining a reversible capacity of 223 mAh g^−1 for over 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g^−1. Furthermore, the Cu_2Sb/Sb_2O_3/Cu/Cu_2O nanocomposite demonstrates twice the sodium-ion diffusion rate compared to pure Sb. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the layered NP-Cu_2Sb, Sb_2O_3 nanoparticles and NP-Cu/Cu_2O, which provide efficient pathways for ion and electron transport, thereby enhancing the rate capability of the electrode. Additionally, the inactive Cu within the Cu_2Sb and the formation of Na_2O as an intermediate product effectively accommodate the volume changes that occur during (de)sodiation, preventing the pulverization of the nanocomposite. These findings highlight the potential of Sb-based materials with unique architectures and composite systems as rechargeable SIBs anodes, and this work serves as inspiration for the further development of novel alloy-type electrodes through the facile dealloying method. Graphical abstract Sb-based anodes for sodium-ion batteries have high capacities but poor cyclability.

        "abstract": "In recent times, few-layer black phosphorus (BP) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its particular two-dimensional structure, good electron conductivity, and high theoretical capacity. The main disadvantages of BP-based materials are the lower practical specific capacity of the BP-based composite than expectation because of the low P atom utilization and the structural fracture due to the large volume expansion that occurs during sodiation/desodiation cycles. In this work, we report a ternary composite comprising BP, graphite, and polyaniline (BP-G/PANI) with a BP mass content of ∼65 wt %. The ternary composite provides an optimized ion pathway (electrolyte → PANI → BP-G → BP), which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the electrode. Also, further ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the presence of graphite in the BP-G composite allows a deep sodiation of BP and also leads to a higher sodiation/desodiation reversibility. In addition, the uniformly coated PANI also restricts the huge volume expansion of the BP electrode through discharge/charge processes, which promise the stable cycling performance of BP-G/PANI. Thus, our composite shows a high reversible gravimetric capacity of 1530 mAh gcompo.-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and a capacity retention of 520 mAh gcompo.-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g-1.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries, including a more uniform sodium distribution, lower-cost materials, and safer transportation options. A promising development in SIBs is the use of hard carbons as anode materials due to their low insertion voltage and larger interlayer spacing, which improve sodium-ion insertion. Traditionally, hard carbons are made from costly carbon sources, but recent advancements have focussed on using abundant bio-waste, like coffee grounds. This approach reduces costs and helps manage global waste. This research investigates the electrochemical performance of bio-waste-derived hard carbons, which is significantly impacted by various pre-treatment methods. Techniques such as BET, XRD, TEM, and XPS are employed to examine the effects of pre-treatment variables, including washing solvents (organic, acidic, or distilled water), pre-oxidation temperatures, and post-heating processes. These factors influence the structural properties and purity of the hard carbon, impacting its effectiveness as an anode material in SIBs. A significant finding is a mesoporous hard carbon produced from coffee grounds that, after washing with distilled water, pre-oxidation at 150 °C, and thermal treatment at 1300 °C in argon, shows a 23% yield, a reversible capacity of 304 mA h g−1, and Initial coulombic efficiency of 78%. This study underscores the importance of pre-treatments in removing impurities and enhancing the material's sodium storage capabilities.",

ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

        "abstract": "The rational design of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high conductivity and reversible redox activity is the key to improving their performance in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a series of COFs (FPDC-TPA-COF, FPDC-TPB-COF, and FPDC-TPT-COF) based on an organosulfur linker, (trioxocyclohexane-triylidene)tris(dithiole-diylylidene))hexabenzaldehyde (FPDC). These COFs feature two-dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox-active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC-TPT-COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420 mAh g-1 (0.2 A g-1), excellent cycling stability (~87% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0 A g-1) and high rate performance (339 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF-based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox-active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage. Furthermore, the sodiation mechanism was elucidated through in-situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work highlights the advantages of integrating multiple functional groups into redox-active COFs for the rational design of efficient and stable SIBs.",

However, the narrow potential window of water and the enlarged ionic radius because of hydration restrict the selection of electrode materials used in the aqueous electrolyte. Here, inspired by the efficient redox reaction of biomolecules during cellular energy metabolism, a proof of concept is proposed that the redox‐active biomolecule alizarin can act as a novel electrode material for the aqueous sodium‐ion battery. It is demonstrated that the specific capacity of the self‐assembled alizarin nanowires can reach as high as 233.1 mA h g−1, surpassing the majority of anodes ever utilized in the aqueous sodium‐ion batteries. Paired with biocompatible and biodegradable polypyrrole, this full battery system shows excellent sodium storage ability and flexibility, indicating its potential applications in wearable electronics and biointegrated devices. It is also shown that the electrochemical properties of electrodes can be tailored by manipulating naturally occurring 9,10‐anthroquinones with various substituent groups, which broadens application prospect of biomolecules in aqueous sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The Fe‐based anode of sodium‐ion batteries attracts much attention due to the abundant source, low‐cost, and high specific capacity. However, the low electron and ion transfer rate, poor structural stability, and shuttle effect of NaS2 intermediate restrain its further development. Herein, the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node spawned N‐carbon nanotube scaffold structure (FHNCS) was designed using the modified MIL‐88B(Fe) as a template followed by catalytic growth and sulfidation process. During catalytic growth process, the reduced Fe monomers catalyze the growth of N‐doped carbon nanotubes to connect the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node, forming a 3D scaffold structure. Wherein the N‐doped carbon promotes the transfer of electrons between Fe3O4/Fe/FeS particles, and the tri‐heterojunction facilitates the diffusion of electrons at the interface, to organize a 3D conductive network. The unique scaffold structure provides more active sites and shortens the Na+ diffusion path. Meanwhile, the structure exhibits excellent mechanical stability to alleviate the volume expansion during circulation. Furthermore, the Fe in Fe3O4/Fe heterojunction can adjust the d‐band center of Fe in Fe3O4 to enhance the adsorption between Fe3O4 and Na2S intermediate, which restrains the shuttle effect. Therefore, the FHNCS demonstrates a high specific capacity of 436 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 84.7% and 73.4% of the initial capacities are maintained after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. We believe that this strategy gives an inspiration for constructing Fe‐based anode with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.",

This one-pot approach greatly reduces the energy consumption and maximizes the efficient use of raw materials. The reaction of elemental tin and antimony in the ionic liquid (IL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride ([P66614]Cl) at 200 °C led to a microcrystalline powder of single-phase SnSb within 10 h with very high yield (95%). Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the IL remains essentially stable during the reaction. It was recovered almost quantitatively by distilling off the organic solvent used for product separation. Composites of SnSb powder and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated by a simple ball milling process. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Na‖SnSb/CNTs cell retains close to 100% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles at a current of 50 mA g−1, which is much better than the Na‖SnSb cell. The greatly increased capacity retainability can be attributed to the conductive network formed by CNTs inside the SnSb/CNTs electrode, providing 3D effective and fast electronic pathways during sodium intercalation and de-intercalation.",

However, efficient phosphorus doping with high concentration in well-crystallized TiO2 nanoparticles is still a big challenge. Herein, we propose a defect-assisted phosphorus doping strategy to selectively engineer the surface structure of TiO2 nanoparticles. The reduced TiO2-x shell layer that is rich of oxygen defects and Ti3+ species precisely triggered high concentration of phosphorus doping (~7.8 at%) and consequently a TiO2@TiO2-x-P core@shell architecture was produced. Comprehensive characterizations and first-principle calculations proved that the surface functionalized TiO2-x-P thin layer endowed the TiO2@TiO2-x-P with substantially enhanced electronic conductivity and accelerated Na ions transportation, resulting in great rate capability (167 mA h g-1 at 10000 mA g-1) and stable cycling (99% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1). Combining in/ex situ X-ray diffraction with ex situ electron spin resonance clearly demonstrated the high reversibility and robust mechanical behavior of the TiO2@TiO2-x-P upon long-term cycling. This work provides an interesting and effective strategy for precise heteroatoms doping to improve the electrochemical performance of nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high theoretical specific capacity. However, poor stability and a complex preparation process limit its large-scale application. Herein, we prepare a binder-free composite electrode composed of amorphous (α-) Sb2S3 and copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) through a simple closed-space sublimation (CSS) method. When applied as the anode in sodium-ion batteries, the α-Sb2S3@CuSbS2 electrode exhibits excellent performance with a high discharge capacity of 506.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. The satisfactory electrochemical performance could be ascribed to the α-Sb2S3–CuSbS2 composite structure and binder-free electrode architecture, which not only retain the structural stability of the electrode but also improve the electrical conductivity. Consequently, CSS, as a scalable and environmentally friendly method, can produce a binder-free electrode in just a few minutes, demonstrating its great potential in the industrial production of sodium-ion batteries. This study may open an avenue to preparing binder-free commercial electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is emerging as a popular cathode for sodium-ion batteries owing to its stable structure, high operating voltage, and large energy density. However, its practical application is hindered by its low conductivity. In addition, due to the loss of fluorine during synthesis, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) impurity is often easily generated, resulting in a decrease in actual operating voltage. Herein, a bifunctional carbon network composed of an N-doped carbon layer and carbon bridge is constructed around NVPF particles. Through pyrolysis of polydopamine (PDA), the NVPF particles are covered in situ by an N-doped carbon layer, and the carbon bridge generated by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is also coated with N-doped carbon. Besides, PTFE also serves as a fluorine supplement to ensure that pure NVPF is obtained. As a result, the bifunctional N-doped carbon network-modified NVPF delivers a high reversible capacity (125.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C) and appreciable cycle stability (92.7% at 1 C over 300 cycles, and 89.8% at 10 C over 1500 cycles). When assembled into a full cell with a commercial hard carbon anode, it displays a discharge median voltage of up to 3.62 V at 0.2 C. Furthermore, it achieves a high energy density of 373.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 461.2 W kg-1, with an excellent specific energy retention of 78.2% after 200 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodium titanate Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) has superior electrochemical properties as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and Nb or V doping is suggested to enhance the electrode performance. In this work, we carry out systematic first-principles calculations of the structural, electronic and electrochemical properties of NTO and Na2Ti2.75M0.25O7 (M = Nb, V), using supercells to reveal the effect of Nb or V NTO-doping on its anode performance. It is found that Nb doping gives rise to the expansion of cell volume but V doping induces the shrinkage of cell volume due to the larger and smaller ionic radius of the Nb and V ions, respectively, compared to that of the Ti ion. We perform structural optimization of the intermediate phases of Na2+xM3O7 with increasing Na content x from 0 to 2, revealing that the overall relative volume expansion rate is slightly increased by Nb and V doping but remains lower than 3%. Our calculations demonstrate that the electrode potential of NTO is slightly raised and the specific capacity is reduced, but the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Nb or V doping. With the revealed understanding and mechanisms, our work will contribute to the search for advanced electrode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metallic bismuth is here studied as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The details of electrochemical redox reactions, rate performance and cycled life were investigated using relatively high mass loading electrodes in two- and three-electrode full-cells. It demonstrated that the rate capability of bismuth anodes with high mass loading are not as good as indicated in previous literatures where low mass loading electrodes were used. It also indicated that the resistances causing a faltering rate performance may be connected to a loss in particle contact during desodiation. Efforts were also made to study the different electrochemical processes that occur during early cycles. Less advantageous characteristics of bismuth electrodes are also discussed. For example, several different electrolyte solutions were tested for compatibility with the bismuth system, where only glyme-based solutions seemed to facilitate robust cycling.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gradually become one of the most promising energy storage techniques in the current era of post-lithium-ion batteries. For anodes, transitional metal selenides (TMSe) based materials are welcomed choices , owing to relatively higher specific capacities and enriched redox active sites. Nevertheless, current bottlenecks are blamed for their poor intrinsic electronic conductivities, and uncontrollable volume expansion during redox reactions. Given that, an interfacial-confined isochronous conversion strategy is proposed, to prepare orthorhombic/cubic biphasic TMSe heterostructure, namely CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 , through using MXene as the precursor, followed by Cu/Se dual anchorage. As-designed biphasic TMSe heterostructure endows unique hierarchical structure, which contains adequate insertion sites and diffusion spacing for Na ions, besides, the surficial pseudocapacitive storage behaviors can be also proceeded like 2D MXene. By further investigation on electronic structure, the theoretical calculations indicate that biphasic CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 anode exhibits well-enhanced properties, with smaller bandgap and thus greatly improves intrinsic poor conductivities. In addition, the dual redox centers can enhance the electrochemical Na ions storage abilities. As a result, the as-designed biphasic TMSe anode can deliver a reversible specific capacity of 576.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , favorable Na affinity, and reduced diffusion barriers. This work discloses a synchronous solution toward demerits in conductivities and lifespan, which is inspiring for TMSe-based anode development in SIBs systems.",

        "abstract": "Organic materials are competitive as anodes for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) due to the low cost, abundance, environmental benignity, and high sustainability. Herein, we synthesized three halogenated carboxylate-based organic anode materials to exploit the impact of halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) on the electrochemical performance of carboxylate anodes in NIBs. The fluorinated carboxylate anode, disodium 2, 5-difluoroterephthalate (DFTP-Na), outperforms the other carboxylate anodes with H, Cl, and Br, in terms of high specific capacity (212 mA h g-1), long cycle life (300 cycles), and high rate capability (up to 5 A g-1). As evidenced by the experimental and computational results, the two F atoms in DFTP reduce the solubility, enhance the cyclic stability, and interact with Na+ during the redox reaction, resulting in a high-capacity and stable organic anode material in NIBs. Therefore, this work proves that fluorinating carboxylate compounds is an effective approach to developing high-performance organic anodes for stable and sustainable NIBs.",

The SnS2 nanosheet and FeS2 nanosphere structures are deposited on the crab shell-derived carbon through simple hydrothermal reaction. Due to the coexistence of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and crab-derived biomass carbon, the anode material has excellent cycle stability and rate performance. SnS2/C and FeS2/C deliver capacities of 535.4 and 479 mA h g–1 at the current density of 0.1 A g–1, respectively.

        "abstract": "While cost‐effective sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity <40 mAh g−1). To address this issue, herein an atomic‐order structural‐design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient‐ordered silicon (MGO‐Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ‐formed short‐range‐, medium‐range‐, and long‐range‐ordered structures construct a stable MGO‐Si, which contributes to favorable Na–Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO‐Si involves an adsorption–intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient‐ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g−1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low‐capacity materials (micro‐Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5–6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better‐performing battery designs.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the limited availability of lithium sources is escalating the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Considering the fluctuating economics of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have now drawn attention because sodium is an earth-abundant, low-cost element that exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs. Despite developments in different anode materials, there still remain several challenges in SIBs, including lighter cell design for SIBs. The presented work designs a facile strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped free-standing pseudo-graphitic nanofibers via electrospinning. A structural and morphological study implies highly disordered graphitic structured nanofibers having diameters of ∼120–170 nm, with a smooth surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that nitrogen was successfully doped in carbon nanofibers (CNFs). When served as an anode material for SIBs, the resultant material exhibits excellent sodium-ion storage properties in terms of long-term cycling stability and high rate capability. Notably, a binder-free self-standing CNF without a current collector was used as an anode for SIBs that delivered capacities of 210 and 87 mA h g–1 at 20 and 1600 mA g–1, respectively, retaining a capacity of 177 mA h g–1 when retained at 20 mA g–1. The as-synthesized CNFs demonstrate a long cycle life with a relatively high Columbic efficiency of 98.6% for the 900th cycle, with a stable and excellent rate capacity. The sodium storage mechanisms of the CNFs were examined with various nitrogen concentrations and carbonization temperatures. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients of the sodium ions based on the electrochemical impedance spectra measurement have been calculated in the range of 10–15–10–12 cm2 s–1, revealing excellent diffusion mobility for Na atoms in the CNFs. This study demonstrates that optimum nitrogen doping and carbonization temperature demonstrated a lower Warburg coefficient and a higher Na-ion diffusion coefficient leads to enhanced stable electrochemical performance. Thus, our study shows that the nitrogen-doped CNFs will have potential for SIBs.",

Herein, the authors explore the impact of wood precursor components and carbonization temperature on closed pore formation in hard carbon for enhanced battery performance. Although the closed pore structure plays a key role in contributing low-voltage plateau capacity of hard carbon anode for sodium-ion batteries, the formation mechanism of closed pores is still under debate. Here, we employ waste wood-derived hard carbon as a template to systematically establish the formation mechanisms of closed pores and their effect on sodium storage performance. We find that the high crystallinity cellulose in nature wood decomposes to long-range carbon layers as the wall of closed pore, and the amorphous component can hinder the graphitization of carbon layer and induce the crispation of long-range carbon layers. The optimized sample demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 430 mAh g^−1 at 20 mA g^−1 (plateau capacity of 293 mAh g^−1 for the second cycle), as well as good rate and stable cycling performances (85.4% after 400 cycles at 500 mA g^−1).

Detailed evaluation of the data evidence a change of the electrochemical reaction upon cycling leading to the striking long-term performance. Further investigations targeted the reaction mechanism of the first cycle by applying complementary techniques, i.e., powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and 23Na/31P magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated an unexpectedly complex reaction pathway including formation of several intercalation compounds, depending on the amount of Na inserted at the early discharge states and subsequent conversion to Na2S and strongly disordered metallic Cr at the completely discharged state. While XAS measurements suggest no further presence of intermediates after formation of Na intercalation compounds, several different phases are detected via MAS NMR upon continued discharging. Especially the data obtained from the MAS NMR investigations therefore point toward a very complex reaction pathway. Furthermore, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, resulting in the presence of NaF, was observed. After recharging the anode material, no structural long-range order occurred, but short-range order indeed resembled the local environment of the starting material, to a certain extent.",

        "abstract": "MnFe2O4 nanodots (∼3.3 nm) homogeneously dispersed in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MFO@C) were prepared by a feasible electrospinning technique. Meanwhile, MFO@C with the character of flexible free-standing membrane was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high electrochemical performance with high-rate capability (305 mA h g(-1) at 10000 mA g(-1) in comparison of 504 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (ca. 90% capacity retention after 4200 cycles). The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

        "abstract": "The paper reports a facile and cost effective method for fabricating sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles through using MoS2 sheets as the precursor by sodium-modification. The electrochemical performances of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are studied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.01-2.6 V vs. Na(+)/Na under different current densities, using the as-prepared sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles as a working electrode. Typically, the initial discharge and charge capacities of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are 475 and 380 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 20 mA g(-1). The sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles exhibit high capacity with a reversible discharge capacity of about 190 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. It should be emphasized that the discharge reaction consists of two steps which correspond to voltage plateaus of 0.93 V and 0.85 V vs. Na(+)/Na in the first discharge curve of the Na/MoS2 battery, respectively. But there is only one apparent voltage plateau in the Na/Na-Mo-S battery, and it reduces to below 0.5 V vs. Na(+)/Na, which can enhance the power density. All of the findings demonstrate that sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles have steady cycling performance and environmental and cost friendliness as next generation secondary batteries.",

        "abstract": "Graphene incorporation should be one effective strategy to develop advanced electrode materials for a sodium-ion battery (SIB). Herein, the micro/nanostructural Sb/graphene composite (Sb-O-G) is successfully prepared with the uniform Sb nanospheres (∼100 nm) bound on the graphene via oxygen bonds. It is revealed that the in-situ-constructed oxygen bonds play a significant role on enhancing Na-storage properties, especially the ultrafast charge/discharge capability. The oxygen-bond-enhanced Sb-O-G composite can deliver a high capacity of 220 mAh/g at an ultrahigh current density of 12 A/g, which is obviously superior to the similar Sb/G composite (130 mAh/g at 10 A/g) just without Sb-O-C bonds. It also exhibits the highest Na-storage capacity compared to Sb/G and pure Sb nanoparticles as well as the best cycling performance. More importantly, this Sb-O-G anode achieves ultrafast (120 C) energy storage in SIB full cells, which have already been shown to power a 26-bulb array and calculator. All of these superior performances originate from the structural stability of Sb-O-C bonds during Na uptake/release, which has been verified by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies and infrared spectroscopies.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) materials are suitable anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) but still suffer from insufficient initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Promoting sodium storage via the pore filling mechanism is an effective way to improve the ICE, and the key here is regulating the pore structures of HC. In this work, coal-derived HC is successfully engineered with abundant accessible closed nanopores by treating the coal precursors with a facile destructive oxidation strategy. Investigations demonstrate that the destructive oxidation strategy can not only introduce abundant oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) but also decrease the size of graphitic microcrystals. Thus, the OFGs significantly enhance the crosslinking of small graphitic microcrystals and stimulate the formation of accessible closed nanopores during carbonization, which eventually improves the ICE by promoting the pore filling mechanism. The optimized HC exhibits so far the highest ICE (92.2%) among coal-derived SIB anode materials, together with a considerable capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 at 90 mA g-1 and a capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles. The results provide guidelines for developing high-performance HC materials toward the large-scale application of SIBs, which is of great significance for future energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "To design a high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode, binary zinc phosphides (ZnP2 and Zn3P2) were synthesized by a facile solid-state heat treatment process, and their Na storage characteristics were evaluated. The Na reactivity of ZnP2 was better than that of Zn3P2. Therefore, a C-modified ZnP2-based composite (ZnP2-C) was fabricated to achieve better electrochemical performance. To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have drawn remarkable attention due to their low cost and the practically inexhaustible sodium sources. The major obstacle for the practical application of SIBs is the absence of suitable negative electrode materials with long cycling stability and high rate performance. Here, sulfur‐doped double‐shell sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) microspheres constructed from 2D ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized via a templating route combined with a low‐temperature sulfurization process. The resulting double‐shell microspheres deliver a high specific capacity (≈222 mAh g−1 at 1 C), excellent cycling stability (162 mAh g−1 after 15 000 cycles at 20 C), and superior rate capability (122 mAh g−1 at 50 C) as anode for SIBs. The improved electrochemical properties originate from synergistic effects between the unique double‐shell nanostructures built from 2D nanosheets architecture and sulfur doping. This synergistic effect not only stabilize Na2Ti3O7‐based electrode during the cycling, but also improve the sluggish Na insertion/extraction kinetics by narrowing the bandgap of Na2Ti3O7. The synthesis strategy proposed here can be developed into a technical rationale for generating high‐performance sodium‐storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials are considered strong candidates as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), which are expected to play an indispensable role in the carbon‐neutral era. Herein, novel braided porous carbon fibres (BPCFs) are prepared using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The BPCFs possess interwoven porous structures and abundant vacancies. The growth mechanism of the BPCFs can be attributed to the polycrystalline transformation of the nanoporous copper catalyst in the early stage of CVD process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Na+ adsorption energies of the mono‐vacancy edges of the BPCFs (−1.22 and −1.09 eV) are lower than that of an ideal graphene layer (−0.68 eV), clarifying in detail the adsorption‐dominated sodium storage mechanism. Hence, the BPCFs as an anode material present an outstanding discharge capacity of 401 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Remarkably, this BPCFs anode, under high‐mass‐loading of 5 mg cm−2, shows excellent long‐term cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 201 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 1000 cycles.

Herein, we propose a space-confinement strategy to remarkably promote the cycling stability and rate capacity by embedding FePS3 particles in the interlayer of expanded graphite (EG), which are derived from in situ transformation of graphite intercalation compounds. The layered EG not only greatly alleviates the volume fluctuations of FePS3 by the space confinement effect so as to maintain the stability of the electrode microstructure, but it also ensures rapid Na+ and electron transfer during cycling. When acting as an anode for SIBs, the hybrid electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 312.5 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g-1 while retaining an ultralong life span of 1300 cycles with a retention of 82.4% at 10 A g-1.

The kinetic investigations and density functional theory reveal that the unique structure connected by interfacial bonds enhances Na+ transport rate and charge transfer efficiency, while carbon greatly mitigates the volume expansion. Unsurprisingly, the VS4-HCMSs exhibit an impressive first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 91.31% and an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 612 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, even exhibit the reversible capacity of 498.8 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1.

However, the commercialization of this device is hindered by the lack of suitable anodes with an optimized morphology that ensure high capacity and cycling stability of a battery. Here, we not only demonstrate that copper sulfide nanoplates exhibit close-to-theoretical capacity (~560 mAh g^–1) and long-term cyclability, but also reveal that their sodiation follows a non-equilibrium reaction route, which involves successive crystallographic tuning. By employing in situ transmission electron microscopy, we examine the atomic structures of four distinct sodiation phases of copper sulfide nanoplates including a metastable phase and discover that the discharge profile of copper sulfide directly reflects the observed phase evolutions.

        "abstract": "The volume collapse and slow kinetics reaction of anode materials are two key issues for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an \"embryo\" strategy is proposed for synthesis of nanorod-embedded MoO2 /MoS2 /C network nanoarchitecture as anode for SIBs with high-rate performance. Interestingly, L-cysteine which plays triple roles including sulfur source, reductant, and carbon source can be utilized to produce the sulfur vacancy-enriched heterostructure. Specifically, L-cysteine can combine with metastable monoclinic MoO3 nanorods at room temperature to encapsulate the \"nutrient\" of MoOx analogues (MoO2.5 (OH)0.5 and MoO3 ·0.5H2 O) and hydrogen-deficient L-cysteine in the \"embryo\" precursor affording for subsequent in situ multistep heating treatment. The resultant MoO2 /MoS2 /C presents a high-rate capability of 875 and 420 mAh g-1 at 0.5 and 10 A g-1 , respectively, which are much better than the MoS2 -based anode materials reported by far. Finite element simulation and analysis results verify that the volume expansion can be reduced to 42.8% from 88.8% when building nanorod-embedded porous network structure. Theoretical calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and heterointerface engineering can promote the adsorption and migration of Na+ leading to highly enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic reaction.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion battery is one of the promising rechargeable batteries due to the low-cost and abundant sodium sources. In this work, a monolithic sodium ion battery based on a Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, MoS2 layered anode, and polyether-based polymer electrolyte is reported. In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation. The resultant polymer electrolyte exhibits relatively high ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm-1 ) at ambient temperature, wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), and favorable mechanical strength (25 MPa). Moreover, such a monolithic Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /MoS2 sodium ion battery using this polymer electrolyte delivers outstanding rate capability (up to 10 C) and superior cyclic stability (84%) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state. Considering these aspects, this work no doubt provides a new approach for the design of a high-performance polymer electrolyte toward monolithic sodium ion battery with exceptional rate capability and high safety.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great interest as a possible technology for grid-scale energy storage for the past few years owing to the wide distribution, low cost and environmental friendliness of sodium resources and similar chemical mechanisms to those of established Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Nonetheless, the implementation of NIBs is seriously hindered because of their low rate capability and cycling stability. This is mainly because the large ionic size of Na+ can reduce the structural stability and cause sluggish reaction kinetics of electrode materials. Herein, three-dimensional nanoarchitectured coral-like CoSe2@N-doped carbon (CL-CoSe2@NC) was synthesized through solvothermal and selenizing techniques. As a result, CL-CoSe2@NC for NIBs at 2 A g-1 exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 345.4 mA h g-1 after 2800 cycles and a superhigh initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 93.1%. Ex situ XRD, HRTEM, SAED and XPS were executed to study the crystal structure evolution between Na and CoSe2 during sodiation/de-sodiation processes. The aforementioned results indicate that the improved sodium storage property of CL-CoSe2@NC could be attributed to better electrode kinetics and a stable SEI film because of the 3D nanoarchitecture and the existence of the NC layer.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with the advantages of high energy density and low cost have attracted extensive attention as next‐generation rechargeable battery technology. However, SMBs suffer from severe Na dendrite and undesired solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which inevitably destroy cycling durability and safety. Herein, a p‐π conjugated organic molecule (OHTAPQ) with redox‐active carbonyls and pyrazines is employed as a robust artificial SEI layer on Na anode (denoted as OHTAPQ@Na) to address these issues. The unique chelation of N and O with Na+ ions in an OHTAPQ‐based layer facilitates good adsorption capacity and low Na+ diffusion barries for uniform Na deposition behavior. As a result, the OHTAPQ@Na||OHTAPQ@Na symmetric cell shows a long‐term cycle lifespan (over 1500 h at 2 mA cm−2), and the OHTAPQ@Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells deliver a capacity retention of 82% after 1600 cycles.

        "abstract": "Heterojunction, with the advantage of fast charge transfer dynamics, is considered to be an effective strategy to address the low capacity and poor rate capability of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). As well, carbonaceous materials, as a crucial additive, can effectively ameliorate the ion/electron conductivity of integrated composites, realizing the fast ion transport and charge transfer. Here, motivated by the enhancement effect of carbon and heterojunction on conductivity, it is proposed that the CoSe2 /WSe2 heterojunction as inner core is coated by carbon outer shell and uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs), which is used as anode material for SIBs. Combining with density functional theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the structure of heterojunction can introduce built-in electric-field, which can accelerate the transportation of Na+ and improve the conductivity of electrons. Moreover, the introduction of porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) can provide a channel for the transportation of Na+ and avoid the volume expansion during Na+ insertion and extraction process. As it is expected, CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs anode displays ultrastable specific capacity of 501.9 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 over 200 cycles, and ultrahigh rate capacity of 625 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles.",

This investigation explores the solid-liquid interphase alteration of an economical asphalt-derived carbon by incorporating multifunctional carbon dots, aiming to clarify the impact of interfacial properties on sodium-ion storage mechanisms. Enhanced by high density defects and carbonyl groups, the capacity, primarily within the sloping discharge, rise from 247 to 361 mA h g−1 in non-aqueous sodium ion batteries. Integrating experimental and computational methods reveals a marked improvement in PF6\n                     - anions absorption at the interface, refining the solvation structure and concentrating these anions. Consequently, a NaF/Na2CO3-dominated, inorganic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) forms, attributed to the swift PF6\n                     - anion dissociation facilitated by the electrode's rapid electron mobility. This effect promotes sodium ion diffusion and accelerates the kinetics of sodium (de)intercalation. Beyond elucidating interfacial property contributions to the sodium storage in disordered carbon, this study highlights the genesis of irreversible capacity and draws connections between SEI's inorganic components and Coulombic efficiency.

        "abstract": "Magnesium molybdate (MgMoO4), which possesses synergistic features combining both hierarchical plate-like nanomaterials and porous architectures, has been successfully synthesized through a facile combustion synthesis at a low temperature. The hierarchical architecture is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The as-obtained MgMoO4 nanoplates showed a porous structure with a pore-size distribution ranging from 50 to 70 nm. This porosity provides an electron transport pathway and enhanced surface reaction kinetics. The binding energies measured for Mg 2p, Mo 3d, 3p and O 1s are consistent with the literature, and with the metal ions being present as M(ii) and M(vi) states, respectively. This indicates that the oxidation states of the metal cations are as expected. The electrochemical behaviour of MgMoO4 was investigated using aqueous (NaOH) and non-aqueous solvents (NaClO4 in EC : DMC : FEC) for supercapacitor and battery applications. The sodium-ion capacitor involves ion absorption and insertion into the MgMoO4 electrodes resulting in superior power and energy densities. However, the cycling stability was found to be stable only for an aqueous system. The formation of a solid electrolyte surface layer restricted the reversible capacity of the MgMoO4 in the sodium-battery. Nevertheless, it does offer some promise as an anode material for storing energy with high rate performance and excellent capacity retention. Detailed comparative analyses of various electrolytes in storage devices such as hybrid sodium-ion capacitors and sodium-ion batteries are vital for the integration of hierarchical structured materials into practical applications. The reaction mechanisms are postulated.",

        "abstract": "Conversion electrodes, which can realize high capacities by employing the wider valence states of transition metals, are investigated for sodium storage and applied for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Importantly, this work is a first report for the sodium storage ability and related storage mechanism in oxalate compounds, specifically cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4) nanorods. The nanorods are intimately blended with acetylene black powders to achieve sufficient electrical conductivity (∼10-3 S cm-1). The resulting C-CoC2O4 electrode delivers an initial capacity of about 330 mA h (g-CoC2O4)-1 at a rate of 0.2 C (60 mA g-1) and preserves 75% of the initial capacity over 200 cycles. A high charge (oxidation) capacity, ∼111 mA h g-1, was achieved even at 30 C (9000 mA g-1). This remarkable electrode performance is reported for the first time for metal oxalate compounds tested for Na cells, to the best of our knowledge. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy analyses lead to the proposal of a new sodium storage mechanism. For this mechanism, CoC2O4 is converted into Co metal involving with the creation of Na2C2O4 on discharge (reduction), and the Co metal is recovered to CoC2O4 on charge. The employed electroconducting carbon is likely to provide good electron conduction paths, which enables fast conversion on both discharge and charge. A full cell comprised of the C-CoC2O4 anode and carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode exhibits good retention capacity over prolonged cycling, with retention of about 84.7% of the first capacity [107 mA h (g-NaCrO2)-1] for 300 cycles, and is active at a rate of 5 C (550 mA g-1), with a capacity of 79.5 mA h g-1. This result demonstrates the potential of applying C-CoC2O4 as an anode material for rechargeable SIBs.",

Herein, a functional electrolyte containing 1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 -DEGDME) is developed, which can be readily used for NiCo2 S4 anode with high initial coulomb efficiency (96.2%), enhanced cycling performance, and boosted capacities (341.7 mA h g-1 after 250 continuous cycles at the current density of 200 mA g-1 ). The electrochemical tests and related phase characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate the ether-based electrolyte is more suitable for the NiCo2 S4 anode in SIBs due to the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interface. Additionally, the importance of the voltage window is also demonstrated to further optimize the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2 S4 electrode.

        "abstract": "In order to improve the electrochemical kinetics of anatase titania (TiO2), Mn-doped TiO2 incorporated with functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been prepared by a modified hydrothermal method and tested for both lithium (LIB) and sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes. The size of the TiO2 particles is controlled to ∼35-40 nm, with almost even distribution on the MWCNTs surface. The nanostructuring and appropriate doping of cost-effective manganese into the TiO2 host improved the electrochemical performance in terms of high rate capability and specific capacity for both the rechargeable battery systems. For the LIBs, the charge capacity of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT anode is 226.3 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 176.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles as compared with the SIBs, in which the charge capacity is 152.1 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 121.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles. After testing the electrodes at a high current rate of 20C, the nanocomposite electrode can still demonstrate charge capacities of 131.2 and 117.2 mA h g-1 at a 0.1C rate for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The incorporation of Mn-ions (2+, 4+) is found to play a crucial role in terms of defects and vacancy creation, increasing conduction band electrons and lattice expansion to facilitate alkali metal ion diffusion for superior electrochemical performance. The combination of heteroatom doping and use of a highly conductive additive in the form of MWCNTs has resulted in excellent electrode integrity, high ion accessibility, and fast electron transport. Its outstanding cycling stability and remarkable rate performance make the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs and SIBs.",

The microstructure evolution studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, along with electrochemical measurements, reveals the optimal carbonization condition of the mangosteen shell: HC carbonized at 1500 °C for 2 h delivers the highest reversible capacity of ∼330 mA h g–1 at a current density of 20 mA g–1, a capacity retention of ∼98% after 100 cycles, and an ICE of ∼83%.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors are known for their high power densities and superior cycle-life compared to Na-ion batteries. However, low energy densities (˂ 100 Wh kg-1) due to the lack of high capacity (˃ 150 mAh g-1) anodes capable of fast-charging are delaying their practical implementation. Herein, we report a high-performance Na-ion hybrid capacitor based on interface engineered hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode consisting of bronze (~ 15%) and anatase (~ 85%) crystallites (~ 10 nm). This pseudocapacitive dual-phase anode demonstrated exceptional specific capacity of 289 mAh g-1@ 0.025 A g-1, and excellent rate capability (110 mAh g-1@ 1.0 A g-1). Na-ion hybrid capacitor integrating dual-phase hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode and activated carbon cathode exhibited a high energy density of 200 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials in both electrodes) and power density of 6191 W kg-1. These values are in the energy and power density range of Li-ion batteries (100-300 Wh kg-1) and supercapacitors (5000-15000 W kg-1) respectively. Furthermore, exceptional capacity retention of 80% is observed after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Outstanding electrochemical performance of the demonstrated Na-ion hybrid capacitor is credited to the enhanced pseudocapacitive Na-ion intercalation of two-dimensional TiO2 anode resulting from nanointerfaces between bronze and anatase crystallites. Mechanistic investigations evidenced Na-ion storage through intercalation pseudocapacitance with minimal structural changes. This approach of nanointerfaces induced pseudocapacitance presents great opportunities towards developing advanced electrode materials for next-generation Na-ion hybrid capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity, low cost, and excellent cycle stability. However, low electrical conductivity and poor Na+ ion transport in TiO2 limit its practical applications. Here, substantially boosted Na+ ion transport and charge transfer kinetics are demonstrated by constructing a near-ideal non-rectifying titanium carbonitride/nitrogen-doped TiO2 (TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 ) heterostructure. Owing to the fast plasma effects and metastable hybrid phases, the TiCx N1- x is epitaxially grown on TiO2 . Energy band engineering at the interface induces high electron densities and a strong built-in electric field, which lowers the Na+ diffusion barrier by a factor of 1.7. As a result, the TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible specific capacities at rates of 0.1 and 10 C reach 312.3 and 173.7 mAh g-1 , respectively. After 600 cycles of charge and discharge at 10 C, the capacity retention rate is 98.7%. This work discovers an effective non-equilibrium plasma-enabled process to construct heterointerfaces that can enhance Na+ ion transport and provides generic guidelines for the design of heterostructures for a broader range of energy storage, separation, and other devices that rely on controlled ionic transport.",

However, the achievement of superior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and high Na‐storage capacity via low‐temperature carbonization remains challenging due to the presence of tremendous defects with few closed pores. Here, a facile hybrid carbon framework design is proposed from the polystyrene precursor bearing distinct molecular bridges at a low pyrolysis temperature of 800°C via in situ fusion and embedding strategy. This is realized by integrating triazine‐ and carbonyl‐crosslinked polystyrene nanospheres during carbonization. The triazine crosslinking allows in situ fusion of spheres into layered carbon with low defects and abundant closed pores, which serves as a matrix for embedding the well‐retained carbon spheres with nanopores/defects derived from carbonyl crosslinking. Therefore, the hybrid hard carbon with intimate interface showcases synergistic Na ions storage behavior, showing an ICE of 70.2%, a high capacity of 279.3 mAh g−1, and long‐term 500 cycles, superior to carbons from the respective precursor and other reported carbons fabricated under the low carbonization temperature. The present protocol opens new avenues toward low‐cost hard carbon anode materials for high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the most prospective anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with significant potential for commercial applications. However, some long-standing and intractable obstacles, like low first coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate capability, storage capacity, and cycling stability, have severely hindered the conversion process from laboratory to commercialization. The above-mentioned issues are closely related to Na+ transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content. Herein, constructing molybdenum-modified hard carbon solid spheres (Mo2C/HC-5.0), both the ion transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content are comprehensively improved. Specifically, Mo2C/HC-5.0 with higher pseudo-graphitic carbon content provides a large number of active sites and a more stable layer structure, resulting in improved sodium storage capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. Moreover, the lower defect density and specific surface area of Mo2C/HC-5.0 further enhance ICE and sodium storage capacity. Consequently, the Mo2C/HC-5.0 anode achieves a high capacity of 410.7 mA h g-1 and an ICE of 83.9% at 50 mA g-1. Furthermore, the material exhibits exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of 202.8 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 214.9 mA h g-1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g-1.",

The intrinsic in-plane cavities in GDY shells offer three-dimensional Na+ transporting channels, enabling fast Na+ diffusion through the GDY shells. Electrochemical kinetics analyses show that the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit faster Na+ transport kinetics than traditional Sb@C NBs. In situ transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the hollow structure and the void space between Sb and GDY successfully accommodate the volume change of Sb during cycling, and the plastic GDY shell maintains the structural integrity of NBs.

Systematic electrochemical studies with a half-cell configuration show that the present hybrid structure exhibits a promising reversible specific capacity of 348 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles with good rate capability. Simulation result reveals that the iron atoms in nickel iron sulfide act as a primary active site to accommodate Na+ ions. At last, with a full cell configuration using NFCN and Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F as the anode and cathode, respectively, the specific capacity appears to be ≈95 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 condition.

        "title": "Non-graphitic carbon as sodium-ion battery anode materials with improved ratio of plateau to sloping capacities prepared from lignite-based organic maceral",
        "abstract": "Herein, huminite concentrate is obtained from lignite with high yield of 68.9 % by density gradient separation, subsequently converted to non-graphitic carbon (HM-H) by carbonization at 1400 °C for 2 h. Huminite concentrate possesses relatively high oxygen content and considerable amount of aromatic component, with modest yield of volatile matter during pyrolysis, resulting in optimized carbon phase distribution and enhanced electrical conductivity of HM-H. Compared with HM prepared by direct carbonization of lignite, HM-H has slightly higher contents of pseudo-graphitic and graphite-like carbons, and lower content of highly disordered one. Notably, HM-H exhibits remarkably improved electrical conductivity (1773 S m−1) than HM (1406 S m−1). Compared with HM anode for SIBs, HM-H one delivers higher plateau capacity (170.1 mAh g−1) meanwhile lower sloping capacity (91.8 mAh g−1), with significantly improved rate and cycling performances. Full cell assorted with NaFe1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode and HM-H anode demonstrates higher energy density of 210.5 Wh kg−1 than its counterpart (193.8 Wh kg−1) at 20 mA g−1, with superior rate performance (208.6 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1) and a capacity retention ratio of 89.7 % after 100 cycles. This work provides a facile and effective strategy for preparing non-graphitic carbon as high-performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Graphite, the most prominent anode material for Li-ion battery, exhibited very poor performance in sodium ion battery. The electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions in graphite is impeded due to smaller interlayer spacing. Here, we have reported ASR derived hard carbon as a suitable anode electroactive material for Na-ion battery. Prepared via single step selective thermal transformation, the hard carbons contain defects, heteroatoms, nanopore, and ordered carbon zones with expanded interlayer spacing. Among all the hard carbons, the hard carbon synthesised at 1100 \n                        \n                           °C\n                        \n                     , showed better electrochemical performance owing to its improved structural and morphological properties.

Issues like global warming and climate changes have made human to shift their energy choices from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Although Li-ion battery is currently dominating the energy market, yet it falls short to meet the growing large scale energy storage system (EES) demand. Na-ion battery is considered as a worthy contender for growing ESS. The hard carbon studied in this work, can be a potential candidate for use as anode active material in Na-ion battery.",

        "abstract": "Graphene/metal oxides (G/MO) composite materials have attracted much attention as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of the high theoretical capacity. However, most metal oxides operate based on the conversion mechanism and the alloying mechanism has changed to Na2O after the first cycle. The influence of G/Na2O (G/N) on the subsequent sodiation process has never been clearly elucidated. In this work, we report a systematic investigation on the G/N interface from both aspects of theoretical simulation and experiment characterization. By applied first-principles simulations, we find that the sluggish kinetics in the G/MO materials is mainly caused by the high diffusion barrier (0.51 eV) inside the Na2O bulk, while the G/N interface shows a much faster transport kinetics (0.25 eV) via unique double-interstitialcy mechanism. G/N interface possesses an interfacial storage of Na atom through the charge separation mechanism. The experimental evidence confirms that high interfacial ratio structure of G/N greatly improves the rate performance and endows G/MO materials the interfacial storage. Furthermore, the experimental investigation finds that the high interfacial ratio structure of G/N also benefits from the reversible reaction between SnO2 and Sn during cycling. Lastly, the effects of (N, O, S) doping in graphene systems at the G/N interface were also explored. This work provides a fundamental comprehension on the G/MO interface structure during the sodiation process, which is helpful to design energy storage materials with high rate performance and large capacity.",

Here, reducing the structure stress for advanced performances by voltage regulation is demonstrated by using microsized Sn (μ-Sn) for sodium ion batteries as a model. Density functional theory and finite element analysis indicate that Sn/NaSn3 is the crucial phase transition highly responsible for inducing surface cracks, particle aggregations, and cell failures. Eliminating this phase transition by the control of cutoff voltages successfully extends the cycle life of μ-Sn to 2500 cycles at 2 A g-1, much longer than ∼40 cycles in a regular voltage window. The specific capacity is still retained at ∼455 mAh g-1, leading to a capacity decay of only ∼0.0088% per cycle. The results provide a simple way to achieve the outstanding performances without complicated preparation, expensive reagents, and laborious processing.",

        "abstract": "Conversion-alloying type anode materials like metal sulfides draw great attention due to their considerable theoretical capacity for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, poor conductivity, severe volume change, and harmful aggregation of the material during charge/discharge lead to unsatisfying electrochemical performance. Herein, a facile and green strategy for yolk-shell structure based on the principle of metal evaporation is proposed. SnS2 nanoparticle is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanobox (SnS2 @C). The carbon nanoboxes accommodate the volume change and aggregation of SnS2 during cycling, and form 3D continuous conductive carbon matrix by close contact. The well-designed structure benefits greatly in conductivity and structural stability of the material. As expected, SnS2 @C exhibits considerable capacity, superior cycling stability, and excellent rate capability in both SIBs and PIBs. Additionally, in situ Raman technology is unprecedentedly conducted to investigate the phase evolution of polysulfides. This work provides an avenue for facilely constructing stable and high-capacity metal dichalcogenide based anodes materials with optimized structure engineering. The proposed in-depth electrochemical measurements coupled with in situ and ex situ characterizations will provide fundamental understandings for the storage mechanism of metal dichalcogenides.",

Herein, we design Na2C4O4 additives as sodium supplements to compensate for Na defects in PBAs, while utilizing the CO2 products decomposed from Na2C4O4 to construct a robust SEI layer containing Na2CO3 species. As proof of concept, our building of full ANIBs using iron-based PBAs and NaTi2(PO4)3 anode with an appropriate amount of Na2C4O4 enable a reversible capacity of ∼144 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C and an excellent cycling stability of 15,000 cycles with 85% retention at 10 C.

Herein, a conceive of nanoflowers, assembled with Bi2S3 nanorods, is demonstrated to construct the multiphase composition involving TiO2 coating and polypyrrole (PPy) encapsulation. Bi2S3 acted as the dominating active material, in consideration of the low content of TiO2, which ensured the high capacity of the composite. The dual-structural restrain of the TiO2 and PPy coatings can effectively alleviate volume variation based on the pseudo-\"zero-strain\" effect of TiO2 and high flexibility of PPy shells. Meanwhile, the heterointerface greatly enhanced the coupling effect between Bi2S3 and TiO2 and thus improved the electrochemical performance, which was proved by the results of density functional theory calculation and electrochemical tests. Combining the regulation from the Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction and the dual-structural restrain effect, the Bi2S3/TiO2@PPy electrode exhibited excellent rate performance and superior cycle stability (275.8 mA h g-1 over 500 cycles at 10 A g-1).

In the gradient film, the top is rich in Sb, contributing to the capacity, while the bottom is rich in Bi, helping to reduce the stress in the interphase between the film and the substrate. Significantly, this gradient film affords a high reversible capacity of ≈500 mAh g−1 and sustains 82% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C, drastically outperforming the solid‐solution counterpart and many recently reported alloy anodes.

Custom-designed organic materials have been pursued as sustainable alternative electrodes for sodium-ion batteries, offering a solution that bypasses the need for traditional high-temperature synthesis. However, the challenge lies in achieving the desired electrochemical properties through precise structural modulation and the incorporation of redox-active functional groups. In this study, a triptycene-based microporous organic ladder polymer is developed featuring redox-active quinone moieties, designed as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. The vertically aligned quinone moieties in the porous ladder polymer prevent the eclipsed stacking of layers, thereby enhancing the exposure of electroactive sites to electrolyte ions. Additionally, the ladder polymer exhibits almost unimodal pores due to its structural rigidity, facilitating fast Na+ ion diffusion. The redox-active quinone moieties host Na+ ions, and the microporosity supports capacitive ion storage. Consequently, a high reversible specific capacity of 316 mAh g-1 has been achieved. This study introduces a novel design strategy to develop redox-active microporous ladder polymers by carefully selecting organic building units for efficient Na+ ion storage.",

However, the methodological and theoretical design principles of electrolyte/solvation structure and their effect on electrochemical performance are still vague. Here, we propose a cationic weakly coordinating-intervention strategy for modulating the Na^+ solvation sheathes and constructing robust anode/cathode interphases in sodium-metal batteries. Unlike the local highly concentrated electrolytes, 1,2-difluorobenzene can weakly coordinate with Na^+ thus transforming the solvation structure into Na^+-anion-incorporated structures and strengthening anode/cathode interphases formation by combining with salt decomposition. Furthermore, the correlations between the electrode interface properties and solvation structure are revealed, which can be tuned by the weakly coordination. Ultimately, the modulated electrolyte achieves 97.5% Coulombic efficiency for 600 cycles in Na‖Cu cells at 1 mA cm^−2 and a beneficial lifetime (2500 h) in Na‖Na cells. Meanwhile, Na‖PB cells have achieved long-term operation at 4.8 V, along with operation at wide temperatures. Here, authors propose a weakly coordinating-intervention strategy to modulate the Na+ solvation sheath and construct a robust interphase in sodium-metal batteries.

However, the continuous anode solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth associated with electron leakage and the fragile cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) lead to capacity fade at high voltage; and yet the solvation‐interphase‐performance relationship is inadequately addressed. Herein, a cooperative Na+‐solvation strategy is reported to stabilize the interphases by a holistic design of electrolytes combining soft and moderate co‐solvents. The rationally regulated Na+‐solvation leads to CEI/SEI with the desired thickness and component stability. As such, remarkable cycling stability is achieved for 4.3‐V Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with 83.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 1 C, significantly outperforming the carbonate counterpart (41.6% capacity retention). Meanwhile, the restrained SEI growth via reducing the formation of electron‐leaking Na2CO3 stabilizes the long‐term cycling of the hard carbon (HC) anode. The assembled NVOPF||HC full cells achieve superior rate capability (up to 15 C) and stable cycling stability over 500 cycles. The demonstrated engineering of electrolyte chemistry, Na+‐solvation, and interphase structure/component contributes toward the rational establishment of design rules for high‐voltage SIBs and possibly other similar chemistries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (NaMnHCF) is a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries, owing to its voltage profile similar to that of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and its use of abundant, inexpensive resources. This study presents full cell cycling data for NaMnHCF against hard carbon (HC) anodes with various common carbonate‐based electrolytes across different voltage windows. Post‐mortem analyses indicate that, in addition to NaMnHCF degradation, Na+‐ion inventory loss significantly contributes to capacity decline during cycling. Surprisingly, an ICP‐OES analysis of the post‐mortem anodes show that the correct electrolyte choice can entirely prevent the commonly cited manganese dissolution of NaMnHCF during cycling. This work also highlights methods for characterizing and processing NaMnHCF and the broader Prussian White family of materials, helping to introduce these materials to a wider audience. Finally, a comparison between NaMnHCF/HC and LFP/graphite is provided, examining both cost and electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Amorphous silicon (a-Si), due to its satisfactory theoretical capacity, moderate discharge potential, and abundant reserves, is treated as one of the most prospective materials for the anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the slow Na+ diffusion kinetics, poor electrical conductivity, and rupture-prone structures of a-Si restrict its further development. In this work, a composite (a-Si@rGO) consisting of porous amorphous silicon hollow nanoboxes (a-Si HNBs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is prepared. The a-Si HNBs are synthesized through “sodiothermic reduction” of silica hollow nanoboxes at a relatively low temperature, and the rGO is covered on the surface of the a-Si HNBs by electrostatic interaction. The as-synthesized composite anode applying in SIBs exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 681.6 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1, great stability over 2000 cycles at 800 mA g–1, and superior rate performance (261.2, 176.8, 130.3, 98.4, and 73.3 mAh g–1 at 100, 400, 800, 1500, and 3000 mA g–1, respectively). The excellent electrochemical properties are ascribed to synergistic action of the porous hollow nanostructure of a-Si and the rGO coating. This research not only offers an innovative synthetic means for the development of a-Si in various fields but also provides a practicable idea for the design of other alloy-type anodes.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides are a class of promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacity. Nevertheless, the reactant products (polysulfides) could dissolve into electrolyte, shuttle across separator, and react with sodium anode, leading to severe capacity loss and safety concerns. Herein, for the first time, gallium (Ga)-based liquid metal (LM) alloy is incorporated with MoS2 nanosheets to work as an anode in SIBs. The electron-rich, ultrahigh electrical conductivity, and self-healing properties of LM endow the heterostructured MoS2-LM with highly improved conductivity and electrode integrity. Moreover, LM is demonstrated to have excellent capability for the adsorption of polysulfides (e.g., Na2S, Na2S6, and S8) and subsequent catalytic conversion of Na2S. Consequently, the MoS2-LM electrode exhibits superior ion diffusion kinetics and long cycling performance in SIBs and even in lithium/potassium-ion battery (LIB/PIB) systems, far better than those electrodes with conventional binders (polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)). This work provides a unique material design concept based on Ga-based liquid metal alloy for metal sulfide anodes in rechargeable battery systems and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several benefits, including cost-efficiency and fast-charging characteristics, positioning them as attractive substitutes for lithium-ion batteries in energy storage applications. However, the inferior capacity and cycling stability of electrodes in SIBs necessitate further enhancement due to sluggish reaction kinetics. In this respect, the utilization of heterostructures, which can provide an inherent electric field and abundant active sites on the surface, has emerged as a promising strategy for augmenting the cycling stability and rate features of the electrodes. This work delves into the utilization of V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure materials as anodes, initially fabricated via a simplified one-step solid-state sintering technique. The high pseudocapacitance and low characteristic relaxation time constant give the V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure impressive properties, such as a high capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 even after 1500 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g-1 and rate capability of 278.9 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Moreover, the assembled sodium-ion full battery delivers a capacity of 118.5 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. These findings provide novel insight and guidance for the rapid synthesis of heterojunction materials and the advancement of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of sodium ion battery (SIBs) is hindered by the rapid reduction in reversible capacity of the carbon-based anode materials. The outside-in doping on carbon-based anode has been extensively explored. Whereas nickel and NiS2 particles embedded nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous graphene can significantly improve the electrochemical performance, we report a build-in heteroatom \"self-doping\" on albumen derived graphene for sodium storage. The build-in sulfur and nitrogen in albumen act as the doping source during the carbonization of proteins. The S-rich proteins in the albumen can also guide the doping and nucleation of the nickel sulfide nanoparticles. Besides, the porous architecture of the carbonized proteins is achieved through the removable KCl/NaCl salts (medium) at high-temperature melting conditions. And during the carbonization process, the nitrogen can reduce the carbonization temperature of thermally stable carbon materials. In this work, the NS- grapheme delivered a specific capacity of 108.3 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles under a constant current density of 500 mA g-1, In contrast, the Ni/NiS2/NS-graphene maintained a specific capacity of 134.4 mAh g-1.

Moreover, an effective strategy was designed to fabricate RPQDs/rGO nanohybrids for addressing the intrinsic issues of red P as anode materials for SIBs. Benefiting from the nanostructuring of red P and the coupling of RPQDs with rGO, the obtained nanohybrids not only promote electron and ion transfer, but also effectively enhance the electronic conductivity, restrain the aggregation of RPQDs and buffer the large volume changes of red phosphorus during the charge-discharge process. The nanohybrids deliver an initial specific capacity of 1161 mA h g-1 and a low capacity deterioration rate of less than 0.12% per cycle even after 250 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1.

However, many challenges remain for development of SIBs with high specific capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. Therefore, CuS as an important earth-abundant, low-cost semiconductor was applied as anode of SIBs with ether-based electrolyte instead of conventional ester-based electrolyte. By incorporating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) into CuS nanosheets and optimizing the cutoff voltage, it is found that the sodium-ion storage performance can be greatly enhanced using ether-based electrolyte. The CuS-RGO composites deliver an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94% and a maximum specific capacity of 392.9 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. And a specific capacity of 345 mAh g-1 is kept after 450 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1. Such an excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the conductive network construction of CuS-RGO composites, the suppression of dissolved polysulfide intermediates by using ether-based electrolyte, and the avoidance of conversion-type reaction by optimizing the cutoff voltage.",

Carbon-coated Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT (multi-walled carbon nanotube) samples were fabricated by a hydrothermal-assisted sol-gel method and the electrochemical performances were evaluated at three different temperatures (25, 45, and 55°C). The well-crystallized Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples exhibited good cycling stability at both low and high temperatures; they delivered an initial discharge capacity of 120-125 mAhg -1 at a 1C rate with a retention of 53% capacity after 1,400 cycles with 99% columbic efficiency. The half-cell delivered a capacity of 100 mAhg -1 even at a high rate of 10C at room temperature. Furthermore, the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples showed good long-term durability; the capacity loss was an average of 0.05% per cycle at a 1C rate at 55°C. Furthermore, ionic diffusivity and charge transfer resistance were evaluated as functions of state of charge, and they explained the high electrochemical performance of the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples. In-situ heat generation measurements revealed reversible results upon cycling due to the high structural stability of the material. Excellent electrochemical performances were also demonstrated in the full-cell configuration with hard carbon as well as antimony Sb/C anodes.",

        "abstract": "The natural insulating property and notorious pulverization of volume variation-induced materials during cycling pares the electrochemical activity of red phosphorous (RP) for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). To work out these issues, a tailored trimodal porous carbon support comprising highly ordered macropores and micro-mesoporous walls embedded with copper (Cu) nanoclusters (Cu-OMC) is proposed to confine RP. The construction of highly conductive copper-carbon wall facilitates fast electrons and ions transportation, while the interconnected and ordered porous structure not only creates enough space to resist the expansion effect of RP but also minimizes the ion diffusion length and enhances ion accessibility (the ion migration coefficient is ten times that of disordered porous carbon). Consequently, the resulting Cu-OMC@RP anode delivers a high reversible capacity (2498.7 mAh g-1 at 0.3 C for LIBs; 2454.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C for SIBs), superb rate properties (824.7 mAh g-1 at 10 C for LIBs; 774.2 mAh g-1 at 5 C for SIBs), and outstanding cycling stability (an ultralow decay rate of 0.057% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 10 C for LIBs and 0.048% per cycle at 5 C over 500 cycles for SIBs).",

        "abstract": "Developing efficient sodium-ion-storage mechanisms to increase the energy capacity in organic electrodes is a critical issue even after this period of prolonged effort. Uric acid (UA), a simple organic compound with three carbonyl groups is demonstrated to be electrochemically active in the insertion/extraction of Na ions. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that the sodium-ion storage by UA is a result of the stepwise mechanisms of p-π conjugation and the carbon anion. Aside from C═O, the functional group C═C(NH-)2 also provides an efficient Na-storage activated site in which the lone-pair electrons is stabilized through the planar-to-tetrahedral structural transition and low-energy orbital hybridization of N atoms. For further improvement of the electrochemical performance, a uric acid and carbon nanotube (UA@CNT) composite is prepared via a vacuum solution impregnation method. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the UA@CNT composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life even at high current densities. A reversible capacity of over 163 mA h g-1 is maintained even after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. The present study paves a way to develop reversible high-capacity organic electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries by a carbon-anion stabilization mechanism.",

        "abstract": "A sol-gel process followed by heat treatment derived a layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode, which depicted unit cell parameters values of a = 2.8389 Å, c = 10.9899 Å, and V = 76.71 Å3 in powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The synthesized cathode exhibited hexagonal, 2D platelets with an ∼300 nm thickness. During the anodic and cathodic sweeps, the cyclic voltammograms revealed multiple redox peaks with the same current densities, shapes, and peak positions, associated with the highly reversible phase transition mechanism of the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode. The sodium cells yielded the capacities of 93/92 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 87/87 mAh g-1 at 1 C for the 50th charge-discharge cycles. The in situ multimode calorimetry (MMC) studies of sodium cells demonstrated a thermal explosion event, which occurred by sodium melting, short-circuit, electrode decomposition reaction, gas generation, exothermic reaction, released heat energy ,and cell gasket melting. Ultimately, the calculated released total heat energies of ∼550/740 J g-1 for in situ MMC studies and ∼312/594 J g-1 for ex situ DSC analyses (charge state at 4 V and discharge state at 2 V) show that the discharged state of sodiated layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode material is more unsafe than the charge state. Furthermore, the ex situ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectrum of a discharge state at 2 V of layered P2-type NaCoO2 revealed a decreased onset temperature (DOT) at 141 °C with two pronounced exothermic peaks at 197 and 266 °C with a released higher total heat energy of 594 J g-1 than the charge state heat energy at 312 J g-1, attributed to the higher charge onset temperature (COT) at 191 °C. Thus, the observed higher heat energy and decreased onset temperature for the discharge state at 2 V is associated with the higher Na+ ion in the discharge state of the layered P2-type NaxCoO2 cathode than that of the pristine cathode, showcasing that the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode is unsafe at the discharged condition for sodium-ion batteries.",

The as-obtained MCNO@DC nanofibers present superior sodium storage performance and retain an especially high specific capacity of 230 mAh g-1 with a large capacity retention of about 96% at 0.1 A g-1 after 500 cycles and a specific capacity of 107 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of about 89% at 1 A g-1 after 6500 cycles. The outstanding cycle characteristic is mainly due to the tiny MCNO nanoparticles, which shorten the ion migration distance, and the three-dimensional DC framework, which remarkably promotes the electronic transfer and efficiently limits the volume expansion during the progress of insertion and extraction of Na+ ions. Moreover, nitrogen doped in carbon is able to improve the electrochemical capability as well. Finally, kinetic analysis of the redox reactions is used to verify the pseudocapacitive mechanism in charge storage and the feasibility of using MCNO@DC composite nanofibers as an anode for sodium-ion batteries with the above-mentioned behavior.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom doping is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the different roles of surface and bulk heteroatoms in Na storage have not been explored much. Herein, N, P dual-doped carbon nanofibers (NP-CNFs) with high doping contents and low surface area are designed to clarify the above issue. It is confirmed that P plays a more crucial role in Na storage compared with N. In addition, surface and bulk P not only possess different configurations but also show distinct Na storage activity. There are only oxidized POx groups on the surface, which are inactive for Na storage but promote the stability of electrochemistry interphase, while in the bulk phase, unoxidized P-C bonds also emerge except POx, which shows preeminently reversible Na storage activity, and the POx groups are activated simultaneously. Furthermore, P-doping changes the reactivity of N-configurations with Na both on the surface and in the bulk phase, exhibiting interesting synergism. As expected, the surface stability, bulk activity, and synergism enable NP-CNFs to achieve superior performance. It could deliver a prominent capacity of 105.6 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 3000 cycles in half cells and 164.3 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles in full cells.",

In this work, we report the rapid synthesis of expanded graphite (EG) via a high-temperature shock reduction method and enhance its sodium storage capacity through nitrogen doping (EGN). The ultrafast nonequilibrium thermal shock generates a defect-rich structure in EGN, expanding the interlayer distance to 0.44 nm while maintaining the layered ordered structure characteristic of graphite-like materials. Spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the successful incorporation of nitrogen atoms into expanded graphite increases the active sites and enhances Na+ adsorption capability. Consequently, SIBs with EGN anodes achieve a reversible specific capacity of 295 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. This work presents a cost-effective and efficient method for EG synthesis, offering a new strategy for designing advanced sodium-ion anode materials.",

In this contribution, a mild, industrially mature pretreatment method is utilized to selectively regulate biomass components. The hard carbon with a rich closed pore structure is prepared by optimizing the appropriate ratio of biomass composition. Optimized etching conditions enhanced the closed pore volume of hard carbon from 0.15 to 0.26 cm3 g-1. Consequently, the engineered hard carbon exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity of 346 mAh g-1 with a high plateau capacity of 254 mAh g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹, robust rate capability, and cycling stability. The optimized hard carbon shows an 88 mAh g⁻¹ increase in plateau capacity compared to hard carbon from directly carbonizing bamboo fibers. This mature approach provides an easy-to-operate industrial pathway for designing high-capacity biomass-based hard carbons for sodium-ion batteries.",

Therefore, polycrystalline Na‐β″‐alumina is employed as a SE model material to investigate the microstructural influence on sodium filament growth during deposition of sodium metal at the anode. The research focuses on the relationship between the microstructure, in particular grain boundary (GB) type and orientation, sodium filament growth, and sodium ion transport, utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements in combination with crystal orientation analysis. The effect of the anisotropic sodium ion transport at/across GBs depending on the orientation of the sodium ion transport planes and the applied electric field on the current distribution and the position of sodium filament growth is explored. The in situ TEM analysis is validated by large field of view post‐mortem secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) analysis, in which sodium filament growth within voids and along grain boundaries is observed, contributing to the sodium network formation potentially leading to failure of batteries.",

This full cell achieves a high specific energy of 203 Wh kg-1 (based on both active electrodes). Such an enhanced performance is attributed to the unique thorny-durian-like architecture and bimetallic alloy composition.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered the most commercially viable anode material for sodium ion batteries due to its excellent sodium storage properties. However, the production cost of hard carbon is high, so optimizing the electrochemical performance of coal-derived hard carbon is adopted. However, due to the dense structure of coal, it is difficult to prepare closed pores inside the coal-derived hard carbon, which is not conducive to increasing capacity. Therefore, we propose Zn2(OH)2CO3 assisted ball milling pretreatment followed by carbonization to generate closed pores in coal-derived hard carbon. The reason for the formation of closed pores is that the uniform pores on the coal surface generated by the wear and etching of Zn2(OH)2CO3 are repaired at high temperatures. Via mechanism characterization, we verified that the plateau capacity is related to the filling of sodium ions in closed pores. Therefore, the as-prepared coal-derived hard carbon delivers a high capacity of 325.3 mA h g−1 (plateau capacity accounting for 45.1%) at a current density of 0.03 A g−1 with a capacity retention rate of 83.5% over 500 cycles. This work has demonstrated that reasonable pore design is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical sodium storage performance of coal-derived hard carbon, providing an effective approach for the high value-added utilization of coal.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries are promising alternatives to Li-ion systems for electrochemical energy storage because of the higher natural abundance and widespread distribution of Na compared to Li. High capacity anode materials, such as phosphorus, have been explored to realize Na-ion battery technologies that offer comparable performances to their Li-ion counterparts. While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities, the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood, limiting further optimization. Here, we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the (de)sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping, ab initio random structure searching, and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation, analysis of 31P chemical shift anisotropies in NMR data reveals P helices and P at the end of chains as the primary structural components in amorphous Na xP phases. X-ray diffraction data in conjunction with variable field 23Na magic-angle spinning NMR support the formation of a new Na3P crystal structure (predicted using density-functional theory) on sodiation. During desodiation, P helices are re-formed in the amorphous intermediates, albeit with increased disorder, yet emphasizing the pervasive nature of this motif. The pristine material is not re-formed at the end of desodiation and may be linked to the irreversibility observed in the Na-P system.",

However, achieving quick charge and high power density is still a major challenge for most SIBs electrodes because of the sluggish sodiation kinetics.

A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction.

        "abstract": "The enhancement of the structural stability of conversion-based metal sulfides at high current densities remains a major challenge in realizing the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2 @NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling. The mesoporous carbon structure provides excellent electrolyte impregnation, efficient charge transport pathways, and good volume expansion buffering. The CuS/FeS2 @NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 ), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1 ), and good rate capability up to 5 A g-1 . The simple, facile synthetic route combined with the rational design of bimetallic PBA nanostructures can be widely utilized in the development of conversion-based metal sulfides and other high-capacity anode materials for high-performance SIBs.",

EP has been used to characterise LIBs; here, we demonstrate the first application of EP to any NIB material. The voltage versus sodiation fraction curves (voltage profiles) of hard carbon lack clear features, consisting only of a slope and a plateau, making it difficult to clarify the structural features of hard carbon that could optimise cell performance. We find additional features through EP that are masked in the voltage profiles.

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon materials are attractive for sodium-ion batteries due to their abundance, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. However, their widespread use is hindered by their limited specific capacity. Herein, a type of bamboo-derived hard carbon with adjustable pore structures is developed by employing a ball milling technique to modify the carbon chain length in the precursor. It is observed that the length of the carbon chain in the precursor can effectively control the rearrangement behavior of the carbon layers during the high-temperature carbonization process, resulting in diverse pore structures ranging from closed pores to open pores, which significantly impact the electrochemical properties. The optimized hard carbon with abundant closed pores exhibits a high specific capacity of 356 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, surpassing that of bare hard carbon (243 mAh g-1) and hard carbon with abundant open pores (129 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1). However, the kinetic analysis reveals that hard carbon with open pores shows better sodium-ion diffusion kinetics, indicating that a balance between the closed and open pores should be considered. This research offers valuable insights into pore design and presents a promising approach for enhancing the performance of hard carbon anode materials derived from biomass precursors.",

These anodes, however, face challenges such as declined cyclability and rate capability, primarily due to mechanical degradation reduced by significant volumetric changes (over 252%) and slow kinetics of sodium-ion storage. Herein, we introduce a novel anode design featuring densely packed bismuth (Bi) embedded within highly conductive carbon microspheres to overcome the aforementioned challenges. Remarkably, the high loading Bi anode within carbon microspheres with a high tap density of 2.59 g cm-3 possesses significant mechanical strength exceeding 590 MPa and limits volume swelling of only 10.9% post-sodiation. This anode demonstrates a high volumetric capacity (908.3 mAh cm-3), ultrafast chargeability (200 A g-1, full charge/discharge in just 5.5 s), and outstanding cyclability over 12,000 cycles and maintains exceptional cycling stability even at -30 °C. The full cell paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode retains over 80% capacity after 600 cycles at 36 C, demonstrating a remarkable rate capability of 126 C (full charge/discharge in 28.6 s). Our comprehensive experimental evaluations and chemo-mechanical simulations shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the anode's superior performance.

However, the choice of suitable anode materials is a key step in the application of SIBs. Here, a simple vacuum filtration method is reported to obtain a bimetallic heterojunction structure.

The results show that the electron rich Se site and the internal electric field generated by the electron transfer in the heterojunction structure can provide rich electrochemically active areas and effectively promote the electron transport during sodiation/desodiation. More attractively, the strong interfacial interaction in the interface on the one hand maintains the stability of the structure and on the other hand promotes the diffusion of electrons. The NiCoSex/CG heterojunction with a strong oxygen bridge exhibits a high reversible capacity of 338 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and an ignorable capacity attenuation at 2 A g-1 for 2000 cycles. The flexible full battery still shows good reversibility and output stability under bending and crimping. This idea of obtaining high-performance anodes by designing a heterojunction structure and constructing an oxygen bridge can provide a new vision for the design of other materials.",

        "abstract": "Fe2 O3 is regarded as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity. The large volume change during discharge and charge processes, however, induces significant cracking of the Fe2 O3 anodes, leading to rapid fading of the capacity. Herein, a novel peapod-like nanostructured material, consisting of Fe2 O3 nanoparticles homogeneously encapsulated in the hollow interior of N-doped porous carbon nanofibers, as a high-performance anode material is reported. The distinctive structure not only provides enough voids to accommodate the volume expansion of the pea-like Fe2 O3 nanoparticles but also offers a continuous conducting framework for electron transport and accessible nanoporous channels for fast diffusion and transport of Li/Na-ions. As a consequence, this peapod-like structure exhibits a stable discharge capacity of 1434 mAh g-1 (at 100 mA g-1 ) and 806 mAh g-1 (at 200 mA g-1 ) over 100 cycles as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. More importantly, a stable capacity of 958 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles and 396 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles can be achieved for LIBs and SIBs, respectively, at a large current density of 2000 mA g-1 . This study provides a promising strategy for developing long-cycle-life LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon made from bamboo has been considered as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries because of its renewability and high-performance. Nitrogen-doping can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of carbon materials through enhancing the conductivity and maintaining the stability. In this work, two series of N-doped hard carbon materials derived from bamboo were prepared by heating the mixture of hard carbon and melamine at different temperatures from 700 to 900 °C with various mass ratios of melamine to hard carbon 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1. The non-porous structure of the carbon particles made it difficult to achieve a high nitrogen content, and nitrogen would not be successfully doped into carbon at too high temperatures. Nitrogen doping into hard carbon would affect the structure and electrochemical properties. Among as-prepared samples, the one prepared with a mass ratio of 1:1 at 800 °C exhibited optimum performance with a high reversible specific capacity of 329.1 mAh·g−1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.5 % at 30 mA·g−1. Moreover, it had excellent rate capability of 206.2 mAh·g−1 at 1.5 A·g−1. After 100 cycles at 0.3 A·g−1, the capacity retention rate was 92.9 %.

First, heterostructured 2D building blocks are self-assembled during co-exfoliation in the solution phase based on electrostatic attraction of different 2D materials. Second, electrophoretic deposition is used as a tool to assemble these building blocks into macroscopic films containing these self-assembled 2D heterostructures. Characterization of deposits formed using this technique elucidates the presence of stacked and sandwiched 2D heterostructures, and zeta potential measurements confirm the mechanistic interactions driving this assembly. Building on the exceptional sodium alloying capacity of BP, these materials were demonstrated as superior binder-free and additive-free anodes for sodium batteries with specific discharge capacity of 2365 mA h gP-1 and long stable cycling duration. This study demonstrates how controllable co-processing of 2D materials can enable material control for stacking and building block assembly relevant to broad future applications of 2D materials.",

The application has been also studied for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The finely crystallized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (around 5 nm in size) are uniformly grown on the PPy nanotubes. When tested as anode materials for SIBs, the CFO-PPy-NT electrode maintains a discharge capacity of 400 mA h g-1 and a stable Coulombic efficiency of 98% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Even at a higher current density of 1000 mA g-1, the composite can still retain a discharge capacity of 220 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of CoFe2O4 on the 3-D matrix of PPy interconnected nanotubes, which favors the diffusion of sodium ions and electronic transportation and also buffers the large volumetric expansion during charge/discharge. Thereby our study suggests that such CFO-PPy-NTs have great potential as an anode material for SIBs.",

Herein, a simple bimetallic selenide hydrothermal strategy is used to synthesize (Ni,Co)Se_2 (NCS) nanostructures by regulating with polyethylene glycol 500 (PEG-500). The material morphology assessment indicated that the prepared NCS materials exhibit a network structure formed by stacked nanoparticles. Remarkably, part of the NCS nanoparticles (marked as NCS10) grew into smooth polygonal nanosheets when 10 ml PEG-500 was added, which has presented a specific capacity of 357.7 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1 A·g^−1 after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, it delivered an excellent rate performance of 318.2 mAh·g^−1 at 5 A·g^−1. It is the synergized effect of ultrathin NCS10 polygonal nanosheets and special porous network structure formed by nanoparticles that ensure favourable structural stability for the insertion and deinsertion of Na^+ during sodiation/desodiation reaction, and the superior sodium storage rate can be attributed to the pseudocapacitance contribution.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in recent years. In order to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performances, such as specific capacity, reversibility, and rate capability of the anode materials, should be further improved. In this work, a Fe2O3/C composite with a well-ordered mesoporous structure is prepared via a facile co-impregnation method by using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template. When used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the well-ordered mesoporous structure ensures fast mass transport kinetics. The presence of nano-sized Fe2O3 particles confined within the carbon walls significantly enhances the specific capacity of the composite. The carbon walls in the composite act not only as an active material contributing to the specific capacity, but also as a conductive matrix improving the cycling stability of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As a result, the well-ordered mesoporous Fe2O3/C composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent cycleability, and high rate capability. It is proposed that this simple co-impregnation method is applicable for the preparation of well-ordered mesoporous transition oxide/carbon composite electrode materials for high performance sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) has been regarded as a favorable cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high voltage and stable structure. However, the limited electronic conductivity restricts its rate performance. NVPF@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach with subsequent calcination to shorten the hydrothermal time. NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm distributed on rGO can be obtained, delivering excellent electrochemical performance such as a longevity life (a high capacity retention of 85.6% after 7000 cycles at 10 C) and distinguished rate capability (116 mAh g-1 at 50 C with a short discharging/charging time of 1.2 min). The full battery with a Cu2Se anode represents a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. The introduction of rGO can augment the electronic conductivity and advance the Na+ diffusion speed, boosting the cycling and rate capability. Besides, the small lattice change (3.3%) and high structural reversibility during the phase transition process between Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaV2(PO4)2F3 testified by in situ X-ray diffraction are also advantageous for Na storage behavior. This work furnishes a simple method to synthesize polyanionic cathodes with ultrahigh rate and ultralong lifespan for fast-charging SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries stand a chance of enabling fast charging ability and long lifespan while operating at low temperature (low-T). However, sluggish kinetics and aggravated dendrites present two major challenges for anodes to achieve the goal at low-T. Herein, we propose an interlayer confined strategy for tailoring nitrogen terminals on Ti_3C_2 MXene (Ti_3C_2-N_funct) to address these issues. The introduction of nitrogen terminals endows Ti_3C_2-N_funct with large interlayer space and charge redistribution, improved conductivity and sufficient adsorption sites for Na^+, which improves the possibility of Ti_3C_2 for accommodating more Na atoms, further enhancing the Na^+ storage capability of Ti_3C_2. As revealed, Ti_3C_2-N_funct not only possesses a lower Na-ion diffusion energy barrier and charge transfer activation energy, but also exhibits Na^+-solvent co-intercalation behavior to circumvent a high de-solvation energy barrier at low-T. Besides, the solid electrolyte interface dominated by inorganic compounds is more beneficial for the Na^+ transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Compared with of the unmodified sample, Ti_3C_2-N_funct exhibits a twofold capacity (201 mAh g^−1), fast-charging ability (18 min at 80% capacity retention), and great superiority in cycle life (80.9%@5000 cycles) at − 25 °C. When coupling with Na_3V_2(PO_4)_2F_3 cathode, the Ti_3C_2-N_funct//NVPF exhibits high energy density and cycle stability at − 25 °C. An interlayer confined strategy to realize the substitution of nitrogen terminals between Ti_3C_2 MXene layers is proposed. The targeted Ti_3C_2-N_funct anode exhibits fast-charging ability and great superiority in cycle life at − 25 °C. Ti_3C_2-N_funct not only possesses a lower Na-ion diffusion energy barrier and charge transfer activation energy, but also exhibits Na^+-solvent co-intercalation behavior at low temperature.",

Herein, chemical and electrochemical stability of propylene carbonate (PC)-based electrolytes on sodium metal and hard carbon anodes is investigated systematically. The results demonstrate that whether using NaClO4 or NaPF6, the PC-based electrolytes are not stable on Na metal, but adding of FEC can immensely enhance the stability of the electrolyte because of the compact solid electrolyte interphase film formed. The electrolytes containing FEC also exhibit high electrochemical compatibility on hard carbon anodes, showing high reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance. A reaction mechanism based on the Na+ induction effect is proposed by spectrum and electrochemical measurements.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, but the performance remains unsatisfactory and the sodiation mechanism in HC is one of the most debated topics. Here, from self-assembled cellulose nanocrystal sheets with crystallographic texture, unique HC nanosheets with vertically oriented (002) planes are fabricated and used as a model HC to investigate the sodiation mechanisms using synchrotron scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The model HC simplifies the 3D sodiation in a typical HC particle into a 2D sodiation, which facilitates the visualization of phase transformation at different states of charge. The results for the first time unveil that the sodiation in HC initiates heterogeneously, with multiple propagation fronts proceeding simultaneously, eventually merging into larger aggregates. The spatial correlation between the preferential adsorption and nucleation sites suggests that the heterogeneous nucleation is driven by the local Na-ion concentration, which is determined by defects or heteroatoms that have strong binding to Na ions. By identifying intercalation as the dominant sodium storage mechanism in the model HC, the findings highlight the importance of engineering the graphene layer orientation and the structural heterogeneity of edge sites to enhance the performances.",

        "abstract": "NaVPO4F has garnered significant attention as a promising cathode material for non‐aqueous sodium‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity and appropriate potential. However, the dissolution of vanadium component of NaVPO4F in aqueous electrolytes has restricted its application in aqueous sodium‐ion batteries (ASIBs). Herein, we report the use of carbon‐coated NaVPO4F as a cathode material in ASIBs. This cathode material exhibited a discharge capacity of 111 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a concentrated 17 m NaClO4 aqueous solution and demonstrated capacity retention of 74.4 % over 100 cycles. The experimental results confirmed that the carbon coating on NaVPO4F and high‐concentration NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibited positive effects in restraining vanadium dissolution. Additionally, when configuration with NaTi2(PO4)3@C as anode, the full cell exhibited a capacity of 43.9 mAh g−1 with an average operating voltage of 1.2 V at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in a concentrated 17 m NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte. These outcomes underscore the potential of NaVPO4F@C as a promising cathode material for ASIBs.",

Herein, we elaborately designed stable Sb-doped metallic 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (1T-MoS2-Sb) with a few-layered nanosheet structure via a simple calcination technique. The N-doping of the carbon and Sb-doping induce the formation of T-phase MoS2, which not only effectively enhances the entire stability of the structure, but also improves its cycling performance and stability. When employed as an anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), 1T-MoS2-Sb exhibits a reversible capacity of 493 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and delivers prominent long-term performance (253 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 2200 cycles) along with decent rate capability. Paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, it displays a superior capacity of 242 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 over 100 cycles, which is one of the best performances of a MoS2-based full cell for SIBs.

When Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC composite is utilized as an anode electrode material in LIB and SIB half cells, the material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and remarkable cycle stability with retaining high capacities. In LIB and SIB half cells, the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material shows the ultralong lifespan at 2000 mAg-1, retaining a capacity of 543 mAhg-1 after 750 cycles, and retaining a capacity of 251 mAhg-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mAg-1, respectively. The porous structure of the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material can not only effectively tolerate the volume expansion of the electrode during discharging and charging, but also facilitate the penetration of electrolyte and efficiently prevents the clustering of active particles.

MXenes, as one of the most promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries, have been reported to have many advantages, such as high electronic conductivity and a hydrophilic surface. However, the compact multilayer structure and deficient delamination significantly inhibits their application, requiring high energy and showing decreased storage capacity and poor rate capabilities. Few-layer MXene has been proved to benefit superior electrochemical properties with a better ionic conductivity and two-dimensional layer structure. Herein, we report scale delamination of few-layer MXene nanosheets as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, which are prepared via an organic solvent assist high-energy mechanical-milling method. This approach efficiently prevents the oxidation of MXene and produces few-layer nanosheets structure, facilitating fast electron transport and Na+ diffusion. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the few-layer MXenes show high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and good rate performance. Specifically, few-layer MXene nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 267 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. After cycling 1500 cycles at a high rate of 1 A g-1, a reversible capacity of 76 mA h g-1 could be maintained.",

To address this issue, a study was conducted to synthesize graphene-attached hierarchical porous Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 microspheres (NVP/GO). Using a hydrothermal method and high temperature sintering process with 1,4-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (NDC) as a carbon source, this study successfully improved the transport dynamics of NVP/GO, resulting in enhanced rate capability and cycling performance. The NVP/GO microspheres exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 108.6 mAh g^−1 at 0.5 C, and even at a high rate of 20 C, the capacity remained at 81.2 mAh g^−1. Impressively, after 10,000 cycles at 10 C, the capacity only experienced a minimal decay of 0.006% per cycle, indicating excellent cycling stability. Ex-situ XRD analysis further confirmed the reversible Na ion extraction/insertion process of the NVP/GO electrode. Moreover, when NVP/GO was assembled into full cells with NVP/GO as both the cathode and anode, the electrochemical performance remained highly satisfactory.

        "abstract": "The design of sodium ion batteries is proposed based on the use of flexible membrane composed of ultrasmall transition metal oxides. In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 , an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1 , and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1 . The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",

        "abstract": "Developing the high-capacity anode materials such as conversion-type metal oxides which possess both Li and Na storage activity is very practical for the high-energy Li-ion battery (LIB) and Na-ion battery (LIB). Herein, we use NiCo_2O_4 anodes as a model to investigate the morphology evolution which accounts for the poor cycling performance and understand the effect of structure optimization on the electrochemical performance. Three NiCo_2O_4 samples with different morphologies of microspheres, nanospheres and nanosheets are synthesized. Firstly, the serious structural degradation of NiCo_2O_4 microspheres is observed whether it works as a LIB or SIB anode. In addition, a significant difference between the lithiation and sodiation capacity of NiCo_2O_4 materials reveals Na^+ ions only partially intercalated in NiCo_2O_4 and the conversion reaction limited by the strain. Next, NiCo_2O_4 nanosheets on Ni foam as a binder-free anode for the LIB are investigated which suggest the positive effect of 3D nanostructures on the morphology stability. As a result, NiCo_2O_4 nanosheets deliver a high lithiation capacity of 1092 mAh g^−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g^−1 and an excellent rate capacity of 643 mAh g^−1 at 4 A g^−1. Finally, NiCo_2O_4 nanospheres are evaluted as a SIB anode which indicate the smaller particle size of active materials is beneficial to the release of stress and structure stability during discharge–charge processes. Relatively speaking, the nano sheet structure is with the best electrochemical performance based on the capacity retention. A rational design of the electrode’ architecture is very important for the conversion-type 3d transition metal oxide anodes for the advanced LIB and SIB.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra-low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3°C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60°C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40°C. This work sheds new lights on the ion-dipole regulation for ultra-low temperature SIBs.",

A low-cost Na-K alloy is liquid at 25 °C from 9.2 to 58.2 wt% of sodium; sodium and/or potassium can be plated dendrite-free in the liquid range at room temperature. The co-existence of two alkali metals in an anode raises a question: whether the liquid Na-K alloy acts as a Na or a K anode. Here we show the alkali-metal that is stripped from the liquid Na-K anode is dependent on the preference of the cathode host. It acts as the anode of a sodium rechargeable cell if the cathode host structure selectively accepts only Na+ ions; as the anode of a potassium rechargeable cell if the cathode accepts K+ ions in preference to Na+ ions. This dual-anode behavior means the liquid Na-K alkali-alloy can be applied as a dendrite-free anode in Na-metal batteries as well as K-metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium‐metal batteries such as Na–O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite‐free sodium‐metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (>10 mA cm−2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h‐M‐SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80−250 µm). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h‐Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm−2) and a high cut‐off capacity (40 mAh cm−2). Moreover, a Na–O2 battery with an h‐M‐SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137 V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 and 1000 mAh g−1. This deposition‐regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high‐performance sodium‐metal‐anode‐based batteries.",

To address these issues, herein, SnO2 quantum dots (≈5 nm) embedded in porous N-doped carbon matrix (SnO2 /NC) are developed via a hydrothermal step combined with a self-polymerization process at room temperature. The ultrasmall size in quantum dots can greatly shorten the ion diffusion distance and lower the internal strain, improving the conversion reaction efficiency and coulombic efficiency. The rich mesopores/micropores and highly conductive N-doped carbon matrix can further enhance the overall conductivity and buffer effect of the composite. As a result, the optimized SnO2 /NC-2 composite for LIBs exhibits a high coulombic efficiency of 72.9%, a high discharge capacity of 1255.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and a long life-span with a capacity of 753 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Composite cathodes have attracted great attentions due to the integrated advantages of each pure structure. And the component ratio deserves a carefully modulation to further improve the corresponding electrochemical performance. Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid composite became a focus in sodium ion batteries due to the supe-riority in high performance, low cost and non-toxicity. In the previous reports, the structure modulation was car-ried out via changing the synthesis condition, varying the transition metal element ratio, and different ion doping. And it is still challenging to explore a more feasible method to simplify the adjustment process. Herein, we intro-duced Mg2+ into Na sites or transition metal sites in Na0.6MnO2 and firstly discovered the doping-sites variation induced structure adjustment phenomenon. Specifically, Mg doping in transition metal sites could be beneficial for the growth of the P2-type structure while layer/tunnel component ratio decreased when locating Mg2+ in Na sites. The P2-O2 phase transformations could be effectively suppressed by locating Mg2+ in both sites could the in high voltage regions and thus improve cycling performance. The designed material, Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2, could attain a decent capacity of 100 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 and a satisfied retention of 76.6 % after 500 cycles. Ad-ditionally, ex situ XRD experiments verify the excellent structural stability of Mg-substituted samples during charge-discharge processes. Moreover, the Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2 also displays superior sodium-ion full-cell proper-ties when merged with hard carbon anode. Thus, this research may indicate a proper novel thread for designing high-performance composite electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising technology for advanced energy storage systems. Hard carbon (HC) is a commonly used SIB anode material; however, the Na ion storage mechanism in HC remains poorly understood and highly debated. Here, the paramagnetic species in HC during Na ion storage are systematically studied to elucidate the underlying mechanism at an electronic level using high‐resolution electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, complemented by in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction, and density functional theory calculations. This investigation identifies and characterizes the coexistence of two distinct intercalation processes in HC: Na ion intercalation and Na+‐solvent co‐intercalation, which are active across both the sloping and plateau voltage regions. Additionally, in the sloping region, Na ions are also stored at in‐plane Stone‐Wales defect sites, which transition into a quasi‐metallic state and subsequently to metallic Na as Na ion intercalation progresses. This transformation is driven by charge redistribution within the graphene layers. These insights establish a direct paramagnetic‐electronic structure‐electrochemical property relationship in HC, providing new insights into the Na ion storage mechanism. Furthermore, this study highlights the unique capability of EPR spectroscopy in elucidating the charge storage mechanism in electrode materials.",

However, small molecular organic materials suffer from issues such as low conductivity and the high dissolution rate in electrolytes. Herein, a phthalocyanine derivative (TPcDS) with a large non-localized π-electron system, obtained through thermodynamic polymerization of 4-aminophthalonitrile (AP) monomers, is designed to address these issues. According to the density function theory calculation, six sodium ions can be attracted by one polymer molecule, indicating a high theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g-1 . The TPcDS molecule realizes sodium storage through a non-localized π-electron system of phthalocyanine macrocycles. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the functional groups of phthalocyanine macrocycles, such as CN groups in TPcDS, experience obviously reversible structural variation upon discharge/charge. A high reversible capacity of 364 mAh g-1 is achieved at a current density of 0.05 A g-1 , and a charge capacity of as high as 246 mAh g-1 is still maintained after 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 . This work provides an effective strategy for the design and synthesis of new oligomeric organic electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "MXene nanosheets and ordered porous carbons both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Assembling and combining the advantages of the two will be a good choice for battery electrode hosts of active materials. In this work, an electrostatic separation-adsorption strategy is proposed to realize the ordered alternating self-assembly of MXene nanosheets and ordered porous carbon (MPOC), obtaining a unique wall-like porous material with a high conductivity and interconnected porous nanostructure, which strengthens the transfer rate of electrons and ions simultaneously. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doping from porous carbon into MPOC prolongs the cycle life. When use red phosphorus (RP) as active materials, the MPOC@RP anode exhibited high-capacity output (2454.3 and 2408.1 mAh g-1 in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) at 0.1 C) and long cycle life (the decay rates per cycle of 0.028% and 0.036% after 1500 and 1200 cycles at 2 C in LIBs and SIBs respectively). The successful application in RP anodes displays great potential in other electrode materials such as silicon, sulfur, selenium, and so on. Meanwhile, this strategy is also effective to design other composites materials like MXene and carbon nanotubes, MXene and Graphene, and so on.",

        "abstract": "Highly crystalline CuFeS2 containing earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements prepared via a high-temperature synthesis exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. The initial specific capacity of 460 mAh g-1 increases to 512 mAh g-1 in the 150th cycle and then decreases to a still very high value of 444 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in the remaining 550 cycles. Even for a large current density, a pronounced cycling stability is observed. Here, we demonstrate that combining the results of X-ray powder diffraction experiments, pair distribution function analysis, and 23Na NMR and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations performed at different stages of discharging and charging processes allows elucidation of very complex reaction mechanisms. In the first step after uptake of 1 Na/CuFeS2, nanocrystalline NaCuFeS2 is formed as an intermediate phase, which surprisingly could be recovered during charging. On increasing the Na content, Cu+ is reduced to nanocrystalline Cu, while nanocrystalline Na2S and nanosized elemental Fe are formed in the discharged state. After charging, the main crystalline phase is NaCuFeS2. At the 150th cycle, the mechanisms clearly changed, and in the charged state, nanocrystalline CuxS phases are observed. At later stages of cycling, the mechanisms are altered again: NaF, Cu2S, and Cu7.2S4 appeared in the discharged state, while NaF and Cu5FeS4 are observed in the charged state. In contrast to a typical conversion reaction, nanocrystalline phases play the dominant role, which are responsible for the high reversible capacity and long-term stability.",

        "abstract": "To achieve high‐quality hard carbon nanofibers (HCNFs), and particularly flexible HCNFs films is the eternal pursuit from low‐cost coal pitch (CP). However, it is still trapped seriously by the inborn bottleneck of low‐softening‐point (LSP) characteristics of CP itself. Herein, an efficient Bi(NO3)3·5H2O‐assisted electrospinning‐carbonization methodology is creatively devised to obtain flexible HCNFs films directly from LSP CP. The essential roles of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and pre‐oxidation in constructing flexible films are rationally proposed. With further regulation in Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dosage and calcination temperatures, specific micro‐structures/morphologies of flexible HCNFs films are finely optimized. The optimum HCNFs‐1.2 film is endowed with robust structural flexibility/stability, high‐content active oxygen/nitrogen groups, abundant graphic microcrystalline zones of large interlayer spacing, and convenient ion‐diffusion channels. Thanks to such remarkable merits, HCNFs‐1.2 retains a large reversible capacity of 125.3 mAh g‒1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1, when evaluated as a self‐supporting film anode for sodium dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs). Furthermore, the HCNFs‐1.2‐based SDIBs deliver a specific capacity of 90.9 mAh g‒1 at 0.1 A g‒1, along with a capacity retention of 78.4% after 1500 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1. The insightful understanding here will provide meaningful guidance for rational design of advanced flexible film electrodes toward next‐generation SDIBs and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency of traditional SIBs severely impedes their further development. Here, a highly active Na2 S-based composite is employed as a self-sacrificial additive for sodium compensation in SIBs. The in situ synthesized Na2 S is wrapped in a carbon matrix with nanoscale particle size and good electrical conductivity, which helps it to achieve a significantly enhanced electrochemical activity as compare to commercial Na2 S. As a highly efficient presodiation additive, the proposed Na2 S/C composite can reach an initial charge capacity of 407 mAh g-1 . When 10 wt.% Na2 S/C additive is dispersed in the Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, and combined with a hard carbon anode, the full cell achieves 24.3% higher first discharge capacity, which corresponds to a 18.3% increase in the energy density from 117.2 to 138.6 Wh kg-1 . Meanwhile, it is found that the Na2 S additive does not generate additional gas during the initial charging process, and under an appropriate content, its reaction product has no adverse impact on the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs. Overall, this work establishes Na2 S as a highly effective additive for the construction of advanced high-energy-density SIBs.",

The crystal structure, chemical composition and surface properties of the synthesized NiO-CoO nanohybrid were analyzed using various characterization methods. The lithium and sodium-ion charge-transfer characteristics of the NiO-CoO nano hybrid electrode were evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The LIB half-cell containing the NiO-CoO hybrid anode exhibited an excellent specific capacity of 739 mA h g-1 at 0.1C-rate. Additionally, SIB performance was also investigated, delivering 340 mA h g-1 of specific capacity at 0.1C-rate. Interestingly, a full-cell (NiO-CoO|1M LiPF6|LiCoO2) was assembled for the first time, employing the NiO-CoO nano hybrid as the anode for the LIB. Further the full cell LIB was presented for real-time applications such as powering commercial LED bulbs and a temperature sensor. The fabricated full-cell sustained illumination for over 5 hours with a green LED bulb on a single charge. The fascinating flower-like morphology of the NiO-CoO hybrid offered short diffusion path, improved electrolyte contacts and effective conversion/re-conversion reactions which in turn led to high charge storage.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the extended usage of lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) encounters nerve-wracking issues, including a lack of suitable reservoirs and high thermal runaway hazards. Although using TiO2 and Li4Ti5O12 has been confirmed to be effective in improving battery safety, their low theoretical capacities inevitably cause damage to the electrochemical performance of the battery. Achieving win-win results has become an urgent necessity. This study designed a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived in situ carbon-coated metal selenide (Ni-Se@G@C) as the anode. When the current density is 0.1-0.3 A g-1, the initial capacity of LIBs reaches 993.2 mAh g-1, which increases to 1478.9 mAh g-1 after running 800 cycles. When running at 2 A g-1, the cell also offers a relatively high capacity of 458.3 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles. After the replacement of graphite with Ni-Se@G@C, the self-heating temperature (T0) and thermal runaway triggering temperature (T1) of half and full cells are significantly increased. Meanwhile, the maximum thermal runaway temperature (T2) and maximal heating release rate (HRRmax) are significantly reduced. Of note, the usage of Ni-Se@G@C enables the battery with superior cycling and rate performance. When used in SIBs, the cell gives an initial discharge capacity of 624.9 mAh g-1, which still remains at 269.4 mAh g-1 after running 200 cycles at 1 A g-1. Notably, Ea of the Ni-Se@G@C cell is 5.6 times higher than that of the graphite cell, corroborating the promoted safety performance. This work provides a new paradigm for MOF-derived micro/nanostructures, enabling the battery with an excellent electrochemical and safety performance portfolio.",

        "abstract": "Na‐superionic‐conductor (NASICON)‐type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON‐type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe‐substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high‐voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g−1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10 000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic‐migration energy barrier and ideal Na+‐diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher‐valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high‐rate capability and long‐duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50 C), along with material‐level energy density up to 304 Wh kg−1.

Consequently, the TFPB-NiPc@CC electrode not only shows improved electrochemical behaviors of high capacity and long cycle stability but also displays superior flexibility and folding stability. The specific capacity achieved by the TFPB-NiPc@CC electrode is 1090.2 mA h/g at 200 mA/g, and after 500 cycles, the specific capacity of the TFPB-NiPc@CC electrode can also be maintained at 994.5 mA h/g with a retention ratio of 91.2%, which are all much higher than those of the TFPB-NiPc electrode.

Sodium-ion storage, especially sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), have advanced significantly and are now emerging as a feasible alternative to the lithium-ion batteries equivalent in large-scale energy storage due to their natural abundance and prospective inexpensive cost. Among various anode materials of SIBs, beneficial properties, such as outstanding stability, great abundance, and environmental friendliness, make sodium titanates (NTOs), one of the most promising anode materials for the rechargeable SIBs. Nevertheless, there are still enormous challenges in application of NTO, owing to its low intrinsic electronic conductivity and collapse of structure. The research on NTOs is still in its infancy; there are few conclusive reviews about the specific function of various modification methods. Herein, we summarize the typical strategies of optimization and analysis the fine structures and fabrication methods of NTO anodes combined with the application of in situ characterization techniques. Our work provides effective guidance for promoting the continuous development, equipping NTOs in safety-critical systems, and lays a foundation for the development of NTO-anode materials in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have shown extensive prospects as alternative rechargeable batteries in large-scale energy storage systems, because of the abundance and low cost of sodium. The development of high-performance cathode and anode materials is a big challenge for SIBs. As is well known, TiNb2O7 (TNO) exhibits a high capacity of ∼250 mAh g-1 with excellent capacity retention as a Li-insertion anode for lithium-ion batteries, but it has rarely been discussed as an anode for SIBs. Here, we demonstrate ball-milled TiNb2O7 (BM-TNO) as an SIB anode, which provides an average voltage of ∼0.6 V and a reversible capacity of ∼180 mAh g-1 at a current density of 15 mA g-1, and presents excellent cyclability with 95% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1. A possible Na storage mechanism in BM-TNO is also proposed.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 is the most promising anode material for secondary battery with its unique 2D layered structure. However, the application of MoS2 is restricted by the poor electrical conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion. Herein, hollow nanotubes constructed with highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets and polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes are fabricated and used as anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries and sodium‐ion batteries. Remarkably, these hollow nanotubes show a high lithium‐specific capacity of 755.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and excellent sodium‐specific capacity of 503.3 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the rational design of unique 1D and 2D composite structure. First, the highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 2D nanosheets and hollow 1D PPy nanotube can effectively promote the charge transfer kinetics. However, the increased interlayer spacing of 1T phase MoS2 rapidly improves the insertion/extraction process of metal ions, and the vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of the PPy nanotubes also exposes more energy storage sites. This work provides a new idea for the preparation of MoS2‐based composite materials, and also proposes a reference for its application in the secondary battery.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of electrical conductivity on the energy-storage characteristics of anode materials in sodium-ion batteries, covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) are hybridized with highly conductive graphene nanosheets (GNs) via two different optimized synthesis routes, i.e., reflux and solvothermal methods. The reflux-synthesized hybrid shows a well-overlapped 2D structure, while the solvothermally prepared hybrid forms a segregated phase in which the contact area between the CONs and GNs is reduced. These two hybrids synthesized by facile methods are fully characterized, and the results reveal that their energy-storage properties can be significantly improved by enhancing the electrical conductivity via the formation of a well-overlapped structure between CONs and GNs. The discharge capacity and rate capability of the reflux-synthesized hybrid was considerably larger than that of the bare CONs, highlighting that the improvement in the charge-carrier transport properties can improve the accessibility of Na ions to the surface of the hybrids. This synthetic methodology can be extended to the fabrication of high-performance anodes for Na-ion batteries.",

Although the same yolk-shell nanostructure (primary particle size, porosity) and three-dimensional architecture alleviated the volume change induced stress and swelling in both batteries, the SIBs show 99% capacity retention over 200 cycles, much better than the 78% capacity retention of the LIBs.

        "abstract": "Iron sulfides with high theoretical capacity confront the challenges of low rate capability and severe capacity fading for sodium storage, which are mainly caused by poor electron/ion transport kinetics and drastic volume fluctuations during cycling. Herein, to mitigate these obstacles, a multi-step synthetic tactic involving solvothermal, carbonization, and subsequent sulfurization is put forward for the construction of wire-like structure by confining Fe7S8 particles in porous N-doped carbon framework (denoted as Fe7S8/PNC) using zinc iron nitrilotriacetate as template. By partially substituting Fe3+ with Zn2+ in the metal coordination complex, the porous structure of coordination complex derived carbon framework can be regulated through pore structure engineering of Zn nanodroplets. The desired porous and robust core/shell structure can not only afford favorable electron/Na+ transport paths and additional active sites for Na+ storage, but also provide reinforced structural integrity of interior Fe7S8 particles by retarding the pulverization and buffering the mechanical stress against volume fluctuations. As anode for sodium-ion batteries, the optimal Fe7S8/PNC delivers a high reversible capacity (743 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), superior rate capability (553 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1), and long-term cycling stability (602 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 with 98.5% retention after 1000 cycles).",

However, the irreversible loss of Na+ at the alloy anode during the initial cycle results in diminished capacity and stability, impairing full‐cell performance. This study presents an easy‐to‐implement cathode presodiation strategy by employing a Na‐rich material to address these challenges. Leveraging the high theoretical capacity and suitable voltage window, Na2S is chosen as the Na donor, which is activated by creating a mixed electron‐ion conducting network, delivering a high capacity of 511.7 mAh g−1. By adding a small amount (i.e., 3 wt.%) of Na2S to the cathode composite, a NaCrO2 || Sn full cell demonstrated capacity improvement from 90.8 to 118.2 mAh g−1 (based on cathode mass). The capacity‐balanced full cell can thus cycle to more than 300 times with >90% capacity retention. This work provides a practical solution to enhance the full‐cell performance and advance the transformation from half‐cell to full‐cell applications of NaSSBs.",

Then, Co1-xS, Co1-xS/C (ultrafine Co1-xS nanoparticles embedded in the shells of the nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow nanosphere), and Co1-xS@C (Co1-xS nanoparticles entirely covered by an external amorphous carbon layer) were selectively fabricated via direct calcination or PPy coating & calcination of the obtained precursor. Co1-xS/C shows best electrochemical performance than the other two materials as anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Besides the excellent rate performance, a high reversible discharge capacity of 320 mA g-1 can be retained after 130 cycles at 1 A g-1. The impressive performance may be attributed to the unique structure, higher conductivity, and more active sites of Co1-xS/C. In addition, 559 mA h g-1 was maintained after 100 cycles at 500 mA g-1 when the Co1-xS/C composite was applied as an anode in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide materials show potential for use in alkali metal ion batteries owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance is still impaired by the tendency of aggregation, volume, and morphological change during the conversion reaction and poor intrinsic conductivity. Until now, ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a metallic-phase structure on the inner surface of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (M-MoS2@HCS) have rarely been investigated as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a novel M-MoS2@HCS anode was designed and synthesized by employing a template-assisted solvothermal reaction. Structural and chemical analyses indicate that the M-MoS2 nanosheets with a larger interlayer spacing compared to their semiconductor counterpart grow on the inner surface of HCS via covalent interactions. When used as the anode materials for Na+ storage, the M-MoS2@HCS anode presents durable and rapid sodium storage properties. The developed electrode shows a reversible capacity of 291.2 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, the reversible capacity is 401.3 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 79%. After 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, the electrode still delivers a reversible capacity of 320.1 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 75%. The excellent sodium storage capability of the MoS2@HCS electrode is explained by the special structural design, which reveals great potential to accelerate the practical applications of transition-metal dichalcogenide electrodes for sodium storage.",

Herein, we design a synergistic strategy of dual doping via the in situ doping and hydrogenation treatment to improve conductivity and cycling stability of TiO2. Experiments and theoretical calculations together revealed that N and C doping reduces the band gap of TiO2, while the presence of oxygen vacancies efficiently accelerates the diffusion of sodium ions. Thus N, C, and oxygen vacancies with high concentration co-doped TiO2, resulting in extraordinary high-rate performance, significant stable cycling, and long-term cyclability of up to 10,000 cycles.

Nevertheless, instability of the reactions that lead to poor electrochemical stability hinders the cathodes from practical applications. Here, the Al and Zn dual-site substitution strategy is proposed to enhance electrochemical performance. The designed cathode, Na0.73Zn0.03Li0.25Mn0.76Al0.01O2 (AlZn), delivers a high discharge capacity of 242 mAh g-1 with an impressive rate capability (162 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1) and excellent capacity retention (89.69% over 150 cycles). In addition, full-cell SIB based on AlZn coupled with hard carbon exhibits a high energy density of 317 Wh kg-1 (based on both cathode and anode mass) and a reasonable capacity retention of 80.8% after 250 cycles. Revealed by advanced investigations, the synergy of robust Al-O in TM layers and O-Zn-O pillars in Na layers helps alleviate severe inactive spinel/rock-salt phase transformation and intragranular cracks in the AlZn cathode. This consequently leads to greatly enhanced electrochemical performance over the pristine cathode.

        "abstract": "Metal–organic framework‐derived metal phosphides with high capacity, facile synthesis, and morphology‐controlled are considered as potential anodes for lithium/sodium‐ion batteries. However, the severe volume expansion during cycling can cause the electrode material to collapse and reduce the cycle life. Here, novel CoP‐C@MoS2/C nanocube composites are synthesized by vapor‐phase phosphating and hydrothermal process. As the anode of LIBs, CoP‐C@MoS2/C exhibits outstanding long‐cycle performance of 369 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. In SIBs, the composite also displays excellent rate capability of 234 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 and an ultra‐high the capacity retention rate of 90.16% at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. Through density functional theory, it is found that the S ions and P ions at the interface formed by CoP and MoS2 can serve as Na+/Li+ diffusion channels with an action of van der Waals force, have attractive characteristics such as high ion adsorption energy, low expansion rate and fast diffusion kinetics compared with MoS2. This study provides enlightenment for the reasonable design and development of lithium/sodium storage anode materials composited with MOF‐derived metal phosphides and metal sulfides.",

        "abstract": "Sodium dendrite growth is responsible for short circuiting and fire hazard of metal batteries, which limits the potential application of sodium metal anode. Sodium dendrite can be effectively suppressed by applying mechanically robust electrolyte in battery systems. Herein, a composite gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is designed and fabricated, mainly consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP). With the addition of an appropriate amount of GO content, the compressive Young's modulus of 2 wt% GO+PVDF-HFP (2-GPH) composite GPE is greatly enhanced by a factor of 10, reaching 2.5 GPa, which is crucial in the suppression of sodium dendrite growth. As a result, uniform sodium deposition and ultralong reversible sodium plating/stripping (over 400 h) at high current density (5 mA cm-2 ) are achieved. Furthermore, as evidenced by molecular dynamics simulation, the GO content facilitates the sodium ion transportation, giving a high ionic conductivity of 2.3 × 10-3 S cm-1 . When coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode in a full sodium metal battery, a high initial capacity of 107 mA h g-1 at 1 C (1 C = 117 mA g-1 ) is recorded, with an excellent capacity retention rate of 93.5% and high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1100 cycles.",

Here, ether electrolytes with NaBF4 as the main salt or additive were applied in NFM//HC full cells and showed enhanced performance than the electrolyte with NaPF6. Then, BF4- was found to have a stronger interaction with Na+, which could reduce the solvation of Na+ with the solvent, thus inducing the formation of the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers rich in inorganic species. Moreover, the morphology, structure, composition, and solubility of CEI and SEI were explored, concluding that NaBF4 could induce more stable CEI and SEI layers rich in B-containing species and inorganics. This work proposes using NaBF4 as the main salt or additive to improve the performance of ether electrolytes in NFM//HC full cells, which provides a strategy to improve the compatibility of ether-based electrolytes and cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Intimately coupled carbon/transition‐metal‐based hierarchical nanostructures are one of most interesting electrode materials for boosting energy conversion and storage applications owing to the strong synergistic effect between the two components and appealing structural stability. Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo‐based nanocrystals. The in situ and confined reaction of the synthetic strategy can not only allow the aggregation of the nanocrystals to be impeded, but also endows extremely intimate coupled interaction between the conductive carbon nanosheets and the nanocrystals MoM (M = P, S, C and O). As a proof of concept, the as‐prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet‐on‐sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long‐term cycles for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity can be maintained at 410 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, one of the best reported values for MoS2‐based electrode materials for SIBs. The present work highlights the importance of designing and fabricating functional strongly coupled hybrid materials for enhancing energy conversion and storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is most likely to be a commercialized anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) impedes its further large-scale industrialization. Since the ICE is greatly related to the side reactions of the electrolyte on the HC surface, herein, we focus on tailoring the surface chemistry of HC via a facile low-temperature oxygen plasma (LTOP) treatment technique. The modified HC after a suitable treatment time possesses a highly ordered and low defect surface without a negligible change in layer spacing, thus facilitating Na+ deinsertion/insertion and reducing the HC/electrolyte side reactions. Moreover, LTOP treatment also brings oxygen functional groups (CO) to the HC surface to enrich Na+ storage active sites. Consequently, the modified HC reveals a higher ICE of 80.9% compared to 60.6% in the bare HC. Also, the modified HC delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 331.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and exhibits superior rate performance with a high specific capacity of 211.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1. This work provides a feasible strategy to tailor the surface chemistry of HC for high-efficiency Na-storage and provides a novel avenue to construct high-efficiency SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The large-scale improper disposal of organic solid waste poses significant environmental challenges. Converting this waste into high-value carbon-based materials provides a sustainable solution for energy applications. In this study, we propose the development of a nitrogen/oxygen-enriched hard carbon material derived from low-cost, environmentally detrimental waste tires through a two-step pre-oxidation and nitriding process. The resulting material exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance as an anode in potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In PIBs, it achieves a high reversible capacity of 363 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining 328.9 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. In SIBs, it maintains a discharge capacity of 406.7 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1. The material's outstanding performance is attributed to its high surface area and abundant heteroatom doping, which create numerous active sites for potassium and sodium ion storage, enhancing rapid ion transport and electron flow. This work presents a simple, environmentally friendly, and sustainable approach to upcycling waste tires into high-performance hard carbon materials, offering a promising anode solution for advanced PIBs/SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium. However, anodes in Na-ion batteries face challenges such as dendrite formation and an unstable solid electrolyte interface layer. To address these challenges, NaK liquid metal alloy anodes have been proposed as an alternative because they do not form dendrites. In our study, we demonstrate that the NaK alloy anode interacts with the commonly used ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, leading to a continuously growing unstable SEI layer, evidenced by cycling failures under 100 cycles and an increasing charge transfer resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that over the course of cycling the surface of the NaK anode becomes increasingly sodium-rich. After 30 cycles, XPS analysis detects only trace amounts of potassium on the NaK anode surface. When the electrolyte is analyzed postcycling using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, there is a noticeable increase in potassium levels, suggesting that potassium metal dissolves into the electrolyte. The introduction of a 10 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate additive can mitigate this problem to some extent, enabling an enhanced cycling performance of up to 800 cycles at 1C. Nevertheless, the dissolution of K metal is still evident in the XPS results, albeit to a lesser degree. These discoveries provide valuable insights for designing a more robust SEI layer for the NaK anode.",

Combining the cation-solvent co-intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether-based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10 A g -1 (corresponding to 100C-rate) with a high capacity retention of 45%. Moreover, the desolvation-free mechanism endows the battery with 61% of its room-temperature capacity at an ultra-low temperature of -70°C.

Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of lignin-derived ordered mesoporous carbons with various pore sizes (from 5 to approximately 50 nm) as anodes in sodium-ion batteries. We have varied the pore size using self-synthesized PEOn-b-PHAm block copolymers with different PEO and PHA chain lengths, applying the “soft templating” approach to introduce isolated spherical pores of 20 to 50 nm in diameters. The pore structure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen physisorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We report the microstructure analysis of such mesoporous lignin-based carbons using Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). In comparison with nontemplated carbon and carbons templated employing commercial Pluronic F-127 and PIB50-b-PEO45, which created accessible channels and spherical pores up to approximately 10 nm in diameter, the carbon microstructure analysis revealed that templating with all applied polymers significantly impedes graphitization upon thermal treatment. Furthermore, the gained knowledge of similar carbon microstructures regardless of the type of template allowed the investigation of the influence of different pore morphologies in carbon applied as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries, supporting the previous theories in the literature that closed pores are beneficial for sodium storage while providing insights into the importance of pore size.",

Meanwhile, the NCN anode exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of nearly 80% for both LIBs and SIBs, which is ascribed to the moderate specific surface area and rational structure design.",

        "abstract": "混合钠离子电容器因其具有成本低、高安全性和快速充放电等特点而, 备受研究者关注。混合钠离子电容器一般由电容型正极和电池型负极组成，其发展最大的难点在于要克服负极侧缓慢的钠离子扩散动力学。在此，我们通过静电纺丝以及后续的碳化、原位硫化，将超细硫化钒颗粒封装在碳纤维的碳基质中，形成一种柔性自支撑电极材料V_3S_4@CNF。这种独特的碳纤维包覆作用能够很好的缓解电极循环中V3S4的体积膨胀，使得V_3S_4@CNF电极具有提升的电化学性能。在钠离子半电池的测试中，V_3S_4@CNF负极展示出高的储Na^+容量（在0.1 A·g^−1电流密度下容量476 mAh·g^−1）、高的倍率性能（在20 A·g^−1电流密度下容量为290 mAh·g^−1）和长的循环稳定性（在2 A·g^−1电流密度下稳定循环1500圈）。最后，用V_3S_4@CNF负极和活性炭正极组装的混合钠离子电容器，在200 W·kg^−1的功率密度下输出了110 Wh·kg^−1的高能量密度，即使功率增加到10000 W·kg^−1，也能提供42 Wh·kg^−1的能量密度。 Hybrid Na-ion capacitors (NICs) have received considerable interests owing to their low-cost, high-safety, and rapidly charging energy-storage characteristics. The NICs are composed of a capacitor-type cathode and a battery-type anode. The major challenge for NICs is to search for suitable electrode materials to overcome the sluggish diffusion of Na^+ in the anode. Herein, ultrafine vanadium sulfide is encapsulated in carbon fiber (V_3S_4@CNF) as a self-supported electrode by electrospinning and in situ sulfurization. The carbon cladding and one-dimensional (1D) nanofiber network-like structure could alleviate the volume expansion of V_3S_4 during Na^+ de-/intercalation process. Consequently, the V_3S_4@CNF anode exhibited a pseudocapacitive sodium storage in terms of large Na^+-storage capacity (476 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1 A·g^−1), high-rate capability (290 mAh·g^−1 at 20.0 A·g^−1) and excellent cycling stability (95% capacity retention for 1500 cycles at 2.0 A·g^−1) in Na half-cells. By employing V_3S_4@CNF as the anode and the activated carbon (AC) cathode, the as-assembled NICs could deliver a high energy density of 110 Wh·kg^−1 at a power density of 200 W·kg^−1. Even at a high power of 10,000 W·kg^−1, the specific energy is still up to 42 Wh·kg^−1. Graphical abstract ",

        "abstract": "Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi-step solvo/hydro-thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4·2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4·2H2O. The CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and has superior long-cycle stability. In addition, in-situ Raman, in-situ and ex-situ X-ray diffraction techniques have provided a unique opportunity to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO. This work also supplies a new perspective and certain research basis for the application of metal oxalate materials in high performance lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Discovering Fe3GeTe2 as an innovative ternary germanium telluride for robust and high-rate sodium/potassium-ion battery anode",
        "abstract": "The distinguishing feature of Fe3GeTe2 lies in its robust in-plane chemical bonds within layers, which are interconnected by the weak van der Waals forces between adjacent layers, offering a stable framework characterized by enhanced interlayer spacing, thereby facilitating the migration of large-sized alkali metal ions. However, to date, there have been no reported studies on the ion storage performance of Fe3GeTe2. In this study, Fe3GeTe2 is synthesized via the chemical vapor transport method to assess its sodium/potassium storage capabilities. Fe3GeTe2 is characterized by its impressive conductivity, a distinctive layered architecture, and a notably wide interlayer spacing, all of these attributes collectively contributing to its superior ion storage proficiency in both sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). Specifically, it demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, maintaining a capacity of 291.8 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 in SIBs and 125.0 mA h g−1 over 6000 cycles at 3 A g−1 in PIBs. A series of in/ex situ characterizations uncover the reaction mechanism of Fe3GeTe2 in the both systems, involving a combined process of intercalation, conversion, and alloying. Theoretical calculations provide further insights into the high ion adsorption affinity and diffusion kinetics of Fe3GeTe2 in these systems. Analytical findings reveal its superior electrochemical performance in SIBs compared to PIBs, owing to higher diffusion kinetics and reactivity. This research establishes both experimental evidence and theoretical underpinnings for the utilization of Fe3GeTe2 in SIBs and PIBs, opening up a new avenue for the utilization of germanium-based ternary materials in the field of energy storage.",

        "title": "Coupled Carbonization Strategy toward Advanced Hard Carbon for High-Energy Sodium-Ion Battery.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low utilization of active metallic sodium (Na) and uncontrollable growth of Na dendrites remain significant challenges for high-performance Na metal batteries, which are limited to inefficient Na-utilization (<1%) and shallow cycling conditions (0.25-1.0 mAh cm-2). In this work, a kind of Na metal anode with record-high utilization and long-term cycling stability is reported, using carbon substrate-supported nitrogen-anchored zinc (Zn) single atoms as current collector. Single Zn atom sites serve as a strong \"magnet\" for Na ions, which guide the metallic Na uniform nucleation and free from dendrite-induced short circuit. The nucleation overpotential of our strategy is essentially zero, where most of the reported modified substrates are greatly exceed 20 mV. Specifically, the Na anodes exhibit a high Na stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency with 99.8% over 350 cycles and a stable voltage response with small voltage hysteresis after cycling 1000 h. The full cell exhibits high Na-utilization up to 100% and superior long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention. In terms of both lifetime and Na-utilization, our strategy are significantly outperforms the reported state-of-the-art Na metal anodes. Moreover, this affords new insights into the controllable Na nucleation behavior and high Na utilization, and sheds a fresh light on atomic level design of electrode for Na metal anodes.",

The difficulty of obtaining suitable electrode materials capable of storing large amount of Na-ion arises from the large radius of Na-ion that restricts its reversible capacity. Herein, Mn_2O_3 powders are synthesised through the thermal conversion of MnCO_3 and reported for the first time as an anode for Na-ion batteries. The phase, morphology and charge/discharge characteristics of Mn_2O_3 obtained are evaluated systematically. The cubic-like Mn_2O_3 with particle sizes approximately 1.0–1.5 µm coupled with the formation of Mn_2O_3 sub-units on its surface create a positive effect on the insertion/deinsertion of Na-ion. Mn_2O_3 delivers a first discharge capacity of 544 mAh g^−1 and retains its capacity by 85% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g^−1, demonstrating the excellent cyclability of the Mn_2O_3 electrode. Therefore, this study provides a significant contribution towards exploring the potential of Mn_2O_3 as a promising anode in the development of Na-ion batteries.",

Taking advantage of the constructed pore structure, the optimized carbon anodes derived from BC/PMMA composites show an enhanced Na+ diffusion rate with a high capacity of 380.66 mA h g-1 at 0.03 A g-1. It is interesting that it possesses superior low-potential capacity, and retains 42% of the total capacity even at a high scan rate of 1 mV s-1.

In this work, a simple, economical, and scalable strategy is developed to inherently coat nanoporous MnS with a 3D N, S co-doped thin carbon layer by using commercially available MnCO3 as precursors. Specifically, the strategy involves a two-step annealing process, which converts the MnCO3 microparticles into nanoporous Mn2O3 and MnS step by step. The 3D N, S codoped carbon layer is in situ formed during the second annealing process by first coating the nanoporous Mn2O3 with a polyaniline layer. Due to the inherent 3D carbon protection and the strong electronic interaction between N, S dopants and MnS, the N, S codoped carbon protected MnS obtained at 900 °C (NS-C@MnS-900) anode displays a high specific capacity of 845 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, which is higher than all reported MnS-based SIB anodes.

The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron‐based X‐ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489 mAh g−1 is observed at 2.0 A g−1 in the potential window 3.0–0.1 V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface‐controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0–0.3 V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3‐type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long‐term stability for 3000 cycles.

Theoretical calculations of the WP polymerization process performed in this study revealed that the introduction of iodine can considerably accelerate the polymerization of WP molecules, yielding P/C composites free of WP residues. Furthermore, in the resulting iodine-doped P/C (I-P/C) composites, iodine forms I-P bonds, considerably enhancing electronic conductivity and promoting faster Na-P redox kinetics compared to those in the original P/C composites. Consequently, an I-P/C electrode exhibited a capacity of 1193 mA h g⁻1, retaining 100 % of its capacity after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g⁻1. Furthermore, an assembled I-P/C||Na3V2(PO4)2F3 full cell retained 91.9 % of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g⁻1. Additionally, the full cell exhibited a high energy density of 132.2 W h kg⁻1 at a power density of 9942.1 W kg⁻1, demonstrating potential to complete charging or discharging within ∼57 s. Finally, an I-P/C||Na3V2(PO4)2F3 pouch cell, with a capacity of 0.36 A h, demonstrated excellent cycling performance even after 150 cycles at 0.05 A g⁻1.",

Transition metal selenides have attracted considerable attention because of their high reversible capacity, superior electrical conductivity and versatile structures. In this study, two-dimensional CuSe nanosheets are synthesized via a simple hydrothermal reaction. When acting as an electrode material for sodium-ion batteries, the CuSe electrode exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of 96.7% at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and a specific capacity of 330 mA h g−1 after 100 operation cycles, as well as retains a specific capacity of 211 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 10 A g−1. Moreover, the anode delivers a specific capacity of 236 mA h g−1 after 3300 cycles at 5 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 91.2%. In sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SHICs) with the two-dimensional CuSe nanosheets and Ti3C2Tx MXene as the negative and positive materials, respectively, the nanosheets without any pre-sodiation present a lifespan of up to 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1 and a capacity retention of about 77.7%.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) hold tremendous potential in next‐generation energy storage. However, no SIB has yet achieved simultaneous support for high voltage, rapid charging, and all‐climate adaptability due to electrolyte limitations. This study successfully constructs versatile SIBs using an optimized acetonitrile (AN)‐based electrolyte, which offers excellent high‐voltage tolerance, high ionic conductivity, anion‐enriched solvation structure, and a wide liquidus temperature range. The engineered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) exhibits low resistance and exceptional stability, effectively supporting fast charging, temperature‐adaptive operation, and long‐term cycling stability. Consequently, this tailored electrolyte, combined with a robust SEI, enables hard carbon (HC) anodes to achieve a high reversible capacity of 223 mAh g−1 at a fast rate of 5 C. When paired with a high‐voltage NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode, the HC||NFM full cells operate stably at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.15 V, sustaining over 1400 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, a practical 3 Ah pouch cell demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 90.7% of its capacity after 1000 cycles, and shows all‐climate adaptability, maintaining 56.4% of its room‐temperature capacity at −60 °C and 97.3% retention after 350 cycles at 50 °C.

        "abstract": "At the research level, novel active materials for batteries are synthesised on a small scale, fabricated into electrodes and electrochemically characterised using each group’s established process due to the lack of standards. Recently, eminent researchers have criticised the implementation of e.g. low active material contents/electrode loadings, the use of research‐type battery cell constructions, or the lack of statistically relevant data, resulting in overstated data and thus giving misleading predictions of the key performance indicators of new battery technologies. Here, we report on the establishment of a reference system for the development of sodium‐ion batteries. Electrodes are fabricated under relevant conditions using 9.5 mg/cm² self‐synthesised Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode active material and 3.6 mg/cm² commercially available hard carbon anode active material. It is found that different types of battery cells are more or less suitable for half‐ and/ or full‐cell testing, resulting in ir/reproducible or underestimated active material capacities. Furthermore, the influence of electrode overhang, which is relevant for upscaling, is evaluated. The demonstrator cell (TRL 4‐5) has been further characterised providing measured data on the power/energy density and thermal behaviour during rate testing up to 15 C and projections are made for its practical limits.",

However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications.

The single‐layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium‐storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g−1 can remain at 5.0 A g−1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 during 100 cycles.

Not only accelerate the Na+ ions diffusion, but also augment the stress resistance and the electrochemical reaction reversibility for the multiphase composite. Furthermore, the porous structure finely increases the ions diffusion kinetics, preventing the aggregation of Sn, Sb, and SSO particles, which achieves high reversible capacity while eliminating structure damage. As a consequence, the fabricated SSO@Sn/Sb‐PCWs electrode exhibited exceptional cycling stability, maintaining a high reversible capacity of 448 mAh g−1 after 150 charge/discharge cycles, and good rate capability with current density up to 5.0 A g−1.

X‐ray absorption spectra at the S K‐edge and Mo L3‐edge are recorded using a synchrotron source, X‐ray emission S Kα and Mo Lα spectra are obtained on a laboratory spectrometer for initial powder and electrode material at different potentials of the cell. Analysis of the spectra shows the occupation of the initially empty orbitals of MoS2 by sodium electrons as a result of the interaction of the components of the sodium‐ion half‐cell. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of a fully discharged electrode material reveal partial transformation of hexagonal MoS2 to disordered tetragonal MoS2 coated with a surface electrolyte interphase layer. The obtained results indicate that coupling MoS2 to graphene prevents the breaking of Mo–S bonds when Na+ ions are first introduced, which may promote stable battery performance.",

The morphological evolution of different-sized single Sn nanoparticle is visualized during the charge/discharge cycles by using a homemade planar electrode. All of the Sn nanoparticles exhibit a dramatic initial volume expansion of about 420% after sodiation to Na15Sn4.

However, the absence of suitable anode materials is the main bottleneck for the commercial application of SIBs. Herein, the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of Na on graphether are predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. Our results show that Na atoms can be adsorbed on graphether forming a uniform and stable coverage on both sides. Even at low intercalated Na concentrations, the semiconducting graphether can be changed to a metallic state, ensuring good electrical conductivity. Due to the structural anisotropy of graphether, the Na+ ions show a remarkable one-dimensional diffusion with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.04 eV, suggesting ultrafast charge/discharge characteristics. The graphether monolayer has a high theoretical specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1, which is much higher than commercial graphite anode materials. Furthermore, the average voltage is 1.58 V, comparable with that of commercial TiO2 anode materials for LIBs (1.5 V). During the charge/discharge process, graphether could mostly preserve the structural integrity upon the adsorption of Na even at the maximum concentration, suggesting its good reversibility.

As a proof of concept, some of the phosphate of Na3V2(PO4)3 was replaced by silicate to fabricate Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, which exhibited a higher average discharge voltage of 3.36 V and a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g-1 than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.31 V, 109.6 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C, therefore improving the energy density. Moreover, the introduced silicate enhanced the intrinsic electroconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials, as confirmed by both theoretical simulation and electrochemical measurements. After pairing with a commercial hard carbon anode, the optimized Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 cathode enabled a stable-cycling full cell with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a remarkable average coulombic efficiency of 99.88%.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 in a graphene-like structure that possesses a large interlayer spacing is a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, its poor cycling stability and bad rate performance limit its wide application. In this work, we synthesized an N-doped rGO/MoS2 (ISE, interlayer spacing enlarged) composite based on an innovative strategy to serve as an anode material for SIBs. By inserting NH4+ into the interlayer of MoS2, the interlayer spacing of MoS2 was successfully expanded to 0.98 nm. Further use of N plasma treatment achieved the doping of N element. The results show that N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) exhibits a high specific capacity of 542 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 200 mA g-1. It is worth mentioning that the capacity retention rate reaches an ultra-large percentage of 97.13%, and the average decline percentage per cycle is close to 0.01%. Moreover, it also presents an excellent rate performance (477, 432, 377, 334 mA h g-1 at 200, 500, 1000, 2000 m A g-1 respectively). This work reveals a unique approach to fabricating promising anode materials and the electrochemical reaction mechanism for SIBs.",

        "title": "Composition and Structure of the solid electrolyte interphase on Na-Ion Anodes Revealed by Exo- and Endogenous Dynamic Nuclear Polarization—NMR Spectroscopy",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIB) are among the most promising devices for large scale energy storage. Their stable and long-term performance depends on the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanosized, heterogeneous and disordered layer, formed due to degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface. The chemical and structural properties of the SEI control the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thus, there is great interest in determining these properties for understanding, and ultimately controlling, SEI functionality. However, the study of the SEI is notoriously challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and minute quantity. In this work, we present a powerful approach for probing the SEI based on solid state NMR spectroscopy with increased sensitivity from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Utilizing exogenous (organic radicals) and endogenous (paramagnetic metal ion dopants) DNP sources, we obtain not only a detailed compositional map of the SEI but also, for the first time for the native SEI, determine the spatial distribution of its constituent phases. Using this approach, we perform a thorough investigation of the SEI formed on Li4Ti5O12 used as a SIB anode. We identify a compositional gradient, from organic phases at the electrolyte interface to inorganic phases toward the anode surface. We find that the use of fluoroethylene carbonate as an electrolyte additive leads to performance degradation which can be attributed to formation of a thicker SEI, rich in NaF and carbonates. We expect that this methodology can be extended to examine other titanate anodes and new electrolyte compositions, offering a unique tool for SEI investigations to enable the development of effective and long-lasting SIBs.",

In this respect, perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all‐organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence “hybrid”, inexpensive and non‐fluorinated Na/Mg‐salts, it displays favourable physico‐chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window >3 V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water‐in‐salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long‐term sustainability, and improved safety.",

        "title": "Unlocking Rapid and Robust Sodium Storage Performance of Zinc-Based Sulfide via Indium Incorporation.",
        "abstract": "Zinc sulfide (ZnS) exhibits promise in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its low operation voltage and high theoretical specific capacity. However, pristine ZnS is not adequate in realizing rapid and robust sodium storage owing to its low reversibility, poor structure stability, and sluggish kinetics. To date, most efforts focus on utilizing carbonaceous incorporation to improve its electrochemical performances. Nevertheless, it remains an arduous challenge for realizing superior rate capability while obtaining stable cycling. Herein, inspired by the crystal structure of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, which possesses an intrinsic layered feature with larger unit-cell volume versus that of ZnS, indium incorporation is thus deployed as an immediate remedy. In/ex situ investigations combined with density functional theory calculations are conducted to reveal the superior kinetics, high reversibility, and good structure stability of ZnIn2S4. Notably, the formed indium-based derivatives during cycling manifest a Na+ (de)intercalation process, thereby exciting a synergetic mechanism to stabilize electrochemical cycling. As a result, the electrochemical performances of Zn-based sulfide are significantly improved via the indium incorporation. Furthermore, a full cell based on the ZnIn2S4 anode with the superior electrochemical performance is developed. This work provides an effective tactic of heteroatom incorporation for optimizing structure as well as exciting a complementary reaction process toward developing superior anodes for high-performance alkali-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfide (FeS) has been extensively studied as sodium‐ion battery anodes due to its high theoretical capacity (609 mAh g−1), but its large volume expansion and low electrical conductivity result in unsatisfactory cycling life and poor rate performance. Moreover, the sodium ion storage mechanism of FeS at a voltage range of 0.01–1 V involving conversion reactions and subsequent ion storage process is unclear yet. Here, the study proposes a vapor‐pressure induced synthesis route to fabricate FeS/C yolk‐shell structure that ultrathin carbon layers coat on the surface of FeS nanosheets, which can accommodate volume expansion of FeS during sodiation observed via in situ transmission electron microscope and improve its electrical conductivity. Remarkably, an in situ magnetometry reveals that vast spin‐polarized electrons can be injected into superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈3 nm) formed during conversion reaction to induce evolution of electrode magnetization between 0.01 and 1 V, during which spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect occurs at Fe/Na2S interfaces to increase extra ion storage and boost ion transport stably. Consequently, the FeS/C yolk‐shell nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 664.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 300.4 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 81.1%.",

Of the three structures analyzed in this study, the yolk structure proved to be the most effective. This structure provides sufficient space for electrode particle expansion, thereby effectively reducing diffusion stress. Additionally, analysis of von Mises stress distribution in the yolk–shell structure across various low temperatures, revealed that the properties of the yolk structure remained largely stable at low temperatures.

In situ transmission electron microscopy images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g-1 is 214 mA h g-1 in half cells or 134 mA h g-1 in full cells.

        "abstract": "In response to the increasing concern for energy management, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively researched as an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The proficient cycling durability and good rate performance of SIBs are the two key parameters that determine their potential for practical use. In this study, nature-inspired three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 ultrathin marigold flower-like microstructures were prepared by a controlled hydrothermal method. These microscale flowers are constructed by arbitrarily arranged but closely interconnected two-dimensional ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. The as-prepared MoS2 microflowers (MFs) have then been chemically wrapped by layered graphene sheets to form the bonded 3D hybrid MoS2-G networks. TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations were used to study the morphology, crystallization, chemical compositions, and wrapping contact between MoS2 and graphene. The ultrathin nature of MoS2 in 3D MFs and graphene wrapping provide strong electrical conductive channels and conductive networks in an electrode. Benefitting from the 2 nm ultrathin crystalline MoS2 sheets, chemically bonded graphene, defect-induced sodium storage active sites, and 3D interstitial spaces, the prepared electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacity (606 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1), remarkable rate performance (345 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and long cycle life (over 100 cycles with tremendous Coulombic efficiencies beyond 100%).

        "abstract": "Porous carbon has been widely focused to solve the problems of low coulombic efficiency (ICE) and low multiplication capacity of Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anodes. The superior energy storage properties of two-dimensional(2D) carbon nanosheets can be realized by modulating the structure, but be limited by the carbon sources, making it challenging to obtain 2D structures with large surface area. In this work, a new method for forming carbon materials with high N/S doping content based on combustion activation using the dual activation effect of K2 SO4 /KNO3 is proposed. The synthesized carbon material as an anode for SIBs has a high reversible capacity of 344.44 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 . Even at the current density of 5 Ag-1 , the capacity remained at 143.08 mAh g-1 . And the ICE of sodium-ion in ether electrolytes is ≈2.5 times higher than that in ester electrolytes. The sodium storage mechanism of ether/ester-based electrolytes is further explored through ex-situ characterizations. The disparity in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the discrepancy in kinetics, wherein ether-based electrolytes exhibit a higher rate of Na+ storage and shedding compared to ester-based electrolytes. This work suggests an effective way to develop doubly doped carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Considering the finite resources of nonrenewable fossil fuels and urgent demands of modern society, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) featuring low cost, considerable natural supply and environmental friendless, show huge prospects in energy storage field, especially in constructing massive energy storage networks. Here, we propose a facile polyacrylonitrile@metal organic frameworks composite-derived sulfuration method, for acquiring heteroatoms doped carbon@encapsulated CoS2 nanoparticles (NSPCFS@CoS2) as SIBs anode. This electrode shows long and steady cycling process at 1 A g−1. After running 2095 cycles, it maintains a capacity of 546.3 mA h g−1. An exceedingly low capacity fading ratio of 0.013% per cycle can be acquired. Also, it gives high discharge capacities of 540.7 and 493.6 mA h g−1, even at 4 and 8 A g−1, separately. In addition, NSPCFS@CoS2 possesses a comparative or even better rate capability than other CoS2 based materials and other types of metal sulfides. Overall, this electrode exhibits superior cycling and rate performances. Additionally, its Na+ reaction kinetics and storage mechanism are deeply investigated.",

MWCNTs can accommodate volume expansion and provide high conductivity. The fabricated Sb2Se3 NRs@MWCNT electrode exhibits improved cycle performance and cyclic stability without additional conductive carbons. The Sb2Se3 NRs@MWCNT electrode showed an enhanced specific capacity of 440 mAhg‐1 at a current density of 0.1 Ag‐1, compared to 220 mAhg‐1 for Sb2Se3 NRs electrode. Additionally, it exhibited good stability at high current density.

However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K‐storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D‐layer‐structured Bi into a quasi‐1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high‐rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K‐ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi‐1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K‐ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g−1) after 15 000 cycles for Na‐ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K‐ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K‐storage reaction mechanisms and cycling‐driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high‐performance anode design by structural dimensionality manipulation and cycling‐driven morphology reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium ion capacitors (SICs) are considered as one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage devices (organic electrolyte batteries, aqueous batteries and supercapacitor, etc.) due to the combined merits of battery and capacitor, the slow reaction kinetics and low specific capacity of anode materials are the main challenges. Point defects including vacancies and heteroatoms doping have been widely used to improve the kinetics behavior and capacity of anode materials. However, the interaction between vacancies and heteroatoms doping have been seldomly investigated. In this study, a hybrid point defects (HPD) engineering has been proposed to synthesize TiO_2 with both oxygen vacancies (OVs) and P-dopants (TiO_2/C-HPD). In comparison with sole OVs or P-doping treatments, the synergistic effects of HPD on its electrical conductivity and sodium storage performance have been clarified through the density functional theory calculation and sodium storage characterization. As expected, the kinetics and electronic conductivity of TiO_2/C-HPD3 are significantly improved, resulting in excellent rate performance and outstanding cycle stability. Moreover, the SICs assembled from TiO_2/C-HPD3 anode and nitrogen-doped porous carbon cathode show outstanding power/energy density, ultra-long life with good capacity retention. This work provides a novel point defect engineering perspective for the development of high-performance SICs electrode materials. A novel hybrid point defect design (HPD) with oxygen vacancies and P-dopant is proposed to solve the insufficient kinetic and low specific capacity problems of TiO_2. Through density functional theory calculation and sodium storage characterization, the synergistic effect of HPD is beneficial to improve the conductivity and sodium storage performance of TiO_2. The prepared sodium ion capacitors show outstanding power/energy density, ultra-long life and good capacity retention.",

However, the sluggish kinetics and significant volume expansion during cycling bring about the poor electrochemical behavior of SIBs. In this work, a dual carbon including internal hard carbon core and external N-doped carbon shell confined MoS2 hierarchical microspheres (HC@MoS2@NC) nanocomposites are prepared as anode for SIBs with superior cycling stability and good rate capability. The dual carbon confinement can improve the structural stability of MoS2. The dual carbon with good electronic conductivity ensures well battery rate capability of MoS2 anode. Meanwhile, the larger interlayer spacing of 10.09 Å caused by NC insertion make MoS2 store more Na+. As a consequence, the HC@MoS2@NC nanocomposite delivers a high capacity of 321 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. At large current density of 2 A g−1, a high capacity of 180 mAh g−1 can still be achieved after 1000 cycles. Even at larger current density of 5 A g−1, the capacity can still be kept at 162 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles.",

In this way, we significantly enhanced the electrochemical performances of the electrode, such as the first cycle efficiency, rate-capability, and specific capacity. In particular, with a 10 nm homogeneous carbon nitride coating, the specific capacity is extended by more than 30% with respect to the bare carbon material with an extended plateau capacity, which we attribute to a heterojunction effect at the materials' interface.

Here, the practicability of solid‐state electrochemical (SSE) pre‐sodiation technique for hard carbon anode is assessed to conquer such challenges. The uniformly pre‐sodiated HC (Pre‐HC) can be fabricated through the SSE reaction between the HC and preloaded sodium metal film without introducing a liquid electrolyte. After being immerged in the electrolyte, a thin artificial SEI with abundant inorganic species is formed on the surface of Pre‐HC due to the spontaneous chemical reaction, and the ICE of HC is improved from 76.0% to 107.9%. Full cell paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits a high ICE of 94.0% with 70% of energy density augment (from 126.5 to 214.4 Wh kg−1) after anode pre‐sodiation. Pre‐HC anode still retains the pre‐sodiation capacity of 671.1 mAh gNa−1 after being stored in the dry air for 2 h.

However, the practical application of these materials is usually limited by their low electronic conductivity and serious volume change during the charging-discharging process.

Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm are anchored on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously. Such unique hierarchical structure are advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting particle aggregation of Fe3O4 and accommodating their volume change during the charging-discharging process as well as enabling fast diffusion of electrons and rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids exhibit ultrahigh sodium storage capacity (525 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1), outstanding cycling stability (312 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (56 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1).",

However, the shortage of electrode materials with outstanding comprehensive properties has limited the practical implementations of NIBs. Among all the discovered anode materials, transition-metal sulfide has been proven as one of the most competitive and promising ones due to its excellent redox reversibility and relatively high theoretical capacity. In this study, double-morphology N-doped CoS2/multichannel carbon nanofibers composites (CoS2/MCNFs) are precisely designed, which overcome common issues such as the poor cycling life and inferior rate performance of CoS2 electrodes. The conductive 3D interconnected multichannel nanostructure of CoS2/MCNFs provides efficient buffer zones for the release of mechanical stresses from Na+ ions intercalation/deintercalation. The synergy of the diverse structural features enables a robust frame and a rapid electrochemical reaction in CoS2/MCNFs anode, resulting in an impressive long-term cycling life of 900 cycles with a capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 (86.4% theoretical capacity) and a surprisingly high-power output.

Orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T‐Nb2O5) has recently been recognized as a promising anode material for Na‐HSCs due to its typical pseudocapacitive feature, but it suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity. Reasonably high electrochemical performance of T‐Nb2O5‐based electrodes could merely be gained to date when sufficient carbon content was introduced. In addition, flexible Na‐HSC devices have scarcely been demonstrated by far. Herein, an in situ encapsulation strategy is devised to directly grow ultrathin graphene shells over T‐Nb2O5 nanowires (denoted as Gr‐Nb2O5 composites) by plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition, targeting a highly conductive anode material for Na‐HSCs. The few‐layered graphene capsules with ample topological defects would enable facile electron and Na+ ion transport, guaranteeing rapid pseudocapacitive processes at the Nb2O5/electrolyte interface. The Na‐HSC full‐cell comprising a Gr‐Nb2O5 anode and an activated carbon cathode delivers high energy/power densities (112.9 Wh kg−1/80.1 W kg−1 and 62.2 Wh kg−1/5330 W kg−1), outperforming those of recently reported Na‐HSC counterparts.

However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries).",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical performance of ionic liquid electrolytes containing different sodium salts dissolved in 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMPTFSI) evaluated in a half-cell configuration using spherical P2-Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2+ z (NCO) cathodes are reported. Among the various electrolytes investigated, sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) (0.5 M) in BMPTFSI shows the best electrochemical performance with a significant improvement in cycling stability (90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 50 mA g-1 in a half cell versus Na metal anode) compared with conventional NaClO4 (1 M) in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolytes (39% retention after 500 cycles). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies reveal that ionic liquid electrolytes are stable up to 4.8 V versus Na/Na+. When NaFSI and NaTFSI are used as conducting salts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results prove that the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is composed of components resulting from the decomposition of the TFSI anion and the deposition of the BMP cation. On the other hand, the CEI layer of the electrode cycled in an electrolyte containing NaClO4 in BMPTFSI follows a different pathway of TFSI decomposition and consists mainly of sodium fluoride. Similarly, plating studies were used to understand the stability of different ionic liquids in contact with metallic sodium. It was found that the excellent capacity retention for the electrolyte consisting of NaFSI salt is related to the formation of a stable CEI and solid electrolyte interphase layers.",

        "abstract": "Anode materials with high capacity and suitable redox potential are crucial for improving the energy density of aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs). And organic anode materials play a promising role due to their tunable electrochemical performance. However, the insufficient electroactive sites lead to a low capacity, hindering the elevation of energy density. Thus, it is essential to design organic molecules with multiple redox-active sites. Herein, we propose a strategy to activate redox sites by regulating the spatial distribution of delocalized electrons within the conjugation system, and the quinone rings are successfully activated as new reversible Na-ion storage sites via enhancing the electron density. The obtained 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinonatocobalt (Co-DHBQ) with electroactive quinone rings exhibits a superior capacity of 183 mA h g-1 accompanied by a multiple-electron transfer. Benefiting from the high capacity, the Co-DHBQ||Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6]·2H2O (MnHCF) full cell outputs a ultrahigh energy density of 110 W h kg-1 (based on the total active material mass of the anode and cathode) with a lifespan of 3000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as cost-effective alternatives or competitors to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale electric energy storage applications. However, their development has been hindered by the high cost of hard carbon (HC) anodes and poor electrochemical performance. To enhance the sodium storage capacity and rate performance of HC, this study accelerated the electrochemical performance of coconut-shell-derived HC anodes for SIBs through N/O codoping using ball milling and pyrolysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the simultaneous introduction of N and O generates a synergistic effect, increasing the surface oxygen-containing functional groups, defects, and interlayer spacing of coconut-shell-derived HC through the codoping of light elements. The excellent strategy has increased the slope capacity and platform capacity of HC, and the synergistic modification of N/O has increased its reversible specific capacity from 272 to 343 mA h g-1 (30 mA g-1), with a retention rate of approximately 92.1% after 100 cycles. In addition, it also exhibits an excellent rate performance, reaching 178 mA h g-1 at 1500 mA g-1. In summary, this study presents an effective strategy for modifying biomass-derived HC.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has demonstrated a significant potential in anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its superior electrochemical properties. Coal is considered a promising hard carbon precursor due to its high carbon yield. However, the widespread adoption of coal-derived HC faces challenges such as limited storage capacity and decreased rate performance, primarily attributed to the dense structure of coal. In this study, a molten salt-assisted approach was developed to adjust the microstructure of coal-derived HC. The dense coal is etched into a flaky structure by molten salt, which is conducive to the diffusion and transport of sodium ions. The optimized HC materials possess large interlayer spacing and abundant pseudo-graphitic domains, exhibiting a remarkable reversible capacity of 303.6 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 and 82.1 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared coal derived HC versus Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) is presented with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 76.15 % and capacity of 100.7 mA h g−1.

However, designing ideal functional superstructures with excellent electrochemical properties is still a major challenge, and an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship of electrodes remains to be achieved. To elucidate this critical issue, herein, we rationally designed and synthesized for the first time superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon anodes using confined space and surface coassembly strategies. Our method primarily relied on the larger interlayer space few-layered MXene and its negatively charged surface, allowing hexamethylenetetramine intercalation and surface electrostatic adsorption. The superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon was successfully assembled by the thermal decomposition of a confined carbon precursor. Subsequently, the comparison of Na+-storage properties of various anodes was carried out based on the results of structural characterization techniques and electrochemical analysis methods. The results showed that the optimized anode (N/O-C@TiO2-20) can deliver a reversible capacity of 165 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, indicating excellent electrochemical properties. The enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of carbon domains, defective nanocrystals, and a covalently coupled interface between TiO2 and mesoporous carbon. Our work not only offered a new strategy for the assembly and regulation of superstructures to promote the electrochemical performance but also enlightened the rational design of advanced anodes for sodium-ion battery application.",

Herein, density functional theory simulations for the first time optimize MoS2 interlayer distance between 0.80 and 1.01 nm for sodium storage. 1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ([BMIm]Ac) induces cellulose oligomers to intercalate MoS2 interlayers for achieving controllable distance by changing the mass ratio of cellulose to [BMIm]Ac. Based on these findings, porous carbon loading the interlayer-expanded MoS2 allowing Na+ to insert with fast kinetics is synthesized. A carbon layer derived from [BMIm]Ac and cellulose coating the composite prevents the MoS2 from contacting electrolytes, leading to less sulfur loss for a more reversible specific capacity. Meanwhile, MoS2 and carbon have a strong interfacial connection through MoN binding, contributing to enhanced structural stability. As expected, while cycling 250 times at 0.1 A g-1 , the MoS2 -porous carbon composite displays an optimal reversible capacity at 517.79 mAh g-1 as a sodium-ion batteries anode. The cyclic test of 1.0 A g-1 also shows considerable stability (310.74 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with 86.26% retentive capacity).

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material in alkali metal ion batteries owing to its cost-effectiveness, abundant sources, and low working voltage. However, challenges persist in achiving prolonged cycling stability and consistent capacity, and the sodium storage mechanism in HC is still debated. Herein, an unreported biomass precursor, \"sisal,\" for deriving hard carbon is developed. A series of sisal hemp-derived hard carbon with natural 3D porous channels are prepared. Through phase characterization and electrochemical testing, the relationship between microstructure and sodium storage capacity is elucidated, further confirming the suitability of the \"adsorption-insertion-filling\" mechanism for sodium storage properties in hard carbon materials. Without the need for any additional modification strategies, this biomass-derived hard carbon demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in both sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries (SIBs and PIBs). The as-prepared HC-1300 demonstrates excellent ion storage capability, delivering a high reversible capacity of 345.2 mAh g-1 in SIBs and 310 mAh g-1 in PIBs at 0.1 C. Moreover, it maintains a specific capacity of 237.3 mAh g-1 over 1200 cycles at 1 C when used in SIBs. The excellent cycling stability and superior rate performance are also presented in full cells, highlighting its potential for practical applications.",

To realize resource recycling, we used a simple treatment method to prepare waste bamboo as a negative electrode material exhibiting considerable electrochemical properties for sodium-ion batteries. The electrochemical properties of high-temperature calcination materials considerably improved after impurity removal treatment using an acid solution, which was performed to eliminate the influence of impurities on electrochemical properties. However, the materials still could not meet commercial requirements. A simple pre-oxidation modification treatment enabled the introduction of O atoms into the carbon skeleton to expand the layer spacing, improved the transport kinetics of Na+ in the carbon skeleton, and further increased the platform capacity of the pre-oxidation material. The preoxidative high-temperature co-treated materials exhibited a specific charge capacity close to 280 mAh g−1 at a 0.1 C rate and a capacity attenuation of almost zero after 100 cycles, and showing a specific charge capacity of more than 150 mAh g−1 at a 2 C rate test.

The incorporation of OVs into TiO2 is demonstrated to render considerably enhanced-rate performances, higher initial capacities, and an accelerated electrochemical activation process during cycling, derived from the boosted intrinsic electric conductivity and improved kinetics of Na uptake. Bestowed with the integrated merits of OVs and shortened Na ion diffusion length in the nanostructure, black titania delivers a reversible specific capacity of 207.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retains 99.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C stably, and still maintains 91.2 mAh g(-1) even at the high rate of 20 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the lower sodiation energy barrier of anatase with OVs enables a more favorable Na intercalation into black anatase. Thus, it is of great significance to introduce OVs into TiO2 to stimulate ultrafast and durable sodium-storage properties, which also offers a potential strategy to project more superior electrodes, utilizing internal defects.",

Sb stands out from the potential candidates, due to high capacity, good electronic conductivity, and moderate sodiation voltage. Here, one-dimensional yolk-shell Sb@Ti-O-P nanostructures are synthesized by reducing core-shell Sb2O3@TiO2 nanorods with NaH2PO2. This structure has Sb nanorod as the core to increase the capacity and Ti-O-P as the shell to stabilize the interface between electrolyte and electrode material. The gap between the core and the shell accommodates the volume change during sodiation/desodiation. These features endow the structure outstanding performances. It could deliver a capacity of about 760 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g-1, with a capacity retention of about 94%. Even at 10 A g-1, the reversible capacity is still at 360 mA h g-1.

Herein, a spindle-chain-structured Fe-based metal organic frameworks (MIL-88A) self-sacrificial template was constructed via the seed-mediated growth of Fe^3+ and fumaric acid in an aqueous solution, which is an environmentally friendly synthesis route. The seed-mediated growth method effectively segregates the nucleation stage from the subsequent growth phase, offering precise control over the growth patterns of MIL-88A through manipulation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. The structural diversity, fast ion/electron diffusion, and unique interfaces of whole anodes are simultaneously enhanced through optimization of the spindle-chain structure of Fe_2O_3@N-doped carbon nanofibers (FO@NCNFs) at the atomic, nano, and macroscopic levels. Benefiting from their heteroatom-doping conductive networks, porous structure, and synergistic effects, FO@NCNFs exhibit a remarkable rate performance of 167 mAh g^−1 at 10 A g^−1 after 2000 cycles for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and long-term cycling stability with a sustained capacity of 260 mAh g^−1 at 2 A g^−1 after 2000 cycles for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

Through tuning graphene layer covered on the top surface of interdigital microelectrodes, the NIMCs unveil remarkably enhanced power density, owing to the establishment of favorable multidirectional fast ion diffusion pathways that significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance. Meanwhile, the as‐fabricated NIMCs present excellent mechanical flexibility without capacitance fade under repeated deformation, and electrochemical stability at a high temperature of 80 °C because of using nonflammable ionogel electrolyte and in‐plane geometry.

All composites show enhancement in the overall capacity and cycling stability compared to the pristine CuP2 due to the well‐connected CNTs on and between the CuP2 particles. At a high currency density of 1 A g−1, CuP2@SWCNTs composite with 13 wt.% SWCNTs can deliver a specific capacity over 400 mAh g−1 for more than 60 cycles, much better than conventional hard carbon materials. The CNTs enhance the conductivity and reduce capacity loss caused by the volume variation of CuP2 based electrode materials. Post‐mortem analysis by scanning electron microscopy depicts a possible battery failure mechanism, whereby the solid electrolyte interface exists in the form of nanospheres distributing at the surface of the electrode. During the repeated cycling (volume change), more fractures and cracks occur resulting in continuous interfacial reactions and consumption of sodium and electrolyte.",

This study comprehensively evaluates the biphenylene network (BP) as a promising anode material using first-principles calculations. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that sodium (Na) ions stably adsorb on BP surfaces, with adsorption energies ranging from −1.29 eV to −2.92 eV, due to effective charge transfer and hybridization between Na (s) and carbon (p) orbitals. The diffusion barriers for Na ion migration are 0.31 eV for the monolayer and 0.76 eV for the bilayer, with optimal paths involving the C8-ring and passing through C6- or C4-rings. Notably, edge sites were found to provide strong Na adsorption on monolayer BP nanoribbon, with low diffusion barriers (0.36 eV), revealing the critical role of edge configurations in enhancing the BP performance as an anode material. The theoretical capacity of Na on the BP monolayer is 908.52 mAh·g⁻¹, surpassing many other two-dimensional materials, and the average open circuit voltage (OCV) is 0.64 V. Overall, BP offers high Na storage capacity, low diffusion barriers, and suitable OCV, positioning it as a strong candidate for high-performance NIB anodes.",

In this work, a N,S co-doped biomass hard carbon/ZnS (N,S-HC@ZnS) composite was synthesized by using molten-salt as template and a facile one-step carbonization strategy. The N,S co-doped carbon host enhances the electrical conductivity of the electrode and mitigates the large volume expansion of ZnS nanoparticles during sodiation/de-sodiation processes. The synergistic effect between hard carbon and ZnS, N,S-HC@ZnS enables a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. Even at a high current density of 2 A g−1, the composite still delivers a commendable capacity of 308.33 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles. Our findings offer a promising direction for the synthesis of high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",

        "title": "Unlocking the Potential of Iron Sulfides for Sodium-Ion Batteries by Ultrafine Pulverization.",
        "abstract": "Iron sulfides have attracted tremendous research interest for the anode of sodium-ion batteries due to their high capacity and abundant resource. However, the intrinsic pulverization and aggregation of iron sulfide electrodes induced by the conversion reaction during cycling are considered destructive and undesirable, which often impedes their capacity, rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Herein, an interesting pulverization phenomenon of ultrathin carbon-coated Fe1- xS nanoplates (Fe1- xS@C) is observed during the first discharge process of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to the formation of Fe1- xS nanoparticles with quantum size (≈5 nm) tightly embedded in the carbon matrix. Surprisingly, no discernible aggregation phenomenon can be detected in subsequent cycles. In/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ultrafine pulverization can confer several advantages, including sustaining reversible conversion reactions, reducing the adsorption energies, and diffusion energy barriers of sodium atoms, and preventing the aggregation of Fe1- xS particles by strengthening the adsorption between pulverized Fe1- xS nanoparticles and carbon. As a result, benefiting from the unique ultrafine pulverization, the Fe1- xS@C anode simultaneously exhibits high reversible capacity (610 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (427.9 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), and ultralong cycling stability (377.9 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 20 A g-1).",

However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction at the high-voltage region in sodium layered cathode materials generates structural instability and poor capacity retention upon cycling. Here, we report a doping strategy by incorporating light-weight boron into the cathode active material lattice to decrease the irreversible oxygen oxidation at high voltages (i.e., >4.0 V vs. Na^+/Na). The presence of covalent B–O bonds and the negative charges of the oxygen atoms ensures a robust ligand framework for the NaLi_1/9Ni_2/9Fe_2/9Mn_4/9O_2 cathode material while mitigating the excessive oxidation of oxygen for charge compensation and avoiding irreversible structural changes during cell operation. The B-doped cathode material promotes reversible transition metal redox reaction enabling a room-temperature capacity of 160.5 mAh g^−1 at 25 mA g^−1 and capacity retention of 82.8% after 200 cycles at 250 mA g^−1. A 71.28 mAh single-coated lab-scale Na-ion pouch cell comprising a pre-sodiated hard carbon-based anode and B-doped cathode material is also reported as proof of concept. The irreversible oxygen redox reaction during charging to the high-voltage region causes cathode structural degradation and Na-ion cell capacity fading.

Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05□0.06)2O (Ni-Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni-O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8 V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g≈Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate >80%). Incorporating currently-modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na-ion full-cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Antimony is an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity and appropriate sodiation potential. However, its practical application is severely impeded by its poor cycling stability caused by dramatic volumetric variations during sodium uptake and release processes. Here, to circumvent this obstacle, Sb@C@TiO2 triple-shell nanoboxes (TSNBs) are synthesized through a template-engaged galvanic replacement approach. The TSNB structure consists of an inner Sb hollow nanobox protected by a conductive carbon middle shell and a TiO2 -nanosheet-constructed outer shell. This structure offers dual protection to the inner Sb and enough room to accommodate volume expansion, thus promoting the structural integrity of the electrode and the formation of a stable solid-electrolyte interface film. Benefiting from the rational structural design and synergistic effects of Sb, carbon, and TiO2 , the Sb@C@TiO2 electrode exhibits superior rate performance (212 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and outstanding long-term cycling stability (193 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 4000 cycles). Moreover, a full cell assembled with a configuration of Sb@C@TiO2 //Na3 (VOPO4 )2 F displays a high output voltage of 2.8 V and a high energy density of 179 Wh kg-1 , revealing the great promise of Sb@C@TiO2 TSNBs as the electrode in SIBs.",

The unique pie-like structure can effectively speed up the kinetics of electrode reactions, while the carbon shell stabilizes the FeS NCs inside. Studies show that the electrochemical reaction processes of P-FeS@C electrodes are dominated by the pseudocapacitive behavior, leading to an ultrafast Na+-insertion/extraction reaction. Hence, the prepared P-FeS@C nanohybrid exhibits superior Na-storage properties especially high rate capability in half cells. For example, it can deliver reversible capacities of 555.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 over 150 cycles and about 60.4 mA h g-1 at 80 A g-1 (an ultrahigh current density even higher than that of the capacitor test).

Herein, a highly cross‐linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two‐step rapid thermal‐annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long‐range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements.

        "abstract": "Sodium metal is regarded as an optimal anode material for high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, during the processes of sodium deposition and stripping, the failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to the continuous accumulation of inactive sodium, thereby compromising the cycling reversibility of the battery. Here, a novel metal fluoride heterointerface layer is generated and constructed through in situ manipulation of the continuous reaction between TiF4 and metal Na. The reconstructed NaF/TiF3 interface layer, which tightly anchors the sodium metal, effectively suppresses the formation of sodium dendrites during the charge‐discharge process. The highly sodium‐philic TiF3 component exhibits strong binding with Na ions, while NaF reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics. Due to the successful artificial construction of this interface layer, the Na/TiF4 composite electrode demonstrates an exceptional ultra‐long cycling stability of 2370 h in symmetric cells (0.5 mAh cm−2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validate the functionality of each component in the Na/TiF4 protective layer. When paired with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a pouch cell, it exhibits stability up to 2000 cycles at current densities of 2 C and 4 C, with a maximum energy density output of 483.1 Wh kg−1 (power density: 320.8 W kg−1).",

Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs.

        "abstract": "To realize the goal of large scale eco-friendly solid-state Na-ion energy storage systems, a combination of cost effective and resource abundant anode material, and a bio-degradable polymer-based electrolyte is essentially required. Herein, a highly abundant waste-biomass sugarcane bagasse, pre-treated with ethanol soaking has been used as precursor to drive hard carbon (EHC) to use as anode in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) with a sodium ion conducting porous polymer electrolyte (PPE) based on a bio-degradable polymer poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL). The pre-treatment with ethanol soaking for a long duration improves the porosity and electrochemical properties of the hard carbons significantly. The EHC powder shows lesser surface area (∼19 m2g−1) with larger average pore size as compared to hard carbon (HC) derived from untreated waste-biomass powder (∼407 m2g−1). The EHC powder also shows larger number of defects and oxygen content, as evident from XRD, Raman and XPS analyses. The porous PCL film has been prepared by one-step immersion-precipitation method with water as non-solvent and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent to obtain thick, free-standing PPE films, soaked with a liquid electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in EC:PC, 1:1 v/v). The comparative electrochemical performance of the hard carbons (EHC and HC) as anodes has been tested by preparing half cells with PPE-films and liquid electrolyte soaked in commercial separator. The PPE is found to be suitable for application in NIBs due to its high ionic conductivity (∼1.7 mS cm−1) and wide electrochemical potential window (∼5.2 V vs Ag/Ag+). The electrochemical cell based on EHC-anode demonstrates excellent performance characteristics showing high reversible discharge capacity of 212 mAhg−1 with biodegradable PPE-film at current rate of 0.5 Ag−1 and shows stable performance up to high current rate of 1 Ag−1.

        "abstract": "Phosphorus represents a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries owing to its extremely high theoretical capacity. Recent in situ transmission electron microscopy studies evidenced anisotropic swelling in sodiated black phosphorus, which may find an origin from the two intrinsic anisotropic properties inherent to the layered structure of black phosphorus: sodium diffusional directionality and insertion strain anisotropy. To understand the morphological evolution and stress generation in sodiated black phosphorus, we develop a chemo-mechanical model by incorporating the intrinsic anisotropic properties into the large elasto-plastic deformation. Our modeling results reveal that the apparent morphological evolution in sodiated black phosphorus is critically controlled by the coupled effect of the two intrinsic anisotropic properties. In particular, sodium diffusional directionality generates sharp interphases along the [010] and [001] directions, which constrain anisotropic development of the insertion strain. The coupled effect renders distinctive stress-generation and fracture mechanisms when sodiation starts from different crystal facets. In addition to providing a powerful modeling framework for sodiation and lithiation of layered structures, our findings shed significant light on the sodiation-induced chemo-mechanical degradation of black phosphorus as a promising anode for the next-generation sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics incompatibility between battery-type anode and capacitive-type cathode for sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) seriously hinders their overall performance output. Herein, we construct a SIHCs device by coupling with quantum grade vanadium nitride (VN) nanodots anchored in one-dimensional N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages hybrids (VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F) as the freestanding anode and the corresponding activated N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages (APCNFs-N/F) as cathode. The strong coupling of VN quantum dots with N/F co-doped 1D conductive carbon cages effectively facilitates the ion/electron transport and intercalation-conversion-deintercalation reactions, ensuring fast sodium storage to surmount aforesaid kinetics incompatibility. Additionally, density functional theory calculations cogently manifest that the abundant active sites in the VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F configuration boost the Na+ adsorption/reaction activity well which will promote both \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" pseudocapacitance and further improve anode kinetics. Consequently, the assembled SIHCs device can achieve high energy densities of 157.1 and 95.0 Wh kg-1 at power densities of 198.8 and 9100.5 W kg-1, respectively, with an ultralong cycling life over 8000 cycles.

        "abstract": "The rise of Na‐storage devices has put forward higher requirements for Na‐storage anode materials with large capacity, long service life, and fast rate capability. Mesoporous carbons, either as active materials or as hosts for guest active nanoparticles, are considered as promising electrode materials. However, addressing the issues of their short lifespan resulting from volume variation and the low coulombic efficiency caused by large surface area via a facile porous structure design still remains a challenge. Herein, a versatile phosphorus‐doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) armed is developed by graphene aerogel (GA) (GA@PMC) for hosting Na‐storage active nanoparticles. As a case study, FeSe2 nanoparticles are selectively supported onto this GA@PMC matrix, creating the FeSe2/GA@PMC composite. When employed in typical Na‐storage devices, such as Na‐ion batteries, Na‐ion hybrid capacitors, and Na‐ion based dual‐ion batteries, the FeSe2/GA@PMC electrode consistently demonstrates superior electrochemical performance. In such GA@PMC, the conformal GA can improve the entire conductivity while decreasing the specific surface area that is directly contacting with electrolyte. The interconnected macroporous structure can not only promote the diffusion of Na+ but also buffers the volume change of the guest active nanoparticles. This bespoke carbon platform synergistically endows the electrode material with enhanced rate capability, cyclic stability, and coulombic efficiency, which are being expected in advanced Na‐storage devices.",

Ag coated Zn foil with enhanced sodiophilicity, rapid Na+ transfer kinetics and superior electronic conductivity guarantee the homogenized Na+ ion and electric field distribution. This enables remarkably low overpotentials and uniform Na plating/stripping behavior with ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% during 500 cycles.

However, the non-negligible volume variation leads to the rapid decay of capacity, which hinders the practical application of Sb anode materials. Here, an economical and scalable route with high yield is proposed to obtain Sb ultrafine nanocrystals embedded in a porous carbon skeleton. Notably, the synergetic effect of the heterogeneous structure is maximized by inducing the interfacial coupling SbOC and creating buffering space for the volume effect of Sb. The high-entropy phase interface creates the doping site breaking the periodicity of atoms and alters the electronic structure, also bridging the slip of intergranular defects. Thus, the electronic conductivity and phase interface structural stability are reinforced. The mechanism of accelerating electron migration at the heterogeneous phase interface is visualized through the density functional theory method, and the mass/charge-transfer kinetics is analyzed via the calculation of surface-induced capacitive contribution.",

However, the available capacity and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) limits the practical application of hard carbon anode. This issue results from the unclear understanding of the Na+ storage mechanism in hard carbon. In this work, a series of hard carbons with different microstructures are synthesized through an \"up to down\" approach by using a simple ball-milling method to illustrate the sodium-ion storage mechanism. The results demonstrate that ball-milled hard carbon with more defects and smaller microcrystalline size shows less low-potential-plateau capacity and lower ICE, which provides further evidence to the \"adsorption-insertion\" mechanism. This work might give a new perspective to design hard carbon material with a proper structure for efficient sodium-ion storage to develop high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",

However, its Na storage properties and sodiation/desodiation mechanism have not been fully explored. Herein, we propose the sodiation/desodiation reaction mechanism of 2D few-layer antimonene (FLA) based on results acquired by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, ex situ selected-area electron diffraction, and theoretical simulations. Our study shows that the FLA undergoes anisotropic volume expansion along the a/b plane and exhibits reversible crystalline phase evolution (Sb ⇋ NaSb ⇋ Na3Sb) during cycling. Density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the FLA has a small Na-ion diffusion barrier of 0.14 eV. The FLA delivers a larger capacity of 642 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 660 mA g-1) and a high rate capability of 429 mAh g-1 at 5 C and maintains a stable capacity of 620 mA g-1 at 0.5 C with 99.7% capacity retention from the 10th to the 150th cycle. Considering the 660 mAh g-1 theoretical capacity of Sb, the electrochemical utilization of Sb atoms of FLA is as high as 93.9% at a rate of 0.5 C for over 150 cycles, which is the highest capacity and Sb utilization ratio reported so far.

Herein, the large enough graphene nanosheets interlayer and abundant nanopores with a diameter of ∼2.1 nm induced by adjusting the pyrolysis temperature in the thermosetting phenolic resin-derived hard carbon matrix to augment the performance of the sodium ion storage. The presence of sufficiently large carbon interlayers has been proven to provide active sites for reversible adsorption, enabling effective storage of sodium ions in the high-voltage slope region, while also promoting rapid Na+ transport. Meanwhile, forming abundant closed nanopores with larger sizes helps sodium ion storage in the low-voltage plateau region. In the optimized samples, the formation of sufficient long graphene nanosheets with a perfect crystal lattice, which further shrinks to form enclosed nanopores, effectively reduces defective sites and specific surface area. Additionally, the appropriate content of C-O and C=O functional groups contributes to an exceptional initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of up to 93%. Simultaneously, the optimized sample HC-1500 contributes to a remarkable plateau capacity of 294 mAh g-\n                     1 during the charging process (high reversible capacity of 403 mAh g-\n                     1 at 0.1 C). Moreover, based on the microstructure evolution and Na storage behavior of hard carbon, an “adsorption (27%) – filling (73%)” sodium storage mechanism that the sodium storage as a quasi-metallic sodium state is demonstrated. Consequently, this study will offer valuable insights for the development of hard carbon anodes tailored for high-energy practical SIBs, while also advancing the understanding of sodium storage mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Bimetallic oxides have received considerable attention as anodes for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their high electrochemical activity and theoretical specific capacity. However, their cycling performance is limited by large volume variation, severe aggregation, and pulverization of bimetallic oxide nanoparticles during repeated metal ion insertion/extraction processes. Herein, bimetallic antimony-vanadium oxide nanoparticles embedded in graphene (SbVO4/G) composites are prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. Bimetallic SbVO4 with abundant redox reaction sites can provide high specific capacity by a multi-electron reaction. A robust graphene substrate can not only alleviate volume expansion but also prevent aggregation and collapse of highly active bimetallic SbVO4. Due to the excellent synergy between the two building components, SbVO4/G hybrids exhibit excellent electrochemical activity, structural stability, and electrochemical performance. When employed as anodes for LIBs and SIBs, SbVO4/G composites display excellent cycling performance (1079.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 150 cycles for LIBs and 401.6 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 450 cycles for SIBs) and impressive rate capability. This work demonstrates that SbVO4/G composites are promising anodes for both LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are emerging next-generation energy storage technology, and exploiting applicative electrode materials to accommodate the large-sized Na+ and K+ are urgently needed. Herein, an innovative composite of BiSb@Bi2O3/SbOx nanoparticles encapsulated in porous carbon (BiSb@Bi2O3/SbOx@C) is fabricated through a template-assisted in-situ pyrogenic decomposition and evaluated as anodes for SIBs and PIBs. The BiSb@Bi2O3/SbOx@C delivers high specific capacity, superior rate capability (205 mA h g−1 and 111 mA h g−1 at 2 Ah g−1) and good cycling stability (248 mA h g−1 and 214 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1) in SIBs and PIBs. The excellent performance owes to the synergistic effect of Bi and Sb, the multilayer nanostructure design as well as the interconnected porous carbon network, which effectively promotes electron transport and ion diffusion, restricts volume change and enhances the electrode structure stability simultaneously. Furthermore, the capacitive behavior contributes much to the storage of sodium and potassium ions, which guarantees a superior rate capability.

Benefiting from the 3D fast Na+ transport network composed of the defective carbon coating, Mo─S─C bonds, enlarged interlayer spacing, S-vacancies, and lattice distortion in the composite, the Na+ storage kinetics is significantly accelerated. As expected, Vs-SMS@C releases an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1089 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , higher than the theoretical capacity. It delivers a satisfactory capacity of 463 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 10 A g-1 , which is the state-of-the-art rate capability compared to other MoS2 based sodium ion battery anodes to the knowledge. Moreover, a super long-term cycle stability is achieved by Vs-SMS@C, which keeps 91.6% of the initial capacity after 3000 cycles under the current density of 5 A g-1 in the voltage of 0.3-3.0 V.

Herein, a dual‐strategy is developed to boost the Na‐storage performance of the Fe/Mn‐based layered oxide cathode by copper (Cu) doping and nanoengineering.

The synergistic effects of Cu doping and nanotechnology enable high Na+ coefficients and low ionic migration energy barrier, as well as highly reversible structure evolution and Cu/Fe/Mn valence variation upon repeated sodium insertion/extraction; thus, the P2‐Na0.76Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48O2 nano‐necklaces yield fabulous rate capability (125.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C with 56.5 mA h g−1 at 20 C) and excellent cyclic stability (≈79% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Additionally, a promising energy density of 177.4 Wh kg−1 is demonstrated in a prototype soft‐package Na‐ion full battery constructed by the tailored nano‐necklaces cathode and hard carbon anode.

Nanostructure electrode materials play a crucial role in this process. However, the current method of preparation is arduous and yields restricted quantities. In view of this, we have devised an innovative approach that provides convenience and efficacy, facilitating the large-scale synthesis of CoS2 nanoparticles, which exhibited exceptional performance. When the current density was 1000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity reached 760 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles. Remarkably, even at an increased current density of 5000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity of CoS2 remained at 685.5 mAh g-1. The ultra-high performance could be attributed to the specific surface area, which minimized the diffusion distance of sodium-ions during the charging and discharging processes and mitigated the extent of structural damage. Our straightforward preparation techniques facilitate the mass production and present a novel approach for the development of cost-effective and high-performing anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

Herein, a zirconium-based metal-organic framework nanostructure coating (ZMOF-NSC) was constructed in a low-loss, flexible manner. Comprehensive studies show that ZMOF-NSC, with its periodically ordered nanochannels and organized pore structures, enhances ion transport and decreases the Na+ migration energy barrier, thus ensuring uniform ion flux and achieving uniform spherical deposition. Additionally, ZMOF-NSC facilitates partial desolvation, catalyzing the formation of an inorganic-rich, dual-layered SEI that effectively protects the anode and suppresses dendrite formation. Consequently, the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery exhibits an impressive lifespan of over 2500 h, demonstrating extended operational longevity. The Na3V2(PO4)3∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries demonstrate exceptional cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10 C, maintaining stability over 3000 cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery achieves an energy density of 370 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 10,484 W kg-1, indicating superior durability and performance. This significant finding highlights the significant potential of structured MOFs to induce a dual-layered SEI, advancing the commercialization of durable, dendrite-free sodium metal batteries.

Herein, we propose a wide-temperature SIB, which involves a carbon-coated Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a Bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme-based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na + can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de-solvent process.  Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na + diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low-temperature behavior. Even at -70 °C, this battery still delivers 70.19% of the room-temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature up to 100 °C. These encourage results might shed light on the exploration of wide-temperature SIBs.",

        "abstract": "A key issue with Na-ion batteries is the development of active materials with stable electrochemical reversibility through the understanding of their sodium storage mechanisms. We report a sodium storage mechanism and properties of a new anode material, digenite Cu1.8S, based on its crystallographic study. It is revealed that copper sulfides (Cu xS) can have metal-rich formulas ( x ≥ 1.6), due to the unique oxidation state of +1 found in group 11 elements. These phases enable the unit cell to consist of all strong Cu-S bonds and no direct S-S bonds, which are vulnerable to external stress/strain that could result in bond cleavage as well as decomposition. Because of its structural rigidness, the Cu1.8S shows an intercalation/deintercalation reaction mechanism even in a low potential window of 0.1-2.2 V versus Na/Na+ without irreversible phase transformation, which most of the metal sulfides experience through a conversion reaction mechanism. It uptakes, on average, 1.4 Na+ ions per unit cell (∼250 mAh g-1) and exhibits ∼100% retention over 1000 cycles at 2C in a tuned voltage range of 0.5-2.2 V through an overall solid solution reaction with negligible phase separation.",

        "abstract": "As a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted more and more attention due to the lower cost of sodium than lithium. Red phosphorus (RP) is an especially promising anode for SIBs with the highest theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g-1, which faces the challenges of large volume change and low conductivity. Herein, we develop a nanoporous RP on reduced graphene oxide (NPRP@RGO) as a high-performance anode for SIBs through boiling. Its nanoporous structure could accommodate the volume change and minimize the ion diffusion length, and the high electronic conductive network built on RGO sheets facilitates the fast electron and ion transportation. As a result, NPRP@RGO exhibits a superhigh capacity (1249.7 mAh gcomposite-1 after 150 cycles at 173.26 mA gcomposite-1), superior rate capability (656.9 mAh gcomposite-1 at 3465.28 mA gcomposite-1), and ultralong cycle life at 5.12 A gRP-1 for RP-based electrodes (775.3 mAh gRP-1 after 1500 cycles). The successful synthesis of NPRP@RGO marks a significant enhanced performance for RP-based SIB anodes, providing a scalable synthesis route for nanoporous structures.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides (MSs) exhibit great prospects as high-performance electrodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), because of the excellent redox reversibility and relatively high theoretical capacity of the conversion-type electrochemical reaction. However, they suffer from intrinsic poor electrical conductivity and tremendous volume expansion during the Na^+ insertion process, which would lead to sluggish reaction kinetic and severe capacity damping. Generally, designing hybrid structures with a secure framework, which could withstand the tension brought by the volume change, is an effective way to promote cycling stability. Besides, the carbonaceous material is considered to be an important additive, which can effectively elevate the electron/ion conductivity and realize the high-rate performance of the anode. Herein, a comprehensive 0-dimensional/2-dimensional (0D/2D) structure of carbon-coated CoS_2 nanospheres encapsulated in reduced graphene oxide (denoted as CoS_2@C/RG) is designed as anode material for SIBs. In the notable 0D/2D CoS_2@C/RG structure, the nanoscale CoS_2@C particles and RG nanosheets provide a high superficial area for Na^+ insertion and shortened Na^+ diffusion pathway. Furthermore, benefiting from the high conductivity and structural flexibility, the introduced RG supplies fast electron transportation channel and guarantees structural stability of the anode, which brings in improved reaction kinetic and structural stability. Consequently, the CoS_2@C/RG electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 716.3 mAh/g at 0.2 A/g after 100 cycles, excellent rate performance, and stable cyclicity of 514.9 mAh/g at 5 A/g after 600 cycles. This work broadens the scope of rationally constructing comprehensive structures and may shed new light on MSs-based multidimensional anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials cannot well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a high‐rate stability of 311.7 mAh g−1 at 10 C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). This work presents the promotive effect of ordered vacancies on the electrochemistry of SIBs and demonstrates the superiority to unordered vacancies, which is expected to extend it to other metal‐ion batteries, not limited to SIBs to achieve high capacity and cycling stability.",

Thereinto, Fe3S4 has a high theoretical specific capacity of 785 mAh g−1. However, at present, the research related to Fe3S4 anode for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is still in its infancy, and it also suffers from severe volume expansion and limited preparation. Therefore, to further boost its sodium storage potential, the Fe3S4@rGO composite with hierarchical structure and carbonaceous network is proposed in this study. Beneficial from the ingenious hierarchitectures and flexible graphene coating, the Fe3S4@rGO anode exhibits outstanding sodium storage performance, which can deliver a high capacity of 603 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 98%. The micron flower‐like structure composed of 2D nanosheets can provide sufficient active sites and promote the rapid transport of Na+. Meanwhile, the 3D interconnected graphene carbon network makes a crucial contribution to alleviating volume changes and enhancing electrical conductivity.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are currently the most promising candidates for large-scale energy storage devices owing to their low cost and abundant resources. Titanium-based layered oxides have attracted widespread attention as promising anode materials due to delivering a safe potential of about 0.7 V (vs Na+/Na) and a small volume contraction during cycles; P2-type Ti-based layered oxides are typically reported, due to the challenging synthesis of the O3-type counterpart resulting from the high percentage of unstable Ti3+. Herein, we report an anomalous O3-Na2/3Ni1/3Ti2/3O2 layered oxide as an ultrastable and high-rate anode material for SIBs. The anode material delivers a reversible capacity of 112 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 C, a good capacity retention rate of 91% after 1400 cycles at 2 C, and, in particular, a capacity of 52 mA h g-1 even at a high rate of 20 C (1780 mA g-1). Furthermore, the in situ X-ray diffraction monitoring reveals no phase transitions and almost zero strain both underlie the good long-cycle stability. The measured high apparent Na+ diffusion coefficient (2.06 × 10-10 cm2 s-1) and the low migration energy barrier (0.59 eV) from density functional theory calculations are responsible for the superior rate capability. Our results promise advanced high-performance O3-type Ti-based layered oxides as promising anode materials toward application for SIBs.",

However, low electronic conductivity, severe particle agglomeration and lack of effective synthesis methods have still greatly hampered their rapid development. Herein, we initially fabricate a novel VSe1.5/CNF composite through a facile electrospinning method followed by selenization. The electrochemical measurements show that VSe1.5/CNFs can enable the rapid and durable storage of Li+, Na+, and K+ ions. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite delivers a high capacity of 932 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, for SIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite manifests a high reversible capacity of 668 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles and an excellent capacity of 265 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 even after an ultra-long 6000 cycles. This is one of the best performances of vanadium-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. Most remarkably, the VSe1.5/CNF composite also demonstrates a satisfactory reversible K+ storage performance.

        "abstract": "Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self-catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple-shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A g-1, which is superior to previously-reported results. Even at 5 A g-1, 259.4 mAh g-1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides (TMSs) are suitable for SIBs and PIBs owing to their satisfactory theoretical capacity and superior electrical conductivity. However, the large radius of Na+/K+ easily leads to sluggish kinetics and poor conductivity, which hinder the development of SIBs and PIBs. Structure design is an effective method to solve these obstacles. In this study, Co2+ ions combined with glycerol molecules to form self-assembled nanospheres at first, and then they were in situ converted into CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix during the selenization process. This structure has three-dimensional ion diffusion channels that can effectively hamper the aggregation of metal compound nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the CoSe2/C of the yolk-shell structure and a large number of pores help alleviate volume expansion and facilitate electrolyte wettability. These structural advantages of CoSe2/C endow it with remarkable electrochemical performances for full/half SIBs and full/half PIBs. The obtained CoSe2/C exhibits superior stability and excellent performance (312.1 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 1600 cycles) for SIBs. When it is used as an anode material for PIBs, 369.2 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1 and 248.1 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 500 mA g-1; in addition, CoSe2/C also shows superior rate capacity (186.4 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1). A series of ex situ XRD measurements were adapted to explore the possible conversion mechanism of CoSe2/C as the anode for PIBs. It is worth noting that the full-cell of CoSe2/C//Na3V2(PO4)3@rGO for SIBs and the full-cell of CoSe2/C//PTCDA-450 for PIBs were successfully assembled. The relationship between the structure and performance of CoSe2/C was investigated through density functional theory (DFT).",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal borides (MBenes) have emerged as a rising star and hold great potential promise for catalysis and metal ion batteries owing to a well-defined layered structure and excellent electrical conductivity. Unlike well-studied graphene, perovskite and MXene materials in various fields, the research about MBene is still in its infancy. The inadequate exploration of efficient etching methods impedes their further study. Herein, we put forward an efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal alkaline solution etching strategy for exfoliating MoAlB MAB phase into 2D MoB MBenes with a well accordion-like structure, which displays a remarkable electrochemical performance in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) with a reversible specific capacity of 196.5 mAh g–1 at the current density of 50 mA g–1, and 138.6 mAh g–1 after 500 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A g–1. The underlying mechanism toward excellent electrochemical performance are revealed by comprehensive theoretical simulations. This work proves that MBene is a competitive candidate as the next generation anode of sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Metal chalcogenides have emerged as promising anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a free-standing membrane based on ultralong Sb2Se3 nanowires has been successfully fabricated via a facile hydrothermal synthesis combined with a subsequent vacuum filtration treatment. The as-achieved free-standing membrane constructed by pure Sb2Se3 nanowires exhibits good flexibility and integrity. Meanwhile, we investigate the lithium and sodium storage behavior of the Sb2Se3 nanowire-based free-standing membrane. When applied as the anode for LIBs, it delivers a reversible capacity of 614 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, maintaining 584 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. When applied as the anode for SIBs, it delivers a reversible capacity of 360 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, retaining 289 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. Such difference in electrochemical performance can be attributed to the more complex sodiation process relative to the corresponding lithiation process. This work may provide insight on developing Sb2Se3-based anode materials for high-performance LIBs or SIBs.",

Operando structural studies give us some of the most useful information for understanding how batteries work, but it remains difficult to separate out the contributions of the various components of a battery stack (e.g., electrodes, current collectors, electrolyte, and binders) and examine specific materials. We have used operando X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) to study specific components of an essentially unmodified working cell and extract detailed, space-resolved structural information on both crystalline and amorphous phases that are present during cycling by Rietveld and pair distribution function (PDF) methods. We illustrate this method with the first detailed structural examination of the cycling of sodium in a phosphorus anode, revealing surprisingly different mechanisms for sodiation and desodiation in this promising, high-capacity anode system.",

        "abstract": "Metal chloride-intercalated graphite intercalation compounds (MC-GICs) show a perfect sandwich structure with high electronic conductivity and chemical stability, but there are few applications for MC-GICs in anode materials of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we selected a splendid host microcrystalline graphite (MG) to synthesize an AlCl3 intercalated MG intercalation compound (AlCl3-MGIC) anode material and demonstrated that it is suitable for SIBs via electrolyte optimization. The AlCl3-MGIC electrode is primarily compared in four electrolytes. Sodium storage is proposed for co-intercalation and conversion reactions by simultaneously selecting a compatible NaPF6/diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) electrolyte. As a result, the AlCl3-MGIC anode delivers a specific capacity of 202 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles and still exhibits a satisfactory capacity of 198 mA h g-1 after 900 cycles. Density functional theory calculations further illustrate that DEGDME solvent molecules offer moderate adsorption energy to sodium ions that guarantees structure stabilization of GICs during repeated cycling. This work provides a theoretical basis for designing sodium ion storage with a graphite layered structure and unveiling the prospects of MC-GIC materials as high-performance anodes.",

The anode of choice in SIBs is hard carbon (HC) due to its electrochemical performance. Among different HC precursors, bio‐waste resources have attracted significant attention due to their low‐cost, abundance, and sustainability. Many bio‐waste materials have been used as HC precursors, but they often require strong acids/bases for pre‐/post‐treatment for HC development. Here, the morphology, microstructure, and electrochemical performance of HCs synthesized from hazelnut shells subjected to different pre‐treatments (i. e., no pre‐treatment, acid treatment, and water washing) were compared. The impact on the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion cells and the cost‐effectiveness were also investigated. The results revealed that hazelnut shell‐derived HCs produced via simple water washing outperformed those obtained via other processing methods in terms of electrochemical performance and cost–ecological effectiveness of a sodium‐ion battery pack.",

The the Emeraldine salt PANI not only exhibits high flexibility to alleviate the high volume change of SnO2 nanoparticles, but also enhances the conductivity of electrons and sodium ions.

        "abstract": "Leveraging economically viable plant bio‐waste‐derived hard carbon (HC) anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries is logical. Many plants' bio‐waste materials are used as HC precursors, but their fabrication process is usually limited by direct carbonization which constrains their large‐scale sustainability. Herein, the critical role of the pre‐hydrothermal carbonization effect in regulating the structure and interfacial Na+ storage mechanism/performance of HC derived from oak leaves (OL) biowaste (OLHC) is reported. The resultant OLHC demonstrates a high‐reversible capacity (378 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C), superior rate performance (272.9 mAh g−1 at 10 C), remarkable cycling performance (75% after 8000 cycles at 10 C), and adequate ICE (85%). Advanced ex/in situ characterization combined with theoretical calculations reveals that hydrothermal pre‐regulation of OLHC stabilizes the spherical particles, introducing more active sites and promoting surface properties with oxygen dopant‐induced defects, which shows uneven surface electrostatic potential and lower activation energy for Na+ adsorption thus generates a thin layer of PF6−/NaF‐enriched core‐shell‐like SEI modulation with organic–inorganic composition. This enables fast interfacial Na+ diffusion kinetics, contributing to high‐capacity retention and stable cycling performance. The studies offer a systematic understanding of the pre‐hydrothermal strategy for the structural design of HC from plant‐leaves‐biowaste with true sustainability and improved performance for SIBs.",

The process results in a unique pseudo-graphitic material with abundant microporosity. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate excellent sodium storage performance by maintaining the plateau capacity even at higher current densities.

However, this goal is not entirely achievable in the case of P2-type layered transition-metal oxides because of the sluggish kinetics and unfavorable electrode|electrolyte interphase formation. To circumvent these issues, we propose a P2-type Na_0.78Ni_0.31Mn_0.67Nb_0.02O_2 (P2-NaMNNb) cathode active material where the niobium doping enables reduction in the electronic band gap and ionic diffusion energy barrier while favoring the Na-ion mobility. Via physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the niobium induces atomic scale surface reorganization, hindering metal dissolution from the cathode into the electrolyte. We also report the testing of the cathode material in coin cell configuration using Na metal or hard carbon as anode active materials and ether-based electrolyte solutions. Interestingly, the Na||P2-NaMNNb cell can be cycled up to 9.2 A g^−1 (50 C), showing a discharge capacity of approximately 65 mAh g^−1 at 25 °C. Furthermore, the Na||P2-NaMNNb cell can also be charged/discharged for 1800 cycles at 368 mA g^−1 and −40 °C, demonstrating a capacity retention of approximately 76% and a final discharge capacity of approximately 70 mAh g^−1. The practical application of sodium-ion batteries at subzero temperatures is hindered by the slow Na-ion transfer kinetics. Here, the authors reported the niobium doping of P2-type cathode active material capable of efficient battery cycling at low temperatures such as −40 °C.",

        "abstract": "Metallic bismuth (Bi) anode materials are promising candidates for alkali-ion batteries due to its high theoretical gravimetric/volumetric capacity. However, the pronounced volume change from Bi to full sodiation phase Na3Bi, inducing the structural collapse, and ionic conduction interruption upon cycling, hinders their implementation in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a mangosteen-like bismuth nanosphere coated by N-doped carbon shell (Bi@NC) was designed and synthesized to address these limitations. Due to the nanosize of Bi core and in situ, generated N-doped carbon shell, this Bi@NC anode can not only effectively accommodate the volume change during the alloying/dealloying process but also provide high-speed channels for electron/ion transport to the highly active bismuth nanospheres. The Bi@NC electrode exhibits outstanding cycling stability (1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 with an impressive capacity retention of 96.5 %) and rapid sodium storage performance (392.8 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1). Importantly, ex-situ techniques and kinetic analysis have revealed the distinctively sharp multiphase transitions and the “battery-capacitor dual-mode” sodium-storage mechanism. This research introduces a new approach to enhance the performance of bismuth-based anodes in advanced SIBs and demonstrates potential for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising large‐scale and low‐cost energy storage systems due to the abundance and low price of sodium. Herein, hard carbons from a sustainable biomass feedstock (vine shoots) were synthesized via a simple two‐step carbonization process at different highest temperatures to be used as anodes in SIBs. The hard carbon produced at 1200 °C delivered the highest reversible capacity (270 mAh g–1 at 0.03 A g–1, with an acceptable initial coulombic efficiency of 71%) since a suitable balance between the pseudographitic domains growth and the retention of microporosity, defects, and functional groups was achieved. A prominent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 97% over 315 cycles was also attained. Comprehensive characterization unraveled a three‐stage sodium storage mechanism based on adsorption, intercalation, and filling of pores. A remarkable specific capacity underestimation of up to 38% was also found when a two‐electrode half‐cell configuration was employed to measure the rate performance. To avoid this systematic error caused by the counter/reference electrode polarization, we strongly recommend the use of a three‐electrode setup or a full‐cell configuration to correctly evaluate the anode response at moderate and high current rates.",

        "abstract": "Cost concerns have promoted the rise of Na-based batteries as an alternative to Li-based batteries, and the energy density pursuits have brought attention to Na metal anodes. Numerous studies have been conducted on the failure mechanisms and improvement methods of Na metal batteries (NMBs) at room temperature; however, the low-temperature applications are still faced with more complex challenges. On the basis of the concentration effect of the electrolytes, we propose a dilute electrolyte for the low-temperature operation of NMBs. With the low salt concentration and tetrahydrofuran cosolvent, the affinity between Na ions and the solvent molecules is weakened to achieve fast reaction kinetics at low temperatures. The designed electrolyte enables an effectively decreased cell impedance, which improves the cycling stability of Na symmetric cells. As a result, the full cell paired with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode maintains a capacity of 80 mAh/g over 250 cycles at -20 °C. This work provides an electrolyte design strategy toward low-temperature NMBs.",

A variety of carbon anode materials such as graphite, hard carbon, soft carbon, and graphene are widely used in sib because of their diversity of structure and chemical properties.

Hard and soft carbon provide high capacity but have problems with electrical conductivity and expansion. Carbon nanostructures, including graphene, have many active sites but are expensive to produce. To improve the properties of carbon materials, strategies such as increasing layer spacing, controlling porosity, and introducing defects are discussed.

The impact of high and low desodiation cut-off potentials is studied and the results show a drastic increase in capacity retention when using the desodiation cut-off potential of 1.2 V as compared to 2.5 V.

        "abstract": "The rational disposal of waste tires poses a ubiquitous challenge globally. Pyrolytic carbon black, a solid by-product produced through pyrolysis, has great application prospects. Carbon-based materials are regard as the most potential commercial anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)， which features cheap, environmentally friendly, and low reaction potential. In this study, three-dimensional vertical graphene composite (TCBp@VGSs) was synthesized from waste tires. The graphene with higher defectiveness offers an increased number of active sites for Na+, while the vertically aligned graphene facilitates rapid electron transfer. As a result, the TCBp@VGSs electrode demonstrates the ability to maintain a reversible capacity of 252.7 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Furthermore, it exhibits a sustained rate performance of 105.4 mAh g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1. Moreover, even after 1900 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, a reversible capacity of 171.5 mAh g−1 is retained, showcasing good stability and a significantly higher capacity compared to TCBp-1100.

Nevertheless, long-cycle stability can not be achieved simultaneously while designing a fast-charging Fe7 S8 -based anode. Herein, Fe7 S8 encapsulated in carbon-sulfur bonds doped hollow carbon fibers (NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 ) is designed and synthesized for sodium-ion storage. The NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 including metallic-phase Fe7 S8 embrace higher electron specific conductivity, electrochemical reversibility, and fast sodium-ion diffusion. Moreover, the carbonaceous fibers with polar CSFe bonds of NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 exhibit a fixed confinement effect for electrochemical conversion intermediates contributing to long cycle life. In conclusion, combined with theoretical study and experimental analysis, the multinomial optimized NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 is demonstrated to integrate a suitable structure for higher capacity, fast charging, and longer cycle life. The full cell shows a power density of 1639.6 W kg-1 and an energy density of 204.5 Wh kg-1 , respectively, over 120 long cycles of stability at 1.1 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Developing anodes with high and stable energy density for both gravimetric and volumetric storage is vital for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries. Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling. As anode for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (864.8 mAh g-1 and 1990 mAh cm-3 at 0.2 A g-1), high rate (612.6 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1) and the longest life among the reported SnSe-based anodes (capacity retention of 92.8% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1). Subsequently, impressive cyclic life (capacity retention of 91.6% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) is also achieved for sodium-ion batteries.

Herein, a simple but effective sulfonation route has been proposed to transform PP-based waste masks into value-added hard carbon (CM) anode materials for advanced sodium-ion batteries. The sulfonation treatment improves the thermal stability of the PP molecule, preventing their complete decomposition and the release of massive gas molecules during the carbonization process. Meanwhile, the oxygen functional groups introduced during sulfonation effectively facilitates the cross-linking between the PP chains, hindering the rearrangement of carbon microcrystalline structures and enhancing its structural disorder. As a result, the prepared hard carbon anode (CM-180) with a high disorder degree and minimal surface defects realizes a high sodium storage capacity of 327.4 mAh g−1 with excellent cycle and rate capability. In addition, when coupled with O3–NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the fabricated sodium-ion full cell delivers a high energy density of 238 Wh kg−1 and achieves an outstanding rate capability with a retained capacity of 75 mAh g−1 even at an ultrahigh current rate of 50 C.

However, one of the main challenges for their wide-scale application is to develop suitable anode materials with excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel orderly layered VMoS2 (OL-VMS) anode material was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal self-assembly approach followed by a heating procedure. As the anode material of the SIBs, the unique structure of OL-VMS not only facilitated the rapid migration of sodium ions between the stacked layers but also provided a stable framework for the volume change in the process of intercalation/deintercalation. In addition, vanadium mediating in the framework caused more defects to produce abundant storage sites for Na+. As such, the obtained OL-VMS-based anode exhibited high reversible capacities of 602.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 mA g-1 and 534 mAh g-1 even after 190-cycle operation at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the OL-VMS-based anode delivered an outstanding specific capacity of 626.4 mAh g-1 after 100-cycle testing at 2 A g-1 in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V. In particular, even in the absence of conductive carbon, it still showed an excellent specific capacity of 260 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 130 cycles in a 0.3-3 V voltage range, which should contribute to the cost reduction and energy density increase.",

Before testing as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery (SIB) application, the samples were systematically characterized. It was clearly observed that V5+ doping significantly affects the phase formation of sodium titanate samples and leads to the alteration of the major phase of Na2Ti3O7 to a single Na2Ti6O13 phase with increasing doping concentrations. Electrochemical investigations clearly showed that the optimized 15 wt% V5+ doped sample exhibits the highest capacity of 136 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 900 cycles as well as better rate capability than the undoped sample by delivering 101 mA h g-1 capacity at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. It is believed that the incorporation of highly charged V5+ in sodium titanate produces oxygen vacancies along with partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, resulting in improved electronic conductivity. The utilization of oxygen vacancies also preserves the integrity of the electrode, giving rise to long term cycling. Thereby, V5+ doping was found to be an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of the sodium titanate anode for SIBs.",

Systematical investigation reveals that good compatibility of the electrode-electrolyte systems forms thinner but a more sustainable solid-electrolyte interphase and delivers a higher ionic conductivity and Na+ ion diffusion coefficient than the commonly used ester-based electrolytes. Therefore, an excellent electrochemical performance is demonstrated with a long cycle life (∼196 mA h/g and 90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g), a super rate capability (∼51% capacity retention at 10 A/g) at a mass loading of 1.5 mg/cm2, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%. More importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at an ultrahigh mass loading of 17 mg/cm2, superior to all reported HC anodes. Our findings not only shed light on the design of high-performance battery systems but also promise a commercial transformation from the lab test to mass production of NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal thiophosphite has demonstrated promising application potential as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, the intrinsic low electrical conductivity and drastic volume expansion impede its commercialization. Herein, a series of metal thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx (metal = Fe, Ni, Co, and Cd) composites are constructed via Lewis acidic molten salt etching followed by synchronous phospho‐sulfurization. The Ti3C2Tx substrate endows the thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx hybrids with high electrical conductivity. Importantly, thiophosphite grown on the MXene layers exhibits a 3D cross‐linked structure, which not only facilitates electron/ion transport, but also maintains robust structural stability owing to the space confinement effect. As a proof of concept, FePS3/Ti3C2Tx demonstrates remarkable rate performance (827.4 and 598.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively) along with long‐term cycling stability (capacity retention of 93.7% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Impressively, the FePS3/Ti3C2Tx//NVPO full cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 396.8 mAh g−1 over 1350 cycles at 2 A g−1. The sodium storage mechanism of FePS3/Ti3C2Tx anode is further unveiled through in situ XRD/ex situ HRTEM characterizations and theoretical calculations. This work provides a fresh perspective on enhancing the electrochemical performance of thiophosphite through the in situ construction of thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx hybrids.",

        "abstract": "Porous Sn (PSn) has aroused extensive attention as an advanced anode for sodium‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and small volume expansion. However, as a low‐melt metal, the preparation of PSn at room temperature is a difficult problem. Herein, universal chemical prelithiation/presodiation strategies are reported to rapidly synthesize PSn from commercial Sn powders at ambient temperature. The recyclable pre‐metallation solvents are selected by redox potential analysis to react with Sn to form alloy precursors in a short time. Benefiting from the application of delithiation/desodiation agents with suitable proton concentrations, PSn perfectly inherits the Sn skeleton from precursors. With this method, porous Al, Pb, Bi, and Sb are successfully produced. Finally, the half‐cell with PSn anode prepared by presodiation strategy achieves a great rate property (663 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and prominent cycling performance with 71% capacity retention after 7500 cycles (502 mAh g−1) at 5 A g−1.

A Coulombic efficiency of ≈99% is achieved after the third cycle. Increase of the C-rate leads to a drop of the capacity, but a full recovery is observed after switching back to the initial C-rate. In the early stages of Na uptake first Cu+ is reduced and expelled from the electrode as nanocrystalline metallic Cu. An increase of the Na content leads to a full conversion of the material with nanocrystalline Cu particles and elemental V embedded in a Na2S matrix. The formation of Na2S is evidenced by 23Na MAS NMR spectra and X-ray powder diffraction. During the charge process the nanocrystalline Cu particles are retained, but no crystalline materials are formed. At later stages of cycling the reaction mechanism changes which is accompanied by the formation of copper(I) sulfide. The presence of nanocrystalline metallic Cu and/or Cu2S improves the electrical conductivity, leading to superior cycling and rate capability.",

The optimized mass loading of SnS2 along with the addition of nitrogen and sulfur on the surface of GAs results in enhanced electrochemical performance of SnS2@N,S-GA composite. In particular, the introduction of nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms could provide more active sites and good accessibility for Na ions. Moreover, the incorporation of the stable SnS2 crystal structure within the anode results in the superior discharge capacity of 527 mAh g-1 under a current density of 20 mA g-1 upon 50 cycles. It maintains 340 mAh g-1 even the current density is increased to 800 mA g-1. Aiming to further systematically study mechanism of composite with improved SIB performance, we construct the corresponding models based on experimental data and conduct first-principles calculations. The calculated results indicate the sulfur atoms doped in GAs show a strong bridging effect with the SnS2 nanocrystals, contributing to build robust architecture for electrode.

The as-fabricated Bi/SSO@PCFs composite with Bi nanocrystals homogeneously dispersed on and around the SSO surface is prepared by an electrospinning method. The excellently dispersed Bi nanocrystals realize an effective contact with SSO, which effectively lowers the electron conduction barriers and promotes the sodium ion release as well as the transport upon the desodiation/sodiation process, increasing the rate capacity and cycle stability of the SSO anode. Importantly, a high-speed ion channel is constructed through the special layered Bi, and SbBi phase. The prepared Bi/SSO@PCFs anodes deliver a high rate capacity up to 25 A g−1 and long cycle life of 5000 cycles with 83 % capacity retention rate, sustaining an average capacity loss of 0.0034 % for each cycle. Particularly, the intercalation of Na+ between layer-structure Bi and SbBi galleries provides a good basis for excellent cycle performance due to small volume change and unobstructed ion channels. This finding provides an effective strategy to establish ion transport highways, which essentially increase the rate-capacity and cycle-life of the SSO-based anodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-based materials have received wide attention as electrodes for energy storage and conversion owing to their rapid mass transfer processes, outstanding electronic conductivities, and high stabilities. Here, sulfur-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (S-CBC) was prepared as a high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation using the bacterial cellulose membrane produced by microbial fermentation as the precursor. Doping sublimed sulfur powder into CBC results in a greater degree of disorder and defects, buffering the volume expansion during the cycle. Significantly, the three-dimensional (3D) network structure of bacterial cellulose endows S-CBC with flexible self-support. As an anode for sodium ion batteries, S-CBC exhibits a high specific capacity of 302.9 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 50 cycles and 177.6 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Compared with the CBC electrode, the S-CBC electrode also exhibits enhanced rate performance in sodium storage. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that Na+ has good adsorption stability and a faster diffusion rate in S-CBC. The doping of the S element introduces defects that enlarge the interlayer distance, and the synergies of adsorption and bonding are the main reasons for its high performance. These results indicate the potential application prospects of S-CBC as a flexible binder-free electrode for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides and oxides with high theoretical capacities have been regarded as promising anode candidates for a sodium-ion battery (SIB); however, they have critical issues including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and poor long-term stability. Herein, a dual carbon design strategy is proposed to integrate with highly active heterojunctions to overcome the above issues. In this new design, CoS2/CoO hollow dodecahedron heterojunctions are sandwiched between open framework carbon-spheres (OFCs) and a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanomembrane (OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO). The CoS2/CoO heterojunctions effectively promote electron transfer on their surface and provide more electrochemical active sites through their hierarchical hollow structures assembled by nanodots. Meanwhile, the dual-carbon framework forms a highly conductive network that enables a better rate capability. More importantly, the dual carbon can greatly buffer volume expansion and stable reaction interfaces of electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Benefitting from their synergistical effects, the OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and still maintains 205.3 mAh g-1 even when current density is increased by 200 times when used as an anode material for SIBs. Their cycling property is also remarkable with a maintained capacity of 161 mAh g-1 after 3500 charging/discharging cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. The dual-carbon strategy is demonstrated to be effective for enhanced reaction kinetics and long-term cycling property, providing siginificant guidance for preparing other high-performance electrode materials.",

Also, cobalt-based materials have high theoretical capacities and molybdenum incorporations can enhance electrical conductivity. Therefore, cobalt and molybdenum LDH is considered as an efficient anode material of sodium-ion battery (SIB). Nevertheless, volume expansion of LDH may limits the electrochemical performance of SIB. In this work, polydopamine (PDA) derived carbon coated cobalt molybdenum LDH (CoMoLDH) is synthesized via the hydrothermal, polymerization and carbonization processes as a novel anode material of SIB. Hydrothermal and polymerization durations are optimized to regular the morphology of CoMoLDH and achieve the suitable thickness of carbon layer. The optimal carbon coated CoMoLDH (CoMoLDH-C-PDA) anode shows a high specific capacity of 779.9 mAh/g at 0.05 A/g. After 100 cycles, the CoMoLDH-C-PDA anodes still presents a specific capacity of 310.9 mAh/g corresponding to capacity retentions of 70.0%. High specific capacity, excellent rate performance and long-term cyclic ability of CoMoLDH-C-PDA are attributed to the higher Na+ diffusion coefficient and smaller charge-transfer resistances.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion‐type metal sulfide (MS) anodes have attracted extraordinary attention due to relatively high capacity and intrinsic safety. The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen‐doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S→NaMoS2→MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe–N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2↔NaMoS2↔Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst. This work contributes new avenues for designing conversion‐type materials with an efficient reversible mechanism.",

Biomass-derived carbon, which is widely available and environmentally friendly, is one of the most promising anode materials for SIBs/PIBs, but the design and regulation of its microstructure is exceptionally complex. By selecting suitable biomass precursors, it is expected that biomass-derived carbon with suitable microstructures can be simply prepared.

        "abstract": "Transition-metal sulfides hold great promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and excellent redox reversibility based on multielectron conversion reactions. In this work, an elaborate composite, cobalt sulfide nanoclusters embedded in honeycomb-like sulfur-doped carbon foam (Co9S8@S-CF), is prepared via a facile sulfur-assisting calcination strategy, which tactfully induces the co-occurrence of in situ pore-forming, sulfidation, sulfur doping, and carbonization. Notably, sulfur-doped carbon foam (S-CF) possesses abundant voids, which are subject to construction of three-dimensional ionic/electronic pathways, leading to high sodium-ion accessibility and ultrafast sodium-ion/electron transportation toward Co9S8 nanoclusters. When worked as an anode in sodium-ion batteries, it delivers a remarkable capacity of 373 mA h g-1 over 1000 cycles at 0.25 C, achieving superior capacity retention of 80%. Furthermore, this anode could achieve unprecedented rate capability with a reversible capacity of 180 mA h g-1 at 50 C (20 A g-1), which significantly precedes those reported previously.",

        "abstract": "Few-layered FePS_3 nanosheets and ultrathin MXene are obtained by liquid ultrasonic exfoliation. The novel 2D/2D heterojunction of FePS_3 nanosheets@MXene composite is synthesized by in situ mixing MXene ultrathin nanosheets with FePS_3 nanosheets. Such unique nanostructure can promote rapid reaction kinetics, prevents electrode pulverization and agglomeration for the volume expansion, and provides the pseudocapacitive contribution. Searching for advanced anode materials with excellent electrochemical properties in sodium-ion battery is essential and imperative for next-generation energy storage system to solve the energy shortage problem. In this work, two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin FePS_3 nanosheets, a typical ternary metal phosphosulfide, are first prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation. The novel 2D/2D heterojunction of FePS_3 nanosheets@MXene composite is then successfully synthesized by in situ mixing ultrathin MXene nanosheets with FePS_3 nanosheets. The resultant FePS_3 nanosheets@MXene hybrids can increase the electronic conductivity and specific surface area, assuring excellent surface and interfacial charge transfer abilities. Furthermore, the unique heterojunction endows FePS_3 nanosheets@MXene composite to promote the diffusion of Na^+ and alleviate the drastic change in volume in the cyclic process, enhancing the sodium storage capability. Consequently, the few-layered FePS_3 nanosheets uniformly coated by ultrathin MXene provide an exceptional reversible capacity of 676.1 mAh g^−1 at the current of 100 mA g^−1 after 90 cycles, which is equivalent to around 90.6% of the second-cycle capacity (746.4 mAh g^−1). This work provides an original protocol for constructing 2D/2D material and demonstrates the FePS_3@MXene composite as a potential anode material with excellent property for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) has drawn significant interest as a promising anode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its large interplanar lattice spacing and relatively high diffusion efficiency. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of low electrical conductivity and substantial volume change greatly impede its practical applications in large-scale energy storage systems. In this work, ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles wrapped with nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as Nb2O5@NC) were delicately synthesized via a facile sol-gel method and subsequent heat treatment. The unique structure of ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles in a carbonaceous matrix can not only effectively shorten the transmission distance for both ions/electrons but also relieve the strain and stress caused by volume variation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In addition, the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and carbon coating can further improve the electronic conductivity and pseudocapacitive behavior of the active materials, thus promoting the rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Nb2O5@NC composite. The obtained 600-Nb2O5@NC-2 anode exhibits superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability, delivering a reversible capacity of 196 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Even at high current densities of 5 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, the long-life cycling tests show that the reversible capacities still remain at 128.4 mA h g-1 and 95.9 mA h g-1 after 3000 cycles, respectively, which is the best performance of Nb2O5-based anodes at high current densities so far. These results indicate that the feasible synthetic strategy of Nb2O5@NC is an effective approach to develop high-performance Nb2O5-based anodes for large-scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides are considered as hopeful anode materials for sodium-ion battery (SIB) due to the high specific capacity and rich reserves in nature. However, the inherent low conductivity of these anode materials, as well as the inevitable volume expansion and structural collapse during cycling, result in their poor rate performance and cycling stability. Herein, a universal selenization-co-carbonization strategy is proposed to synthesize Cu2-xSe nanoparticles in-situ confined in highly defective nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu2-xSe@NC) with superior architectural features, which involves simultaneous selenization and carbonization procedure of octahedral metal–organic framework (Cu-BTC) precursor. The nitrogen-doped carbon matrix stabilizes/confines the Cu2-xSe nanoparticles to prevent their agglomeration and volume expansion during cycling while endowing high electrical conductivity to the hybrid materials. As anode for SIBs, the Cu2-xSe@NC exhibits a high reversible capacity of 340 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 70 %, superior rate performance (capacity retention of 82.4 % from 0.02 to 5 A/g), and long-cycle durability. The ex-situ XRD and HRTEM techniques confirmed that Cu2-xSe undergoes complex intercalation and crystal evolution accompanied by reversible intermediate phases (NaCuSe and Na2Se) transformation during charge/discharge cycle. First-principles calculations and in-situ EIS confirmed that the intercalation of Na+ can greatly reducing the energy band gap and improving the electrical conductivity of Cu2-xSe@NC, thereby achieving excellent rate performance. Moreover, the Cu2-xSe@NC anode is also evaluated by matching with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to assemble a full SIB, which can provide high initial capacity and capacity retention, revealing its potential for practical application.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are widely considered a hopeful alternative to lithium‐ion battery technology. However, they still face challenges, such as low rate capability, unsatisfactory cycling stability, and inferior variable‐temperature performance. In this study, a hierarchical Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) @reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite (NVPF@rGO/CNT) is successfully constructed. This composite features 0D Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles are coated by a cross‐linked 3D conductive network composed of 2D rGO and 1D CNT. Furthermore, the intrinsic Na+ storage mechanism of NVPF@rGO/CNT through comprehensive characterizations is unveiled. The synthesized NVPF@rGO/CNT exhibits fast ionic/electronic transport and excellent structural stability within wide working temperatures (−40–50 °C), owing to the zero‐strain NVPF and the coated rGO/CNT conductive network that reduces diffusion distance for ions and electrons. Moreover, the stable integration between NVPF and rGO/CNT enables outstanding structural stability to alleviate strain and stress induced during the cycle. Additionally, a practice full cell is assembled employing a hard carbon anode paired with an NVPF@rGO/CNT cathode, which provides a decent capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, thereby attaining an ideal energy density of 242.7 Wh kg−1.

The flexible of binderless B-P/NC with annealing of 600 °C (B-P/NC-600) exhibits the remarkable performance for the robust capacity of 200 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 500 cycles and a durable reversible capacity of 160 mAh/g even at 1 A/g after 12,000 cycles, exhibiting the equally commendable stability of flexible B-P/NC-600. In addition, B-P/NC-600 delivers the reversible capacity of 265 mAh/g with the test temperature of 60 °C. More importantly, the flexible B-P/NC-600 is fabricated as anode for the whole battery, delivering the capacity of 90 mAh/g at 1 A/g after 200 cycles. Meanwhile, theoretical calculation further verified that boron and phosphorus co-doping can improve the adsorption capacity of nitrogen carbon materials. The favorable performance of flexible B-P/NC-600 can be ascribed to the nitrogen-rich carbon nanofibers with three-dimensional network matrix for the more active site of boron and phosphorus co-doping.

        "abstract": "Waste hemp hurd (WHH) was used as a sustainable feedstock for producing hard carbon-based anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Two easily scalable production pathways were tested and compared: (1) pyrolysis (at 500 °C) and subsequent annealing at 800, 1000 or 1200 °C, and (2) hydrothermal pretreatment (at 180 °C) and subsequent annealing at the above-mentioned highest temperatures. Results indicated that when a HCl (2 mol m−3) aqueous solution was used as hydrothermal medium, the textural, structural and surface chemistry features linked to the electrochemical performance of the resulting hard carbons improved. The WHH-derived electrode produced via HCl-mediated hydrothermal pretreatment and subsequent annealing at 1000 °C showed an exceptional electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity (535 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1) and rate capability (372, 156, 115, and 83 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1, respectively) when an ester-based electrolyte was used (NaTFSI in EC/DMC). Using an ether-based electrolyte (NaPF6 in diglyme) improved both the ICE (from 69% to 78%) and cycling stability (85% of capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 A g−1; 91% when current rate returned to 0.1 A g−1). In summary, relatively low-cost WHH-derived carbons are able to deliver an exceptional performance, much better than that reported so far for other biomass-derived carbons, and even close to that exhibited by more expensive and complex composite and hybrid materials.",

        "abstract": "It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high‐rate and long‐cycle oxide cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) because of the sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high‐performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2‐structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2‐ and O3‐type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic‐scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2 C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high‐performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.",

        "abstract": "It is of fundamental and technological significance to develop dual‐role anode materials for both lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with high performance. Here, a composite material based on CoSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N‐doped carbon framework intertwined with carbon nanotubes (CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs) is prepared successfully from cobalt‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF‐67). As anode materials for LIBs, CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites deliver a reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. The charge and discharge mechanisms of CoSe2 are characterized using ex situ X‐ray diffraction and Raman analysis, from which the lithiation products of CoSe2 are found to be LixCoSe2 and Li2Se, which are further converted to CoSe2 upon delithiation. The CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites also demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance as anode materials for SIBs with a carbonate‐based electrolyte, with specific capacities of 606 and 501 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 1 A g−1 in the 100th cycle. The electrochemical performance of the anode materials is further studied by pseudocapacitance and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements. This work may be exploited for the rational design and development of dual‐role anode materials for both Li‐ and Na‐ion batteries.",

Herein, a cube-like core/shell composite of single MnS nanocubes (≈50 nm) encapsulated in N, S co-doped carbon (MnS@NSC) with strong CSMn bond interactions is successfully prepared as outstanding anode material for SIBs. The carbon shell significantly restricts the expansion of the MnS volume in successive sodiation/desodiation processes, as demonstrated by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of one single MnS@NSC nanocube. Moreover, the in situ generated CSMn bonds between the MnS core and carbon shell play a significant role in improving the Na-storage stability and reversibility of MnS@NSC, as revealed by in situ Raman and TEM. As a result, MnS@NSC exhibits a high reversible specific capacity of 594.2 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 and an excellent rate performance. It also achieves a remarkable cycling stability of 329.1 mAh g-1 after 3000 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 corresponding to a low capacity attenuation rate of 0.0068% per cycle, which is superior to that of pristine MnS and most of the reported Mn-based anode materials in SIBs.",

The carbonization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) via a single-step process into hard carbon (HC) delivers a high-performing anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). Direct pyrolysis of PET waste increases the interlayer spacing with partially closed slit-shaped micro and mesopores that significantly improves the lower potential plateau-based capacity to 68% of the total capacity, validating a battery-type anode material. The HC carbonized at 1000℃ delivers a reversible capacity of 337 mAh/g with capacity retention of 88% after 100 cycles at 30 mAh/g. The HC exhibits 80% capacity retention even after 1000 cycles at a 1C rate and is promising for fast cycling-high power density applications. In PIBs, the HC carbonized at 800℃ performs the best and shows a reversible capacity of 305 mAh/g, with a battery-type low voltage plateau contribution of 32%.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the ultra-wide spacing MoS2/C structure is beneficial for the chemical adsorption of sodium ions and facilitates redox reactions.

In this work, we report the synthesis of methyl-functionalized MoS2 (M-MoS2) nanosheets through a facile second solvothermal method. During the second solvothermal treatment, the pristine MoS2 is mostly converted from the 2H to 1T phase and the interlayer distance is expanded from 0.65 to 0.80 nm. When evaluated as the anode for SIBs, the M-MoS2 exhibits superior cycling stability and rate capability. Kinetic analysis shows that the capacity is mainly contributed from a pseudocapacitive process. Ex situ XRD shows that the M-MoS2 exhibits inhibited lattice breathing and thus reduced volume change during cycling. This work demonstrates that the M-MoS2 is a promising candidate for pseudocapacitive sodium storage.",

In order to fully utilize MXenes' electrochemical energy storage capability, here, processing of 2D MXene flakes into hollow spheres and 3D architectures via a template method is reported. The MXene hollow spheres are stable and can be easily dispersed in solvents such as water and ethanol, demonstrating their potential applications in environmental and biomedical fields as well. The 3D macroporous MXene films are free‐standing, flexible, and highly conductive due to good contacts between spheres and metallic conductivity of MXenes.

Inspired by the structure of biological cell membranes, N/P co‐doped hard carbon nanospheres (NPCS) anodes with abundant ultramicropores (≈0.6 nm) are proposed and synthesized as robust sodium anodes. Based on density functional theory calculations, optimizing ultramicropores can enable small Na+ to be well confined within the pores and hinder large solvent molecules from invading and reacting, introducing N/P species contributes to the rapid adsorption/diffusion of Na+. In situ XRD and Raman analysis suggest that the nanoconfinement strategy induced by abundant ultramicropores and N/P co‐doping enables highly reversible electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical test confirms that the nanoconfinement strategy endows the NPCS anode with high reversible capacity (376.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior initial coulombic efficiency (87.3% at 1.0 A g−1), remarkable rate capability (155.6 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (with capacity retention of ≈94.6% after 10 000 cycles), lightening a promising avenue for developing SIB with robust durability.",

To meet this challenge, herein, we first propose a redox-potential-matched chemical sodiation approach, utilizing phenazine-sodium (PNZ-Na) as the optimal reagent to sodiate the Na3V2(PO4)3 precursor into Na-enriched Na4V2(PO4)3. The spontaneous sodiation reaction enables a fast reduction of one-half V ions from V3+ to V2+, followed by the insertion of one Na+ ion into the NASICON framework, which only takes 90 s to obtain the phase-pure Na4V2(PO4)3 product. When paired with a hard carbon anode, the resulting Na4VP‖HC full cell exhibits a high energy density of 251 W h kg−1, which is 58% higher than that of 159 W h kg−1 for the Na3VP‖HC control cell. Our chemical sodiation methodology provides an innovative approach for designing sodium-rich cathode materials and could serve as an impetus to the development of advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Balancing Defects and Microcrystals in Carbon Anodes by Molecular Chemistry Method for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Carbon materials with large capacity and low potential serve as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Carbon defects offer active sites for sodium storage but sacrifice reversibility, whereas carbon microcrystals improve conductivity but may suffer from low capacity. Herein, the balance between defects and microcrystals is realized by the molecular chemistry method of cross-linking and defect repairing. Real-time spectroscopic analyses reveal that the decomposition of tetrabromophthalic anhydride (TBPA) molecule induces the dehydrogenation of pitch to release small gas molecules to form pseudo-closed pores, followed by the cross-linking of C═O bonds in TBPA with the dehydrogenated pitch to form C─O─C bonds and thus suppress the excessive microcrystal growth. Meanwhile, the decomposition products of TBPA can also react with the dehydrogenated pitch to repair carbon defects. Thanks to the microstructure balance, the as-synthesized carbon material exhibits a smoother ion mass transfer channel (d(002) = 0.386 nm, La = 4.56 nm) and a larger storage space (Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.086 cm3 g-1) than the pitch carbon (PC, d(002) = 0.349 nm, La = 5.90 nm, Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.041 cm3 g-1), increasing the capacity from 162.5 to 336.5 mAh g-1. This work sheds a chemical light on regulating carbon material microstructure for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be attractive candidates for large-scale energy storage systems because of their rich earth abundance and consistent performance. However, there are still challenges in developing desirable anode materials that can accommodate rapid and stable insertion/extraction of Na^+ and can exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, the self-assembled hairball-like VS_4 as anodes of SIBs exhibits high discharge capacity (660 and 589 mAh g^−1 at 1 and 3 A g^−1, respectively) and excellent rate property (about 100% retention at 10 and 20 A g^−1 after 1000 cycles) at room temperature. Moreover, the VS_4 can also exhibit 591 mAh g^−1 at 1 A g^−1 after 600 cycles at 0 °C. An unlike traditional mechanism of VS_4 for Na^+ storage was proposed according to the dates of ex situ characterization, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical kinetic analysis. The capacities of the final stabilization stage are provided by the reactions of reversible transformation between Na_2S and S, which were considered the reaction mechanisms of Na–S batteries. This work can provide a basis for the synthesis and application of sulfur-rich compounds in fields of batteries, semiconductor devices, and catalysts. The unique hairball-like VS_4 composed of spiral nanowires was successively constructed through a one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared hairball-like VS_4 exhibits high capacity and long cycle stability for Na^+ storage at room temperature, and it can tolerate drastic temperature changes. The ex situ characterization and electrochemical kinetic analysis reveal that the storage mechanisms of VS_4 changed with the increase in the number of cycles.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as promising energy storage devices in grid-level applications, owing to their largely reduced cost compared with that of lithium-ion batteries. However, the practical application of SIBs has been seriously hindered because of the lack of appropriate anode materials, limited by the thermodynamics perspective, which is one of the central task at current stage. Herein, we have developed a general one-pot strategy for the synthesis of transition-metal phosphide (TMP) based hybrid nanosheets composed of carbon-coated TMP nanoparticles anchored to the surface of nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets. This facile and cost-effective method is quite universal and holds potential to be further extended to other metal phosphide materials. Significantly, the hybrid nanosheet electrode possesses excellent sodium storage properties as anodes for SIBs, including high specific capacity, an ultra-long cycle life and a remarkable rate performance. This work makes a significant contribution to not only the synthetic methodology of TMP-carbon two-dimensional hybrid nanostructures, but also the application of TMP-based anodes for high-energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Coal-based carbons have garnered interest as cost-effective anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their widespread availability and economic practicality. However, the inherent limitations in their microstructure, including insufficient active sites for Na-ion storage, restrict their potential for high-performance applications. Herein, a pitch-assisted coating treatment through confined carbonization is employed to transform open micropores in coal-based activated carbon into closed pores, resulting in more compact and efficient active sites for Na-ion storage. Complementary ex situ Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses elucidate that Na filling within closed pores significantly influences the low-voltage plateau capacity, validating the critical role of closed pores in enhancing sodium storage efficiency. The engineered coal-based carbon anodes demonstrate a sodium storage capacity of 290.0 mAh g-1 and an initial coulombic efficiency of 78.0%, along with exceptional cycling stability and rate performance. In combination with an O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the assembled full cell achieves a remarkable energy density of 251.2 Wh kg-1, determined by using the total mass of the cathode and anode. This work provides novel perspectives on the structural engineering of coal-based carbon materials, establishing a foundation for their commercialization in high-performance SIBs.",

Among all the anode materials for SIBs, metal sulfides/selenides (MXs) have shown inspiring results because of their versatile material species and high theoretical capacity. They suffer from large volume expansion, however, which leads to bad cycling performance. Thus, methods such as carbon modification, nanosize design, electrolyte optimization, and cut‐off voltage control are used to obtain enhanced performance. Here, recent progress on MXs is summarized in terms of arranging the crystal structure, synthesis methods, electrochemical performance, mechanisms, and kinetics. Challenges are presented and effective ways to solve the problems are proposed, and a perspective for future material design is also given. It is hoped that light is shed on the development of MXs to help finally find applications for next‐generation rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Two new structural forms of Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, the layered O3- and P3-forms, were synthesized and comprehensively characterized. Both materials show electrochemical activity as electrodes in Na-ion batteries. During cell charging (desodiation of the Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 cathode), we observed a structural phase transformation of O3-Na0.95Co0.5Ti0.5O2 into P3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, whereas no changes other than conventional unit cell volume shrinkage were detected for P3-Na0.65Co0.5Ti0.5O2. During Na insertion (cell discharging), the reconversion of the P3-form into O3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 was impeded for both materials and occurs well below 1 V versus Na+/Na only. The reconversion is hindered by the charge and spin transfers of Co (LS-Co3+ → HS-Co2+) and by a significant unit cell volume expansion at the P3 → O3 transformation, as revealed from the magnetization, crystallographic, and spectroscopic studies. As the kinetics of such transformations depend on numerous parameters such as time, temperature, and particle size, a large cell overpotential ensues. An extended cutoff voltage at 0.2 V versus Na+/Na during discharging allows to complete the P3 → O3 transformation and increases the specific discharging capacity to 200 mA h g-1. Moreover, a quasi-symmetrical full cell, based on the O3- and P3-forms, was designed, eliminating safety concerns associated with sodium anodes and delivering a discharge capacity of 130 mA h g-1.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), endowed with relatively small Stokes radius and low desolvation energy for Na+, are reckoned as a promising candidate for fast-charging endeavors. However, the C-rate charging capability of practical energy-dense sodium-ion pouch cells is currently limited to ≤1C, due to the high propensity for detrimental metallic Na plating on the hard carbon (HC) anode at elevated rates. Here, an ampere-hour-level sodium-ion pouch cell capable of 3C charging is successfully developed via phosphorus (P)-sulfur (S) interphase chemistry. By rational electrolyte regulation, desired P-S constituents, namely, Na3PO4 and Na2SO4, are generated in the solid-electrolyte interphase with favorable Na+ interface kinetics. Specifically, Na+ desolvation energy barrier has been greatly lowered by the weak ion-solvent coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane on Na3PO4 interphase, while Na2SO4 expedites charge carrier mobility due to its intrinsically high ionic conductivity. Consequently, an energy-dense (126 Wh kg-1) O3-Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2||HC pouch cell capable of 3C charging (100% state of charge) without Na plating can be achieved, with a great capacity retention of 91.5% over 200 cycles. Further, the assembled power-type Na3V2(PO4)3||HC pouch cell displays an impressive fast-charging capability of 50C, which surpasses that of previously reported high-power SIBs. This work serves as an enlightenment for developing fast-charging SIBs.",

Here, the asphalt preoxidation at a specific temperature in the air introduces oxygen‐containing groups to connect the unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon and aromatic side chains, forming a disordered carbon skeleton to inhibit melting and rearrangement during carbonization. The abundant oxygen‐containing groups hinder the growth of the carbon layers during pyrolysis, which promotes the formation of disordered phases and abundant micropores in asphalt‐based hard carbons (HCs). The simultaneous increase in initial coulombic efficiency, capacity, and transport behavior of sodium ions in HCs is achieved by adjusting the carbon layer and micropore evolution. The optimized HCs display excellent initial coulombic efficiency of 86.14% with remarkable reversible capacity of 313.83 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and high‐rate capability with 140 mAh g−1 at 5 C. Pairing with O3‐NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the full cell delivers a higher reversible capacity of 255.7 mAh g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 83.7% and long cycle life.

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances.",

        "abstract": "SnS is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical specific capacity, but the poor intrinsic conductivity, bulk expansion and shuttle effects brought by polysulfides seriously limit its practical use. Here, soft/rigid SnS&TiS2 compounds with carbon nanotubes (ST@CNTs) is designed to overcome the shortcomings. The rigid TiS2, as the strong backbone of SnS&TiS2, relieves the expansion stress caused by SnS after sodiation, together with CNTs improve the materials conductivity. TiS2 generates many sulfur defects under the synergistic effect of SnS, which can regulate the sodium-ion embedding sites to stabilize the compound structure and decrease the sodium-ion diffusion energy barrier. Moreover, rigid TiS2 can adsorb polysulfides induced by SnS, thus suppresses the shuttle effect and improves the cycling and rate performances. Fortunately, the above conclusions are confirmed by the DFT calculations. The ST@CNTs provide a specific capacity of 550 mAh/g at 1.0 A/g after 300 cycles, and a high-rate capability of 443 mAh/g at 2.0 A/g. This soft/rigid misfit strategy combines the advantages of high modulus of rigid layers and high sodium-ion storage capacity of soft layers, which gives an idea for the development of new anode candidates for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion capacitors possess higher energy density than supercapacitors and higher power density than Na-ion batteries. However, kinetic mismatches between fast capacitive charge storage on the cathode and sluggish battery-type reactions on the anode lead to a poor charge/discharge rate capability and insufficient power output of Na-ion capacitors. Thus, developing suitable anode materials for Na-ion capacitors is urgently desirable. This work demonstrates an electrochemically exfoliated graphite (EEG) anode with enhanced capacitive charge storage, greatly boosting the Na-ion reaction kinetics of co-intercalation. The EEG anode shows a high reversible capacity of 109 mAh g-1 and maintains a good capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles. The assembled Na-ion capacitor using the EEG anode can finish the charge/discharge process in less than 10 s, which achieves an ultrahigh power density of 17,500 W kg-1 with an energy density of 17 Wh kg-1. The high capacitive contributions at both the anode and cathode contribute to the fast rate capability and high power output of the fabricated Na-ion capacitors. This work will promote the development of ultrafast charging sodium-ion storage devices.",

TiO_2 is very popular as anode materials for both lithium and sodium ion batteries because of the nontoxicity, safety and great stabilities. However, the low electronic conductivities and inferior sodium ion diffusion make it becoming a great challenge to develop advanced TiO_2 anodes. Doping heteroatoms and incorporation of defects are believed to be great ways to improve the electrochemical performance of TiO_2 anodes. In this work, commercial TiO_2 (P25) nanoparticles was modified by hydrogen and nitrogen high-power plasma resulting in a disordered surface layer formation and nitrogen doping as well. The electrochemical performances of the samples as anode materials for sodium ion batteries was measured and the results indicated that after the hydrogen–nitrogen plasma treatment, H–N-TiO_2 electrode shows a 43.5% of capacity higher than the P-TiO_2 after 400 cycles long-term discharge/charge process, and the samples show a good long cycling stability as well, the Coulombic efficiencies of all samples are nearly 99% after 50 cycles which could be sustained to the end of long cycling. In addition, hydrogen–nitrogen plasma treated TiO_2 electrode reached the stable high Coulombic efficiency earlier than the pristine material. High resolution TEM images and XPS results indicate that there is a disordered surface layer formed after the plasma treatment, by which defects (oxygen vacancies) and N-doping are also introduced into the crystalline structure. All these contribute to the enhancement of the electrochemical performance.",

In this study, the intercalation technique for nitrogen-doped carbon layers is implemented for the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2/NC) structure to improve the rate and cycling stability of SIBs by increasing the diffusion rate of sodium ions and mitigating excessive volume structural expansion. The as-synthesized MoS2/NC anode has a high discharge specific capacity of 546 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 160 cycles, as well as a high rate and stable cycle performance of 406 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.

One of the key obstacles to sodium batteries is the lack of efficient and stable anode materials.

In this work, two molecules (Na-CPN and Na-CPP) were synthesized and used as anode materials for SIBs. Structurally, the two compounds are isomers, and they are distinguished by the position of N atoms in phenylpyridine. Na-CPP provides a high reversible capacity of 197 mAh g -1 , excitingly, its capacity could maintain 99.1% even after 350 cycles of 100 mA g -1 . Moreover, after going through 1200 cycles at a current density of 5C, the Na-CPP electrode still retain a capacity rate of 89.9%. These results are impressive. In contrast, Na-CPN exhibited inferior capacity performance and rate performance for its larger polarization, particle size and charge transporting resistance.",

All-solid-state ferroelectric-engineered composite electrolyte could improve the electrolyte–electrode interfacial stability as well as the interfacial ion conduction of the Na-ion battery using the NVP anode. Outstanding cyclic stability has been achieved in the all-solid-state Na-ion battery using the NVP anode, with a capacity fading rate as low as 0.005% per cycle. Symmetric Na-ion cells using the NASICON-structured electrodes could simplify the manufacturing process, reduce the cost, facilitate the recycling post-process, and thus attractive in the field of large-scale stationary energy storage. However, the long-term cycling performance of such batteries is usually poor. This investigation reveals the unavoidable side reactions between the NASICON-type Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 (NVP) anode and the commercial liquid electrolyte, leading to serious capacity fading in the symmetric NVP//NVP cells. To resolve this issue, an all-solid-state composite electrolyte is used to replace the liquid electrolyte so that to overcome the side reaction and achieve high anode/electrolyte interfacial stability. The ferroelectric engineering could further improve the interfacial ion conduction, effectively reducing the electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistances. The NVP//NVP cell using the ferroelectric-engineered composite electrolyte can achieve a capacity retention of 86.4% after 650 cycles. Furthermore, the electrolyte can also be used to match the Prussian-blue cathode Na_ x Fe_ y Fe(CN)_6− z ·nH_2O (NFFCN).

The results show that the hard carbon cross-linked with oxy-hybrid (HCO) possesses affluent micropores (0.5∼0.9 nm) and groups of carbonyls (C = O). The micropores can accelerate the plateau capacity, while the C = O can induce the formation of inorganic rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to promote initial coulombic efficiency (ICE).

The general sodium metal anode (SMA), for example, suffers from an unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which may induce severe dendrite growth and continuous Na consumption, particularly under high rates. At the same time, the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) of a widely adopted cathode material Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has to tolerate the massive volume changes during the rapid Na+ ion intercalation/extraction, resulting in structural degradations and the capacity loss. Here, a facile strategy is reported by introducing aluminum ethoxide to a conventional ether‐based electrolyte, to promote the formation of an alumina‐rich SEI and CEI, which facilitates the rapid Na+ ion transport across the interface and promotes the uniform Na deposition. The resultant Na || Na symmetric cell demonstrates a stable cycling of 4800 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2, and a Na || NVP full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81.28% after 6000 cycles at 40C.

The heterostructure constructed by MnSe and FeSe nanocrystals induces the formation of built-in electric fields, accelerating electron transfer and ion diffusion, thereby improving reaction kinetics. In addition, carbon enclosure can buffer the volumetric stress and enhance the electrical conductivity. These aspects cooperatively endow the anode with superior cycling stability and distinguished rate performance. Specifically, the discharge capacity of MnSe-FeSe@C reaches 414.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 388.8 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 5.0 A g−1. In addition, it still retains a high reversible capacity of 449.2 mA h g−1 after 700 long cycles at 1.0 A g−1. Further, the ab initio calculation has been employed to authenticate the existence of the built-in electric field by Bader charge, indicating that 0.24 electrons in MnSe were transferred to FeSe.

        "abstract": "The unique coordination configuration of single‐atom materials (SAMs) allows precise reaction control at atomic‐level and a potential of unusual electrochemical reaction. Nevertheless, it is a big challenge to prepare main group element with high loading content. Here, multifield‐regulated synthesis (MRS) technology is utilized to rapidly produce single‐atom antimony (Sb) metal with a high loading of 15 wt.%. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the significantly enhanced reaction kinetics of Sb and nitrogen‐doped graphene by multi‐physics field coupling. Compared with common metallic Sb nanoparticles, atomically dispersed Sb displays remarkably improved electrochemical reaction kinetics and stable structure due to the negligible variation of stresses and volume expansion during the pseudocapacitive alloying‐dealloying process. Such extraordinary alloying reaction in well‐dispersed Sb atoms enabling homogeneous ion flow can serve as active nucleation sites for regulating even Na metal nucleation and growth. As a result, copper foil coated with only ≈3 µm thickness of such material exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.99%, an ultra‐low overpotential of 3 mV, and a long lifetime exceeding 2500 h in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, an anode‐free MRS‐SbSA||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery is constructed, which demonstrates exceptionally high energy density (≈362 Wh Kg−1), outstanding rate capability and good cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Developing sodium ion battery (SIB) anode materials of a low-cost and high-capacity nature for future large-scale applications still involves challenges. Herein, we have reported gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) as a novel SIB anode material for the first time. Ga2S3 nanorods have been synthesized via the facile hydrothermal preparation of a GaOOH precursor with subsequent H2S annealing. Mixed with graphene upon electrode preparation, this Ga2S3 electrode maintains a reversible specific capacity of 476 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.4 A g-1, with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Ex situ XRD analysis and theoretical calculations are employed to comprehensively elucidate the detailed sodium ion storage mechanism of Ga2S3, which is composed of initial Na+ intercalation, a subsequent multi-step conversion reaction between S and Na+, and an eventual alloying reaction between Ga and Na+ with the end product of Na7Ga13. Further kinetics analysis has demonstrated that the conversion reaction is the rate-limiting step due to a multi-step reaction with the intermediate phase of GaS. Moreover, the appearance of liquid metal Ga, as confirmed via TEM observations and theoretical calculations, can serve as a self-healing agent that repairs cracks in the electrode. Our findings shed light on the further design of Ga-based materials, and they also can be extended to solid-state-battery systems.",

The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations.

The porous carbon material (KHCO3-GT-700) obtained through KHCO3 activation followed by pyrolysis exhibits remarkably high specific surface area, large layer spacing, abundant defect sites, and a well-developed micro/mesoporous structure.

        "abstract": "The development of anode materials is critical to the success of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Because of the size difference between Li and Na, the commercial anode material graphite in Li-ion batteries does not work for Na-ion batteries. Thus, it will be ideal if some universal anode materials could work for both Li- and Na-ion batteries with high performance. Inspired by a recent study on the high performance of a 2D-Si2BN sheet as an anode material for Li-ion batteries, we design a three dimensional (3D) porous structure by using the nanoribbons of a Si2BN sheet as building blocks. Based on the state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, we find that the resulting 3D porous Si2BN structure is stable chemically, dynamically and thermally, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 512.42 (341.61 mA h g-1), a low voltage of 0.27 V (0.15 V), a small volume expansion of 2.5% (2.7%), and a low migration energy barrier of 0.44 eV (0.19 eV) for Li- (Na-) ion batteries. These intriguing features, together with the light mass and rich abundance of Si, B and N, suggest that the 3D porous Si2BN structure is a promising candidate for the anode material of both Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na-DK) is applied to realize dual-function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen-containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven-membered rings for quasi-metallic sodium in HC. The as-formed sodium induces robust NaF-rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles. This work provides in-depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium‐ion batteries due to its low cost, relatively low working voltage, and satisfactory specific capacity. However, it still remains a challenge to obtain a high‐performance hard carbon anode from cost‐effective carbon sources. In addition, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is subjected to continuous rupture during battery cycling, leading to fast capacity decay. Herein, a lignin‐based hard carbon with robust SEI is developed to address these issues, effectively killing two birds with one stone. An innovative gas‐phase removal‐assisted aqueous washing strategy is developed to remove excessive sodium in the precursor to upcycle industrial lignin into high‐value hard carbon, which demonstrated an ultrahigh sodium storage capacity of 359 mAh g−1. It is found that the residual sodium components from lignin on hard carbon act as active sites that controllably regulate the composition and morphology of SEI and guide homogeneous SEI growth by a near‐shore aggregation mechanism to form thin, dense, and organic‐rich SEI. Benefiting from these merits, the as‐developed SEI shows fast Na+ transfer at the interphases and enhanced structural stability, thus preventing SEI rupture and reformation, and ultimately leading to a comprehensive improvement in sodium storage performance.",

NiSe_2-reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-C composite nanofibers are successfully prepared via electrospinning and a subsequent selenization process. The electrospun nanofibers giving rise to these porous-structured composite nanofibers with optimum amount of amorphous C are obtained from the polystyrene to polyacrylonitrile ratio of 1/4. These composite nanofibers also consist of uniformly distributed single-crystalline NiSe_2 nanocrystals that have a mean size of 27 nm.

The initial discharge capacities of the NiSe_2-rGO-C composite and bare NiSe_2 nanofibers at a current density of 200 mA g^−1 are 717 and 755 mA h g^−1, respectively. However, the respective 100^th-cycle discharge capacities of the former and latter are 468 and 35 mA h g^−1.

        "abstract": "Hard carbons (HCs) are widely used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their availability, ease of synthesis, and low cost. HCs can store Na ions between stacked sp^2-layers of carbon and micropores. In this work, hard carbons are synthesized from 1 M, 2 M, 3 M, 4 M, and 5 M dextrose solutions by hydrothermal synthesis followed by high-temperature calcination at 1100 °C in an argon atmosphere. Among all hard carbons derived from different concentrations of dextrose solutions, hard carbon derived from 3 M dextrose solution delivers superior electrochemical performance compared to other hard carbons. Hard carbon derived from 3 M dextrose solution (DHC-3 M) provides an initial reversible capacity of 273 mAh g^−1 with a capacity retention of 82% at the end of 100 charge–discharge cycles at 30 mA g^−1. Further, high-rate charge–discharge cycling at 200 mA g^−1 shows an initial capacity of 200 mAh g^−1 and retains over 61% capacity at the end of 500 cycles. The improved capacity of DHC-3 M is due to the higher d-spacing value and more disorderness, which improve the plateau region capacity due to the intercalation of Na^+ in the carbon matrix. Besides, 3 M dextrose-derived hard carbons are less agglomerated than other concentrations and show less charge transfer resistance before and after cycling, resulting in improved electrochemical performance.

However, the inevitable side reactions between Na metal anode and electrolyte, the formation of Na dendrite during cycling, and the uneven electric field distribution at the interface will lead to a decrease in the cycling stability of the battery. Herein, N and S co‐doped carbon dots are employed as electrolyte additives in view of their quantum size, excellent dispersion, and polar surface functional groups. It is found that the quantum‐sized carbon core and sodiophilic surface functional groups of N,S‐CDs enable the homogenous deposition of Na+ and the involvement of N,S‐CDs in the formation of solid electrolyte film. The N,S‐CDs co‐deposition guarantees the uniform sodium plating in the initial cycle, avoiding the routine dendrite growth. The strength and stability of SEI are boosted with the assistance of inorganics such as Na3N and Na2S, which accelerate the transport of Na+ flux and realize rapid charge transfer at the interface, ensuring high reversibility of sodium ion plating/stripping.

However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (−40 °C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na‐ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790 h (0.5 mA cm−2/1 mAh cm−2) in carbonate‐based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at −40 °C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/0.5 mAh cm−2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at −40 °C.

Here we report additive strategies by using the additives sodium difluoro(oxalato) borate (NaDFOB) or/and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in the baseline electrolyte solution of 1 M NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate to overcome these issues. For the SMB with sodium anode and carbon‐coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, a stable cell cycling up to 600 cycles (capacity retention about 96±3 %) was reached by using only 1–2 wt. % NaDFOB, compared to only less than 75 cycles of the baseline electrolyte. Sodium plating/stripping tests, voltammetry measurements, impedance analysis as well as cell tests were performed in order to reveal the electrochemical characteristics of the electrolytes including additive effects. The optimal SIB cell performance in cells containing hard carbon and NVP was achieved by using 2 wt.‐% NaDFOB.

        "abstract": "Designing hierarchical porous structures is widely recognized as an effective strategy to improve ion transport and create active sites for disordered carbon anodes of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, hierarchical porous hard carbon (hp‐HC) is synthesized using zinc acetate as a templating agent. The hierarchical porous structure facilitates effective Na+ ion storage with a high reversible capacity of 327 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Notably, the sodium storage behavior is capacitance‐dominated, with the capacity primarily characterized by slope capacity. Additionally, the hp‐HC retains 94.5% of its capacity after 6000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. This work provides a convenient route for manipulating pore types, which is of great significance for developing high‐capacity hard carbon electrodes for enhanced sodium‐ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as highly promising and economically viable alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale energy storage systems and light electric vehicles. Optimizing anode materials is crucial for enhancing the energy density and cycling stability of SIBs. In this study, a coherent SnO2-coated BaTiO3 nanosphere composite with carbon package dispersed inside porous carbon network (PC/C@SnO2@BaTiO3) is introduced as SIBs anode, which was synthesized by two-step hydrothermal method and calcination process with NaCl template. The piezoelectric effect of BaTiO3 during charge-discharge process can raise electron conductivity and ion diffusion rate in the as-formed composite. The porous carbon network outside not only strengthens the structure of the anode material but also increases the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte with the improving conductivity and Na+ diffusion rate, thereby enhancing the kinetic and electrochemical properties of the active material. After 300 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, the PC/C@SnO2@BaTiO3 composite retains a capacity of 372.8 mAh g−1 from the initial 454.5 mAh g−1, and can still exhibit outstanding rate characteristics with a capacity of 176.3 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 300 cycles. The results show the PC/C@SnO2@BaTiO3 composite has great promise as anode-active material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Tin-based materials possess a high-capacity as a potential anode for Na-ion batteries (SIBs), but the inferior electric conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics limit their further development. In this paper, we have successfully constructed multiphase structure SnO2/SnS/SnS2 by combining the electrochemical induction and in-situ hydrothermal method to effectively alleviate these problems. The continuous addition of sulfur source (thioacetamide, TAA) results in the formation of a transition from pure product (SnO2) to double structure (SnO2/SnS), and finally multiphase structure (SnO2/SnS/SnS2). Compared to single or bimetal chalcogenides, the tri-metal chalcogenides have strengthened synergistic effects between diverse components. Additionally, the SnO2/SnS/SnS2 composites exhibit small grain size and abundant mesoporous structure, which aid to shorten the distance of ions transfer and increase surface active sites for Na-ions storage. The SnO2/SnS/SnS2 anode displays optimal diffusion coefficient (1.94 × 10−15 cm2 s−1) and cycling durability, with a recoverable specific discharge ability of 401 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and a maintenance overpasses 77 %.

        "abstract": "The prospects of sodium (Na) metal batteries have been fatally plagued by interfacial Na dendrites, mainly affected by preferred nucleation on the metal anode and the steep gradient of Na ions in the electrolyte, leading to limited Coulombic efficiency and short lifespans. Herein, an electrochemically inert potassium-based Na-K alloy demonstrates a liquid alloying diffusion mechanism that enables dendrite-free Na anodes. The extremely small Na fluctuation and flexible Na-K bonds in the liquid alloy phase bring isotropic nucleation of Na upon electroplating/stripping, which is directly observed by in situ optical imaging. Spontaneously, serving as (de)sodiation buffer with faster electron/mass transportation, the liquid inertia also provides attenuated concentration distribution of Na. Significantly, a record capacity retention of approximately 100% is rendered when coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes (ca. 2 mg cm-2) over 500 cycles at 10C, advancing the possibility of using liquid alloy for stable metal anodes beyond Na storage systems.",

The environmental impacts upon organic anode synthesis were quantified according to cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA).

This is due to the formation of GexSb1-x at the surface leading to better diffusion of Na, and the formation of a stable twin organic and inorganic SEI which protects the electrode. By judicious control of the surface modification, an improvement in the capacity to between 50% and 300% has been achieved at high current densities (0.83-8.4 A g(-1)) in an ionic liquid electrolyte NaFSI-[Py1,4]FSI.

Introducing element S into MoSe2 crystal structure can enhance the electron and ion transportation and lift the ability of MoSe2 to store Na+; the presence of Se can expand the interlayer spacing in contrast to MoS2. Moreover, carbon composition can also favor the electrical conductivity and the rigid micro/nanostructure is better for preventing the stacking of MoS0.74Se1.26 nanoflakes.

However, their service life, especially at high specific density, is hindered by the undesirable reversibility of metal anodes, owing to the inhomogeneous ion distribution and awkward charge transfer dynamics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, it is well demonstrated that ferroelectric phase BaTiO3 reinforced Na3 Zr2 Si2 PO12 ceramic electrolyte can deconcentrate the distribution of charge transfer and self-accelerate Na+ migration at the Na/Na3 Zr2 Si2 PO12 interface upon cycling, realizing a compact Na deposition morphology together with a high critical current density (1.05 mA cm-2 at ambient conditions). Assembled symmetric cells based on the proposed composite electrolyte render stable cycling up to 1000 h at 0.3 mA cm-2 . Specifically, the all solid-state sodium metal batteries paired with Na3 V1.5 Cr0.5 (PO4 )3 cathode material can deliver a capacity of 95 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and maintain 84.4% of the initial capacity after 400 cycles.

We have investigated the relative performance of novel intrinsically metallic h-BSi3 (BS) sheet as an anode for SIBs, compared to LIBs, through Density Functional Theory studies. Our calculations show that BS has higher chemisorption interactions with Na than Li atoms while drawing substantial electron densities from both, turning them into cations. BS is able to reach a high specific capacity of 1127.62 mA h g-1 for Na, while only as half of that for Li, at ambient temperatures ranging 300-600 K. The moderate sodiation (0.77 V) and lithiation (0.79 V) voltages facilitate BS to prevent the SEI layer formation, metal plating and harmful dendrite growth and to maintain good energy density. BS retains good electronic and ionic conductivities after hosting both Na and Li adatoms, while the former diffuses with about as half the barriers as those of the latter, supporting faster charge/discharge rate and greater preservation of storage capacities in high current densities when BS is used as an anode in SIBs. Na adsorptions cause relatively lower structural deformations to BS, and refrain from forming clusters, leading to good cyclic stability. The superior electrochemical performance of Na, thus, makes BS a potential anode material for SIBs.",

Finally, variable temperature Raman spectroscopy is employed in-situ to test the changes of ZVO with increasing temperature aiming to assess the effect of cooling rate on the ZVO. This work establishes a suitable ZVO anode for SIBs and highlights the formidable energy storage potential in a competitive landscape.",

        "abstract": "Developing supermechanically resilient hard carbon materials that can quickly accommodate sodium ions is highly demanded in fabricating durable anodes for wearable sodium-ion batteries. Here, an interconnected spiral nanofibrous hard carbon fabric with both remarkable resiliency (e.g., recovery rate as high as 1200 mm s-1 ) and high Young's modulus is reported. The hard carbon nanofabrics are prepared by spinning and then carbonizing the reaction product of polyacrylonitrile and polar molecules (melamine). The resulting unique hard carbon possesses a highly disordered carbonaceous structure with enlarged interlayer spacing contributed from the strong electrostatic repulsion of dense pyrrolic nitrogen atoms. Its excellent resiliency remains after intercalation/deintercalation of sodium ions. The outstanding sodium-storage performance of the derived anode includes excellent gravimetric capacity, high-power capability, and long-term cyclic stability. More significantly, with a high loading mass, the hard carbon anode displays a high-power capacity (1.05 mAh cm-2 at 2 A g-1 ) and excellent cyclic stability. This study provides a unique strategy for the design and fabrication of new hard carbon materials for advanced wearable energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "To solve large volume change and low conductivity of Bi2S3-based anodes, a coordination regulation strategy is proposed to prepare Bi2S3 nanoparticles dispersed in carbon fiber (Bi2S3@CNF) composites. It has been discovered that introducing trimesic acid as a ligand can significantly improve the loading and dispersion of Bi3+ in polyacrylonitrile fibers. The results exhibit that Bi2S3 nanoparticles of 200-300 nm are uniformly anchored on the superficial surface layer of CNFs, and Bi2S3 nanoparticles of about 20 nm are evenly dispersed in the interior of CNFs. Assessed as sodium-ion batteries' anode material, the discharge capacity of the Bi2S3@CNF anode in the second cycle is 669.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and still retains 620.2 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles, with the capacity retention rate of 92.7%. Even at 0.5 A g-1, the specific capacity of the second cycle is 432.99 mAh g-1, which still keeps 400.9 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles, with a retention rate of 92.5%. The excellent cycle stability is mainly attributed to the uniform distribution of small Bi2S3 nanoparticles in CNFs providing abundant active sites, preventing side reactions, relieving volume expansion, improving the electrical conductivity, and accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics.",

        "abstract": "Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H‐NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H‐NTO anode to stably operate for 80 000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H‐NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at −40 °C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co‐intercalation behavior in ether‐based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long‐cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.",

        "abstract": "Robust interfaces in anodes play a crucial role in boosting sodium-ion battery (SIB) performance. However, the fragile interfaces constructed by a two-step synthesis or artificial stack are prone to be destroyed during the charging/discharging processes, which significantly reduces the lifetime of SIBs. Here, a facile construction strategy is developed to produce robust interfaces in hollow sphere-like CoSe2/nitrogen-doped carbon (HS-CoSe2/NC) using intrinsic Co, N, C in metal-organic framework as precursors, which enhance the electron/ion diffusion kinetics. In parallel, the hollow sphere structure of CoSe2/NC contributes to shortening the sodium-ion diffusion distance and guaranteeing structure stability. Benefiting from the unique design, ultrahigh reversible specific capacity (456.6 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1) is maintained even after 7250 cycles with a supreme capacity retention (96.6%). The sodium-ion storage mechanism is clarified by combining theoretical calculations and in situ/ex situ experimental characterizations. This work provides a new pathway to build robust interfaces in anodes for boosting SIBs performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted great interest for large‐scale electric energy storage in recent years. However, anodes with long cycle life and large reversible capacities are still lacking and therefore limiting the development of SIBs. Here, a bulk Bi anode with surprisingly high Na storage performance in combination with glyme‐based electrolytes is reported. This study shows that the bulk Bi electrode is gradually developed into a porous integrity during initial cycling, which is totally different from that in carbonate‐based electrolytes and ensures facile Na+ transport and structural stability. The achievable capacity of bulk Bi in the NaPF6‐diglyme electrolyte is high up to 400 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention is 94.4% after 2000 cycles, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.0028% per cycle. It exhibits two flat discharge/charge plateaus at 0.67/0.77 and 0.46/0.64 V, ascribed to the typical two‐phase reactions of Bi ↔ NaBi and NaBi ↔ Na3Bi, respectively. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique porous integrity, stable solid electrolyte interface, and good electrode wettability of glymes. This interplay between electrolyte and electrode to boost Na storage performance will pave a new pathway for high‐performance SIBs.",

The interspacing between the graphene layers in the anthracite structure also increased after the heat treatment. Besides, on extending the heating time, the anthracite structure became more disordered than the samples heated for shorter times. Therefore, the intercalation ability of Na+ ions in the anthracite structure increased, and the sample heated at 900 °C for 6 hours exhibited the highest reversible capacity of up to 160 mA h g−1 with adequate capacity retention after 100 cycles at C/10 rate.",

Three different chemical reagents, i.e., H3BO3, K2CO3 and KOH, are also utilized to prepare chemically activated pinecone-derived carbons separately. When treated as an anode in lithium-ion batteries, the template-assisted pinecone-derived carbon (PDC-T) provides excellent discharge capacities of 822.8 and 272.1 mAh g−1 beyond 500 cycles at current densities of 100 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively.

Additionally, a full cell is constructed to validate the potential applications of pinecone-derived carbons in lithium-ion batteries with long-term cycling stability. In sodium-ion battery, the PDC-T anode delivers superior discharge capacity of 338.9 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1.

        "abstract": "The lithium and sodium storage performances of SnS anode often undergo rapid capacity decay and poor rate capability owing to its huge volume fluctuation and structural instability upon the repeated charge/discharge processes. Herein, a novel and versatile method is described for in situ synthesis of ultrathin SnS nanosheets inside and outside hollow mesoporous carbon spheres crosslinked reduced graphene oxide networks. Thus, 3D honeycomb-like network architecture is formed. Systematic electrochemical studies manifest that this nanocomposite as anode material for lithium-ion batteries delivers a high charge capacity of 1027 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the as-developed nanocomposite still retains a charge capacity of 524 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium-ion batteries. In addition, the electrochemical kinetics analysis verifies the basic principles of enhanced rate capacity. The appealing electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries can be mainly related to the porous 3D interconnected architecture, in which the nanoscale SnS nanosheets not only offer decreased ion diffusion pathways and fast Li+ /Na+ transport kinetics, but also the 3D interconnected conductive networks constructed from the hollow mesoporous carbon spheres and reduced graphene oxide enhance the conductivity and ensure the structural integrity.",

This study proposes a novel conversion reaction using CoSnO3 (CSO) nanocubes uniformly wrapped in graphene nanosheets, which are fabricated using a wet-chemical strategy followed by low-temperature heat treatment. This optimized composite exhibits durable cyclability and high-rate capability, attributing to the strong interaction between reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and CSO through its surface oxygen moieties. It develops a facile conversion reaction route, thereby leading to SnO2 formation during charging. This interactive phenomenon further contributes to improving the reaction kinetics and restraining the volume expansion during cycling.

Alloying-type bismuth (Bi) offers a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 3800 mAh/cm3 and superb rate capability but suffers from large volume expansion (∼244%) and undesirable structural pulverization. Herein, a hectogram-scale Bi-inlaid carbon skeleton (GC-Bi) composite was synthesized through a facile precipitation-carbonization method using low-cost industrial-grade chemical reagents. The as-prepared GC-Bi composite features a unique particle-nested-bulk architecture, achieving a high tap-density of 3.33 g/cm3, which is approximately 4.16 times greater than that of commercial HC. Besides, the carbon sheath enhances the electronic conductivity and accommodates the substantial volume swelling of the embedded Bi particles, contributing to the formation of a thin and stable solid electrolyte interface on the electrode. Consequently, the GC-Bi anode achieves a high volumetric capacity (1123 mAh/cm3), impressive rate capability (207.8 mAh/g at 80 A/g), together with long cyclability retaining 96.5% of its capacity after 5000 cycles in a Na//GC-Bi half-cell and 78% after 800 cycles in a GC-Bi//Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cell.",

However, its intrinsic defects and impurities will lead to battery failure, diminishing further development of sodium batteries in energy storage. Here, an acrylonitrile copolymer and poly(ethylene oxide) (LA/PEO) composite binder is developed to address these challenges in biomass-derived hard carbon. Typical commercial biomass-derived hard carbon with this binder (HC-LA/PEO) achieved an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 91.1% and a reversible capacity of 341.12 mAh g-1, superior to most of binders currently used. When transition metal ion impurities exist in hard carbon, the HC-LA/PEO shows better tolerance and even shows a higher reversible capacity than its high purity counterpart. After function-oriented design, due to hydrogen bonding and polar interaction, the HC-LA/PEO demonstrated superior initial efficiency and reversible capacity while enhancing mechanical strength and reducing electrode brittleness. In addition, this composite binder induced a more uniform and stable SEI layer on hard carbon, improving interfacial stability and ion transport efficiency. The LA/PEO binder acts as an intelligent gatekeeper mitigating the adverse effects from intrinsic defects and impurities, consequently, gives full play to the biomass-derived hard carbon in sodium batteries.",

        "abstract": "A major factor in classifying carbon materials is their degree of graphitization, which is defined as a structural transition from an amorphous to an ordered crystalline state. Previous studies have shown that graphitization depends on the intrinsic properties of precursors for carbon materials. Thus, these studies on graphitization have been mainly limited to modulating precursors. Herein, we demonstrate the degree of graphitization that can be governed by a stabilization process using polyethylene (PE) as a single precursor, as PE is a non-graphitizable material. PE is stabilized by e-beam irradiation and subsequent thermal oxidation or sulfuric acid treatments to investigate the effects of stabilization methods. The resulting thermally and acid-stabilized PEs are graphitized up to 2,000 °C, and surprisingly, they diverge from a single precursor into soft and hard carbons, respectively. We also confirm that laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical tool for revealing the different structures of thermally and acid-stabilized PEs at the early stage of graphitization based on the formation patterns of carbon cluster ions. In addition, the distinct electrochemical performances of soft and hard carbons are investigated by applying them as anode materials into sodium ion batteries, respectively. We believe that this study provides fundamental insights and practical tools to develop tailor-made carbon materials from a single and common precursor.",

However, current commercially available anode materials as active materials for lithium-/sodium-ion batteries generally suffer from large volume changes and poor rate performance. In response, we synthesized defect-rich N, S co-doped two dimensional (2D) nanosheet-assembled porous carbon microspheres (N, S-PCS) via simple hydrothermal, carbonization and etching process based on the principle of Schiff base reaction. The N, S-PCS structure is thus constructed by removing Fe_7S_8 nanoparticles from the carbon skeleton to form porous microspheres with N, S doping. Therefore, the micromorphology characteristic, pore structure and electro-conductivity of carbon materials are effectively optimized via heteroatom doping and surface engineering. As expected, the prepared N, S-PCS electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. For lithium-ion batteries, it achieves reversible capacities of 1045 and 237 mAh g^−1 at 0.1 and 20 A g^−1, respectively. For sodium-ion batteries, it shows good cycling stability with a capacity of 157 mAh g^−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g^−1. Experimental and theoretical calculation results confirm that the N, S co-doping strategies help to improve the structural stability, shorten the ion diffusion paths, and promote the reaction kinetics, thus achieving excellent electrochemical performance. This work is instructive for the practical application of nonmetal doping functionalized porous carbon structures for metal-ion batteries. 碳基负极材料具有成本低、来源广、电导率高、形态易控制等 特点, 被广泛应用于各种电池储能系统中. 然而, 目前市售的作为锂/钠 离子电池活性材料的负极材料普遍存在体积变化大、倍率性能差的问 题. 为此, 我们根据希夫碱反应原理, 通过简单的水热、碳化和刻蚀工 艺, 合成了由二维纳米片组装而成的N、S共掺杂多孔碳微球(N、SPCS).

        "title": "Increasing Accessible Subsurface to Improving Rate Capability and Cycling Stability of Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported that the enhancement of rate capability of carbonaceous anode by heteroatom doping is due to the increased diffusion‐controlled capacity induced by expanding interlayer spacing. However, percentage of diffusion‐controlled capacity is less than 30% as scan rate is larger than 1 mV s−1, suggesting there is inaccuracy in recognizing principle of improving rate capability of carbonaceous anode. In this paper, it is found that the heteroatom doping has little impact on interlayer spacing of carbon in bulk phase, meaning that diffusion‐controlled capacity is hard to be enhanced by doping. After synergizing with tensile stress, however, the interlayer spacing in subsurface region is obviously expanded to 0.40 nm, which will increase the thickness of accessible subsurface region at high current density. So SRNDC‐700 electrodes display a high specific capacity of 160.6 and 69.5 mAh g−1 at 20 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Additionally, the high reversibility of carbon structure insures ultralong cycling stability and hence attenuation of SRNDC‐700 is only 0.0025% per cycle even at 10 A g−1 for 6000 cycles. This report sheds new insight into mechanism of improving electrochemical performance of carbonaceous anode by doping and provides a novel design concept for doping carbon.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional layered materials commonly face hindered electron transfer and poor structure stability, thus limiting their application in high-rate and long-term sodium ion batteries. In the current study, we adopt finite element simulation to guide the rational design of nanostructures. By calculating the von Mises stress distribution of a series of carbon materials, we find that the hollow biconcave structure could effectively alleviate the stress concentration resulting from expansion. Accordingly, we propose a biconcave-alleviated strategy based on the Aspergillus niger-derived carbon (ANDC) to construct ANDC/MoS2 with a hollow biconcave structure. The ANDC/MoS2 is endowed with an excellent long-term cyclability as an anode of sodium ion batteries, delivering a discharge capacity of 496 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. A capacity retention rate of 94.5% is achieved, an increase of almost seven times compared with the bare MoS2 nanosheets. Even at a high current density of 5 A g-1, a reversible discharge capacity around 400 mAh g-1 is maintained after 300 cycles. ANDC/MoS2 could also be used for efficient lithium storage. By using in situ TEM, we further reveal that the hollow biconcave structure of ANDC/MoS2 has enabled stable and fast sodiation/desodiation.",

        "abstract": "We report the fabrication of 3D flower-like MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth as a binder-free anode for sodium ion battery. Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the ALD TiO2 layer can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of MoS2. The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",

More types of niobium-based oxides are prepared in order to provide more candidates for anode materials.

Arborescent Zn3Nb2O8 particles (Zn3Nb2O8-A) and stump-like Zn3Nb2O8 particles (Zn3Nb2O8-B) have been prepared by solid-state and solvothermal methods, respectively. Benefiting from the microsized stump-like structure and the exposure of the (110) facet, Zn3Nb2O8-B delivers superior long-term cycling stability with a 139.6% capacity retention (291.8 mA h g−1) over 650 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and a large reversible specific capacity of 91.4 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the Zn3Nb2O8-B electrode exhibits outstanding cycling stability (100.1 mA h g−1 with 94.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles at 0.5 A g−1) in sodium-ion batteries. The excellent electrochemical performance of the stump-like Zn3Nb2O8-B materials can be attributed to the exposure of the (110) facet, enlarged interlayer spacing, small charge transfer resistance, and high pseudocapacitive contribution. Therefore, Zn3Nb2O8-B has great application prospects as an anode material for lithium/sodium-ion storage.",

        "abstract": "The low-cost and profusion of sodium reserves make Na-ion batteries (NIBs) a potential candidate to lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage applications. NaVOPO4 has been recognized as one of the most promising cathodes for high-energy NIBs, owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, their further application is hindered by the multiphase transition and conductivity confinement. Herein, we proposed a feasible, one-step hydrothermal synthesis to regulate the synthesis of α-NaVOPO4 with controlled morphologies. The electrochemical properties of the NaVOPO4 electrode can be significantly enhanced taking Ketjen black (KB) as the optimized conductive carbon. Besides, combining with the nanocrystallization and construction of the conductive framework via high-energy ball milling, taking KB as the conductive carbon, the as-prepared NaVOPO4/5%KB exhibits superior Na-storage performance (140.2 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 84.8% over 1000 cycles at 10 C) to the original NaVOPO4 (128.5 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 83.1% over 1000 cycles at 10 C). Moreover, the aqueous full cell with NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode delivers a capacity of 114.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C (141 W h kg-1 energy density) and 80.6% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 5 C. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the nanosized structural and enhanced interfacial effect, which could be rewarding to construct electron transportation tunnels, thus speeding up the Na+-diffusion kinetics. The modified strategy provides an efficient approach to intensify the electrochemical performance, which exhibits potential application of the NaVOPO4 cathode for NIBs.",

Challenges with material properties remain, however, particularly with regards the performance of anodes. We report a rapid, energy-efficient ionic liquid synthesis method for mixed phase Na2Ti3O7 and Na2Ti6O13 rods. This method is based on a novel phase-transfer route which produces pure functional materials via a dehydrated IL. The structure of the synthesised materials was characterised using powder X-ray diffraction, which confirms the formation of a mixed Na2Ti3O7 and Na2Ti6O13 phase, with majority Na2Ti3O7 phase, in contrast to previous synthesis methods. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals a rod morphology, with an average diameter and length of 87 nm ± 3 nm and 1.37 μm ± 0.07 μm, respectively. The initial discharge and charge capacity of Na2Ti3O7 nanorods were measured as 325.20 mA h g-1 and 149.07 mA h g-1, respectively, at 10 mA g-1 between 0.01-2.5 V. We attribute the enhanced performance to the higher weight fraction of Na2Ti3O7 phase vs. previous reports, demonstrating the potential of the ionic liquid method when applied to sodium titanate materials.",

Owing to the catalytic graphitization of Co and the introduction of nitrogen-functional groups, the hard carbon shows structural merits of ordered expanded graphitic layers, hierarchical porous channels, and large surface area. Applying in the anode of lithium/sodium-ion batteries, the large surface area and the existence of nitrogen functional groups can improve the specific capacity by surface adsorption and faradic reaction, while the hierarchical porous channels and expanded graphitic layers can provide facilitate pathways for electrolyte and improve the rate performance.

        "abstract": "Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion‐solvent binding energy for high‐voltage or low‐temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly‐reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with ─CH2─ units, the low‐solvation tris(2‐ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate‐based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion‐enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower‐solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 °C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60 °C. Moreover, the TOP molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long‐cycling and high‐safety sodium metal batteries.",

As the anode for SIBs, the cream roll-like MnS/NSCT composite has delivered the best electrochemical performance to date (the highest capacity of 550.6 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, the highest capacity of 447.0 mA h g-1 after 1400 cycles at 1000 mA g-1, and the best rate performance of 319.8 mA h g-1 at 10 000 mA g-1). Besides, according to several in situ and ex situ techniques, the sodium storage mechanism of MnS/NSCTs is mainly from a conversion reaction, and the superior electrochemical performance of MnS/NSCTs is mainly attributed to the unique cream roll-like structure. More importantly, this simple method may be feasible for other anode materials, which will greatly promote the development of SIBs.",

To tackle these issues, carbon-coated WS2 (NTs-WS2@C) nanocomposites were prepared through a facile synthesis method that involved precipitating a carbon precursor (20% sucrose) on WS2 nanotubes, followed by annealing treatment under an argon environment. Thanks to the presence of highly conductive and mechanically robust carbon on the outer surface, NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites show improved electrochemical performance compared with bare NTs-WS2. After 60 cycles at 80 mA g-1 current density, the cells display high capacities of 305 mAh g-1 in LIBs and 152 mAh g-1 in SIBs, respectively. As the current density increases to 600 mA g-1, it provides specific capacities of 209 and 115 mAh g-1, correspondingly. The enhanced electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs is primarily attributed to the synergistic effects of the tubular architecture of WS2, carbon network and stable nanocomposite structure, which can effectively constrain volume variation during the metal ions intercalation/deintercalation processes.",

The original electron configuration of Mo 4d orbitals is changed via the electron injection by Ni, which triggers the phase transition from 2H to 1T phase, thus improving the electrical conductivity and accelerating the redox kinetics of the material. Consequently, 1T-Ni-MoS2 exhibits superior rate capability (266.8 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and excellent cycle life (358.7 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 350 cycles). In addition, the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3/C||1T-Ni-MoS2 full cells deliver excellent electrochemical properties and show great prospects in energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Mn-based layered oxide cathodes have attracted widespread attention due to high capacity and low cost, however, poor air stability, irreversible phase transitions, and slow kinetics inhibit their practical application. Here, we propose a universal interfacial reconstruction strategy based on converting residual alkali to tunnel phase Na0.44MnO2 for addressing the above mentioned issue simultaneously, using O3 NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2@2 mol % Na0.44MnO2 (NaNFM@NMO) as the prototype material. The optimized material exhibits an initial capacity and energy density comparable with lithium-ion batteries. The reversible anionic redox behavior and charge compensation mechanism of NaNFM@NMO were analyzed and verified by soft X-ray absorption spectrum and in situ X-ray absorption spectrum. Due to the intrinsic stability of the tunnel structure, excellent air stability and highly reversible structure evolution of the NaNFM@NMO cathode material are achieved, which are confirmed by contact angle test, rigorous aging test, and in situ X-ray diffraction. More importantly, the NaNFM@NMO cathode demonstrates a great match with the nonpresodiated hard carbon anode and shows excellent electrochemical performance of the full cell. Additionally, such a strategy could be also applied to modify P2-type cathodes, showing superior universality and good prospects in industrialized production. Overall, the proposed strategy could improve air stability while remaining interfacial and bulk stable simultaneously and will open up a whole new field for the optimization of other electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Tailoring the microstructure of hard carbon through selective biomass precursor and carbonization temperature is the key to address the low specific capacity and initial coloumbic efficiency (ICE). Herein, a low-cost and abundant green-peas pod (GPP), scientifically known as \n                        pisum sativum\n                     , is chosen as potential biomass precursor for the synthesis of hard carbon, due to their high yield (>60 %). Hard carbon anode is prepared from GPP at 1000, 1200 and 1400 °C. The hard carbon prepared at 1400 °C shows the highest storage capacity and better cyclic stability compared to hard carbon prepared at 1000 and 1200 °C. A high specific capacity of ∼293 mAh/g with cyclic stability ∼74 % after 100 cycles is seen for HC1400 when cycled at 0.1C (1C = 300 mA/g). It shows specific capacities of 290, 226, 192 and 142 mAh/g at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 C-rates, respectively. Further, an increase in specific capacity to 645 mAh/g is achieved when tested with 1 M NaBF4 in tetraglyme, though reason is not clear for the observed capacity. In addition, HC1400 shows an improved initial coloumbic efficiency (ICE) of 74 %, higher than the hard carbon anodes prepared at 1000 and 1200 °C with 63 and 65 % of ICEs, respectively. The high specific capacity, improved ICE are explained due to the selection of biomas, increased porosity and pore volume with temperature and excellent sodium ion diffusion. The higher ICE value helps to decrease the first-cycle irreversible capacities, making this material a prospective anode for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Pre‑carbonization for regulating sucrose-based hard carbon pore structure as high plateau capacity sodium-ion battery anode",
        "abstract": "Although hard carbon still suffers from low initial coulombic efficiency and a controversial sodium storage mechanism, it is widely explored and utilized as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its affordability and accessibility. This work used pre‑carbonization to construct sufficient reaction time of volatile reactive molecules released from matrix in the carbon interlayers, hence optimizing the structure of the nanopore and the graphite microcrystal inside the sucrose-based hard carbon. The sucrose-based hard carbon after pre‑carbonization treatment has an expanded carbon layer spacing, an appropriate micro-mesopore ratio, and a distinct closed pore structure. The result provides evidence that the low-voltage plateau region capacity is related to two Na+ storage behaviors: intercalation between carbon layers and pore-filling in nanopores. Further larger interlayer distances, lower micro-mesoporous ratios, and closed pores are favorable for sodium storage in the low-voltage plateau region which is assisting to improve the initial coulombic efficiency. In comparison to previously published studies, the pre‑carbonized hard carbon at 450 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C/min exhibits an impressive plateau capacity of 277 mAh g−1, increasing the contribution of the plateau capacity from 54 % to 63 %, while also enhancing cycling and rate performance. Furthermore, it has a significant initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 85 % and a noteworthy reversible specific capacity of 374 mAh g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1, which is noticeably better than the biomass hard carbon documented in the literature. Achieving a sustained low-voltage plateau capacity through microstructure modulation is crucial for producing hard carbon with both high specific capacity and rewarding ICE. This study presents a novel approach for the preparation sucrose based hard carbon of high plateau capacity and is expected to contribute significantly to the development of high energy density sodium-ion battery energy storage systems.",

Here, heteroatom (S, P, and N) doped hierarchical vesicular carbon (HHVC) materials with a high surface area up to 867.5 m2 g−1 are successfully prepared using a surface polymerization of hexachloro‐cyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and 4,4′‐sulfonyldiphenol (BPS) on the ZIF‐8 polyhedrons. Significantly, it is the first time to achieve a controllability of the wall thickness for this unique carbon, ranging from 18 to 52 nm. When utilized as anodes for sodium ion batteries, these novel carbon materials exhibit a high specific capacity of 327.2 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, which can be attributed to the expanded interlayer distance and enhanced conductivity derived from the doping of heteroatoms. Importantly, a high capacity of 142.6 mAh g−1 can be obtained even at a high current density of 5 A g−1, assigning to fast ion/electronic transmission processes stemming from the unique hierarchical vesicular structure.

Due to enhanced electrical conductivity and good structural stability, the MoS2 /C composite microspheres exhibit substantially improved Li/Na-ion storage performance. Compared to unmodified MoS2 , MoS2 /C composite microspheres deliver higher Li/Na-ion storage capacity (Li+ : 1017 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and Na+ : 531 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 ), as well as better rate capability (Li+ : 434 mA h g-1 at 1 Ag-1 and Na+ : 102 mA h g-1 at 1 Ag-1 ) and capacity retention (Li+ : 902 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles and Na+ : 342 mA h g-1 over 100 cycles).

Herein, the library of such non‐negligible factors is extended by targeting an alloying‐type bismuth anode well known for its high volumetric capacity for both Li+ and Na+ storage, showing that the mechanical property of key reaction intermediates also plays a role in differentiating its Na+ versus Li+ storage mechanisms. Applying spatially and temporally resolved in situ transmission electron microscopy to Li+ and Na+ storage within bismuth, it not only demonstrates the thermodynamic similarity in a step‐wise phase transition but also discloses its kinetic distinctions in morphological and structural integrities determined by Young's modulus of involving reaction intermediates and spatial configuration, which well accounts for the surprisingly observed superior Na+ storage performance of Bi anode compared to the inferior Li+ storage.

Utilizing 3D‐printed (3DP) anode materials with hybrid sodium storage mechanism and elevated mass loading is promising yet poorly explored. Herein, the design of a prototype ternary composite is reported, MoS2@Bi/N‐doped carbon, as a sodium storage candidate to achieve high reversible capacity (604 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with an initial output of 709 mAh g−1) and outstanding rate capability (169.6 mAh g−1 at 15 A g−1), outperforming the state‐of‐the‐art reports. This is realized by delicate structural and interfacial engineering of the composite anode, markedly synergizing the conversion‐typed MoS2, alloy‐typed Bi, and adsorption‐typed N‐doped carbon. Theoretical simulations and operando instrumental analysis elaborate the reasons of the boosted electrochemical performance. Encouragingly, a fully 3DP SIB affording an areal mass loading of up to 11.7 mg cm−2 is demonstrated, retaining a capacity of 114 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1.

Due to their high porosity, excellent adsorption and catalytic activity, as well as the possibility of simultaneous implementation of various charge accumulation mechanisms, they can be used as electrode materials for metal-ion batteries. However, a significant disadvantage is that most MOFs have a low electrical conductivity, and the production of conductive MOFs is a costly, time-consuming and technically difficult process. In this work, we developed a method for synthesizing the Zn2(EDTA)(H2O) MOF composite and studied the possibility of using it as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries based on aqueous electrolytes. The structure and morphology of the compound was studied using XRD, IR, TGA and SEM. Using cyclic voltammetry, the electrochemical characteristics of the organometallic framework in alkaline electrolytes 1, 10 M NaOH, as well as in saturated aqueous electrolyte NaClO4, were evaluated. It has been established that the studied compound does not give a satisfactory electrochemical response in aqueous electrolytes (both in alkaline and neutral media) due to the strong degradation of the electrode material, which is associated with the high solubility of this MOF representative. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed the presence of two redox processes due to the release of metallic zinc from an electrolyte solution, where two forms of zinc exist in equilibrium (the ZnEDTA complex and the free zinc cation). Therefore, we concluded, it is not possible to use this material as an anode for water-based sodium-ion batteries in contrary to a published research study.",

        "abstract": "\nNowadays, hard carbon is one of the most promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries. However, the Na‐storage performance of hard carbon varies for different precursors and synthetic processes due to disparities in the dopant content, dimensions, and categories of defects, graphitic domains, which lead to controversial explanations for the energy storage mechanism. Herein, self‐freestanding membrane of cellulose‐derived carbon fibers is presented, delivering a reversible Na‐storage capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 due to abundant ordered graphitic zones with enlarged interlayer spacings around 0.39 ± 0.03 nm. Benefiting from a robust solid electrolyte interphase layer rich in NaF nanocrystals, the membrane also holds a superior rate capability of 100 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and long‐term cycling stability with capacity retention of 82.6% at 1.5 A g−1 for 4000 cycles. A clear sodiation behavior of Na+ intercalation into enlarged carbon graphitic layers at the slope step above 0.10 V and Na cluster evolution in the micropores at the plateau step around 0.01–0.10 V is disclosed by high‐resolution element mapping microscopy, different from the accepted mechanism of Na+ intercalation into graphitic layers at the plateau step.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon attracts considerable attention as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries; however, their poor rate capability and low realistic capacity have motivated intense research effort toward exploiting nanostructured carbons in order to boost their comprehensive performance. Ultramicropores are considered essential for attaining high‐rate capacity as well as initial Coulombic efficiency by allowing the rapid diffusion of Na+ and inhibiting the contact of the electrolyte with the inner carbon surfaces. Herein, hard carbon nanosheets with centralized ultramicropores (≈0.5 nm) and easily accessible carbonyl groups (CO)/hydroxy groups (OH) are synthesized via interfacial assembly and carbonization strategies, delivering a large capacity (318 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1), superior rate capability (145 mA h g−1 at 5.00 A g−1), and approximately 95% of reversible capacity below 1.00 V. Notably, a new charge model favoring fast capacitive sodium storage with dual potential plateaus is proposed. That is, the deintercalation of Na+ from graphitic layers is manifested as the low‐potential plateau region (0.01−0.10 V), contributing to stable insertion capacity; meanwhile, the surface desodiation process of the CO and OH groups corresponds to the high‐potential plateau region (0.40−0.70 V), contributing to a fast capacitive storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) employing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as anode exhibit enormous application prospect and attract widespread attention for large-scale energy storage and conversion owing to the advantages of environment-friendly, cost-effective, and high-safety. However, achieving long-term cyclic stability and capacity retention at high current densities remains a huge challenge due to inherent low conductivity and kinetic limitations as well as severe solubility in electrolytes. Rational design of COFs with high conductivity, rapid redox kinetics, and structural stability is the key to improving their performance in SDIBs. Herein, a kind of S/Se co-doped COF is successfully designed and synthesized in which the co-doping effect significantly enhances stability and conductivity, improves the compatibility with electrolyte, facilitates the fast ion and electron transfer, and strengthens the adsorption capability for Na+. As anticipated, the constructed SDIBs not only deliver a high discharge capacity of up to 167.2 mAh g−1 and can cycle stably for 700 cycles at 2 C without degradation, but also achieve an ultra-long cycle life of 15,000 cycles at 20 C, with a capacity decay rate as low as 0.00045 % per cycle. Moreover, a capacity retention of 89.2 % corresponding to the normal electrolyte dosage and 12,000 ultra-stable cycles are realized even under lean electrolyte and demonstrate excellent fast-charging performance with extremely low self-discharge rate. The structural evolution of electrodes and the energy storage mechanism of DIBs are further revealed by in-situ characterization and theoretical calculations. This work expands the versatility of designing COFs with high redox activity, emphasizes the importance of heterogeneous element doping, and sheds novel insights on the construction of COFs-based materials for efficient Na+ storage.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth is a promising anode material for state‐of‐the‐art rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical volumetric capacity and relatively low working potential. However, its charge storage mechanism is unclear, hindering further improvement of the cell performance. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy and X‐ray diffraction techniques as well as theoretical analysis, it is found that a large anisotropic volume expansion of 142% occurs along the z‐axis largely due to the alloy reaction during sodiation, significantly reducing the electrochemical performance of bismuth electrodes. To address this problem, ultrathin few‐layer bismuthene with a large aspect ratio is rationally synthesized, and can relieve the expansion strain along the z‐axis. A free‐standing bismuthene/graphene composite electrode with tunable thickness achieves a strikingly stable and high areal sodium storage capacity of 12.1 mAh cm−2, which greatly exceeds that of most reported electrode materials. The clarification of the charge storage mechanism and the superior areal capacity achieved should facilitate the development of bismuth‐based high‐performance anodes for practical electrochemical energy‐storage applications.",

        "abstract": "As anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been widely explored due to their low cost, high theoretical capacity and rich redox reactions. However, poor cycling performance and capacity retention limit the application of materials. In this work, multiphase nano Co9S8/CoS encapsulated in N-doped carbon for high capacity SIBs anode is prepared via a facile two-step strategy: precipitation and heat treatment. When applied as anodes for SIBs, mass capacity of 389.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 60 cycles is obtained, and delivered ~300 mAh g−1 from 2nd to 300th cycle without depravation under 1.0 A g−1. In addition, according to the calculation of Na+ diffusion kinetics, it is evident that carbon encapsulation not only helps prevent electrolyte erosion but also enhances the D\n                     Na+ of the anode material. The high efficient strategy can be applied to synthesis of other multiphase analogues. Based on theoretical investigations, calculations of band gaps and rebuild energies for other TMSs (i.e., Cu7S4/Cu2S, FeS/Fe21.333O32/Fe3O4, MnS2/MnS, Ni3S2/Ni3C and cubic-ZnS/hexagonal-ZnS), as well as analysis of cyclic data, it can be concluded that Co9S8/CoS@NC material exhibits the highest conductivity and cycle stability.",

Furthermore, even at a large current density of 2 C, a high capacity of 168 mAh g(-1) can still remain, which is much higher than that of pristine NiS2 materials.

Porous cellulose-derived fibres were employed as the inner carbon framework to construct fast conductive circuits and provide an abundant site for anchoring CoTe2 nanocrystals. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-derived carbon layers act as carbon armour to encapsulate CoTe2 nanocrystals, inhibiting their volume change and structural pulverization during repeated sodium intercalation/deintercalation. Benefiting from the exquisite structural design, the N-C@CoTe2@C electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability for over 3000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1 and rate performance (113.8 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1).

Herein, guided by the DFT calculation, Sb/Fe2S3 was fabricated by annealing Fe and Sb2S3 mixed powder. Next, Sb/Fe2S3 was blended with 15 wt % graphite by ball milling, yielding nano-Sb/Fe2S3 anchored on an exfoliated graphite composite (denoted as Sb/Fe2S3-15%). When applied as an anode of SIBs, Sb/Fe2S3-15% delivered reversible capacities of 565, 542, 467, 366, 285, and 236 mA h g-1 at current rates of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A g-1, respectively, surpassing most of the Sb-based anodes. The co-existence of highly conductive Fe2S3 and Sb minimizes the polarization of the anode. Our experiments proved that the Sb and Fe2S3 phases were reversible during discharge/charge cycling, and the exfoliated graphite can accelerate the Na+ diffusion and e- conduction.

However, the carbonization and granulation of HC powders involve complex processes and require considerable energy. Here, we developed a facile method for manufacturing HC anodes for SIBs via a novel microwave induction heating (MIH) process for polymer/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films. Numerical simulations solving electromagnetic field and heat transfer problems revealed the MIH mechanism; the electric current induced by the applied microwave enables direct Joule heating of the SWCNT networks in the composite film. Consequently, the composite films could be heated to the target temperatures (800–1400 °C) and free-standing HC/SWCNT anodes could be prepared by applying MIH for only 30 s. Comparative analyses confirmed that ultrafast MIH is a reliable technique for producing HC anodes and can replace conventional carbonization processes which require a high-temperature furnace. Moreover, the HC/SWCNT anodes prepared by the ultrafast MIH were successfully applied to the SIB full cells. Finally, the feasibility of MIH for scalable roll-to-roll production of HC anodes was verified through local heating tests using a circular sheet larger than a resonator.",

To overcome the drawbacks, herein the successful fabrication of TiS2 @N,S-codoped C (denoted as TiS2 @NSC) through a chemical vapor reaction between Ti-based metal-organic framework (NH2 -MIL-125) and carbon disulfide (CS2 ) is demonstrated. The C─N bonds enhance the electronic/ionic conductivity of the TiS2 @NSC electrode, while the C─S bonds provide extra sodium storage capacity, and both polar bonds synergistically suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Consequently, the TiS2 @NSC electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and rate performance, delivering reversible capacities of 418/392 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2/5 A g-1 . Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope analyses reveal that TiS2 undergoes an intercalation-conversion ion storage mechanism with the generation of metallic Ti in a deeper sodiation state, and the pristine hexagonal TiS2 is electrochemically transformed into cubic rock-salt TiS2 as a reversible phase with enhanced reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation cycling. The strategy to encapsulate TiS2 in N,S-codoped porous carbon matrices efficiently realizes superior conductivity and physical/chemical confinement of the soluble polysulfides, which can be generally applied for the rational design of advanced electrodes.",

Herein, we synthesized the ordered porous carbon matrix wrapped FeS_2 nanoparticles (FeS_2@OCN) with high sodium wettability and low pore tortuosity to economically enhance the interface compatibility as well as to lower the energy barrier in SIBs. The synergistic effects of low tortuosity pores and strong sodium wettability homogenize the Na^+ flux distribution, bring the electron dislocation via the enrichment of edge-nitrogen (Pyridinic N and Pyrrolic N), thus achieving the dendrite-free sodium deposition and dramatically enhanced reaction kinetics. Benefiting from exceptional structural/compositional/electronic merits, the resultant anode is endowed with exceptional structure stability, achieving long-term cycling stability of 451.9 mAh·g^−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A·g^−1 with specific capacity retention of 92.9%. Attenuated electrode tortuosity and high sodium wettability can corporately improve the interface compatibility and attenuate the activation barrier of the FeS_2 host and beyond.",

The yolk–shell architecture, with SnSe2 nanoparticles embedded within a nitrogen-doped carbon shell, significantly boosts structural integrity and sodium storage performance. The SnSe2@NC electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 368.9 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and an impressive capacity retention of 324.2 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. Electrochemical analyses reveal that the enhanced performance is attributed to the improved Na-ion diffusion kinetics, reduced charge-transfer resistance, and the structural stability conferred by the nitrogen-doped carbon shell and the internal void space.

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) have been considered as one of the most promising anode material for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and (NIBs), because of its high theoretical capacity. However, natural insulating property and the large volume expansion of red P during cycling lead to poor cyclability and low rate performance, which prevents its practical application. Here, we significantly improves both lithium storage and sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into the mesoporous carbon matrix (P@CMK-3) using a vaporization-condensation-conversion process. The P@CMK-3 shows a high reversible specific capacity of ∼ 2250 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 0.25 C (∼ 971 mA h g(-1) based on the composite), excellent rate performance of 1598 and 624 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 6.1 and 12 C, respectively (562 and 228 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite at 6.1 and 12 C, respectively) and significantly enhanced cycle life of 1150 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 5 C (500 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite) after 1000 cycles for LIBs. For Na ions, it also displays a reversible capacity of 1020 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P (370 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite) after 210 cycles at 5C. The significantly improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique structure that combines a variety of advantages: easy access of electrolyte to the open channel structure, short transport path of ions through carbon toward the red P, and high ionic and electronic conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Metal oxides, as promising electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries, usually need to be formed by exposure to oxygen, which usually thermally corrodes the carbon material with which they are compounded, reducing their flexibility and electrical conductivity. Herein, we present for the first time a preoxidation-assisted mechanism to prepare bismuth oxide and carbon nanofibers (Bi2O3@C-NFs) by electrospinning, using Bi2S3 nanorods as multifunctional templates. The bismuth could be oxidized by C═O bonds formed through the cyclization reaction in the high-temperature calcination process, effectively avoiding thermal corrosion of carbon in oxygen atmosphere at high temperature. More importantly, the uniformly distributed Bi2O3 nanodots and longitudinal tunnels are formed inside the S- and N-doped carbon nanofibers with the continuous diffusion of Bi generated from the decomposition of Bi2S3 nanorods and the conversion to Bi─O bonds with C═O bonds being broken. Benefiting from the structural and composition merits arising from preoxidation, Bi2O3@C-NFs self-supporting anodes show high specific capacity (439 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1), superior rate performance (243 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 A g-1), and outstanding cycling stability (211 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1).

Herein, a TiO2-coated MoP/phosphorus doped carbon (MoP@TiO2/P-C) nanorod with a new structure is constructed using TiO2-coated Mo-MOF as the precursor through an in situ topological conversion technique. In the synthesis process, the traditional highly toxic PH3 phosphorus is avoided. TEM results reveal that TiO2 nanoparticles are distributed at the interface between the MoP core and the P-doped carbon shell, which breaks the density of the carbon layer and facilitates ion transport. The GITT results demonstrate the fact that the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions is remarkably improved by two orders of magnitude due to the presence of TiO2. Notably, TiO2 can effectively cushion volume expansion with an almost negligible rate of 13%, allowing cells to manifest a high discharge capacity of 419 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density and exceptional stability where the specific capacity remains constant for 10 000 cycles at a high density of 10 A g-1 (∼81 seconds for one charging).

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are considered as one of the most potential anode materials in sodium-ion batteries due to their high capacity, low cost, and rich resources. Among plenty of options, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been the focus of research due to the graphene-like layered structure and unique electrochemical properties. Importantly, an abnormal capacity increase phenomenon was observed in the MoS2 anode of sodium-ion batteries, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, by analyzing the composition and structure of the material after a different number of cycles, we confirmed that the (002) plane shows a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing after the sodium ion insertion process and a phase transformation from the hexagonal phase MoS2 (2H-MoS2) to the trigonal phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2). Moreover, the ratio of 1T-MoS2 presented an increasing trend during cycling. The dual-phase co-existence leads to enhanced electrical conductivity, higher Na affinity, and higher Na+ mobility, thus increasing the capacity. Our work provides a new perspective on the anomalous electrochemical behavior of sulfide anodes during long-term cycling.",

        "abstract": "To make sodium-ion batteries a realistic option for everyday energy storage, a practicable method is to enhance the kinetics of Na+ reactions through the development of structurally stable electrode materials. This study utilizes ternary Sn-based dichalcogenide (SnS1.5 Se0.5 ) in the design of electrode material to tackle several issues that adversely hinder the performance and longevity of sodium-ion batteries. First, the incorporation of Se into the SnS structure enhances its electrical conductivity and stability. Second, the ternary composition restricts the formation of intermediates during the desodiation/sodiation process, resulting in better electrode reaction reversibility. Finally, SnS1.5 Se0.5 lowers the diffusion barrier of Na, thereby facilitating rapid and efficient ion transport within the electrode material. Moreover, nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon (NS-C) is used to enhance surface chemistry and ionic/electrical conductivity of SnS1.5 Se0.5 , leading to a pseudocapacitive storage effect that presents a promising potential for high-performance energy storage devices. The study has successfully developed a SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C anode, exhibiting remarkable rate capability and cycle stability, retaining a capacity of 647 mAh g-1 even after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g-1 in half-cell tests. In full-cell tests, Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 //SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C delivers a high energy density of 176.6 Wh kg-1 . In addition, the Na+ storage mechanism of SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C is explored through ex situ tests and DFT calculations. The findings suggest that the ternary Sn-based dichalcogenides can considerably enhance the performance of the anode, enabling efficient large-scale storage of sodium.

Herein, we have reported the synthesis of a cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) reinforced chitosan (Ch)-derived free-standing HC anode, which features hydroxyl surface chemistry on HC and flexible framework. The CNC-Ch not only serves as a binder and a substrate but also increases the Na-ions adsorption and diffusion.

The superior electrochemical properties are attributed to continuous electron transport pathway, improved electrical conductivity, and excellent stress relaxation.",

        "abstract": "Porous carbon materials are used widely in catalysis, electrochemistry, or as sorbents, but pore size control continues to be a challenge in their syntheses. Here the authors show that the 3D molecular structure of the carbon sources allows to control the pore size of the resulting carbon materials at the Ångstrom-level. Carbon materials with controlled pore sizes at the nanometer level have been obtained by template methods, chemical vapor desorption, and extraction of metals from carbides. However, to produce porous carbons with controlled pore sizes at the Ångstrom-level, syntheses that are simple, versatile, and reproducible are desired. Here, we report a synthetic method to prepare porous carbon materials with pore sizes that can be precisely controlled at the Ångstrom-level. Heating first induces thermal polymerization of selected three-dimensional aromatic molecules as the carbon sources, further heating results in extremely high carbonization yields (>86%). The porous carbon obtained from a tetrabiphenylmethane structure has a larger pore size (4.40 Å) than those from a spirobifluorene (4.07 Å) or a tetraphenylmethane precursor (4.05 Å). The porous carbon obtained from tetraphenylmethane is applied as an anode material for sodium-ion battery.",

        "abstract": "Different dimensions of carbon materials with various features have captured numerous interests due to their applications on the tremendous fields. Restricted by the raw materials and devices, the controlling of their morphology is a major challenge. Utilizing the catalytic features of the intermediates from the low‐cost salts and polymerization of 0D carbon quantum dots (CQDs), 0D CQDs are expected to self‐assemble into 1/2/3D carbon structures with the assistance of temperature‐induced intermediates (e.g., ZnO, Ni, and Cu) from the salts (ZnCl2, NiCl2, and CuCl). The formation mechanisms are illustrated as follows: 1) the “orient induction” to evoke “vine style” growth mechanism of ZnO; 2) the “dissolution–precipitation” of Ni; and 3) the “surface adsorption self‐limited” of Cu. Subsequently, the degree of graphitization, interlayer distance, and special surface area are investigated in detail. 1D structure from 700 °C as anode displays a high Na‐storage capacity of 301.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles and 107 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. Quantitative kinetics analysis confirms the fundamentals of the enhanced rate capacity and the potential region of Na‐insertion/extraction.

The presence of numerous defect sites and C=O active double bonds within the structure, coupled with the flaky morphology, results in an outstanding carbon anode material, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 272 mAh g−1 with excellent rate performance (229 mAh g−1 at 10 C). Furthermore, the material maintains 80 % capacity over 1300 cycles at a high current density of 10 C. The optimization in structure and morphology, along with enhanced electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion kinetics, also ensures that the capacity of the material is dominated by plateau capacity at any current density, which is beneficial for increasing the energy density of full battery configurations and holds promise for high-performance sodium-ion battery anode materials.",

        "abstract": "The practical value of hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries has garnered significant attention. Asphalt-derived hard carbon offers lower cost and scale advantages compared to expensive resin and bio-based hard carbon materials. However, the synthesis of asphalt-derived hard carbon with significantly enhanced reversible capacity remains challenging. This study focuses on synthesizing P-doped hard carbon material using polyphosphoric acid-modified petroleum asphalt as a precursor and the pre-oxidation method. Doping P elements in hard carbon induces deformation of the molecular layer structure within the pseudo-graphite domains, expanding graphite layer spacing and increasing the number of internal closed micropores, thereby enhancing the sodium storage capacity of the matrix. The reversible capacity of P-doped hard carbon (PHC-1300) increased from 240.3 mA h g−1 to 359.9 mA h g−1 during the initial charge-discharge cycle at a rate of 0.05 C compared to undoped hard carbon (HC-1300). Moreover, phosphate exhibits higher reduction ability than adjacent carbon atoms, generating electron holes that partially compensate for limited electron conduction capability in hard carbon material. The electronic conductivity of the material increases from 26.1114 S cm−1 to 36.6418 S cm−1, demonstrating a significant enhancement compared to high graphitized soft carbon (SC-1300).Therefore, the practical significance of employing this straightforward precursor modification method to prepare P-doped hard carbon warrants attention.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) has been a promising alternative for sustainable electrochemical energy-storage devices. However, it still needs great efforts to develop electrode materials with ultrafast gravimetric and volumetric Na-storage performance, due to difficult balance between Na-ion diffusion kinetics and pressing density of materials. In this work, Bi2Se3/graphene composites, synthesized by a selenization reaction, are investigated as anode materials for SIBs. Na-ion storage mechanism of Bi2Se3 should be attributed to a combined conversion-alloying one by a series of ex situ measurements. In the composites, Bi2Se3 particles with an average diameter of 100 nm are uniformly dispersed onto graphene with strong interfacial interaction. Despite their nanoscale size, the pressing density of Bi2Se3/graphene composite could still reach a high value of 2.07 g/cm3. Therefore, the composites can deliver a high gravimetric specific capacity of 346 mAh/g and volumetric specific capacity of 716 mAh/cm3 at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Remarkably, the composites exhibit an ultrafast Na-storage capability and a negligible capacity fading with the increasing of current density from 0.2 to 5 A/g. Even at 10 A/g (≈30 C), the composites still possess a gravimetric capacity of 183 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of 379 mAh/cm3 with ultrastable cyclability up to 1000 cycles. This work introduces a valid route to design electrode materials with both excellent gravimetric and volumetric performance of Na-ion storage.",

Despite recent advances via nanostructured electrode design and interface engineering, the correlation between mechanical stability, solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and reaction kinetics/reversibility remains controversial and elusive. Here, by combining in situ scanning electron microcopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we have investigated the underlying electro-chemo-mechanical behavior and their coupling effects during charge/discharge of microsized Sn anode. Our results revealed that microsized Sn is pulverized into nanoparticles with simultaneous formation of numerous voids and pores upon the 1st charge/discharge, while the electrolytes composition plays a critical role on the consequent parasitic reactions and eventually the sodiation/de-sodiation reversibility. In contrast to carbonate-based electrolytes, ether-based electrolytes enabled formation of inorganic species dominated SEI with improved mechanical strength, thus leading to higher specific capacity and improved cycling stability.

To overcome these issues, we propose an effective synthesis of composite materials, encapsulating Bi nanoparticles in N,S co-doped carbon nanoribbons and composites with carbon nanotubes (N,S-C@Bi/CNT), using Bi2S3 nanobelts as templates. The uniform distribution of Bi nanoparticles and the structure of carbon nanoribbons can reduce the diffusion path of ions/electrons, efficiently buffer the large volume change and prevent Bi from aggregating during cycles. As expected, the N,S-C@Bi/CNT electrode shows superior sodium storage performance in half cells, including a high specific capacity (345.3 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1), long cycling stability (1000 cycles), and superior rate capability (336.0 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1).",

Herein, a 2D metallic anode, KCu4S3, is reported expertly crafted using a KSCN molten salt approach, laying the foundation for fast‐charging SIBs. It is found that the mixed metal‐valence states within this compound provide substantial advantages, particularly in enhancing the high‐rate capability and ensuring long‐term durability. The mechanism that appears to facilitate these benefits can be traced to the formation of NaCu2S2 intermediate, which assist in electron transfer during Na+ (de)intercalation. In situ observations confirm the sodiation products of NaCu2S2 and sodium polysulfide can recover to the original phase upon desodiation. Such distinctive characteristics endow KCu4S3 with remarkable electrochemical performances, including an impressive capacity of 355 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 100% capacity retention within 3000 cycles. Moreover, the full cell exhibits a high energy density of 332 Wh kg−1 and retains 92% of its capacity across 150 cycles at 1 A g−1.

        "abstract": "The transition phenomenon involving copper replacing the transition metal elements within transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) is a recent and unique observation in the context of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) where TMCs serve as anodes. Fundamental understanding of the driving forces and kinetics governing this transition is crucial for elucidating the sodium storage mechanism in TMCs anodes. Herein, cobalt disulfide (CoS2) has been chosen as a representative anode. It is revealed that the transition behavior of copper replacing cobalt during the cycling originates from chemical/electrochemical dual‐driving forces. The chemical driving force emanates from the interaction between Cu+ dissolved in the electrolyte and the resulting sodium polysulfide products. The reaction extent is intricately linked to the surface roughness of the copper collector. The electrochemistrical driving force is effectively elucidated through the application of the Hard‐Soft‐Acid‐Base theory. Multiple charaterization techniques, such as Solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) have been employed to confirm that cobalt exists as cation instead of metal after transition. This research offers a novel perspective understanding the transition behavior exhibited by CoS2, with potential wider implications for understanding analogous behaviors in other metal sulfide anodes.",

Here, a molecular intercalation strategy is developed to synthesize thermally stable 1T-rich MoSe2 , covalently bonded to an intercalated carbon layer (1TR /2H-MoSe2 @C). Density functional theory calculations uncover that the introduced ethylene glycol molecules not only serve as electron donors, inducing a reorganization of Mo 4d orbitals, but also as sacrificial guest materials that generate a conductive carbon layer. Furthermore, the C─Se/C─O─Mo bonds encourage strong interfacial electronic coupling, and the carbon layer prevents the restacking of MoSe2 , regulating the maximum 1T phase to an impressive 80.3%. Consequently, the 1TR /2H-MoSe2 @C exhibits an extraordinary rate capacity of 326 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 and maintains a long-term cycle stability up to 1500 cycles, with a capacity of 365 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 . Additionally, the full cell delivers an appealing energy output of 194 Wh kg-1 at 208 W kg-1 , with a capacity retention of 87.3% over 200 cycles. These findings contribute valuable insights toward the development of innovative transition metal dichalcogenides for next-generation energy storage technologies.",

        "abstract": "Multiple transition metals containing chalcogenides have recently drawn boosted attraction as anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Their greatly enhanced electrochemical performances can be attributed to the superior intrinsic conductivities and richer redox reactions, comparative to mono metal chalcogenides. To employ various binary metals comprising selenides (B-TMSs) for SIBs, discovery of a simplistic, scalable and universal synthesis approach is highly desirable. Herein, a simple, facile, and comprehensive strategy to produce various combinations of nanostructured B-TMSs is presented. As a proof of concept, optimized, high surface area bearing, and hierarchical nanosheets of iron-nickel selenide (FNSe), iron-cobalt selenide, and nickel-cobalt selenide are produced and employed in SIBs. These B-TMSs exhibit adequately high energy capacities, excellent rate capabilities, and an extraordinarily stable life of 2600 cycles. As far as it is known, it is the first work to discuss sodium storage of FNSe, so various in situ and ex situ battery analyses are carried out to probe the sodium storage mechanism. When employed in sodium full batteries, these B-TMSs present reasonably high reversible specific capacities even after 100 cycles. Overall, the presented strategy will pave the way for facile synthesis of numerous binary transition metal chalcogenides that are the potential materials for energy storage and conversion systems.",

However, it suffers from large volume expansion and poor conductivity.

The carbon foam serves as a three-dimensional conductive network and a buffer skeleton, contributing to improved rate performance and cycling stability. In addition, Mo doping enhances the kinetics of sodium-ion transfer, and the interlaced SnO2 nanoflake arrays is beneficial to promote the conversion reactions during the charge/discharge process. The as-prepared composite with a unique structure demonstrate a high initial capacity of 1017.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, with a capacity retention over three times higher than that of the control sample (SnO2@C-foam) at 1 A g−1, indicating a remarkable rate performance.",

The deduced diffusion coefficient from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for NGO as anode in NIBs is in the range of 10−11–10−12 cm2 s−1.

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries have emerged as potential rivals to lithium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, maintaining a stable sodium metal anode under harsh conditions (current density >10 mA cm−2) is extremely challenging. The primary issue is the highly reactive sodium metal continuously reacts with the electrolyte to form a thick and loose solid electrolyte film. The tip effect causes sodium ions (Na+) accumulated in the bulge resulting in uneven deposition. In this paper, a unique artificial interfacial layer (Ag nanoparticles distributed in NaClO4‐based matrix) is prepared on the surface of a metallic sodium anode using in situ displacement reaction. Ag particles arranged at the bottom of the artificial layer act as effective nucleation sites helping Na+ deposit uniformly, while the built‐in electric field formed between Ag in the middle/top of the artificial layer and the sodium accelerates the migration of Na+ in the interfacial layer during the deposition and reduce the polarization. Such important properties further allow the steady operation of modified sodium metal batteries in very harsh conditions. The symmetric battery achieves reversible stripping/plating for over 1000 h under high current density (10 mA cm−2). Moreover, the full cell coupled with a high‐loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (20 mg cm−2) presents a stable cycle performance.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",

Herein, novel cubic‐like XFe (X = Co, Ni, Mn) Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), as cathodes materials, are obtained through as‐tuned ionic bonding, delivering improved crystallinity and homogeneous particles size. As expected, Ni‐Fe PBAs show a capacity of 81 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, mainly resulting from their physical–chemical stability, fast kinetics, and “zero‐strain” insertion characteristics. Considering that the combination of elements incorporated with carbon may increase the rate of ion transfer and improve the lifetime of cycling stability, they are expected to derive binary metal‐selenide/nitrogen‐doped carbon as anodes. Among them, binary Ni0.67Fe0.33Se2 coming from Ni‐Fe PBAs shows obvious core–shell structure in a dual‐carbon matrix, leading to enhanced electron interactions, electrochemical activity, and “metal‐like” conductivity, which could retain an ultralong‐term stability of 375 mAh g−1 after 10 000 loops even at 10.0 A g−1. The corresponding full‐cell Ni‐Fe PBAs versus Ni0.67Fe0.33Se2 deliver a remarkable Na‐storage capacity of 302.2 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1.

However, bulk MoS2 exhibits a sluggish kinetics for the intercalation-deintercalation of sodium ions and large volume expansion, which result in poor cyclability and rate performance. In this study, we designed few-layered MoS2/C nanoflowers with expanded interspacing of MoS2-MoS2 planes using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an intercalating reagent and a carbon precursor. Due to the unique nanostructure and larger interlayer spacing, the MoS2/C nanoflower electrode achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 400 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 500 mA g-1 for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), showing a good cycling stability.

        "abstract": "Lignin, a biomass derived polymer, has gained considerable recognition as a highly promising precursor of hard carbon primarily due to its ample reserve, eco‐friendliness, and cost‐effectiveness. However, lignin‐derived hard carbon via direct carbonization generally yields suboptimal performance for sodium storage due to the unsuitable microstructure. Herein, a simple phytic acid activation combined high‐temperature annealing strategy is proposed to regulate the microstructure of lignin‐derived hard carbon for high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) anode. Phytic acid activation not only reduces the ordering and creates abundant closed pores through improving the crosslinking degree and thermal stability of lignin but also introduces P heteroatoms to effectively expand the interlayer spacing of the derived hard carbon. High‐temperature carbonization further increases the size of closed pores, leading to a more favorable sodium storage in the plateau region. Consequently, the optimal phytic acid activating lignin derived hard carbon (PLHC 1300) delivers a high capacity of 380.3 mAh g−1 with an enhanced plateau capacity ratio of near 68.1% at 30 mA g−1, and achieves a capacity retention of near 100% after 150 cycles at 1 A g−1.

Meanwhile, the bimetallic phases/boundary defects and built‐in electric fields are formed with a strong electronic coupling effect, effectively alleviating the separation of the M/S phase (Fe/Sb and S), and significantly enhancing ion/e− conductivity. As expected, FF delivers an ultra‐fast sodium‐ions storage rate capacity of 436.5/334.3 mAh g−1 even at 10.0/20.0 A g−1. When the operation temperature is lowered to ‐5 °C, the reversible capacity can still remain at ≈349.7 mAh g−1. Assisted by the detailed kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, their great ion‐storage abilities mainly derive from improved interfacial Na+/e− transfer and surface/near‐surface redox behaviors. Moreover, the reassembling evolution of active phases is revealed by in/ex situ techniques, further demonstrating the stable adsorption/anchoring of intermediate reaction products Fe/Sb–S phases on the heterointerface, accompanying high reversible conversion‐alloying reaction.

        "abstract": "MXenes, as excellent candidate anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), suffer from the sluggish ion-diffusion kinetics resulting from the anchoring effect of the negatively-charged functional groups on their surface on sodium ions. Herein, we introduce positively-charged conductive polyaniline (PANI) to induce self-assembly of Ti3C2Tx MXenes into three-dimensional PANI/Ti3C2Tx network. In this PANI/Ti3C2Tx network, PANI not only intercalates into Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to enlarge the interlayer spacing, but also promotes negative-to-positive transition of the surface charges of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, significantly improving ion-diffusion kinetics. Electrochemical test results further confirm the superb ion-diffusion kinetics of PANI/Ti3C2Tx network. Meanwhile, a covalent interaction (Ti-N) between PANI and Ti3C2Tx, proved by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) tests, plays a key role in stabilizing this network structure. Therefore, PANI/Ti3C2Tx exhibits excellent sodium storage performances with a high specific capacity, superior rate performance and ultra-long lifespan at high current density. More importantly, when operated at the rigorous temperatures from 50 oC to -30 oC, PANI/Ti3C2Tx also exhibits good electrochemical performances. The present work presents a simple strategy for designing 3D porous MXene-based materials to realize high rate performance and all-climate energy storage device.",

        "abstract": "Metal-polydopamine coordination chemistry attracts great attention owing to the synergistic effect of adjustable components and advantageous structures. However, few efforts have been devoted to exploring bimetal-polydopamine composites, especially for multistructural composites with high-capacity components and high stability. In this regard, the TiO2 @C-WSe2 core-shell nanospheres are designed and fabricated based on Ti-W-polydopamine composites after selenization, in which the TiO2 nanoparticles are encapsulated or embedded in the carbon nanospheres and the external WSe2 nanosheets are grown epitaxially on the carbon surfaces, featuring multiple channels for ion diffusion and abundant active edges for electrochemical reactions. The introduction of WSe2 not only greatly improves the capacity but also results in exponential growth of the active edge. As a result, the as-prepared TiO2 @C-WSe2 displayed long-term cycling performance in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the anode is assembled into sodium-ion batteries, manifesting a stable capacity of 352 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 even after 2000 cycles, one of the best performances for polydopamine-based composites. Enhanced performance can be attributed to the synergies of high-capacity components and different dimensional materials. This work highlights that the rational design of functional structures provides a novel inspiration for electrodes with effective nanoarchitectures.",

Understanding the miscibility of Na into Pb is crucial for the development of high-energy density negative electrode materials for NIBs. Using a first-principles multiscale approach, we analyze the thermodynamic properties and estimate the Na-alloying voltage of the Na-Pb system by constructing the compositional phase diagram. In the Pb-Na system, we elucidate the phase boundaries of important phases, such as Pb-rich face-centered cubic and $\\beta$-NaPb$_3$, thereby improving our understanding of the phase diagram of the Na-Pb alloy. Due to the strong ordering tendencies of the Na-Pb intermetallics (such as NaPb, Na$_5$Pb$_2$, and Na$_{15}$Pb$_4$), we do not observe any solid-solution behavior at intermediate and high Na concentrations.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are now considered as a low‐cost alternative to lithium‐ion technologies for large‐scale energy storage applications; however, their safety is still a matter of great concern for practical applications. In this paper, a safer sodium‐ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb‐based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb‐based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications.",

Herein, the sodium storage performance and mechanisms of MnO2 with four distinct phase structures (α, β, γ, and δ) as anodes are systematically investigated. Among the four materials, the layered δ-MnO2 nanoflowers exhibit the best sodium storage performances, characterized by a specific capacity of 303.6 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g-1, cyclability of 247.3 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g-1, and high-rate performance of 184.5 mA h g-1 at 3000 mA g-1. Furthermore, δ-MnO2 shows the most pronounced pseudocapacitance behavior during discharge/charge processes among the four materials. Ex situ XRD and TEM analyses reveal that the sodium storage reactions of α-, β-, and γ-MnO2 proceed via a conversion reaction mechanism, while the sodium storage reaction of δ-MnO2 is controlled by an insertion/deinsertion mechanism. The findings presented in this study may offer insights into the structure regulation and performance promotion of MnO2-based anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Low-valence titanium sulfides (LVTS) have metal-like electrical conductivities and a strong polysulfide binding abilities, which are promising anodes for sodium ion batteries with high capacities and long cycle lifes. However, it is difficult for traditional synthesis methods to synthesize LVTS without impurities. The electric field regulation method possesses the advantages of flexibility and high efficiency, achieving accurate control of the metal reduction process by adjusting the electrolysis potential and reaction time. In this work, we synthesized a series of LVTS (TiS and Ti2S) using electric field control methods and investigated their electrochemical behaviors as sodium storage anodes for the first time. Compared with traditional TiS2, LVTS display remarkable Na storage properties under the condition of complete electrochemical conversion at 0.005-3 V. Especially for TiS, it demonstrates a high capacity of 409 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 and inspiring cyclic stability over 6000 cycles. The large number of vacancies in the crystal structure can chemically anchor polysulfides and alleviate their dissolution in the electrolyte, resulting in superior long-term cyclic stability. The high intrinsic conductivity of LVTS is in favor of rapid transfer of electrons and promotes the fast conversion of polysulfides to sodium sulfides, thus realizing high reversible capacities. Moreover, with its fast Na+ transport kinetics, the as-prepared TiS demonstrates an impressive rate performance of 321 mAh g-1 at 15 A g-1. Overall, the electric field regulation method is flexible and efficient, which provides a new route for the preparation of high-performance electrode materials. Moreover, nonstoichiometric metal compounds possess abundant active sites and rapid electron transport kinetics, which provide a new choice for promising sodium storage materials in large-scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Flexible polypyrrole (PPy) films with highly ordered structures were fabricated by a novel vapor phase polymerization (VPP) process and used as the anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The PPy films demonstrate excellent rate performance and cycling stability. At a charge/discharge rate of 1 C, the reversible capacities of the PPy film anode reach 284.9 and 177.4 mAh g-1 in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. Even at a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the reversible capacity of the PPy film anode retains 54.0% and 52.9% of the capacity of 1 C in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. After 1000 electrochemical cycles at a rate of 10 C, there is no obvious capacity fading. The molecular structure and electrochemical behaviors of Li- and Na-ion doping and dedoping in the PPy films are investigated by XPS and ex situ XRD. It is believed that the PPy film electrodes in the overoxidized state can be reversibly charged and discharged through the doping and dedoping of lithium or sodium ions. Because of the self-adaptation of the doped ions, the ordered pyrrolic chain structure can realize a fast charge/discharge process. This result may substantially contribute to the progress of research into flexible polymer electrodes in various types of batteries.",

The optimized Fe3O4@FeS electrode shows ultralong cycle life and outstanding rate capability.

More importantly, the prepared Fe3O4@FeS also exhibits excellent full-cell performance.

Furthermore, it is also disclosed that such superior electrochemical properties can be attributed to the pseudocapacitive behavior of FeS shell as demonstrated by the kinetics studies as well as the core-shell structure. In view of the large-scale availability of commercial precursor and ease of preparation, this study provide a scalable strategy to develop advanced anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Because of the large abundance of sodium (Na) as a source material and the easy fabrication of Na‐containing compounds, the sodium (Na) battery is a more environmentally friendly and sustainable technology than the lithium‐ion battery (LIB). Na‐metal batteries (SMBs) are considered promising to realize a high energy density to overtake the cost effectiveness of LIBs, which is critically important in large‐scale applications such as grid energy storage. However, the cycling stability of the Na‐metal anode faces significant challenges particularly under high cycling capacities, due to the complex failure models caused by the formation of Na dendrites. Here, a universal surface strategy, based on a self‐regulating alloy interface of the current collector, to inhibit the formation of Na dendrites is reported. High‐capacity (10 mAh cm−2) Na‐metal anodes can achieve stable cycling for over 1000 h with a low overpotential of 35 mV. When paired with a high‐capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode (7 mAh cm−2), the SMB delivers an unprecedented energy density (calculated based on all the cell components) over 200 Wh kg−1 with flooded electrolyte, or over 230 Wh kg−1 with lean electrolyte. The dendrite‐free SMB also shows high cycling stability with a capacity retention per cycle over 99.9% and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.",

However, charging P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to voltages higher than 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 at 4.35 V (vs. Na+/Na) are achieved through dual‐site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali‐metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O2‐Zn2+O2‐ “pillar” for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the a–b‐plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation.

        "abstract": "Flexible electrodes with superior stability, high performance, and low cost have drawn numerous considerations in energy storage devices. Here, we developed a facile and robust strategy to prepare coal-based carbon dots (i.e., CDs) with high yields derived from lignite by microwave-assisted mild oxidation and further fabricate a carbon nanofiber film decorated with CDs (i.e., CNF@CDs) by electrospinning water-soluble CDs with polyacrylonitrile (i.e., PAN) through thermal treatment and carbonization and applied as flexible electrodes for sodium-ion batteries. The as-prepared CNF@CDs as binder-free anode presents a reversible capacity of 223 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1 and obtains a high capacity retention of 96% over 400 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical properties were attributed to the unique structure of CNF@CDs with the optimal ratio of carbon nanofiber and coal-based carbon dots, in which carbon fiber with the 3D framework facilitates the speed of ion diffusion and electron transport as well as the surface-induced assembly of CDs on the surface of the PAN fibers brings in strong structure stability and electrode integrity. The current study supplies a novel and effective approach to constructing flexible electrodes with superior stability and high performances from low-cost materials, which has potential application prospects in flexible energy storage devices.",

However, their practical application is hindered by challenges such as limited reversible capacity and sluggish transfer kinetics. Herein, we proposed an anion substitution strategy to optimize iron-based sulfate cathode materials. The electrochemical characterization and theoretical calculations confirmed a reduction in the migration barrier of Na+ ions in various pathways. Besides, fluorine weakened the electron density of the crystal plane, thereby impeding the continuous side reaction of the electrolyte. As expected, the NFSF cathode can exhibit a capacity of 121.5 mAh g-1 at 12 mA g-1 and keep a high retention of 78.8% after 1000 cycles at 600 mA g-1. In addition, the NFSF-based cathode and hard carbon (HC)-based anode were assembled into a laboratory-scale pouch cell to demonstrate the electrochemical performance and practical applications.",

        "abstract": "The weak van der Waals interactions of the one-dimensional (1D) chainlike VS4 crystal structure can enable fast charge-transfer kinetics in metal ion batteries, but its potential has been rarely exploited in depth. Herein, a thermodynamics-driven morphology manipulation strategy is reported to tailor VS4 nanosheets into 3D hierarchical self-assembled architectures including nanospheres, hollow nanospheres, and nanoflowers. The ultrathin VS4 nanosheets are generated via 2D anisotropic growth by the strong driving force of coordination interaction from ammonium ions under microwave irradiation and then evolve into 3D sheet-assembled configurations by adjusting the thermodynamic factors of temperature and reaction time. The as-synthesized VS4 nanomaterials present good electrochemical performances as the anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In particular, the hollow VS4 nanospheres show a specific capacity of 1226.7 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 current density after 100 cycles. The hierarchical nanostructures with large specific surface area and structural stability can overcome the difficulty of sodium ions embedding into the bulk material interior and provide more reactive materials at the same material mass loading compared with other morphologies. Both experiment and DFT calculations suggest that VS4 nanosheets reduce reaction kinetic impediment of sodium ion in battery operating. This work demonstrates a way of the morphological design of 2D VS4 nanosheets and application in sodium ion storage.",

However, the relatively larger radius of sodium ions than that of lithium ions is not suitable for storage in conventional graphite, which is widely used as the anode. To resolve this issue, in this study, we developed a new harmonized carbon material with a three-dimensional (3D) grapevine-like structure and a sulfur component using an efficient synthesis process. Based on these advantages, the harmonized sulfur-carbon material exhibited a high reversible capacity of 146 mA h g-1 at an extremely high specific current of 100 A g-1 and long-term galvanostatic cycling stability at 10 and 100 A g-1 with superior electrochemical performance.

Nevertheless, the practical electrochemical performance is severely hampered by poor cyclability due to volumetric expansion of Ge upon cycling. Herein, double-carbon confined cobalt germanium hydroxide (CGH@C/rGO) composites has been facilely synthesized with the supportion of l-ascorbic acid and graphene oxide (GO) as anode materials for sodium-ion storage. As a result, the CGH@C/rGO anode delivers a high cyclic stability with a reversible capacity of 416 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and an excellent rate capability of 206 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 compared with CGH, CGH@C and CGH/rGO composites. Besides, the reversible capacity of 266 mA h g-1 still remained even after 500 cycles at current density of 1 A g-1. Such outstanding electrochemical performance could be accredited to a strong interaction between CGH, carbon, and graphene, which increases the electronic conductivity, relieves the volume expansion aroused by sodiation/desodiation, shortens the pathway of electron/ion transportation that further improving the reaction kinetics and endowing the material with remarkable cycling capability. Obviously, this in situ hydrothermal synthesis of double carbon coating strategy can be extended to designing other candidates of anode materials for SIBs.",

To address the above problems, we herein successfully develop an industrially adaptable process for scalable synthesis of affordable phosphorus/carbon (APC) anode materials with an excellent electrochemical performance at a significantly reduced cost. The key to our success is a delicately designed, self-organized, strongly interactive porous P/C structure filled with sodium alginate binder, which maintains the structural integrity of anode and enhances the electrical contact of red P upon its volume variation via a dual protection from porous structure and strong surface interactions. The APC anodes hence present ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (86.2%), excellent cycling stability, and superior rate capability. The industrially adaptable process and excellent electrochemical performance endow the novel APC nano/microspheres with promising applications in high-performance Na-ion batteries.",

Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are considered potential substitutes for next‐generation low‐cost energy storage systems due to the low cost and abundance of sodium resources. However, the industrialization of SIBs faces a great challenge in terms of the anode. Hard carbon could be a promising anode material due to its high capacity and low cost which originates from biomass. This study used pre‐treatment and template carbonization methods to extract a hard carbon material from a large amount of discarded biomass in bamboo powder waste. This material has a good initial Coulombic efficiency of 78.6 % and good cycling stability when applied to sodium ion batteries.Typically, the optimal hard carbon material is used as the anode to prepare sodium ion battery prototypes to demonstrate their potential applications. The anode exhibited excellent sodium storage performance with a reversible capacity of 303 mAh ⋅ g−1 at 1 C rate and good cycling performance, retaining 92.0 % of its capacity after 100 cycles. These results demonstrate that BPPHC is a promising candidate for anode material in sodium‐ion batteries. This work suggests that bamboo powder could be a low‐cost anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "MoSe2, with its extraordinary theoretical capacity, has emerged as a profoundly auspicious anode material for Sodium-ion Batteries (SIBs). However, the actual realization of SIBs encounters hurdles arising from insufficient electron and ion transportation capabilities, along with the irreversible transformation of Mo/Na2Se into MoSe2, eventually substituted by Mo/Se. In this investigation, By employing Mo-based complexes, we have achieved a triumphant synthesis of C@MoSe2@OMWCNT (oxidized multiwall carbon nanotubes) materials, wherein OMWCNTs serve as the fundamental substrate. Theoretical analysis has revealed that the utilization of OMWCNTs not only enhances the structural stability of the anode materials but also improves the electrical conductivity and Na+ ion mobility (the Na+ diffusion barrier: (MoSe2) 0.91 eV vs (C@MoSe2@OMWCNT) 0.41 eV) of the C@MoSe2@OMWCNT. These properties make C@MoSe2@OMWCNT a promising candidate for the development of high-performance SIBs. Furthermore, the Ex-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) examination, unveils the emergence of Se and MoSe2 within the C@MoSe2@OMWCNT. The findings indicate that the outer carbon coating layer efficiently prevents contact between Se and the electrolyte, thereby impeding the formation of polyselenides. When C@MoSe2@OMWCNT is employed as the anode for the SIB, it exhibits exceptional cycle stability, with a capacity of 303 mA h g−1 and 189 mA h g−1 after 500 and 3000 cycles, respectively, under a current density of 5 A g−1.

When used as anodes for SIBs, the heterojunctions at the interfaces effectively accelerate the Na+ diffusion rate to promote the sodium-storage reaction kinetics. The N and S-codoped carbon provides a rapid conductive framework for the fast charge transport during the sodium-storage process. Moreover, the beneficial confinement effect of the NSC layer effectively guarantees a superb cycle property for the MSS@NSC anode. The favorable synergistic effects between the highly conductive framework of the NSC and MSS heterostructure endow the MSS@NSC anode with satisfactory electrochemical Na-storage properties.",

However, the poor structural stability derived from the large volume expansion and short lifetime impedes their further practical applications. Herein, we report a novel anode with a pomegranate-like nanostructure of SnP2O7 particles homogeneously dispersed in the robust N-doped carbon matrix. For the first time, we make use of in situ self-nanocrystallization to generate ultrafine SnP2O7 particles with a short pathway of ions and electrons to promote the reaction kinetics. Ex situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) shows that the average particle size of SnP2O7 decreases from 66 to 20 nm successfully based on this unique nanoscale-engineering method. Therefore, the nanoparticles together with the N-doped carbon contribute a high pseudocapacitance contribution. Moreover, the N-doped carbon matrix forms strong interaction with the self-nanocrystallization ultrafine SnP2O7 particles, leading to a stable nanostructure without any particle aggregation under a long-cycle operation. Benefiting from these synergistic merits, the SnP2O7@C anode shows a high specific capacity of 403 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 and excellent cycling stability (185 mAh g-1 after 4000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1).

Here, various NCDCMs have been successfully controlled and synthesized by small molecule polymerization methods, and their synthesis process has been also verified by NMR, MOLDI-TOF, TG-MS, etc. When serving as sodium ion battery anodes, the NCDCMs dominated by a high concentration of pyrrolic N (>80.3%) exhibits a satisfactory reversible capacity (434.5 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and 146.7 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1, respectively). It is revealed that pyrrolic N has more suitable adsorption energy and larger interlayer spacing, by density functional theory calculations and electron orbital theory, respectively, which synergistically makes the material obtain excellent electrochemical performance. This research exhibits a more efficient way to reveal the differences in the sodium ions storage behavior of different nitrogen configurations doped carbon, and provides new insight for the precise design and synthesis of a certain type of heteroatom doping to achieve satisfactory electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "The anode/electrolyte interface behavior, and by extension, the overall cell performance of sodium‐ion batteries is determined by a complex interaction of processes that occur at all components of the electrochemical cell across a wide range of size‐ and timescales. Single‐scale studies may provide incomplete insights, as they cannot capture the full picture of this complex and intertwined behavior. Broad, multiscale studies are essential to elucidate these processes. Within this perspectives article, several analytical and theoretical techniques are introduced, and described how they can be combined to provide a more complete and comprehensive understanding of sodium‐ion battery (SIB) performance throughout its lifetime, with a special focus on the interfaces of hard carbon anodes. These methods target various length‐ and time scales, ranging from micro to nano, from cell level to atomistic structures, and account for a broad spectrum of physical and (electro)chemical characteristics. Specifically, how mass spectrometric, microscopic, spectroscopic, electrochemical, thermodynamic, and physical methods can be employed to obtain the various types of information required to understand battery behavior will be explored. Ways are then discussed how these methods can be coupled together in order to elucidate the multiscale phenomena at the anode interface and develop a holistic understanding of their relationship to overall sodium‐ion battery function.",

However, the development of SIBs is limited by the lacking of proper anodes with long cycling lifespans and large reversible capacities. Here we present rational synthesis of Rayleigh-instability-induced bismuth nanorods encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Bi@N-C) using Bi2S3 nanobelts as the template for high-performance SIB. The Bi@N-C electrode delivers superior sodium storage performance in half cells, including a high specific capacity (410 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1), long cycling lifespan (1000 cycles), and superior rate capability (368 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1). When coupled with homemade Na3V2(PO4)3/C in full cells, this electrode also exhibits excellent performances with high power density of 1190 W kg-1 and energy density of 119 Wh kg-1total. The exceptional performance of Bi@N-C is ascribed to the unique nanorod@nanotube structure, which can accommodate volume expansion of Bi during cycling and stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase layer and improve the electronic conductivity.",

        "abstract": "The development of Na-ion full cells (NIFCs) suffers from the issue that the solid electrolyte interphase formation on the carbon anode consumes the limited sodium from cathode and thus incurs the decreased energy density and poor cyclic stability. To address these issues, we herein report that Na2O2 could be used as a sacrificial Na source through spraying its slurry on the surface of cathode, and investigate its stability as well as electrochemical behavior toward NIFCs. The results show that Na2O2 has good chemical and storage stability under a dry atmosphere and has no negative effect on the electrochemical performance of the cathode. Compared with the pristine cathode, the Na2O2-decorated cathode exhibits higher discharge capacity, superior capacity retention, and rate capability in a full cell with a carbon anode. Our cathode Na compensation strategy provides an effective avenue to make up for the irreversible Na+ loss cause by the formation of solid electrolyte interphase on the anode, thereby promoting the electrochemical performance and energy density of NIFCs toward the large-scale application.",

However, challenges such as cumbersome procedures and improper hazardous waste disposal must be effectively addressed. In this work, we propose a simplified and economical method for converting waste LiFePO4 cathode waste to a novel sodium-ion battery anode material. By leveraging waste plastics to catalyze the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at high temperatures, a novel anode material, R-Fe2P/CNT, was fabricated, which exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability (capacity retention rate of 86.36 % at 1.0 A g−1 after 600 cycles) and rate capability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations showed improved sodium adsorption and enhanced electronic conducitivity in R-Fe2P/CNT composites. This strategy effectively recycles the valuable components of used batteries and plastics, offering a new \"treating waste with waste\" concept for the preparation of functional materials.",

P5C6 exhibits superior energetic stability and dynamic stability, with type II band alignment and a 0.73 eV direct band gap, indicating optimal charge diffusion. Electrochemical assessments reveal a low sodium migration barrier (0.019 eV), facilitating rapid charge-discharge rates, with a storage capacity of 590.5 mAh/g and intercalation at a low average voltage (0.27 V). Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) confirm its thermal stability during sodium storage, underscoring P5C6's potential as a promising SIB anode material.",

Vertical MoS2 nanosheet array coated on carbon fibers not only can expose rich active sites and reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, but also improve the electronic conductivity and enhance structural stability.

However, the poor cyclability and safety issues caused by unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and dendrite issues limit their practical application. Herein, it is theoretically predicted that constructing the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure with high work function can lower the Fermi energy level, and therefore effectively suppressing continuous electrolyte decomposition derived from the electron‐tunneling effect after long‐term sodiation process. Furthermore, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) is experimentally fabricated as an advanced Na‐anode current collector. The seamless Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure not only offers abundant active sites to induce uniform Na+ deposition and enhance ion‐transport kinetics, but also facilitates the formation of stable SEI for dendrite‐free sodium anode, which are confirmed by cryogenic components transmission electron microscopy tests and in situ spectroscopy characterization. As a result, the Na‐composite anode (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na) delivers stable plating/stripping process of 5000 h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles. More impressively, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell displays ultralong cycle life of 10 000 cycles at 20 C.

The mesoporous structure is also a promising morphology to obtain better performance for electrochemical and catalytic applications, thanks to its high surface area. A simple one-step electrochemical method is proposed for mesoporous chalcogenides synthesis. The synthesized Cu2 Se material has two types of mesopores (9 and 18 nm in diameter), which are uniformly distributed inside the flakes. These materials are also implemented for sodium (Na) ion battery (NIB) anode as a proof of concept. The electrode employing the mesoporous Cu2 Se exhibits superior and more stable specific capacity as a NIB anode compared to the non-porous samples. The electrode also exhibits excellent rate tolerance at each current density, from 100 to 1000 mA g-1 . It is suggested that the mesoporous structure is advantageous for the insertion of Na ions inside the flakes.

Thus, it is highly preferred to construct porous materials with abundant laminate structures to overcome the ion‐diffusion limitation in MXene multilayer films and increase the accessible interlayer sites. Herein, the enhancement of laminate structures in a pre‐assembled Ti3C2Tx network is achieved, under the effects of interlayer slipping of MXene nanosheets during capillary densification, and finally obtained a dense monolith with both high density (2.37 g cm−3) and high porosity (87.3 m2 g−1). This MXene anode material delivers a high capacity of 185 mAh g−1 and a superior rate performance of 55 mAh g−1 (5 A g−1). With improvement of both density and gravimetric capacity, this monolith has a high volumetric capacity of up to 200 mAh cm−3 at 1 A g−1 even after 2000 cycles. Herein, new insights are provided into the design of high‐capacity MXene anodes for sodium‐ion batteries and control of different 2D materials in compact structures.",

        "title": "The induced formation and regulation of closed-pore structure for biomass hard carbon as anode in sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Biomass hard carbon is regarded as an advanced anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) since it possesses balanced performance including satisfactory specific capacity, suitable operating voltage window and low cost. Although numerous instances of utilizing biomass-derived hard carbon in SIBs have been observed, the unregulated pore structure of these hard carbon materials significantly constrains the electrochemical performance of SIBs, leading to diminished initial Columbic efficiency (ICE) and plateau capacity. Herein, taking a biomass hard carbon derived from waste camellia seed shells (CSSHCs) as a template, we display a correlation between synthesis conditions and pore structure of CSSHCs. CSSHCs are synthesized via a facile route including pre‑carbonization, purifying, mechanical ball-milling and high-temperature carbonization, and it is found that adjusting the secondary calcination temperature can induce the formation of closed pore structure, which is of great benefit to increase the ICE and the plateau-capacity. Besides, it is also proved that the obtained CSSHCs anodes obey a sodium storage mechanism that can be classified as “adsorption-intercalation-pore filling”, which endows SIBs with a competitive electrochemical performance. Specifically, the obtained biomass hard carbons at 1300 °C exhibits the best electrochemical performance among these anodes with the reversible capacity of as high as 270.0 mAh g−1 and a high ICE of 80.1 %, together with an excellent cycle stability (91.0 % capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.1C, 1C = 300 mA g−1). Therefore, this study provides a significant exploration and raw material support for the further utilization of the waste biomass and sustainable development of the anode materials for the large-scale application of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries represent a promising approach for stationary energy storage; however, the lack of appropriate anode materials has substantially retarded their development. Herein, we demonstrated an iron-based phosphate material of Na3Fe3(PO4)4 as an inexpensive and efficacious anode alternative. While the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple renders a two-Na-insertion reaction with desirable potentials, its unique layered structure further facilitates the Na-insertion kinetics and reversibility. Consequently, this electrode exhibits an appealing Na-insertion performance, with a reversible capacity of ∼83 mAh g–1, suitable anode potential of −0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl, excellent rate capability of 200 C, and outstanding cycling of 6000 cycles. Utilizing operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we revealed the structural evolution of the Na3Fe3(PO4)4 anode during the two-electron reaction, where the extremely small volume expansion (∼3%) enables its fast-charging and long-cycling capability. Our work suggests new considerations of developing versatile iron phosphate compounds as appealing anode materials for energy storage in aqueous electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "The particle size of hard carbon used as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) directly affects critical physical properties, including specific surface area and conductivity of the electrode, thereby influencing the electrode's sodium storage performance. However, related research is limited. In this work, lignite‐derived hard carbons with various particle sizes were investigated as anode materials for SIBs. The electrochemical performance and Na+ diffusion capability were evaluated. The results show that smaller particle sizes in hard carbon anodes lead to reduced mesopore volumes, specific surface areas, and coating densities, which effectively improve cycle stability, initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), and rate capability of the electrode. Specifically, hard carbon anodes within a 1–15 µm particle size distribution exhibited a reversible capacity of 251 mAh g−1 and an ICE of 73.67% at a current density of 25 mA g−1. Even after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, these anodes maintained a reversible capacity of 238 mAh g−1, achieving a capacity retention rate of 99.85%.",

        "abstract": "Although hard carbon (HC) demonstrates superior initial Coulombic efficiency, cycling durability, and rate capability in ether‐based electrolytes compared to ester‐based electrolytes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), the underlying mechanisms responsible for these disparities remain largely unexplored. Herein, ex situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and in situ Raman spectroscopy are combined to investigate the Na storage mechanism of HC under different electrolytes. Through deconvolving the EPR signals of Na in HC, quasi‐metallic‐Na is successfully differentiated from adsorbed‐Na. By monitoring the evolution of different Na species during the charging/discharging process, it is found that the initial adsorbed‐Na in HC with ether‐based electrolytes can be effectively transformed into intercalated‐Na in the plateau region. However, this transformation is obstructed in ester‐based electrolytes, leading to the predominant storage of Na in HC as adsorbed‐Na and pore‐filled‐Na. Furthermore, the intercalated‐Na in HC within the ether‐based electrolytes contributes to the formation of a uniform, dense, and stable solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and eventually enhances the electrochemical performance of HC. This work successfully deciphers the electrolyte‐dominated Na+ storage mechanisms in HC and provides fundamental insights into the industrialization of HC in SIBs.",

Herein, we examine the intercalation properties of novel double sodium nickel-manganese sulfate, Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2, having a large monoclinic unit cell, through electrochemical and ex situ diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The sulfate salt Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2 is prepared by thermal dehydration of the corresponding hydrate salt Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2·4H2O having a blödite structure. The intercalation reactions on Na2Ni1-xMnx(SO4)2 are studied in two model cells: half-ion cell versus Li metal anode and full-ion cell versus Li4Ti5O12 anode by using lithium (LiPF6 dissolved in EC/DMC) and sodium electrolytes (NaPF6 dissolved in EC:DEC). Based on ex situ XRD and TEM analysis, it is found that sodium intercalation into Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2 takes place via phase separation into the Ni-rich monoclinic phase and Mn-rich alluaudite phase. The redox reactions involving participation of manganese and titanium ions are monitored by ex situ EPR spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that manganese ions from the sulfate salt are participating in the electrochemical reaction, while the nickel ions remain intact. As a result, a reversible capacity of about 65 mA h g-1 is reached. The selective intercalation properties determine sodium nickel-manganese sulfate as a new electrode material for hybrid lithium-sodium ion batteries that is thought to combine the advantages of individual lithium and sodium batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon with abundant resources, low-cost, and high specific capacity, is a promising anode material for large-scale sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance of hard carbon suffers from serious challenges due to sluggish ion transport dynamic behavior, especially at low potential, in high power density of sodium-ion batteries. To address this issue, we introduce an ionic-conductive sodium-titanate into hard carbon to boost its sodium-ion transport kinetics via constructing a dual ionic-electronic conducting network in hard carbon anode. Benefiting from our design, the optimized hard carbon-sodium titanate electrode achieves high specific capacity of 137 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1, compared to that of hard carbon of 25 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1. Remarkably, it also exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 71.4% at the current density of 2.0 A g−1 after 800 cycles. This work presents a practical strategy for high-rate hard carbon design and provides valuable insights into the construction of high-rate anode for advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Safety hazards caused by flammable electrolytes have been major obstacles to the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The adoption of nonflammable all-phosphate electrolytes can effectively improve the safety of SIBs; however, traditional low-concentration phosphate electrolytes are not compatible with carbon-based anodes. Herein, we report an anion-cation interaction modulation strategy to design low-concentration phosphate electrolytes with superior physicochemical properties. Tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) is introduced as a cosolvent to regulate the ion-solvent-coordinated (ISC) structure through enhancing the anion-cation interactions, forming the stable anion-induced ISC (AI-ISC) structure, even at a low salt concentration (1.22 M). Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculations, we reveal the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Impressively, both the hard carbon (HC) anode and Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode work well with the developed electrolytes. The designed phosphate electrolyte enables Ah-level HC//NFPP pouch cells with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of over 99.9% and a capacity retention of 84.5% after 2000 cycles. In addition, the pouch cells can operate in a wide temperature range (-20 to 60 °C) and successfully pass rigorous safety testing. This work provides new insight into the design of the electrochemically compatibility electrolyte for high-safety and long-lifetime SIBs.",

To address this problem, homogeneous CoP nanoparticles enwrapped in the N-doped carbon (CoP/NC) microspheres are synthesized by the simultaneous carbonization and phosphorization of Co-salen complex microspheres for the first time. The N-doped carbon enhances its conductivity and diminishes the volume stress, and the dispersed CoP nanoparticles in carbon provide more reaction sites, resulting in a superior sodium storage performance. CoP/NC microspheres exhibit the capacity of 373 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Even at 2 A g-1 for 2000 cycles, the capacity of 195 mA h g-1 is also achieved.

        "abstract": "The practical application of sodium-ion batteries is mainly hindered by relatively low energy density, which can be effectively overcome by increasing the pseudo-graphitic content in non-graphitic carbon (NGC) anodes. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy was reported to promote the growth of pseudo-graphitic domains in NGC thanks to the synergistic effect of pre-carbonization and NaOH etching using semi-coke as precursor. Based on pre-carbonization at 800 °C and NaOH etching with NaOH/carbon ratio of 0.5 at 600 °C, the resultant NGC (FC-800–0.5–600) exhibits a 13 % increase in percentage of pseudo-graphitic structure meanwhile 14 % decrease for graphite-like structure, but similar content of highly disordered structure compared with its counterpart. Notably, although similar in sloping capacity, FC-800–0.5–600 possesses much higher plateau capacity (<0.1 V) of 218.6 mAh g−1 than its counterpart (174.9 mAh g−1), which is attributed to the enhanced “interlayer intercalation” effect related with pseudo-graphitic structure. Thus, FC-800–0.5–600 can deliver an impressive reversible capacity of 326.8 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1, together with a considerable ICE of 84.7 %. This work proposed an effective strategy to increase pseudo-graphitic structure content in NGC, providing a rational guide for designing high-performance anodes in SIBs for practical use.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries because of the low cost and natural abundance of sodium resources. Nevertheless, low energy density and poor cycling stability of current SIBs unfavorably hinder their practical implementation for the smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Antimony tin (SnSb) is one of the most promising anode materials for next-generation SIBs attributing to its high capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, the practical application of SnSb anodes in SIBs is currently restricted because of their large volume changes during cycling, which result in serious pulverization and loss of electrical contact between the active material and the carbon conductor. Herein, we apply reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-incorporated SnSb@carbon nanofiber (SnSb@rGO@CNF) composite anodes in SIBs that can sustain their structural stability during prolonged charge-discharge cycles. Electrochemical performance results shed light on that the combination of rGO, CNF, and SnSb alloy led to a high-capacity anode (capacity of 490 mAh g-1  at the 10th cycle) with a high capacity retention of 87.2% and a large Coulombic efficiency of 97.9% at the 200th cycle.

However, performance enhancement is often attributed to the unclear synergistic effects among the active components. A comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms on the interfaces at the atomic level remains elusive. Herein, the carbon‐coated Fe3Se4/CoSe (Fe3Se4/CoSe‐C) anode material as a model featuring atomic‐scale contact interfaces is synthesized. This unique heterogeneous architecture offers an adjustable electronic structure, which facilitates rapid reaction kinetics and enhances structural integrity. In situ microscopic and ex situ spectral characterization techniques, along with theoretical simulations, confirm that the heterointerface with strong electric fields promotes Na+ ion migration. Based on solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, an interface charge storage mechanism is revealed, resulting in the enhanced specific capacity of the anode materials. When employed as an anode in SIBs, the Fe3Se4/CoSe‐C electrode demonstrates excellent rate capabilities (218 mAh g−1 at 7 A g−1) and prolonged cycling stability (258 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 1000 cycles).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries are currently being investigated as an attractive substitute for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in large energy storage systems because of the more abundant and less expensive supply of Na than Li. However, the reversible capacity of Na-ions is limited because Na possesses a large ionic radius and has a higher standard electrode potential than that of Li, making it challenging to obtain electrode materials that are capable of storing large quantities of Na-ions. This study investigates the potential of CoFe2O4 synthesised via the molten salt method as an anode for Na-ion batteries. The obtained phase structure, morphology and charge and discharge properties of CoFe2O4 are thoroughly assessed. The synthesised CoFe2O4 has an octahedron morphology, with a particle size in the range of 1.1–3.6 μm and a crystallite size of ∼26 nm. Moreover, the CoFe2O4 (M800) electrodes can deliver a high discharge capacity of 839 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, reasonable cyclability of 98 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and coulombic efficiency of ∼99%. The improved electrochemical performances of CoFe2O4 can be due to Na-ion-pathway shortening, wherein the homogeneity and small size of CoFe2O4 particles may enhance the Na-ion transportation. Therefore, this simple synthetic approach using molten salt favours the Na-ion diffusion and electron transport to a great extent and maximises the utilisation of CoFe2O4 as a potential anode material for Na-ion batteries.",

However, modification of the inner pore structure of HC still remains a challenge. In this work, porous HCs are synthesized using pitch as the precursor, and the open and closed pores in HC are modified by NaF to obtain NaF@HC and polypropylene (PP)@NaF@HC, respectively. In the results, it is proved that NaF modification can construct closed pores in HC and improve Na+ transportation. Furthermore, NaF modification of the open pores effectively inhibits the electrolyte decomposition. Both NaF@HC and PP@NaF@HC exhibit excellent sodium‐storage performance, which delivers the reversible specific capacities of 310 and 323 mAh g−1, corresponding to the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 72.3% and 82.2%, respectively. Even after 200 cycles, their capacity retentions still maintain 99.5% and 92.8%. Nevertheless, NaF modification of the closed pores increases the sodium deposition barrier, leading to a severe capacity fading of the plateau capacity at a high current rate. In this study, the structural regulation of open and closed pores in HC can be guided, thereby improving its sodium‐storage kinetics.",

MTPPB can realize a spontaneous cross-coordination solvation structure with NaPF6 by selective affinity, synchronously optimizing the interfacial chemistry and sodium storage process. The advantages of the chemical π-π bridging of MTPP+-HC and interaction of MTPP+-PF6- contribute to preferential and oriented reduction of PF6-, forming a low-resistance supramolecular SEI. Additionally, Na+-Br- coordination weakens the Na+-solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de-solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6%, desirable rate capability under 25 °C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1 C under -20 °C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3% and a 15% increment of energy density under 25 °C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC-based SIBs with high energy/power density and long-life span in the extended operating-temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Cobalt disulfides with high theoretical capacity are regarded as appropriate anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but their intrinsically low conductivity and large volume expansion lead to a poor electrochemical performance. In this work, graphitic carbon coated CoS2 nanoparticles are encapsulated in bamboo-like carbon nanotubes by pyrolysis and sulfidation process. Graphitic carbon can improve the electrical conductivity and prevent the agglomeration of CoS2 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, bamboo-like carbon nanotubes can serve as conductive skeleton frames to provide rapid and constant transport pathways for electrons and offer void space to buffer the volume change of CoS2 nanoparticles. The advanced anode material exhibits a long-term capacity of 432.6 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 900 cycles and a rate capability of 419.6 mA h g−1 even at 10 A g−1 in the carbonate ester-based electrolyte.

        "abstract": "Carbon material has emerged as a highly promising anode for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to its abundance of resources, cost‐effectiveness, and high carbon yield. This work elaborately designs the precursor structure for the self‐assembly of melamine‐cyanuric acid on the anthracite surface through hydrogen bonding, and successfully constructs N‐doped carbon with tailored microstructure and expanded interlayer spacing. Serving as anode for SIBs, the optimized sample delivers high specific capacity (371.3 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1), superior rate capability (295.8 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1), and excellent ultra‐long cycling performance (the retention of 91.5% after 3000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1). The systematic investigations reveal the enhancement of sodium‐ion storage in the low‐voltage plateau region involving the interlayer intercalation coupled with nanopores filling. It is discovered that the microporous structure formed by the appropriate graphite sheet angle influences the migration and storage of sodium ions. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption capacity for sodium ion is enhanced and the migration energy barrier perpendicular to the graphite layer is reduced at the appropriate angle of 8°. This study provides novel insights into the sodium‐ion storage mechanism, offering guidance for the better design of anthracite‐based carbon anode with superior performance.",

        "abstract": "Developing high‐capacity and high‐rate anodes is significant to engineering sodium‐ion batteries with high energy density and high power density. Layered Na2Ti3O7 (NTO), with an open crystal structure, large theoretical capacity, and low working potential, is recognized as one of the prospective anodes for sodium storage. Nevertheless, it suffers from sluggish sodiation kinetics and low (micro)structure stability triggered by a high Na+ diffusion barrier and weak adhesion of [Ti3O7] slabs. Herein, the interlayered local structure of NTO is regulated to solve the above issues, in which parts of interlayered Na+ sites are substituted by H+ (Na2−xHxTi3O7 [NHTO]). Theoretical calculations prove that the NHTO offers lower activation energy for Na+ transports and low interlayer spacings with alleviated Na–Na repulsion and relatively flexible [Ti3O7] slabs to reduce fractural stress. In situ and ex situ characterizations of (micro)structure evolution reveal that NHTO goes through transformation between H‐rich and Na‐rich phases, resulting in high structure stability and microstructure integrity. The optimal NHTO anode delivers a high capacity of 190.6 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 300 cycles and a superior high‐rate stability of 90.6 mA h g−1 at 50 C over 10,000 cycles at room temperature. Besides, it offers a capacity of 50.3 mA h g−1 after 1800 cycles at a low temperature of −20°C and 195.7 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a high temperature of 40°C at 0.5 C. The developed topologically interlayered local structure regulation strategy would raise the prospect of designing high‐performance layered anodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are now close to replacing lithium-ion batteries because they provide superior alternative energy storage solutions that are in great demand, particularly for large-scale applications. To that end, the present study is focused on the properties of a new type of dual-electrode material, Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, synthesized using a mixed hydroxy-carbonate route. Cyclic voltammetry confirms that redox couples, at high and low voltage ranges, are facilitated by the unique features and properties of this dual-electrode, through sodium ion deintercalation/intercalation into the layered Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 material. This material provides superior performance for Na-ion batteries, as evidenced by the fabricated sodium cell that yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 125/218 mAh g-1 in the voltage range of 1.5-4.4 V at 0.5 C. At a low voltage range (1.5-2.6 V), the anode cell delivered discharge-charge capacities of 100/99 mAh g-1 with 99% capacity retention, which corresponds to highly reversible redox reaction of the Mn4+/3+ reduction and the Mn3+/4+ oxidation observed at 1.85 and 2.06 V, respectively. The symmetric Na-ion cell, fabricated using Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 196/187 μAh at 107 μA.

        "abstract": "The conventional carbonization process for synthesizing hard carbons (HCs) requires high-temperature furnace operations exceeding 1000 °C, leading to excessive energy consumption and lengthy processing times, which necessitates the exploration of more efficient synthesis methods. This study demonstrates the rapid preparation of HC anodes using intense pulsed light (IPL)-assisted photothermal carbonization without the prolonged and complex operations typical of traditional carbonization methods. A composite film of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is carbonized at high temperatures in less than 1 min. The SWCNTs efficiently absorbed light energy, enabling ultrafast heating and eliminating the need for prolonged, high-energy furnace-based processes. The IPL-assisted HC anodes exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, with an initial desodiation capacity of 260.4 mAh g⁻¹anode and 97.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles. These results are comparable to those achieved using traditional furnace-based carbonization processes, such as carbonizing HC anodes at 1200 °C, validating the effectiveness of IPL-assisted processes. Additionally, surface and structural analyses revealed the development of pseudo-graphitic domains, crucial for enhanced sodium-ion storage. This research highlights IPL-assisted photothermal carbonization as a viable, time-efficient, and energy-saving alternative to conventional methods, offering a sustainable pathway for the large-scale production of HC anodes for future sodium-ion battery technologies.",

The CMK-8 not only serves as an electronic conducting pathway, but also creates interpenetrating tunnels, which guarantee electrolyte accessibility and thus Na+ transport throughout the electrode. Moreover, the change in the SnO2 volume during sodiation/desodiation can be accommodated by the CMK-8 framework. With a high tap density of ∼1000 mg cm-3 (vs. ∼800 mg cm-3 for the conventional NIB anode, hard carbon), the SnO2/CMK-8 anode shows a high reversible capacity of 800 mA h g-1 and excellent rate capability, delivering 330 mA h g-1 in ∼10 min. The electrode charge storage mechanism is examined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction.

The unique tubular structure enables the highly reversible Li/Na storage with high specific capacity, enhanced cycling stability, and superior rate performance. It is indicated that the contribution of partial pseudocapacitive behavior greatly improves the rate capability for SIBs, where a high capacity retention of 81.5% can be obtained when the current densities range from 0.1 to 3 A g-1 (460 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 vs 379 mA h g-1 at 3 A g-1). This work provides an effective design rationale on transition-metal diselenide-based tubular nanostructures as superior hosts for both Li and Na ions, which could push forward the development of practical applications of transition-metal diselenide-based anodes in LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are perceived as competitive candidate anodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) on account of their high capacity and admirable reversibility. However, a majority of TMSs suffer from huge volume expansion and poor kinetics so they cannot achieve durable and fast Na+ storage. Herein, a cation vacancy‐ordered Cr2/3S is fabricated by extracting quantitative Cr atoms from nickel arsenide type CrS via sulfur “atomic pump,” that is, sulfur and particular sit Cr atoms are bonded to extend a new structure. The ordered vacancies not only construct a loosely‐packed crystal structure but also induce delocalized electron states of Cr atoms, hence effectively accelerating Na+ diffusion and releasing volume strain to enable high‐rate and longevous SIBs. The new Cr2/3S anode presents a high reversible capacity of 544 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1 and excellent high‐rate performance of ≈100% capacity retention after 7000 cycles at 20 A g−1. Subsequent in situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the Na+ storage mechanism of Cr2/3S. The proposed cation exaction strategy through an innovative sulfur “atomic pump” can be an efficient way to achieve loosely‐packed structure material for large‐capacity and fast‐kinetics anodes.",

Yet, conventional SIBs are in the depths of inferior charge/discharge efficiency and cyclability at elevated temperatures. Rational structure design is highly desirable. Hence, a 3D hierarchical flower architecture self-assembled by carbon-coated Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 (NVP) nanosheets (NVP@C-NS-FL) is fabricated via a microwave-assisted glycerol-mediated hydrothermal reaction combined with a post heat-treatment. The growth mechanism of NVP@C-NS-FL is systematically investigated, by forming a microspherical glycerol/polyglycerol-NVP complex initially and then converting into flower-like architecture during the subsequent annealing at a low temperature ramping rate. Benefiting from the integrated structure, fast Na+ transportation, and highly effective heat transfer, the as-obtained NVP@C-NS-FL exhibits an excellent high-temperature SIB performance, e.g., 65 mAh g-1 (100 C) after 1000 cycles under 60 °C. When coupled with NaTi2 (PO4 )3 anode, the full cell can still display superior power capability of 1.4 kW kg-1 and long-term cyclability (2000 cycles) under 60 °C.",

The product of CoS 2 nanoparticles dispersed in N-doped hollow spheres (N-HCS) was prepared through sulfurization treatment (CoS 2 /S@N-HCS). During the sulfuration process, S will penetrate into the PAA and be embedded in the graphite layer along with the carbonization process. It was found that during the charging and discharging process, the S in the carbon layer will gradually dissolve out, thereby forming new ion diffusion channels in the carbon spheres and exposing more CoS 2 active sites. CoS 2 /S@N-HCS composite exhibits a specific capacity of 729.6 mAh g -1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g -1 . The sodium storage mechanism and reaction kinetics of the materials were further measured by in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex-situ X-ray diffraction, capacitance performance evaluation and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting worldwide attention due to their multiple merits including abundant reserve and safety. However, industrialization is challenged by the scarcity of high-performance carbon anodes with high specific capacities. Here, we report the metal-assisted microcrystalline structure regulation of carbon materials to achieve high-capacity sodium storage. Systematic investigations of in situ thermal-treatment X-ray diffraction and multiple spectroscopies uncover the regulation mechanism of constructing steric hindrance (C-O-C bonds) to restrain the aromatic polycondensation reaction. The carbon precursor of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-type pitch contributes to a high carbon yield rate (40%) compared with those of resin and biomass precursors. The as-synthesized carbon materials deliver high capacities of up to 390 mAh g-1, surpassing many reported carbon anodes for SIBs. Through correlating specific capacity with ID/IG values in Raman spectra and theoretical calculation of carbon materials regulated by different metal elements (Mn, Nb, Ce, Cr, and V), we identify and propose the binding energy as the descriptor for characterizing the capability of regulating the carbon microcrystalline structure to promote sodium storage. This work provides a universal method for regulating the carbon structure, which may lead to the controlled design and fabrication of carbon materials for energy storage and conversion and beyond.",

We also found that the inferior cycling stability of Na_2TP as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) than lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) could be due to the larger ion radium of Na^+ than Li^+, which results in larger steric resistance and polarization during EES. The Na_2TP, therefore, shows greater changes in spectra during de/sodiation than de/lithiation. We expect that our findings could provide a reference for the rational design of organic compounds for EES.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have been one of the most promising alternatives for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale energy storage systems due to cost-efficiency and rich resources of sodium. However, graphite, a commercial anode material of LIBs, shows a very low reversible capacity for sodium-ion storage because of the weak binding between sodium and graphite. Herein, an activated graphite (AG) material with abundant defects including edges and vacancies with oxygenic functional groups is well-designed and fabricated by a facile and eco-friendly ball-milling method. The structural evolutions during the ball-milling process and their effects on electrochemical sodium-ion storage performance are investigated. A stable reversible capacity of 139.1 mA h g-1 can be achieved at 1.0 A g-1 even after 4500 cycles for the AG-50 electrode with the 50-hour ball-milling treatment, amounting to a very low decay ratio of 0.0034% per cycle. Based on physical characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the greatly improved specific capacity and cycling stability of the AG anode for sodium-ion storage can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer space, increased specific surface area, and introduced defects caused by ball-milling treatment, which provide vast active sites for reversible sodium-ion storage based on a adsorption/desorption mechanism, thus leading to great improvement in the specific capacity of the AG electrode. These results can provide a meaningful reference for the application of modified graphite for high-performance sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus has been recognized as a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) because of its large theoretical capacity and suitable sodiation potential. However, low conductivity, large volume change, and incomplete alloy/de-alloy caused by a high formation energy (Ef) of a Na3P sodiation product hinder its practical applications. Herein, we found that element Se can offer a relatively low Ef for a sodiation product and form a robust P–Se bond, which effectively improves the conductivity and Na+ reaction kinetics. In this direction, heteroatomic amorphous phosphorus-rich phosphorus selenides molecules encapsulated into porous carbon nanotubes (a-P9Se@pCNTs) were successfully prepared, showing a highly reversible Na+ storage ability with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%, a high specific capacity of 2215 mAh/g, and an excellent rate capability even at a high mass loading of ∼70 wt %. The combined density functional theory calculations and comprehensive experimental study authenticate that the lower formation energy of a sodiated product and the fast ion transport ability of P9Se can significantly accelerate reversible alloy/de-alloy reaction, improve pulverization issues, and restrain the undesired decomposition of an electrolyte, resulting in full nearly utilization of an active material and a stable solid electrolyte interphase. The present ﬁnding demonstrates an innovative design pathway for a red phosphorus anode and guides substantial progress of energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium disulfide (VS_2) as a typical two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenide has excellent competitiveness for sodium-ion storage due to its wide layer spacing (0.575 nm), high theoretical capacity of 932 mAh·g^−1 originating from multi-electron electrochemical redox. However, continuous sodiation process accompanied by crystal structural evolution and collapse cause rapid capacity decaying. Herein, novel few-layer VS_2 nanosheets with open (001) crystal planes are in-situ constructed on reduced graphene oxide to solve these issues mentioned above. It indicates that few-layer VS_2 provides more Na^+ storage activity due to the low Na^+ surface migration energy barrier on exposed crystal (001) planes. The flexible and high electronic conductivity of carbon matrix also effectively builds multi-level buffer structure and electron transport kinetics to boost the Na^+ insertion/conversion reactive activity on VS_2 as well as Na^+ pseudocapacitance storage kinetics on edges and defects of nanosheets. Those coupling effects result in high rate capability and long cycling stability as a battery/capacitor anode. It delivers conspicuous high energy density of 81 and 40 Wh·kg^−1 at power density of 118 and 10,286 W·kg^−1, as well as 80% energy retention rate after 5000 cycles, confirming its great application potential in sodium-based storage devices.

        "abstract": "Layered germanium phosphide (GeP) is considered a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity and rapid Li+/Na+ diffusion. Herein, we first reveal that the pristine GeP nanosheet shows ∼110 % and 128 % volume expansion during the first lithiation/sodiation by in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively, which leads to severe detectable fractures or cracks of the GeP anode. Thus, we revisit the failure mechanism of the GeP anode is attributed to the unsatisfactory mechanical robustness. Then, we propose a simple and efficient strategy that combines GeP nanosheets with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to design a GeP/SWCNTs composite anode. Nanoindentation experiments and theoretical calculations confirm that the GeP/SWCNTs composite exhibits reduced internal stress to alleviate expansion in the first lithiation/sodiation. As a result, the GeP/SWCNTs composite anode delivers an initial Coulombic efficiency of ∼85 % and ∼90 % in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. More importantly, the specific capacity retentions are improved from ∼11 % and ∼8 % after 50 cycles to ∼50 % and ∼51 % remarkably after 200 cycles in LIBs and SIBs, respectively.",

Nevertheless, their deficiencies such as ultralong sonication time, limited flake size distribution, and uncontrollable thicknesses are major hurdles for the development of phosphorene‐based materials. Herein, electrochemical cationic intercalation has been introduced to prepare phosphorene, through which large‐area FL‐P without surface functional groups can be efficiently attained (less than 1 h). More importantly, its layer number (from 2 to 11 layers) can be manipulated by changing the applied potential. The as‐obtained phosphorene delivers superior sodium‐storage performances when directly utilized as an anode material in sodium‐ion batteries. This electrochemical cation insertion method to prepare phosphorene should greatly facilitate the development of phosphorene‐based technologies. Moreover, this work provides the possibility for the scalable preparation of monolayer 2D materials by exploring intercalation ions. Additionally, the successful electrochemical exfoliation of phosphorene can promote the application of electrochemical exfoliation in other 2D materials.",

In this study, mango peel is utilized as a raw material to synthesize a N-doped hard carbon by hydrothermal pre-carbonization, acid treatment and carbonization. The electrochemical performance of the hard carbon in sodium-ion half-cells is investigated. The results substantiate that the spherical morphology is induced by hydrothermal pre-carbonization, and the N-doping and expanded interlayer spacing result in augmented active sites for Na+ storage and increased capacitive behavior. These effects enhance the storage capacity for Na+ and promote electrode kinetics. Consequently, the hard carbon obtained by hydrothermal pre-carbonization and acid treating exhibits outstanding electrochemical properties, including a high specific capacity of 275 mAh/g at 100 mA g−1, enhanced rate capability and excellent cycling stability (no capacity attenuation after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g−1).

        "abstract": "Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1 V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over-sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9-Fluorenoneb (9-FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55 V and 1.07 V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9-FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high-performance sodium-ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.",

        "title": "A core-shell structure of polydopamine-coated phosphorus-carbon nanotube composite for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "The electrochemical performance of red phosphorus is severely limited by its low electrical conductivity and large-volume-expansion-induced material pulverization and continuous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. Conductive coating has been regarded as an ideal approach to address these issues. In this paper, we design a rational strategy to improve the sodium storage performance of red phosphorus by in situ coating of a polydopamine layer on phosphorus-carbon nanotube hybrid (P-CNT@PD) via a self-polymerization of dopamine under weak base conditions. The in situ generated PD coating can provide an elastic buffer for accommodating the volume change of active materials and prevent their direct contact with the electrolyte. Due to the conductive and elastic PD coating, the P-CNT@PD composite presents a high rate capacity (1060 mA h g-1 at the second discharge and 730 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles at 2.6 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (470 mA h g-1 after 5000 cycles at 5.2 A g-1) as an anode for sodium ion batteries. This facile and scalable synthesis route provides a favorable approach for the mass production of high performance electrodes for sodium ion batteries.",

        "title": "An effective model for sodium insertion in hard carbons.",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (NIBs) are a potential alternative to Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) because of their lower cost and greater availability. As anodes, hard carbons (HCs) seem to be the most promising candidates for NIBs. Previous numerical theoretical research studies have focussed on the general conditions for Na insertion in HCs, while experiments have shown that the properties of Na insertion in HCs depend strongly on specific material properties of HCs. Our target is building an effective model based on experimental data and the volume expansion phenomenon as a base for constructing chemical potentials and free energies efficiently as the starting point for continuum modeling of intercalation in HCs. In our effective model, HC is treated implicitly, while Na is simulated in a confined space, created by the HC. To reproduce the complex intercalation behavior of Na, different intercalation sites at different energy levels must be introduced. The results show good agreement with the experimental data and clarify the contribution of different Na insertion sites and the exchange between different sites of Na to the open circuit voltage as well as their contribution to the reversible and irreversible capacity of Na in HCs.",

        "title": "A Superior Sodium/Lithium-Ion Storage Material: Sea Sponge C/Sn2Fe@GO.",
        "abstract": "A well-structured anode nanomaterial, which can ensure electron and ion transport and avoid excessive pulverization, is of crucial importance to achieve high capacity with superior cycling stability for both sodium- and lithium-ion batteries (SIBs and LIBs). For the purpose of a superior rate performance, this work here has designed and successfully synthesized a new Na+/Li+ storage nanomaterial of SCS/Sn2Fe@GO through loading of a Sn2Fe nanoalloy on sea-sponge-like carbon spheres (SCSs), followed by a graphene oxide (GO) wrapping process. In such a designed composite, the SCS skeleton ensures electronic conductivity and shorts Na+ and Li+ diffusion pathways, while the Sn2Fe nanoalloy delivers a high capacity and prevents excessive pulverization. The GO shell around SCS/Sn2Fe greatly enhances the cyclability. Used as an anode, the SCS/Sn2Fe@GO nanocomposite enables a high capacity up to 660 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, which is maintained without decay up to 800 cycles in SIBs, and up to 850 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 after 3500 cycles in LIBs, proving its applicability in new-generation SIBs and LIBs.",
