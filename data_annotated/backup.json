        "text": "As the production and consumption of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) increase, the recycling of spent LIBs appears inevitable from an environmental, economic and health viewpoint. The leaching behavior of Ni, Mn, Co, Al and Cu from treated cathode active materials, which are separated from a commercial LIB pack in hybrid electric vehicles, is investigated with ammoniacal leaching agents based on ammonia, ammonium carbonate and ammonium sulfite. Ammonium sulfite as a reductant is necessary to enhance leaching kinetics particularly in the ammoniacal leaching of Ni and Co. Ammonium carbonate can act as a pH buffer so that the pH of leaching solution changes little during leaching. Co and Cu can be fully leached out whereas Mn and Al are hardly leached and Ni shows a moderate leaching efficiency. It is confirmed that the cathode active materials are a composite of LiMn2O4, LiCoxMnyNizO2, Al2O3 and C while the leach residue is composed of LiNixMnyCozO2, LiMn2O4, Al2O3, MnCO3 and Mn oxides. Co recovery via the ammoniacal leaching is believed to gain a competitive edge on convenitonal acid leaching both by reducing the sodium hydroxide expense for increasing the pH of leaching solution and by removing the separation steps of Mn and Al.",

Here, Professor Arumugam Manthiram looks back at the evolution of cathode chemistry, discussing the three major categories of oxide cathode materials with an emphasis on the fundamental solid-state chemistry that has enabled these advances. Lithium-ion batteries have aided the portable electronics revolution for nearly three decades. They are now enabling vehicle electrification and beginning to enter the utility industry. The emergence and dominance of lithium-ion batteries are due to their higher energy density compared to other rechargeable battery systems, enabled by the design and development of high-energy density electrode materials. Basic science research, involving solid-state chemistry and physics, has been at the center of this endeavor, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. With the award of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to the development of lithium-ion batteries, it is enlightening to look back at the evolution of the cathode chemistry that made the modern lithium-ion technology feasible. This review article provides a reflection on how fundamental studies have facilitated the discovery, optimization, and rational design of three major categories of oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries, and a personal perspective on the future of this important area.",

Metal oxides are commonly used in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathodes and there is still a lack of understanding of the role of OVs in LIB research field. Here, we report on the behavior of OVs in a single-crystal LIB cathode during the non-equilibrium states of charge and discharge. We found that microcrack evolution in a single crystal occurs due to OV condensation in specific crystallographic orientations generated by the continuous migration of OVs and TM ions. Moreover, understanding the effects of the presence and diffusion of OVs in metal oxides enables the elucidation of most of the conventional mechanisms of capacity fading in LIBs and provides new insights for new electrochemical applications.",

After etching and subsequent carbon coating, the treated Ge nanostructures provide good electrical conductivity and are resistant to gradual deterioration, resulting in superior electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs, with a charge capacity retention of 96% after 100 cycles and a high specific capacity of 1360‚ÄÖmA h g^‚àí1 at 1‚ÄÖC and a high-rate capability with reversible capacities of 1080 and 850‚ÄÖmA h g^‚àí1 at the rates of 5 and 10‚ÄÖC, respectively.

        "text": "A novel process for extracting transition metals, recovering lithium and regenerating cathode materials based on facile co-extraction and co-precipitation processes has been developed. 100% manganese, 99% cobalt and 85% nickel are co-extracted and separated from lithium by D2EHPA in kerosene. Then, Li is recovered from the raffinate as Li2CO3 with the purity of 99.2% by precipitation method. Finally, organic load phase is stripped with 0.5M H2SO4, and the cathode material LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 is directly regenerated from stripping liquor without separating metal individually by co-precipitation method. The regenerative cathode material LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 is miro spherical morphology without any impurities, which can meet with LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 production standard of China and exhibits good electrochemical performance. Moreover, a waste battery management model is introduced to guarantee the material supply for spent battery recycling.",

The movement of lithium ions into and out of electrodes is central to the operation of lithium-ion batteries. Although this process has been extensively studied at the device level, it remains insufficiently characterized at the nanoscale level of grain clusters, single grains and defects. Here, we probe the spatial variation of lithium-ion diffusion times in the battery-cathode material LiCoO_2 at a resolution of ‚àº100¬†nm by using an atomic force microscope to both redistribute lithium ions and measure the resulting cathode deformation. The relationship between diffusion and single grains and grain boundaries is observed, revealing that the diffusion coefficient increases for certain grain orientations and single-grain boundaries. This knowledge provides feedback to improve understanding of the nanoscale mechanisms underpinning lithium-ion battery operation.",

        "text": "Currently, exploring high‚Äêvolumetric‚Äêcapacity electrode materials that allow for reversible (de‚Äê)insertion of large‚Äêsize K+ ions remains challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode for storage of K+ ions due to its high volumetric capacity, confirmed in lithium‚Äê/sodium‚Äêion batteries, and the intrinsic good electronic conductivity. However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium‚Äêion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now. Here, a novel K‚ÄìTe battery is constructed, and the K+‚Äêion storage mechanism of Te is revealed to be a two‚Äêelectron conversion‚Äêtype reaction of 2K + Te ‚Üî K2Te, resulting in a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm‚àí3. Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm‚àí3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high‚Äêrate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm‚àí3 at 15 C, and superior long‚Äêterm cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C. This excellent electrochemical performance proves the feasibility of utilizing Te as a high‚Äêvolumetric‚Äêcapacity active material for storage of K+ ions and will advance the practical application of KIBs.",

        "text": "High-tap-density silicon nanomaterials are highly desirable as anodes for lithium ion batteries, due to their small surface area and minimum first-cycle loss. However, this material poses formidable challenges to polymeric binder design. Binders adhere on to the small surface area to sustain the drastic volume changes during cycling; also the low porosities and small pore size resulting from this material are detrimental to lithium ion transport. This study introduces a new binder, poly(1-pyrenemethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PPyMAA), for a high-tap-density nanosilicon electrode cycled in a stable manner with a first cycle efficiency of 82%-a value that is further improved to 87% when combined with graphite material. Incorporating the MAA acid functionalities does not change the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) features or lower the adhesion performance of the PPy homopolymer. Our single-molecule force microscopy measurement of PPyMAA reveals similar adhesion strength between polymer binder and anode surface when compared with conventional polymer such as homopolyacrylic acid (PAA), while being electronically conductive. The combined conductivity and adhesion afforded by the MAA and pyrene copolymer results in good cycling performance for the high-tap-density Si electrode.",

        "text": "A facile process is demonstrated for the synthesis of layered SiCN-MoS_2 structure via pyrolysis of polysilazane functionalized MoS_2 flakes. The layered morphology and polymer to ceramic transformation on MoS_2 surfaces was confirmed by use of electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. Tested as thick film electrode in a Li-ion battery half-cell, SiCN-MoS_2 showed the classical three-stage reaction with improved cycling stability and capacity retention than neat MoS_2. Contribution of conversion reaction of Li/MoS_2 system on overall capacity was marginally affected by the presence of SiCN while Li-irreversibility arising from electrolyte decomposition was greatly suppressed. This is understood as one of the reasons for decreased first cycle loss and increased capacity retention. SiCN-MoS_2 in the form of self-supporting paper electrode (at 6‚ÄÖmg¬∑cm^‚àí2) exhibited even better performance, regaining initial charge capacity of approximately 530‚ÄÖmAh¬∑g^‚àí1 when the current density returned to 100‚ÄÖmA¬∑g^‚àí1 after continuous cycling at 2400‚ÄÖmA¬∑g^‚àí1 (192‚ÄÖmAh¬∑g^‚àí1). MoS_2 cycled electrode showed mud-cracks and film delamination whereas SiCN-MoS_2 electrodes were intact and covered with a uniform solid electrolyte interphase coating. Taken together, our results suggest that molecular level interfacing with precursor‚Äìderived SiCN is an effective strategy for suppressing the metal-sulfide/electrolyte degradation reaction at low discharge potentials.",

Their microscopically inhomogeneous nature calls for characterization tools that provide operando and localized information from individual grains and particles. Here, we describe an approach that enables imaging the nanoscale distribution of ions during electrochemical charging of a battery in a transmission electron microscope liquid flow cell. We use valence energy-loss spectroscopy to track both solvated and intercalated ions, with electronic structure fingerprints of the solvated ions identified using an ab initio nonlinear response theory. Equipped with the new electrochemical cell holder, nanoscale spectroscopy and theory, we have been able to determine the lithiation state of a LiFePO4 electrode and surrounding aqueous electrolyte in real time with nanoscale resolution during electrochemical charge and discharge. We follow lithium transfer between electrode and electrolyte and image charging dynamics in the cathode. We observe competing delithiation mechanisms such as core-shell and anisotropic growth occurring in parallel for different particles under the same conditions. This technique represents a general approach for the operando nanoscale imaging of electrochemically active ions in the electrode and electrolyte in a wide range of electrical energy storage systems.",

        "text": "Though high entropy oxides have been explored as possible conversion-type negative electrodes for Li-ion batteries, the roles of the different elements remain unclear. Here the authors determine the behavior of each element during electrochemical cycling and connect it to the nanoscale structure. High entropy oxides (HEOs) with chemically disordered multi-cation structure attract intensive interest as negative electrode materials for battery applications. The outstanding electrochemical performance has been attributed to the high-entropy stabilization and the so-called ‚Äòcocktail effect‚Äô. However, the configurational entropy of the HEO, which is thermodynamically only metastable at room-temperature, is insufficient to drive the structural reversibility during conversion-type battery reaction, and the ‚Äòcocktail effect‚Äô has not been explained thus far. This work unveils the multi-cations synergy of the HEO Mg_0.2Co_0.2Ni_0.2Cu_0.2Zn_0.2O at atomic and nanoscale during electrochemical reaction and explains the ‚Äòcocktail effect‚Äô. The more electronegative elements form an electrochemically inert 3-dimensional metallic nano-network enabling electron transport. The electrochemical inactive cation stabilizes an oxide nanophase, which is semi-coherent with the metallic phase and accommodates Li^+ ions. This self-assembled nanostructure enables stable cycling of micron-sized particles, which bypasses the need for nanoscale pre-modification required for conventional metal oxides in battery applications. This demonstrates elemental diversity is the key for optimizing multi-cation electrode materials.",

        "text": "Iron pyrite (FeS2) is a promising lithium ion battery cathode material because of its low cost and ultra-high energy density (1671 Wh kg-1). However, its reaction mechanisms are still controversial. In this work, we find that different from the conventional beliefs that a formation of an intermediate phase Li2FeS2 and then Fe/Li2S composites at the initial discharge, it undergoes a one-step reaction (FeS2 ‚Üí Fe + Li2S) or a two-step reaction (FeS2 ‚Üí FeS + Li2S‚Üí Fe + Li2S), which depends on current rate and temperature. In the charge process, it undergoes a two-step reaction: a phase transition Fe + Li2S ‚Üí FeS at about 1.74 V; a generation of elemental sulfur (Li2S ‚Üí S, 2.30 V). FeS is a mackinawite phase which is formed on the interface of Li2S via a hetero-epitaxial growth. In the subsequent cycles, it is a combination reaction behavior of FeS and S. The reaction mechanism suggests that FeS2 suffers from the challenges of conversion reaction materials both FeS and S, such as big volume change, voltage hysteresis, and polysulfide dissolution. These findings would help understand the intrinsic capacity fading of FeS2 and provide guidelines to improve its electrochemical performances.",

Recently, Si nanostructures-based lithium-ion battery anode, with sophisticated structure designs and process development, has made significant progress. However, low cost and scalable processes to produce these Si nanostructures remained as a challenge, which limits the widespread applications. Herein, we demonstrate that Si nanoparticles with controlled size can be massively produced directly from low grade Si sources through a scalable high energy mechanical milling process. In addition, we systematically studied Si nanoparticles produced from two major low grade Si sources, metallurgical silicon (‚àº99 wt % Si, $1/kg) and ferrosilicon (‚àº83 wt % Si, $0.6/kg). It is found that nanoparticles produced from ferrosilicon sources contain FeSi2, which can serve as a buffer layer to alleviate the mechanical fractures of volume expansion, whereas nanoparticles from metallurgical Si sources have higher capacity and better kinetic properties because of higher purity and better electronic transport properties. Ferrosilicon nanoparticles and metallurgical Si nanoparticles demonstrate over 100 stable deep cycling after carbon coating with the reversible capacities of 1360 mAh g(-1) and 1205 mAh g(-1), respectively. Therefore, our approach provides a new strategy for cost-effective, energy-efficient, large scale synthesis of functional Si electrode materials.",

        "text": "The authors show that after cycling the model cathode material Li_2Ru_0.5Mn_0.5O_3 undergoes ruthenium segregation and even exsolution at the reconstructed oxide surface, which triggers a progressive degradation process. The insights enable new dimensions in choosing dopants for stabilized cathode surface. Despite the importance of studying the instability of delithiated cathode materials, it remains difficult to underpin the degradation mechanism of lithium-rich cathode materials due to the complication of combined chemical and structural evolutions. Herein, we use state-of-the-art electron microscopy tools, in conjunction with synchrotron X-ray techniques and first-principle calculations to study a 4 d -element-containing compound, Li_2Ru_0.5Mn_0.5O_3. We find surprisingly, after cycling, ruthenium segregates out as metallic nanoclusters on the reconstructed surface. Our calculations show that the unexpected ruthenium metal segregation is due to its thermodynamic insolubility in the oxygen deprived surface. This insolubility can disrupt the reconstructed surface, which explains the formation of a porous structure in this material. This work reveals the importance of studying the thermodynamic stability of the reconstructed film on the cathode materials and offers a theoretical guidance for choosing manganese substituting elements in lithium-rich as well as stoichiometric layer-layer compounds for stabilizing the cathode surface.",

Here, we propose the use of a sulfur-based cathode material, amorphous MoS3 and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) composite, which can be substituted for the pure sulfur-based cathodes. In order to enhance kinetics and stability of the electrodes, we intentionally pulverize the microsized MoS3 sheet into nanosheets and form an ultrathin nano-SEI on the surface using in situ electrochemical methods. Then, the pulverized nanosheets are securely anchored by the oxygen functional group of r-GO. As a result, the electrochemically treated MoS3/r-GO electrode shows superior performance that surpasses pure sulfur-based electrodes; it exhibits a capacity of about 900 mAh g-1 at a rate of 5C for 2500 cycles without capacity fading. Moreover, a full-cell battery employing the MoS3/r-GO cathode with a silicon-carbon composite anode displays a 3-5 times higher energy density (1725 Wh kg-1/7100 Wh L-1) than present LIBs.",

        "text": "Recoveries of cobalt and lithium metals from spent lithium-ion batteries are very important for prevention of environmental pollution and alleviation of resource shortage. In this study, a hydrometallurgical route for the recovery of lithium fluoride was proposed. Lithium and cobalt could be first selectively leached into solution using formic acid and hydrogen peroxide. By investigating the effects of leaching temperature, time, stoichiometric ratio, H2O2 concentration and solid-to-liquid ratio, the leaching efficiency of Li and Co could reach 99.90% and 99.96%, respectively. Meanwhile, the evaluation of leaching kinetics and calculation of apparent activation energies revealed that the leaching process fitted chemical control satisfactorily. After further fractional precipitation, a high purity of 99.0% lithium fluoride could be finally obtained, thus achieving the effective recovery of spent material from the lithium-ion battery.",

Here, we report both experimental and theoretical studies of porous doped silicon nanowires synthesized by direct etching of boron-doped silicon wafers. When using alginate as a binder, porous silicon nanowires exhibited superior electrochemical performance and long cycle life as anode material in a lithium ion battery. Even after 250 cycles, the capacity remains stable above 2000, 1600, and 1100 mAh/g at current rates of 2, 4, and 18 A/g, respectively, demonstrating high structure stability due to the high porosity and electron conductivity of the porous silicon nanowires. A mathematic model coupling the lithium ion diffusion and the strain induced by lithium intercalation was employed to study the effect of porosity and pore size on the structure stability. Simulation shows silicon with high porosity and large pore size help to stabilize the structure during charge/discharge cycles.",

        "text": "Controlling the morphology of nanostructured silicon is critical to improving the structural stability and electrochemical performance in lithium-ion batteries. The use of removable or sacrificial templates is an effective and easy route to synthesize hollow materials. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of mesoporous silicon hollow nanocubes (m-Si HCs) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOF) as an anode material with outstanding electrochemical properties. The m-Si HC architecture with the mesoporous external shell (‚àº15 nm) and internal void (‚àº60 nm) can effectively accommodate volume variations and relieve diffusion-induced stress/strain during repeated cycling. In addition, this cube architecture provides a high electrolyte contact area because of the exposed active site, which can promote the transportation of Li ions. The well-designed m-Si HC with carbon coating delivers a high reversible capacity of 1728 mAhg-1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 80.1% after the first cycle and an excellent rate capability of >1050 mAhg-1 even at a 15 C-rate. In particular, the m-Si HC anode effectively suppresses electrode swelling to ‚àº47% after 100 cycles and exhibits outstanding cycle stability of 850 mAhg-1 after 800 cycles at a 1 C-rate. Moreover, a full cell (2.9 mAhcm-2) comprising a m-Si HC-graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode exhibits remarkable cycle retention of 72% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C-rate.",

The morphology and porosity of the as-synthesized SiGe alloy can be controlled effectively by adjusting the sacrificial Al content of the precursor. With an Al content of 80%, the 3D-NP SiGe presents uniformly coral-like structure with continuous ligaments and hierarchical micropores and mesopores, which leads to a high reversible capacity of 1158 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g-1 with excellent rate capacity.

        "text": "Free-standing electrode (FSE) architectures hold the potential to dramatically increase the gravimetric and volumetric energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by eliminating the parasitic dead weight and volume associated with traditional metal foil current collectors. However, current FSE fabrication methods suffer from insufficient mechanical stability, electrochemical performance, or industrial adoptability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable camphene-assisted fabrication method that allows simultaneous casting and templating of FSEs comprising common LIB materials with a performance superior to their foil-cast counterparts. These porous, lightweight, and robust electrodes simultaneously enable enhanced rate performance by improving the mass and ion transport within the percolating conductive carbon pore network and eliminating current collectors for efficient and stable Li+ storage (>1000 cycles in half-cells) at increased gravimetric and areal energy densities. Compared to conventional foil-cast counterparts, the camphene-derived electrodes exhibit ‚àº1.5√ó enhanced gravimetric energy density, increased rate capability, and improved capacity retention in coin-cell configurations. A full cell containing both a free-standing anode and cathode was cycled for over 250 cycles with greater than 80% capacity retention at an areal capacity of 0.73 mA h/cm2. This active-material-agnostic electrode fabrication method holds potential to tailor the morphology of flexible, current-collector-free electrodes, thus enabling LIBs to be optimized for high power or high energy density Li+ storage. Furthermore, this platform provides an electrode fabrication method that is applicable to other electrochemical technologies and advanced manufacturing methods.",

        "text": "Conventional nickel‚Äêrich cathode materials suffer from reaction heterogeneity during electrochemical cycling particularly at high temperature, because of their polycrystalline properties and secondary particle morphology. Despite intensive research on the morphological evolution of polycrystalline nickel‚Äêrich materials, its practical investigation at the electrode and cell levels is still rarely discussed. Herein, an intrinsic limitation of polycrystalline nickel‚Äêrich cathode materials in high‚Äêenergy full‚Äêcells is discovered under industrial electrode‚Äêfabrication conditions. Owing to their highly unstable chemo‚Äêmechanical properties, even after the first cycle, nickel‚Äêrich materials are degraded in the longitudinal direction of the high‚Äêenergy electrode. This inhomogeneous degradation behavior of nickel‚Äêrich materials at the electrode level originates from the overutilization of active materials on the surface side, causing a severe non‚Äêuniform potential distribution during long‚Äêterm cycling. In addition, this phenomenon continuously lowers the reversibility of lithium ions. Consequently, considering the degradation of polycrystalline nickel‚Äêrich materials, this study suggests the adoption of a robust single‚Äêcrystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a feasible alternative, to effectively suppress the localized overutilization of active materials. Such an adoption can stabilize the electrochemical performance of high‚Äêenergy lithium‚Äêion cells, in which superior capacity retention above ‚âà80% after 1000 cycles at 45 ¬∞C is demonstrated.",

        "text": "Low performance of cathode materials has become one of the major obstacles to the application of lithium-ion battery (LIB) in advanced portable electronic devices, hybrid electric vehicles, and electric vehicles. The present work reports a versatile oxygen-deficient LiV3O8 (D-LVO) nanosheet that was synthesized successfully via a facile oxygen-deficient hydrothermal reaction followed by thermal annealing in Ar. When used as a cathode material for LIB, the prepared D-LVO nanosheets display remarkable capacity properties at various current densities (a capacity of 335, 317, 278, 246, 209, 167, and 133 mA h g-1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 mA g-1, respectively) and excellent lithium-ion storage stability, maintaining more than 88% of the initial reversible capacity after 200 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The outstanding electrochemical properties are believed to arise largely from the introduction of tetravalent V (‚àº15% V4+) and the attendant oxygen vacancies into LiV3O8 nanosheets, leading to intrinsic electrical conductivity more than 1 order of magnitude higher and lithium-ion diffusion coefficient nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of LiV3O8 without detectable V4+ (N-LVO) and thus contributing to the easy lithium-ion diffusion, rapid phase transition, and the excellent electrochemical reversibility. Furthermore, the more uniform nanostructure, as well as the larger specific surface area of D-LVO than N-LVO nanosheets may also improve the electrolyte penetration and provide more reaction sites for fast lithium-ion diffusion during the discharge/charge processes.",

However, multiple processes occurring at the cathode/electrolyte interface lead to overall performance degradation. One key failure mechanism is the dissolution of transition metals from the cathode. This work presents results combining scanning electrochemical microscopy with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to examine cathode degradation products. Our effort employs a LiMn2O4 (LMO) thin film as a model cathode to monitor the Mn dissolution process without the potential complications of conductive additive and polymer binders. We characterize the electrochemical behavior of LMO degradation products in various electrolytes, paired with ICP and EPR, to better understand the properties of Mn complexes formed following metal dissolution. We find that the identity of the lithium salt anions in our electrolyte systems [ClO4‚Äì, PF6‚Äì, and (CF3SO2)2N‚Äì] appears to affect the Mn dissolution process significantly as well as the electrochemical behavior of the generated Mn complexes. This implies that the mechanism for Mn dissolution is at least partially dependent on the lithium salt anion.",

        "text": "Porous hierarchical NiMn2O4/C tremella-like nanostructures are obtained through a simple solvothermal and calcination method. As the anode of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), porous NiMn2O4/C nanostructures exhibit a superior specific capacity and an excellent long-term cycling performance even at a high current density. The discharge capacity can stabilize at 2130 mA h g(-1) within 350 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1). After a long-term cycling of 1500 cycles, the capacity is still as high as 1773 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 4000 mA g(-1), which is almost five times higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. The porous NiMn2O4/C hierarchical nanostructure provides sufficient contact with the electrolyte and fast three-dimensional Li(+) diffusion channels, and dramatically improves the capacity of NiMn2O4/C via interfacial storage.",

However, the application of the LIBs still faces limitations such as energy density, durability, charging speed and safety. Nanomaterials, which have at least one dimension under nanoscale, can offer some solutions to these challenges by modifying the properties and performance of the electrode materials. In this research, recent progresses and challenges of using nanomaterials as electrode materials for LIBs are analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of different types of nanomaterials are being discussed, such as nanoparticles, nanocoating, nanotubes, and nanocomposites, and their effects on the electrochemical behavior of the LIBs. On the other hand, some of the key issues and future directions for the development of nanomaterials-based LIBs are also being highlighted. This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview and perspective on the application of nanomaterials for better performance LIBs.",

        "text": "No design rules have yet been established for producing solid electrolytes with a lithium-ion conductivity high enough to replace liquid electrolytes and expand the performance and battery configuration limits of current lithium ion batteries. Taking advantage of the properties of high-entropy materials, we have designed a highly ion-conductive solid electrolyte by increasing the compositional complexity of a known lithium superionic conductor to eliminate ion migration barriers while maintaining the structural framework for superionic conduction. The synthesized phase with a compositional complexity showed an improved ion conductivity. We showed that the highly conductive solid electrolyte enables charge and discharge of a thick lithium-ion battery cathode at room temperature and thus has potential to change conventional battery configurations. Description Editor‚Äôs summary Solid electrolytes have been developed to allow solid-state batteries to compete with liquid electrolyte batteries, but there is still a challenge in ensuring good contact with the electrodes, which thus limits the thickness of electrodes that can be used in practice. Li et al. applied the principles of high-entropy materials to improve upon the properties of existing electrolytes through the sensible partial substitution of addition elements. The authors demonstrate the incorporation of their materials into a cathode structure, which provides the high ionic conductivity required for solid-state battery applications. ‚ÄîMSL Adding composition complexity to a known crystal framework enables millimeter-thick battery electrodes.",

        "text": "\"Fast-charging\" lithium-ion batteries have gained a multitude of attention in recent years since they could be applied to energy storage areas like electric vehicles, grids, and subsea operations. Unfortunately, the excellent energy density could fail to sustain optimally while lithium-ion batteries are exposed to fast-charging conditions. In actuality, the crystal structure of electrode materials represents the critical factor for influencing the electrode performance. Accordingly, employing anode materials with low diffusion barrier could improve the \"fast-charging\" performance of the lithium-ion battery. In this Review, first, the \"fast-charging\" principle of lithium-ion battery and ion diffusion path in the crystal are briefly outlined. Next, the application prospects of \"fast-charging\" anode materials with various crystal structures are evaluated to search \"fast-charging\" anode materials with stable, safe, and long lifespan, solving the remaining challenges associated with high power and high safety. Finally, summarizing recent research advances for typical \"fast-charging\" anode materials, including preparation methods for advanced morphologies and the latest techniques for ameliorating performance. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the ongoing breakthroughs for \"fast-charging\" anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Intercalated materials (niobium-based, carbon-based, titanium-based, vanadium-based) with favorable cycling stability are predominantly limited by undesired electronic conductivity and theoretical specific capacity. Accordingly, addressing the electrical conductivity of these materials constitutes an effective trend for realizing fast-charging. The conversion-type transition metal oxide and phosphorus-based materials with high theoretical specific capacity typically undergoes significant volume variation during charging and discharging. Consequently, alleviating the volume expansion could significantly fulfill the application of these materials in fast-charging batteries.",

Since the electrode reaction occurs preferentially in regions with lower resistance, reaction distribution can be happened within composite electrodes. We investigate the relationship between the reaction distribution with depth direction and electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes with changing electrode porosities. Two dimensional X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the reaction distribution is happened in lower porosity electrodes. Our developed 6-probe method can measure electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes. The ionic conductivity is decreased for lower porosity electrodes, which governs the reaction distribution of composite electrodes and their performances.",

        "text": "Due to its high specific capacity, silicon anode has gained interest on a global scale as the anode of next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, it is challenging for silicon anodes to replace graphite anodes for widespread use due to the inevitable volume expansion and SEI film development generated by silicon during the lithiation/delithiation process. Among these, the advancement of nanotechnology has sped up the development of silicon anodes. This paper reviews nanotechnology applied in the Si anode to improve the battery performance. The volume expansion of Si is effectively decreased by reducing the volume of the silicon anode in order to increase its specific surface area. Additionally, the smaller negative electrode reduces the distance traveled by lithium ions, greatly increasing the silicon negative electrode's efficiency. At present, the main silicon nano-anode materials include nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets, nanotubes, nanoporous materials and so on. It is hoped that this review will provide a deep prospect introduction to the nano-silicon anode. Pure silicon nanoparticles and silicon nanowires, and new nanomaterials composed of them with graphite, graphene, metals, etc.",

        "text": "Recently, hydrogen boride (HB) with a pseudo-two-dimensional sheet structure was successfully synthesized, and it is theoretically predicted to have high potential as a negative electrode material for alkali metal ion batteries, making it a promising new candidate. This study represents the first experimental examination of the negative electrode properties of HB. HB was synthesized via cation exchange from MgB2. The confirmation of HB synthesis was achieved through various spectroscopic experiments, including synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in addition to direct observation using transmission electron microscopy. The HB electrode was prepared by mixing the HB powder sample with conductive additive carbon black and a polymer binder. A test cell was assembled with the HB electrode as the working electrode, and lithium metal as the counter and reference electrodes, and its battery electrode properties were evaluated. Although reversible charge-discharge curves with good reversibility were observed, the reversible capacity was 100 ¬± 20 mA h g-1 which is significantly smaller than the theoretical predictions. Nitrogen gas adsorption experiments were performed on the HB powder sample to determine the specific surface area indicating that the HB sheets were stacked together. It is plausible to consider that this stacking structure led to a reduced lithium-ion storage capacity compared to the theoretical predictions.",

Here, a new electrophoretic deposition Co3O4/graphene (EPD Co3O4/G) hybrid electrode is developed to improve the electrochemical performance. Through EPD, Co3O4 nanocubes can be homogeneously embedded between graphene sheets to form a sandwich-like structure. Owing to the excellent flexibility of graphene and a large number of voids in this sandwich-like structure, the structural integrity and unobstructed conductive network can be maintained during cycling. Moreover, the electrode kinetics has proved to be a fast surface-controlled lithium storage process. As a result, the Co3O4/G hybrid electrode exhibits high specific capacity and excellent electrochemical cycling performance. The Co3O4/G hybrid electrode was also further studied by in situ electrochemical XRD to understand the relationship of its structure and performance: (1) The observed LixCo3O4 indicates an intermediate of possible small volume change in the first discharging. (2) The theoretical capacity achievement of the Co3O4 in hybrid electrode was evidenced. (3) The correlation between the electrochemical performance and the structural evolution of the Co3O4/G hybrid electrode was discussed detailedly.",

However, the large volume change of RP during charging/discharging imposes an adverse effect on the cyclability and the rate performance suffers from its low conductivity. Herein, a facile solution-based strategy is exploited to incorporate phosphorus into the pores of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) derived carbon hosts under a mild temperature. With this method, the blocky RP is etched into the form of polyphosphides anions (PP, mainly P5 - ) so that it can easily diffuse into the pores of porous carbon hosts. Especially, the indelible crystalline surface phosphorus can be effectively avoided, which usually generates in the conventional vapor-condensation encapsulation method. Moreover, highly-conductive ZIF-8 derived carbon hosts with any pore smaller than 3 nm are efficient for loading PP and these pores can alleviate the volume change well. Finally, the composite of phosphorus encapsulated into ZIF-8 derived porous carbon exhibits a significantly improved electrochemical performance as lithium-ion battery anode with a high capacity of 786 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 , a good stability within 700 cycles at 1 A g-1 , and an excellent rate performance.",

        "text": "Layered lithium-rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interests owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320 - 350 mA h g -1 ). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, it is expected to revive the development of layered lithium-rich cathode materials to resolve our increasing dependence on high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we reviewed recent research progresses and in-depth understandings of structure characterizations and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium-rich manganese-based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarized the proposed reaction mechanisms on both the cationic redox reaction of transition-metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discussed opportunities and challenges facing the future development of LLRM cathode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.",

Additionally, spent LIBs should be recycled to achieve a circular economy and supply resources for new LIBs or other products. Especially the recycling of the active material of the electrodes is the focus of current research. Existing approaches for recycling (e.g., pyro-, hydrometallurgy, or flotation) still have their drawbacks, such as the loss of materials, generation of waste, or lack of selectivity. In this study, we test the behavior of commercially available LiFePO4 and two types of graphite microparticles in a dielectrophoretic high-throughput filter. Dielectrophoresis is a volume-dependent electrokinetic force that is commonly used in microfluidics but recently also for applications that focus on enhanced throughput. In our study, graphite particles show significantly higher trapping than LiFePO4 particles. The results indicate that nearly pure fractions of LiFePO4 can be obtained with this technique from a mixture with graphite.",

While new solid electrolytes (SEs) have been developed with high enough ionic conductivities, SSBs with long operational life are still rarely reported. Therefore, on the way to high-performance and long-life ASSBs, a better understanding of the complex degradation mechanisms, occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces is pivotal. While the lithium metal/solid electrolyte interface is receiving considerable attention due to the quest for high energy density, the interface between the active material and solid electrolyte particles within the composite cathode is arguably the most difficult to solve and study. In this work, multiple characterization methods are combined to better understand the processes that occur at the LiCoO2 cathode and the Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte interface. Indium and Li4Ti5O12 are used as anode materials to avoid the instability problems associated with Li-metal anodes. Capacity fading and increased impedances are observed during long-term cycling. Postmortem analysis with scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that electrochemically driven mechanical failure and degradation at the cathode/solid electrolyte interface contribute to the increase in internal resistance and the resulting capacity fading. These results suggest that the development of electrochemically more stable SEs and the engineering of cathode/SE interfaces are crucial for achieving reliable SSB performance.",

        "text": "Hierarchical copper silicate hydrate hollow spheres-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite is successfully fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method using silica as in situ sacrificing template. The electrochemical performance of the composite as lithium-ion battery anode was studied for the first time. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the hierarchical hollow structure and conductive RGO matrix, the composite exhibits excellent long-life performance and rate capability. A capacity of 890 mAh/g is achieved after 200 cycles at 200 mA/g and a capacity of 429 mAh/g is retained after 800 cycles at 1000 mA/g. The results indicate that the strategy of combining hierarchical hollow structures with conductive RGO holds the potential in addressing the volume expansion issue of high capacity anode materials.",

        "text": "Modern studies of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathode materials employ a large range of experimental and theoretical techniques to understand the changes in bulk and local chemical and electronic structures during electrochemical cycling (charge and discharge). Despite its being rich in useful chemical information, few studies to date have used 17O NMR spectroscopy. Many LIB cathode materials contain paramagnetic ions, and their NMR spectra are dominated by hyperfine and quadrupolar interactions, giving rise to broad resonances with extensive spinning sideband manifolds. In principle, careful analysis of these spectra can reveal information about local structural distortions, magnetic exchange interactions, structural inhomogeneities (Li+ concentration gradients), and even the presence of redox-active O anions. In this Perspective, we examine the primary interactions governing 17O NMR spectroscopy of LIB cathodes and outline how 17O NMR may be used to elucidate the structure of pristine cathodes and their structural evolution on cycling, providing insight into the challenges in obtaining and interpreting the spectra. We also discuss the use of 17O NMR in the context of anionic redox and the role this technique may play in understanding the charge compensation mechanisms in high-capacity cathodes, and we provide suggestions for employing 17O NMR in future avenues of research.",

        "text": "This article demonstrates the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of tungsten nitride using tungsten hexacarbonyl [W(CO)6] and ammonia [NH3] and its use as a lithium-ion battery anode. In situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), ellipsometry and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements are carried out to confirm the self-limiting behaviour of the deposition. A saturated growth rate of ca. 0.35 √Ö per ALD cycle is found within a narrow temperature window of 180-195 ¬∞C. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) vibrational spectroscopy is used to determine the reaction pathways of the surface bound species after each ALD half cycle. The elemental presence and chemical composition is determined by XPS. The as-deposited material is found to be amorphous and crystallized to h-W2N upon annealing at an elevated temperature under an ammonia atmosphere. The as-deposited materials are found to be n-type, conducting with an average carrier concentration of ca. 10(20) at room temperature. Electrochemical studies of the as-deposited films open up the possibility of this material to be used as an anode material in Li-ion batteries. The incorporation of MWCNTs as a scaffold layer further enhances the electrochemical storage capacity of the ALD grown tungsten nitride (WNx). Ex situ XRD analysis confirms the conversion based reaction mechanism of the as-grown material with Li under operation.",

Though much attention has been paid to this issue, the behavior of Mn dissolution has not been clearly revealed. In this work, by using a refined in-situ UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) technique, we monitored the concentration changes of dissolved Mn ions in liquid electrolyte from LMO at different state of charge (SOC), confirming the maximum dissolution concentration and rate at 4.3 V charged state and Mn2+ as the main specie in the electrolyte. Through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we revealed that Mn dissolution process is highly related to surface structure evolution, solvent decomposition and lithium salt. These results will contribute to understanding TM dissolution mechanisms in working conditions as well as the design of stable cathode.",

Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in mobile devices, hybrid, and electric vehicles. Electrode-electrolyte interface has a strong impact on battery capacity decrease and long-term cycling stability. In order to improve fundamental understanding of the involved phenomena to accelerate the rational design of cathode materials and stable interface, Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O2 (NCM) is a cathode material for rechargeable LIB and also a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Their battery performance and catalytic activity are highly correlated to their structures. Multiple processes occurring at the cathode/electrolyte interface led to overall performance degradation. One failure mechanism is the dissolution of transition metals from the cathode. Our efforts employ thin film as a model cathode to monitor the Mn dissolution. Using LiMn2O4 and NCM as cathode materials, we will focus on electrochemical characterization, cation mixing, oxygen evolution, and thin film deposition with controlled crystal structures and composition. We will further introduce our work employing the scanning electrochemical microscope to study LIBs degradation and cathode-electrolyte interface in situ and in real-time.",

The IL-based electrolyte is characterized in terms of conductivity and viscosity at various temperatures, revealing a Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) trend. Lithium half-cells employing the Sn-C anode and NMC cathode in the Pyr14 TFSI-LiTFSI electrolyte are investigated by galvanostatic cycling at various temperatures, demonstrating the full compatibility of the electrolyte with the selected electrode materials. The NMC and Sn-C electrodes are combined into a cathode-limited full cell, which is subjected to prolonged cycling at 40‚Äâ¬∞C, revealing a very stable capacity of about 140‚ÄÖmAh‚Äâg(-1) and retention above 99‚Äâ% over 400 cycles. The electrode/electrolyte interface is further characterized through a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations upon cell cycling. The remarkable performances reported here definitively indicate that IL-based lithium ion cells are suitable batteries for application in electric vehicles.",

        "text": "Performance of lithium-ion batteries at sub-ambient temperatures are extremely restricted by the resistive interphases originated from electrolyte decomposition, especially on the anode surface. This work reports a novel strategy that anode interphase of low impedance is constructed by applying an electrolyte additive dimethyl sulfite (DMS). Electrochemical measurements indicate that the as-constructed interphase provides graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cells with excellent lower temperature performance, outperforming the interphase constructed by 1,3,2-Dioxathiolane 2,2-dioxide (DTD), a common commercially used electrolyte additive. Spectral characterizations in combination with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the improved performance is attributed to the unique molecular structure of DMS, which presents appropriate reduction activity and constructs the more stable and ionically conductive anode interphase, due to the weaker combination of its reduction product with lithium ions than DTD. This rational design of interphases via additive structure has been proven to be a low cost but rather effective approach to tailor the performances of lithium-ion batteries.",

        "text": "During solid‚Äêstate calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid‚Äêstate reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart Ni‚Äêrich layered oxides (LiNi1‚Äêx‚ÄêyCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium‚Äêion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron‚Äêbased X‚Äêray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature‚Äêdependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid‚Äêstate lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high‚Äêenergy/power density lithium‚Äêion batteries.",

Although the discovery and optimization of battery active materials has been the subject of extensive study since the 1980s, the most disruptive advancements of commercial LIBs in the past decade stem instead from overall cell design and engineering. In pursuit of higher energy density and fast-charging capability, strategies focused on tuning the properties of composite electrode architectures (e.g., porosity, conductivity, tortuosity, spatial heterogeneity) by restructuring the inactive component matrix of LIB electrode films have recently garnered attention. This perspective explores recent advances in electrode design through an applied lens, emphasizing synthetic platforms and future research directions that are scalable, commercially feasible, and applicable to a wide range of active materials. We introduce and critically assess recently proposed strategies for structuring electrode architectures, including spatial gradients of local composition and microstructure; metal-foil current collector alternatives; and electrode templating techniques, evaluating both achievements in battery performance and commercial applicability. Coupled with improved active materials, new electrode architectures hold promise to unlock next generation LIBs.",

With the redox reactions happening in the couples of Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+, PF6- anions can be incorporated into the cathode and reversibly released into the LiPF6-based electrolyte. Meanwhile, benefiting from its unique structure and insolubility, Co(DFc)x shows a high energy density of 632 Wh kg-1 (vs. lithium anode), a high operating potential of 3.63 V (vs. Li+/Li), a high reversible (discharge) capacity of 170 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 (the 3rd cycle), an excellent rate performance (up to 2000 mA g-1, 5 minutes for one cycle), and extraordinary cycling stability (an average capacity of 74.9 mAh g-1 for 8000 cycles at 2000 mA g-1).",

The obtained composite material presents a bouquet structure containing manganese and tin oxide nanoparticle network with graphene sheets. Benefiting from this porous nanostructure, in which graphene sheets provide high electronic pathways to enhance the electronic conductivity, uniformly distributed particles offer accelerated kinetic reaction with lithium ion and reduced volume deviation in the tin dioxide (SnO2) particle during charge-discharge testing. As a consequence, ternary composite Mn2SnO4@GS showed a high rate performance and outstanding cyclability of anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The electrode achieved a specific capacity of about 1070 mA h g-1 at a current density of 400 mA g-1 after 200 cycles; meanwhile, the electrode still delivered a specific capacity of about 455 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 2500 mA g-1.
