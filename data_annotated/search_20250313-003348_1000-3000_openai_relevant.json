        "abstract": "In summary, Ni(OH)2 nanoflowers (Ni(OH)2 NFs) and Ni(OH)2 nanoflowers grown on Ni foan (Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF) were synthesised using a one‐step hydrothermal process. In energy storage applications, the Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF can be a useful electrode material. When utilized as a supercapacitor electrode material, the Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF shows a discharge specific capacity of 100.0 F g−1, which is greater than that of pure Ni(OH)2 NFs (27.3 F g−1) at an applied current density of 0.4 A g−1. In lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), the Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF composite is used as an anode and has primordial discharge and charge capacities of 1595.2 and 1104.3 mAh g−1, individually. Lithium‐ion batteries are made possible by the Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF anode, which has an amazing capacity of 213.8 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles. Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF are employed as sodium ion batteries(SIBs) anodes, and Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF has 440.0 and 217.9 mAh g−1 for the primal discharge and charge capacities, individually. The Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF anode with a high capacity of 122.7 mAh g−1 following 50 cycling numbers allows for construction of lithium ion batteries,Ni(OH)2 NFs@NF has better sodium and lithium ion storage capacity than Ni(OH)2 NFs.The content of this study is intended to provide a reference for future research on nickel hydroxide flexible electrodes.",

        "abstract": "The development of high‐performance sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is heavily relied on the exploration of the appropriate electrode material for Na+ storage, which ought to feature merits of high capacity, easy‐to‐handle synthesis, high conductivity, expedite mass transportation, and stable structure upon charging–discharging cycle. Herein, a universal source‐template method is reported to synthesize a variety of transition metal (e.g., V, Sb, W, Zn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) selenides implanting on N doped 3D carbon nanoarchitecture hybrids (MmSen@3D‐CN) with powerful SeC bonding rivet. Benefiting from the superior architecture and potent SeC bonding between Cu2−xSe and N‐doped 3D carbon (3D‐CN), the Cu2−xSe@3D‐CN nanohybrids, as anode of SIBs, show high capacity, high‐rate capability, and long‐cycle durability, which can deliver a reversible capacity of as high as 386 mAh g−1, retain 219 mAh g−1 even at 10 A g−1, and run durably over thousands of charging–discharging cycles. The Cu2−xSe@3D‐CN as anode is also evaluated by developing a full SIB by coupling with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, which can deliver high energy density and show excellent stability, shedding light on its potential in practical application.",

        "abstract": "The reserves of sodium resources are much larger than those of lithium resources, and they are widely distributed and easy to produce and can be widely used in photovoltaic energy storage and other industries on the premise of this advantage. However, how to produce hard carbon anodes at a low cost for the preparation of energy storage materials requires continuous exploration and experimentation to find the optimal solution. Here, we used waste sour date shell biomass as a precursor for a hard carbon anode obtained by simple acid treatment and two pyrolyses. It is shown that acid washing after prepyrolysis has a significant effect on the electrochemical performance of the sour date shell-derived hard carbon (ZJ), constructing a stable structure that makes it easier for sodium ions to be embedded and dislodged, and the carbon particles are homogeneous and free of bonding and electrode cracking. The ZJ-1500-HCl pyrolyzed at 1500 °C has a high reversible capacity of 329.1 mAh g-1, 94.1% initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), 90.54% capacity retention efficiency cycling 300 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g-1, and a resistivity below 10 Ω. It has good cycle stability and a good multiplier performance. It is expected to be used in practical production and photovoltaic energy storage in the future.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising candidates due to the abundant Na resources, challenges still exist. In particular, the formation of dendrites caused by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer can lead to battery short circuits or even fires. To solve the above problem, cobalt‐doped Ni3S2 nanosheets were decorated onto a 3D nickel foam skeleton (Co‐Ni3S2‐NF). The successful one‐step hydrothermal synthesis of Co‐Ni3S2‐NF was evidenced by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopic spectra, high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy lattice images. Experimental results showed that Co‐Ni3S2‐NF provided a multitude of nucleation sites, stabilized the SEI layer, inhibited dendrites growth, and ensured uniform ions transfer. The aforementioned results were validated by ex‐situ electron microscopy images, as well as optical microscopy images. This improved the cycling stability of SMBs with a high coulombic efficiency after 400 cycles at the condition of 2 mA cm−2. When assembling Co‐Ni3S2‐NF@Na into a full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3, it also demonstrated excellent rate performance, showing the outstanding cycling stability. This advancement offers new insights into the development of high‐performance anodes of SMBs.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth selenide holds great promise as a kind of conversion-alloying-type anode material for alkali metal ion storage because of its layered structure with large interlayer spacing and high theoretical specific capacity. Nonetheless, its commercial development has been significantly hammered by the poor kinetics, severe pulverization, and polyselenide shuttle during the charge/discharge process. Herein, Sb-substitution and carbon encapsulation strategies are simultaneously employed to synthesize SbxBi2-xSe3 nanoparticles decorated on Ti3C2Tx MXene with encapsulation of N-doped carbon (SbxBi2-xSe3/MX⊂NC) as anodes for alkali metal ion storage. The superb electrochemical performances could be assigned to the cationic displacement of Sb3+ that effectively inhibits the shuttling effect of soluble polyselenides and the confinement engineering that alleviates the volume change during the sodiation/desodiation process. When used as anodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, the Sb0.4Bi1.6Se3/MX⊂NC composite exhibits superior electrochemical performances. This work offers valuable guidance to suppress the shuttling of polyselenides/polysulfides in high-performance alkali metal ion batteries with conversion/alloying-type transition metal sulfide/selenide anode materials.",

In this work, we prepared a poly(methyl methacrylate)-filled composite electrolyte (named as GHSE) by in situ polymerization of methyl methacrylate in the porous Na3Zr2Si2PO12-polymer vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene composite membrane for the first time. The GHSE membrane exhibits a high ionic conductivity (2.78 × 10-3 S cm-1), wide electrochemical window (∼4.9 V), high Na+ ion transference number (∼0.63), good thermal stability and flexibility, as well as smaller interfacial resistance. Moreover, a composite Na/C anode was prepared, which shows good dendrite suppression ability. The full cell Na0.67Ni0.23Mg0.1Mn0.67O2 |GHSE|Na/C exhibits excellent rate capability with an initial discharge capacity of 96 mAh g-1 even at a higher current density of 192 mA g-1 and excellent cyclability for 600 cycles.

        "abstract": "Commercial hard carbon (HC) anode suffers from unexpected interphase chemistry rooted in the parasitic reactions between surface oxygen-functional groups and ester-based electrolytes. Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed to regulate interphase chemistry by tailoring targeted functional groups on the HC surface, where highly active undesirable oxygen-functional groups are skillfully converted into a Si-O-Si molecular layer favorable for anchoring anions. Then, an inorganic/organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase with low interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhanced cycling durability is constructed successfully. Consequently, the modified HC anode delivers an excellent rate capability of 206.2 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 92.5% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, the coin-type full-cell equipped with Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cathode exhibits an exceptional capacity retention ratio of 80.9% after 800 cycles at 1C. The present simple and effective interfacial modification strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for promoting the development and practicability of HC anode in ester-based electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries.",

Graphite with low price exhibits excellent Li+ reversible intercalation properties, which has been widely applied in anodes of LIBs. But it has low capacity for sodium because of its weak chemical bonding with sodium. Here, a defect engineered graphite with low graphitization structure is reported. This graphite demonstrates a defect adsorption and solvated ion intercalation of sodium ions by introducing more active sites and ether electrolytes, effectively improving the storage capacity of sodium. Further experiments and characterization show defects increased after ball milling with surface area increased, and the favorable defects on the interface of graphite are significantly increased. The defect engineered graphite absorbs more sodium‐ions and exhibits capacitive characteristics with fast sodiation/desodiation process, leading to an improved capacity storage than the defect‐free graphite. Meanwhile, the defect engineered graphite can deliver a capacity of 175 mAh g−1, and maintain a good capacity retention of 84% at 5 A g−1 after 6000 cycles.

The reaction mechanism, structural evolution and reaction kinetics during the reported sodiation/desodiation processes were carefully investigated. The gradually enhanced diffusion controlled contribution resulted in the capacity increasing. And the capacity decay could be ascribed to the irreversible reaction of metallic titanium formation and the increasing potential polarization. It is worth noting that sodium ions seem to partially reduce NTO to metallic state, which is irreversible. The present study can provide more information for the design of advanced Na2Ti6O13 anode.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxides are considered promising anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacities; however, their practical application is limited by the detrimental large volume expansion that occurs upon cycling. In this work, a rationally designed TiO2 @Fe@FeOx nanocomposite encapsulated by a TiO2 shell with unique core-shell structure is synthesized and exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as an anode in LIBs and SIBs. The nanocomposite exhibits a reversible capacity of 619.2 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 with a coulombic efficiency over 99.5% after 1000 cycles when used as a LIB anode. The nanocomposite also exhibits superior sodium storage performance (267 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 , capacity retention of 65.4% after 1000 cycles at 200 mA g-1 ). The TiO2 shell serves as a strong conformal layer and soft matrix that can tolerate the volume expansion and maintain the structural integrity of the anode during discharging and charging. Moreover, the open active diffusion channels of the shell contribute to high ion diffusivity and improved ionic, and electronic diffusion. These findings indicate that adoption of TiO2 coating is an effective strategy to optimize the electrochemical performance of transition metal oxide anode materials.",

        "abstract": "Alloying-type anode materials are regarded as promising alternatives beyond intercalation-type carbonaceous materials for sodium storage owing to the high specific capacities. The rapid capacity decay arising from the huge volume change during Na+-ion insertion/extraction, however, impedes the practical application. Herein, we report an ultrafine antimony embedded in a porous carbon nanocomposite (Sb@PC) synthesized via facile in situ substitution of the Cu nanoparticles in a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived octahedron carbon framework for sodium storage. The Sb@PC composite displays an appropriate redox potential (0.5-0.8 V vs Na/Na+) and excellent specific capacities of 634.6, 474.5, and 451.9 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 A g-1 after 200, 500, and 250 cycles, respectively. Such superior sodium storage performance is primarily ascribed to the MOF-derived three-dimensional porous carbon framework and ultrafine Sb nanoparticles, which not only provides a penetrating network for rapid transfer of charge carriers but also alleviates the agglomeration and volume expansion of Sb during cycling. Ex situ X-ray diffraction and in situ Raman analysis clearly reveal a five-stage reaction mechanism during sodiation and desodiation and demonstrate the excellent reversibility of Sb@PC for sodium storage. Furthermore, post-mortem analysis reveals that the robust structural integrity of Sb@PC can withstand continuous Na+-ion insertion/extraction. This work may provide insight into the effective design of high-capacity alloying-type anode materials for advanced secondary batteries.",

When cycled at 0.1 A g−1, the P‐CNSs electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 328 mAh g−1, even at a high current density of 20 A g−1, a considerable capacity of 108 mAh g−1 can still be maintained. Besides, this material also shows excellent cycling stability, at a current density of 5 A g−1, the reversible capacity can still reach 149 mAh g−1 after 5000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Metal polyphosphides are regarded as the ideal anode candidates for sodium storage because of their high theoretical capacity, reasonable potential, and abundant resource alternative. However, most of them suffer from irreversibility problems, as reflected by their low reversible capacity, inferior Coulombic efficiency (CE), low rate capability, and poor cycling stability. In this work, we systematically compare the electrochemical behavior of a variety of polyphosphides bulks, discovering that the CuP2 bulks have higher initial reversible capacity (416 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and CE (74%) compared to the FeP2, CoP3, and NiP2 bulks, which is related to the unique crystal structure of CuP2. The CuP2 electrode is optimized by the rational design of encapsulating CuP2 nanoparticles into three-dimensional graphene networks (CuP2@GNs), leading to excellent electrochemical performance. In the carbonate electrolyte, the CuP2@GNs electrode can deliver the reversible capacities of up to 804, 736, 685, 621, and 508 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g-1, respectively, along with a first CE of 66%. The reversible capacity can be up to 737 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a first CE of 83% in the ether electrolyte. These excellent performance demonstrates that CuP2@GNs could be a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Though being a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), MoS2 with high theoretical capacity shows poor rate capability and rapid capacity decay, especially involving the conversion of MoS2 to Mo metal and Na2S. Here, we report all-in-one MoS2 nanosheets tailored by porous nitrogen-doped graphene (N-RGO) for the first time to achieve superior structural stability and high cycling reversibility of MoS2 in SIBs. The all-in-one MoS2 nanosheets possess desirable structural characteristics by admirably rolling up all good qualities into one, including vertical alignment, an ultrathin layer, vacancy defects, and expanded layer spacing. Thus, the all-in-one MoS2@N-RGO composite anode exhibits an improvement in the charge transport kinetics and availability of active materials in SIBs, resulting in outstanding cycling and rate performance. More importantly, the restricted growth of all-in-one MoS2 by the porous N-RGO via a strong coupling effect dramatically improves the cycling reversibility of conversion reaction. Consequently, the all-in-one MoS2@N-RGO composite anode demonstrates excellent reversible capacity, outstanding rate capability, and superior cycling stability. This study strongly suggests that the all-in-one MoS2@N-RGO has great potential for practical application in high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Tin (Sn)-based anodes for sodium (Na)-ion batteries possess higher Na-storage capacity and better safety aspects compared to hard carbon -based anodes but suffer from poor cyclic stability due to volume expansion/contraction and concomitant loss in mechanical integrity during sodiation/desodiation. To address this, the usage of nanoscaled electrode-active particles and nanoscaled-carbon-based buffers has been explored, but with compromises with the tap density, accrued irreversible surface reactions, overall capacity (for \"inactive\" carbon), and adoption of non-scalable/complex preparation routes. Against this backdrop, anode-active \"layered\" bismuth (Bi) has been incorporated with Sn via a facile-cum-scalable mechanical-milling approach, leading to individual electrode-active particles being composed of well-dispersed Sn and Bi phases. The optimized carbon-free Sn-Bi compositions, benefiting from the combined effects of \"buffering\" action and faster Na transport of Bi, to go with the greater Na-storage capacity and lower operating potential of Sn, exhibit excellent cyclic stability (viz., ∼83-92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C) and rate capability (viz., no capacity drop from C/5 to 2C, with only ∼25% drop at 5C), despite having fairly coarse particles (∼5-10 μm). As proven by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and stress measurements, the sequential sodiation/desodiation of the components and, concomitantly, stress build-ups at different potentials provide \"buffering\" action even for such \"active-active\" Sn-Bi compositions. Furthermore, the overall stress development upon sodiation of Bi has been found to be significantly lower than that of Sn (by a factor of ∼3.8), which renders Bi promising as a \"buffer\" material, in general. Dissemination of such complex interplay between electrode-active components during electrochemical cycling also paves the way for the development of high-performance, safe, and scalable \"alloying-reaction\"-based anode materials for Na-ion batteries and beyond, sans the need for ultrafine/nanoscaled electrode particles or \"inactive\" nanoscaled-carbon-based \"buffer\" materials.",

Through the assistance of simulated sunlight, suppressed dendritic sodium growth, buffered volume deformation, promoted electrochemical reaction kinetics, and improved structural stability are simultaneously achieved. Meanwhile, ferroelectric polarization enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The collisions among electrons are dramatically decreased; in turn, the thermal stability of the battery is improved via the tailored orientation of active materials. A stable protective solid-state electrolyte interface film is formed via the photogenerated electrons and the magnetohydrodynamics effect, depressing the growth of sodium dendrites. The porous three-dimensional heterostructure is conducive for promoting transmission of charges and the diffusion of ions, effectively reducing the local current density of metals, further inhibiting the growth of sodium dendrites during deposition and peeling processes. Density functional theoretical calculations also verify that the fabricated MoS2 composite possesses intensified electron density, and exhibits fast reaction kinetics in repeated cycles and lowered sodium adsorption energy. The optical field and the rational magnetic fabrication technology can fundamentally solve the bottleneck problems restricting the development of batteries, mitigating the energy crisis.",

However, an unsatisfactory solid–electrolyte‐interphase formed by irreversible electrolyte consumption caused by defects or oxygen‐containing functional groups of hard carbon impedes its further application. Herein, a novel composite binder that is composed of polar polymer chondroitin sulfate A (sodium salt) and polyethylene oxide by hydrogen bonding demonstrates defect passivation capability. This composite binder can reduce the exposure of defects by forming hydrogen bonds with oxygen functional groups on the hard carbon surface and inhibit the decomposition of electrolyte confirmed by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. In situ Raman and theoretical calculations reveal that multiple polar functional groups in chondroitin sulfate A (sodium salt) can accelerate the transport of Na+ by adsorbing and facilitate the decomposition of PF6− to form NaF. Additionally, polyethylene oxide in the composite binder can increase viscosity and accelerate the transport of Na+. As a result, an ultra‐thin (9 nm, cyro‐TEM) and NaF‐rich solid–electrolyte interphase is obtained, thereby the hard carbon anode achieves improved initial Coulombic efficiency (84%) and high‐capacity retention of 94% after 150 cycles in a NaPF6/ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte.",

To expose more radical sites for sodium storage, a 3D structure with a multistage pore structure is constructed through NH3 release during the pyrolyzation process.

The WS2 nanocrystals are beneficial for storing more sodium ions and expediting the transportation of sodium ions, thus improving the capacity and reaction kinetics. Chlorella acts as a reactor and not only inhibits the stacking of WS2 nanocrystals during the synthesis process but also alleviates the mechanical pressure of composite during the charge/discharge process. As a result, the WS2/NPC-2 electrode delivers a high specific capacity (436 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and superior rate performance of 311 mA h g-1 at 3 A g-1 for SIBs. It also exhibits excellent stability even up to 6000 cycles at 5 A g-1, which is one of the optimal long-cycle properties reported for WS2-based materials to date.",

        "abstract": "Anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are confronted with severe volume expansion and poor electrical conductivity. Construction of assembled structures featuring hollow interior and carbon material modification is considered as an efficient strategy to address the issues. Herein, a novel template-assisted epitaxial growth method, ingeniously exploiting lattice matching nature, is developed to fabricate hollow ordered architectures assembled by SnO2 nanorods. SnO2 nanorods growing along [100] direction can achieve lattice-matched epitaxial growth on (110) plane of α-Fe2O3. Driven by the lattice matching, different α-Fe2O3 templates possessing different crystal plane orientations enable distinct assembly modes of SnO2, and four kinds of hollow ordered SnO2@C nanorods arrays (HONAs) with different morphologies including disc, hexahedron, dodecahedron and tetrakaidecahedron (denoted as Di-, He-, Do-, and Te-SnO2@C) are achieved. Benefiting from the synergy of hollow structure, carbon coating and ordered assembly structure, good structural integrity and stability and enhanced electrical conductivity are realized, resulting in impressive sodium storage performances when utilized as SIB anodes. Specifically, Te-SnO2@C HONAs exhibit excellent rate capability (385.6 mAh·g-1 at 2.0 A·g-1) and remarkable cycling stability (355.4 mAh·g-1 after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A·g-1). This work provides a promising route for constructing advanced SIB anode materials through epitaxial growth for rational structural design.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal dichalcogenides have great potential as anodes of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity. However, the restacking severely limits their accessible sites, leading to undesirable specific capacity, cycle stability, and working temperature range. Herein, a hierarchical 2D VS2/Ti3C2Tx MXene hybrid is designed via a simple liquid‐mixing method, where VS2 is confined in the conductive Ti3C2Tx matrix with chemical connections built between them. The in situ transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal that the hybrid depends on a very fast and reversible intercalation/de‐intercalation process between VS2 and NaxVS2 (where x = 1) to store sodium. Theoretical calculations disclose that the Ti3C2Tx matrix remarkably enhances the charge transfer and alleviates the volume expansion of VS2 especially after Na+ is inserted. Consequently, such a rational design exhibits an intercalation pseudocapacitance‐dominant mechanism, with excellent specific capacity (522 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), rate capability (342 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1), cycle life (116% after 3000 cycles), and also all‐climate workability (with high specific capacity and long‐term cycle stability even at 70 and −40 °C). This study may open up a new vision to design fast‐charging, long‐cycle, and all‐climate SIBs anodes based on the intercalation pseudocapacitance.",

        "abstract": "Electron transfer plays a crucial role in energy storage materials, such as metal-ion batteries (MIBs). Numerous approaches have been developed to facilitate the electron transfer for MIBs, and most of them extend the special surface areas, which promotes the contact between metal ions and the electrodes. Herein, we report the formation of intramolecular channels for electron transfer to open and close intermolecular channels in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) through functionalization, modulating the cell performance of two-dimensional (2D) nitrogenated holey graphene C2N anodes. This also activates the inactive metal ions in the anodes, reducing their production costs. Upon increasing the concentration of hydrogen atoms, the intramolecular electron transfer increases, lowering the intermolecular electron transfer between C2N and metal ions and thus weakening their interaction and reducing the capacities of the anodes. A high concentration of hydrogen atoms introduced in C2N would further promote the intramolecular electron transfer and block the channels for intermolecular electron transfer. For functionalized C2N monolayers that can be used as anodes in SIBs, they possess high specific capacities, high conductivities, and low open-circuit voltages. This work proposes the fabrication of 2D energy storage materials with tunable macroscale behaviors (e.g., performance) through the relationships between the macroscale and microscale levels and between intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer.",

        "abstract": "The development of layered metal sulfides with stable structure and accessible active sites is of great importance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a simple liquid-mixing method is elaborately designed to immobilize WS2 nanoflakes on N-doped carbon (NC), then further coat carbon to produce WS2/NC@C. In the formation process of this composite, the presence of NC not only avoids the overlap and improves the dispersion of WS2 nanoflakes, but also creates a connection network for charge transfer, where the wrapped carbon provides a stable chemical and electrochemical reaction interface. Thus, the composite of WS2/NC@C exhibits the desired Na+ storage capacity as anticipated. The reversible capacity reaches the high value of 369.8 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles, while excellent rate performances and cycle life are also acquired in that capacity values of 256.7 and 219.6 mA h g-1 at 1 and 5 A g-1 are preserved after 1000 cycles, respectively. In addition, the assembled sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs, AC//WS2/NC@C) exhibit an energy/power density of 68 W h kg-1 at 64 W kg-1, and capacity retention of 82.9% at 1 A g-1 after 2000 cycles.

        "abstract": "The lack of anodes stability is one among key barriers to the widespread commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). This is attributed to graphite, a well‐known common anode material for a range of commercial batteries including lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), which limits the insertion of sodium (Na) ions due to their large ionic size. Tin (Sn) has shown its potential as a suitable anode material because it exhibits high capacities in conversion and alloying reactions. However, it endures significant volumetric expansion and slower reaction rates during sodiation. To overcome these challenges, this work presents a novel anode material for SIBs where a 2D layered architecture of Sn with a hard carbon (HC) buffer layer is engineered using physical vapor deposition technique. This novel anode (SnHT/HC) exhibits a high initial capacity of 470 mAhg−1 and an exceptional retention of 438 mAhg−1 after 3000 cycles at 0.2C, with 99 % Coulombic efficiency. SnHT/HC testing at varying fast charge and discharge C‐rate of 5C, 10C, 15C, and 50C has shown promising results. Better electron transport and reduced volumetric changes are perceived to enhance the overall performance of SnHT/HC electrodes.",

However, the concomitant inorganic salt is usually recognized as impurities and plays an obscure and even contradictory effect on the regulation of pore structure in HCs. Herein, a two-step pyrolysis procedure to the representative salty coal is performed, in which the acid washing program is selectively inserted. It is illuminated that salt acts as a template or activating agent for the generation of open pores at low temperatures but inhibits the closure of pores during the following high-temperature carbonization. The optimized HC delivers a reversible capacity of 322.4 mAh g-1, a high plateau capacity of 192 mAh g-1, and an initial coulombic efficiency of 80%, outperforming to most coal-based HCs. Assembled with an NVPOF cathode, the full-cell exhibits a high energy density of 284.7 Wh kg-1.

        "abstract": "The development of aqueous rechargeable sodium batteries (ARSBs) demands high-performance electrode materials, especially anode materials with low operating potential and competent electrochemical properties. The lithium/sodium vanadium phosphate family with good structural stability and abundant vanadium chemistry versatility is a promising series for energy storage applications. Herein, a new member in the sodium vanadium phosphate family, i.e. NaV3(PO4)3, is introduced as a novel anode candidate for ARSBs. For the first time, its sodium intercalation mechanism in an aqueous electrolyte is explored, and moreover, the well-aligned NaV3(PO4)3@porous carbon nanofiber is constructed to fulfil its full potential. Based on the reversible phase transformation and 3D open framework, the NaV3(PO4)3 is demonstrated to be reliable in the aqueous electrolyte. Favored by the well-aligned, highly porous and hierarchical 1D nanoarchitecture, the freestanding aligned NaV3(PO4)3@porous carbon hybrid film achieves fast electron/ion transport capability and good mechanical flexibility, resulting in its superior high-rate properties and excellent cycling durability. Moreover, a full cell is fabricated using the aligned NaV3(PO4)3@C nanofiber as the anode and Na0.44MnO2 as the cathode. The cell is capable of high-rate long-term cycling, which retains 84% of the capacity after five hundred cycles at alternate 20 and 5C. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates a novel high-performance anode material for ARSBs, but also introduces a general applicable and highly efficient architecture of aligned 1D nanofibers for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides show promise for use in alkali‐ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacities. However, their poor cycling stability and rate performance hinder their further development. To avoid these issues, In2S3 into Sb2S3 is introduced to improve its electrochemical properties by optimizing its crystal structure and sodium storage mechanism. A heterostructure composed of In2S3 and Sb2S3 shows a unique morphology of formicary microspheres, which provide abundant channels for fast transfer of sodium ions, large surface area for a high pseudocapacitance effect, and enough voids to relieve volume expansion. A sodium‐ion battery containing the bimetallic sulfide anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and long cycle life of about 1000 cycles. Similarly, a high capacity of ≈610 mA h g−1 is achieved for a lithium‐ion battery containing the anode. During sodiation/desodiation, the synergistic effect of In2S3 and Sb2S3 enhances electronic conductivity and supports the host structure, preventing collapse. The cycling performance and rate performance of the In2S3–Sb2S3 anode are further improved by wrapping the electrode with carbon nanotubes. Even at a high current density of 3.2 A g−1, this carbon composite structure still shows a capacity of about 355 mA h g−1.",

Here, new anode materials Na1+xBixTi2−x(PO4)3/C (x=0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02) composites are prepared through introducing Bi elements into NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP, a promising anode material for ASIBs) with a facile sol‐gel method. Thus, it firstly reports that the Bi doping can contribute to the inhibition of hydrogen evolution via regulation the electrode potential for hydrogen evolution at the anode, also accompanying with excellent electrochemical and charge/discharge performances. The full cell constructed by Na0.44MnO2 as cathode and Bi‐modified NTP as anode, exhibits the better cycling performance with a larger capacity retention of about 80.1% at 2 C‐rate for 800 cycles and 80.2% at 10 C‐rate for 1400 cycles in contrast with the pristine one (71.2%, 56.2%), respectively. Furthermore, the expansion of the charge cut‐off voltage resulted from the inhibition of hydrogen evolution after Bi doping into NTP can finally increase the discharge capacity and energy density of the modified full cell by 21.8% and 17.3%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "To improve ion transport kinetics and electronic conductivity between the different phases in sodium/lithium-ion battery (LIB/SIB) anodes, heterointerface engineering is considered as a promising strategy due to the strong built-in electric field. However, the lattice mismatch and defects in the interphase structure can lead to large grain boundary resistance, reducing the ion transport kinetics and electronic conductivity. Herein, monometallic selenide Fe3 Se4 -Fe7 Se8 semi-coherent heterointerface embedded in 3D connected Nitrogen-doped carbon yolk-shell matrix (Fe3 Se4 -Fe7 Se8 @NC) is obtained via an in situ phase transition process. Such semi-coherent heterointerface between Fe3 Se4 and Fe7 Se8 shows the matched interfacial lattice and strong built-in electric field, resulting in the low interface impedance and fast reaction kinetics. Moreover, the yolk-shell structure is designed to confine all monometallic selenide Fe3 Se4 -Fe7 Se8 semi-coherent heterointerface nanoparticles, improving the structural stability and inhibiting the volume expansion effect. In particular, the 3D carbon bridge between multi-yolks shell structure improves the electronic conductivity and shortens the ion transport path. Therefore, the efficient reversible pseudocapacitance and electrochemical conversion reaction are enabled by the Fe3 Se4 -Fe7 Se8 @NC, leading to the high specific capacity of 439 mAh g-1 for SIB and 1010 mAh g-1 for LIB. This work provides a new strategy for constructing heterointerface of the anode for secondary batteries.",

However, the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of conventional sodium-ion storage anode materials are major challenges for the practical utilization of SICs. In this work, interconnected urchin-like hollow Na2Ti3O7 (Na2Ti3O7-IcUH) chains were designed and prepared by a simple one step template-assisting method.

High specific capacity and suitable working potential anode materials are one of the keys to search for future developments. Here, a novel and stable sodium titanate/carbon-black phosphorus (NTO/C-BP) hybrids are first fabricated as a promising anode material for advanced sodium-ion batteries. Under the protection of argon (Ar) atmosphere, the direct high-energy mechanical milling of the BP nanoparticle and NTO/C results in the formation of NTO/C-BP hybrids. In other words, the BP nanoparticle can be interconnected with bare NTO by P-O-Ti bonds and/or form stable P-C bonds with the carbon coating layer on the surface of NTO. The NTO/C-BP hybrids are not only beneficial for enhancing specific capacity but also have a great protective effect on the exposure of BP to air by the synergistic effect between BP and NTO/C. The results show that the NTO/C-BP hybrids can deliver very high specific capacity (∼225 mA h g-1 after 55 cycles at 20 mA g-1, ∼183 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1).

The anode is composed of cross-linking hollow carbon sheet encapsulated CuP2 nanoparticles (CHCS-CuP2) and a cathode of carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (C-NVPF). For the preparation of the CHCS-CuP2 nanocomposites, we develop an in situ phosphorization approach, which is superior to mechanical mixing. Such CHCS-CuP2 nanocomposites deliver a high reversible capacity of 451 mAh g-1 at 80 mA g-1, showing an excellent capacity retention ratio of 91% in 200 cycles together with good rate capability and stable cycling performance. Post mortem analysis reveals that the cross-linking hollow carbon sheet structure as well as the initially formed SEI layers are well preserved. Moreover, the inner electrochemical resistances do not significantly change. We believe that the presented battery system provides significant progress regarding practical application of SIB.",

        "abstract": "Metal selenides are promising anode candidates for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental friendship. However, the low rate capability at high current density due to its inherent low electrical conductivity and poor cycle stability caused by inevitable volume variations during cycling frustrate its practical applications. Herein, we have developed a simple metallic-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived selenide strategy to synthesize a series of heterogeneous bimetallic selenides encapsulated within graphene aerogels (GA) as anodes for SIBs. The bimetallic selenides/GA composites have unique structural characteristics that can shorten the migration path for Na+/electrons and accommodate the volume variations via additional void space during cycling. The built-in electric fields induced at the heterointerfaces can greatly reduce the activation energy for rapid charge transfer kinetics and promote the diffusion of Na+/electrons. GA is also beneficial for accommodating the volume variations during cycling and improving conductivity. As an advanced anode for SIBs, the MoSe2-Cu1.82Se@GA with a special porous octahedron can deliver the highest capacity of 444.8 mAh/g at a high rate of 1 A/g even after 1000 cycles among the bimetallic selenides/GA composites.",

In comparison to classic molecules and assembly processes, control over the steric interactions and linkage of large POMs to achieve superlattices with multiple levels of organization remains a great challenge. This work presents a universal approach to modulate the spatial coordination behavior and configurations, and achieves a class of cluster superlattice architectures formed by linear alignment and two-dimensional arrangement of POM units. The formation mechanism is explained as a stepwise co-assembly pathway in which POMs can intervene and dictate a typical stripping-restacking combination mode with the lamellar mediator. These cluster superlattices with long-range POMs ordering impart distinct merits to their derivatives by sulfuration, for which we demonstrate the substantially promoted power and cycling life of these POM derivatives applied as sodium-ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical behaviors of current graphitic carbons are seriously restricted by its low surface area and insufficient interlayer spacing for sodium-ion batteries. Here, sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nanosheets are reported by utilizing sodium dodecyl sulfate as sulfur resource and graphitization additive, showing a controllable interlayer spacing range from 0.38 to 0.41 nm and a high specific surface area up to 898.8 m2 g-1 . The obtained carbon exhibits an extraordinary electrochemical activity for sodium-ion storage with a large reversible capacity of 321.8 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 , which can be mainly attributed to the expanded interlayer spacing of the carbon materials resulted from the S-doping. Impressively, superior rate capability of 161.8 mAh g-1 is reserved at a high current density of 5 A g-1 within 5000 cycles, which should be ascribed to the fast surface-induced capacitive behavior derived from its high surface area. Furthermore, the storage processes are also quantitatively evaluated, confirming a mixed storage mechanism of diffusion-controlled intercalation behavior and surface-induced capacitive behavior. This study provides a novel route for rationally designing various carbon-based anodes with enhanced rate capability.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nitrides with layered structures and scalable syntheses have emerged as potential anode choices for the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries. However, the low crystallinity of materials synthesized through traditional thermal condensation leads to insufficient conductivity and poor cycling stability, which significantly hamper their practical applications. Herein, a facile salt-covering method was proposed for the synthesis of highly ordered crystalline C3N4-based all-carbon nanocomposites. The sealing environment created by this strategy leads to the formation of poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), the crystalline phase of C3N4, with extended π-conjugation and a fully condensed nanosheet structure. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations reveal the high crystallinity of C3N4 significantly reduces the energy barrier for electron transition and enables the generation of efficient charge transfer channels at the heterogeneous interface between carbon and C3N4. Accordingly, such nanocomposites present ultrastable cycling performances over 5000 cycles, with a high reversible capacity of 245.1 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 delivered. More importantly, they also exhibit an outstanding low-temperature capacity of 196.6 mAh g-1 at -20 °C. This work offers opportunities for the energy storage use of C3N4 and provides some clues for developing long-life and high-capacity anodes operated under extreme conditions.",

In this work, zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) nanospheres have been prepared by the simple hydrothermal route and the structural analysis of ZnFe2O4 was evaluated by using X-ray diffraction. The morphology and microstructural characterizations are obtained using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that a single phase material was obtained with uniform sphere-like morphology and high crystallinity. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method was employed to determine the specific surface area of the ZnFe2O4 nanospheres which has been calculated to be 32 m2 g−1. The electrochemical results indicate that the composite possesses high sodium storage capability (478 mA h g−1), and good cycling stability (284 mA h g−1 at 100th cycle) and rate capability (78 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1). The high sodium storage performance of the ZnFe2O4 electrode is ascribed to the mesoporous nature of the ZnFe2O4 nanospheres. Further, sodium kinetics and the reaction mechanism in ZnFe2O4 nanospheres have been elucidated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, ex situ TEM, and XAS. The acquired results indicate sluggish kinetics, reversibility of the material, and the stable structure of ZnFe2O4. Therefore, such a structure can be considered to be an attractive contender as a low cost anode for SIBs.",

        "title": "Heterogeneous carbon coated resin-based hard carbon anode material for high-performance sodium ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Resin-based hard carbons are promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high storage capacity and purity. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) still hinders their practical application. Crosslinking and high-temperature pyrolysis strategies have been demonstrated to improve ICE effectively, but the complex process and high energy consumption hinder their industrialization. This paper proposes a facile synthesis of resin-based hard carbon with a soft carbon coating strategy to improve ICE. By carbonizing commercial phenolic resin at 1150℃, hard carbon with a reversible capacity of 291.6 mAh g−1 and 82.6 % ICE was obtained. After asphalt-based soft carbon coating, the optimized sample (CHC-1150) with a heterogeneous carbon coating layer of about 8.5 nm displays a high reversible capacity and ICE of 309.8 mAh g−1 and 88.2 %. Moreover, when combined with NaFe1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the assembled 18650 cylindrical-type batteries deliver a high ICE of 84.3 %, excellent low-temperature capability and cycling stability. Additionally, the disassembly results after cycling indicate that the soft carbon layer can inhibit the decomposition of electrolytes and avoid sodium plating. These encouraging results suggest that heterogeneous carbon coating should be a promising strategy to promote the electrochemical performance of resin-based hard carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium‐ion batteries with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here, a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high‐capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of GeS bonds to synergistically realize high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti–S framework and weak GeS bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA h g−1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA h g−1 at 32 C over 10 000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, X‐ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations reveal the formation of well‐dispersed NaxGe confined in the rigid Ti–S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying‐conversion and surface‐dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding‐energy‐driven atomic scissors method would break new ground on designing a high‐rate and high‐capacity sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Disordered carbons are promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries. However, a major drawback of these materials is their low Coulombic efficiency in the first cycles, which indicates parasitic reactions. Such reactions can be supressed by alumina coating on the surface of the anodic materials; more ions are then available for electrochemical activity, and less electrolyte solution is lost. On the other hand, some pores and surface edge sites are passivated by the coating and are no longer available for reversible reaction with sodium ions, hence their contribution is eliminated, leading to reduction in specific capacity. We show herein that electrochemical insertion of sodium ions into carbon anodes prior to alumina coating has double positive effect on anode perfomances, meaning, preventing passivation and maintaining high specific capacity. We show that the artificial layer still prevented parasitic reactions, while the pores and surface edge sites retained electrochemical activity. The capacity values were thus restored and even became higher due to preventing the development of a surface layer. UPS measurements assessed the energetic states of the electrodes and confirmed that the alumina coating forms a barrier for interfacial electron transfer from the electrode to the solution at any polarization stage.",

Currently, there are still difficulties in research anode materials that can insert/extract Na/K ions quickly and stably. Herein, the sulfur-rich (NH4)2Mo3S13 is proposed as the anode for SIBs/PIBs and is obtained by a hydrothermal method. The sulfur-rich (NH4)2Mo3S13 with a three-dimensional structure shows a high capacity and long lifespans for Na+ (at 10 A g-1 the capacity of 165.2 mAh g-1 after 1100 cycles) and K+ (120.7 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 retained after 500 cycles) storage. In addition, the (NH4)2Mo3S13 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance at low temperatures (0 °C). The mechanism of Na+ storage in (NH4)2Mo3S13 can be innovatively revealed through the combined use of electrochemical kinetic analysis and a series of ex situ characterization tests. It is believed that the present work identifies (NH4)2Mo3S13 as a promising anode for the SIBs/PIBs and will be of broad interest in research on engineering sulfur-rich transition metal sulfide and on energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "As the sole commercially viable anode material for sodium‐ion batteries, hard carbon currently faces challenges such as slow diffusion kinetics in the low voltage range and low safety due to sodium deposition. In order to deepen the understanding of the pseudocapacitive processes of hard carbon in the high voltage range and enhance sodium storage capacity, this study systematically investigates the electrochemical performance and ion storage of ZPCs of different sizes. We propose a mathematical model based on a spherical particle core‐shell structure, which profoundly reveals the relationship between size and specific surface area, as well as the linear relationship between specific surface area and specific capacity. Moreover, simply by reducing the size of the porous carbon, the specific capacity increased by 86.5 mAh g‐1. Dynamic studies reveal that in nano‐porous carbon materials, sodium‐ion storage primarily relies on defect adsorption. Size reduction enhances physical adsorption and surface capacitance response, with ZPC‐80 exhibiting lower resistance and higher diffusion coefficient, indicating that size reduction improves electronic conductivity and charge transfer efficiency, achieving excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability. This work yields a profound insight into the dynamic characteristics of hard carbon anode, presenting a new perspective for the design of efficient sodium‐ion batteries.",

The as‐prepared Na2FePO4F@C fiber film tightly adherent on aluminum foil features great flexibility and is directly used as binder‐free cathode for sodium‐ion batteries, exhibiting admirable electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity (117.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C), outstanding rate capability (46.4 mAh g−1 at 20 C), and unprecedentedly high cyclic stability (85% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). The reaction kinetics and mechanism are explored by a combination study of cyclic voltammetry, ex situ structure/valence analyses, and first‐principles computations, revealing the highly reversible phase transformation of Na2FeIIPO4F ↔ NaFeIIIPO4F, the facilitated Na+ diffusion dynamics with low energy barriers, and the desirable pseudocapacitive behavior for fast charge storage. Pouch‐type Na‐ion full batteries are also assembled employing the Na2FePO4F@C nanofibers cathode and the carbon nanofibers anode, demonstrating a promising energy density of 135.8 Wh kg−1 and a high capacity retention of 84.5% over 200 cycles.

To make up for the lost sodium-ion, pre-sodiation treatments have been applied, which are effective ways to mitigate the low initial efficiency. Here, we developed a direct-contact method to achieve the pre-sodiation for cathode and anode electrodes and demonstrated the enhanced coulombic efficiency of the first cycle with improved cyclability and reversible capacity. Moreover, we proved the formation of a thick passivation layer at the cathode-electrolyte interface during the pre-sodiation process; this contributes to the improved cycle stability by preventing the dissolution of the active material and its deposition on the anode surface. The direct-contact method is a simple and cost-effective way to complete pre-sodiation, and this simple process will be widely applicable for practical battery manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon material is one of the candidates with great promise as anode-active material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, new types of biomass-derived hard carbons were obtained via one-step carbonization of lotus seedpods at 1000-1400 °C, respectively. The control of carbonization temperature proved to be significant in controlling the lattice characterization of lotus seedpod-derived hard carbon. Higher temperature generally promoted the lattice graphitization and thus generated a more narrowed d-interlayer space with limited pore volume. The hard carbon pyrolyzed at 1200 °C achieved an optimized reversible capacity of 328.8 mAh g-1 and exhibited a remarkable capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles. In addition, such a biomass-derived hard carbon presented improved cyclic stability and rate performance, revealing capacity of 330.6, 288.9, 216.9, 116.5, and 78.3 mAh g-1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g-1, respectively. Intrinsically, high pyrolysis temperature (1400 °C) gave rise to more narrowed carbon lattice and reduced pore volume and, thus, failed to accommodate sodium ions either from the intercalation into lattice or the ion adsorption onto the pore surface. Such combined advantages of lotus seedpod-derived hard carbon, including the abundance, sufficiently adequate reversible capacity, and prominent cycling and rate property allowed for its large-scale application as promising anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Fe3O4 is widely investigated as an anode for ambient sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), but its electrochemical properties in the wide operation‐temperature range have rarely been studied. Herein, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which are well encapsulated by carbon nanolayers, are uniformly dispersed on the graphene basal plane (named Fe3O4/C@G) to be used as the anode for SIBs. The existence of graphene can reduce the size of Fe3O4/C nanoparticles from 150 to 80 nm and greatly boost charge transport capability of electrode, resulting in an obvious size decrease of superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles generated from the conversion reaction from 5 to 2 nm. Importantly, the ultra‐small superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈2 nm) can induce a strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect at operating temperatures ranging from −40 to 60 °C, thus achieving highly efficient Na‐ion transport and storage in a wide operation‐temperature range. Consequently, the Fe3O4/C@G anode shows high capacity, excellent fast‐charging capability, and cycling stability ranging from −40 to 60 °C in half/full cells. This work demonstrates the viability of Fe3O4 as anode for wide operation‐temperature SIBs and reveals that spin‐polarized surface capacitance effects can promote Na‐ion storage over a wide operation temperature range.",

As expected, the as-prepared CoSe 2 @NC composite delivers remarkable reversible capacity and ultralong cycling lifespan even at a high rate (384.3 mAh g -1 after1800 loops under 2.0 A g -1 ) when served as anode for SIBs. This work provides great possibilities for the practical application of CoSe 2 -based anode in SIBs and the original strategy can be extended to explore other anode materials.",

        "abstract": "The instability of interfacial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer of metallic sodium (Na) anode during cycles results in the rapid capacity decay of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Herein, the concept of interfacial protection engineering of Na nanoparticles (Na-NPs) is proposed first to achieve stable, dendrite-free, and long-life SMB. Employing an ion-exchange strategy, conformal Sn-Na alloy-SEI on the interface of Na-NPs is constructed, forming Sn@Na-NPs. The stable alloy-based SEI layer possesses the following three advantages: 1) significantly enhancing the transport dynamics of Na+ ions and electrons; 2) enabling the well-distributed deposition of Na+ ions to avoid the growth of dendrites; and 3) protecting the Sn@Na-NPs anode from the attack of electrolyte, thereby reducing the parasitic reaction and boosting the Coulombic efficiency of SMBs. Because of these virtues, the symmetric Sn@Na-NPs cell shows an ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.54 V at 10 mA cm-2 after 600 h. Paired with the Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F (NaVPF) cathode, the NaVPF-Sn@Na-NPs full cell exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 89.2 mAh g-1 at 1 C and a high capacity retention of 81.6% after 600 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Coal samples of different ranks were investigated through various compositional, morphological/structural, and textural experiments prior to their electrochemical implementation in Na-ion half-cells. The purity of coals proved insignificant while distinctions in the flake size, pore width, pore distribution, I_D/I_G ratio, crystallite parameters (L_a and L_c) along with adjacent parameters, such as the R-empirical parameter, i.e., limited parallel graphene stacking proved more relevant for Na^+ storage into the negative host electrodes. Coal powders were identified via a two-step TGA analysis technique displaying the overall carbon content of the coals and the impurities. Coal-based anode materials were prepared from raw and pyrolyzed coals (at 800 °C under argon gas-flow) and cycled in Na-ion half-cells to further investigate the impact of the coal rank on the energetic properties. High volatile bituminous coal with lower graphene stacking and augmented nanoscopic pores delivered higher reversible capacity in comparison with semi-anthracite coal, whether in their raw (67 vs. 54 mAh/g) or pyrolyzed (214 vs. 64 mAh/g) states, respectively vs. Na/Na^+.

Herein, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy is used to address these challenges via filling the micropores of sucrose-based HC with pyrolysis by-products from acetonitrile, thereby reducing the specific surface area of HC microspheres. This approach mitigates the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leading to an enhancement in ICE. Moreover, the conversion of open micropores into closed pores creates additional storage space for sodium ions, effectively extending the specific capacity within the plateau region. Specifically, the HC prepared with a deposition duration of 1 h demonstrates the most favorable electrochemical performance. The optimal HC anode manifests an enhanced specific capacity of 307.6 mAh g−1 with an ICE of 66.01 % and exhibits excellent cycle stability (84.9 % capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100 mAh g−1).

To delineate the individual role of carbon matrix and graphene, material characterization and electrochemical analyses were performed for GeP3/C@rGO and three other samples: bare GeP3, GeP3 with graphene coating (GeP3@rGO) and GeP3 with carbon matrix (GeP3/C). GeP3/C@rGO exhibits the highest electric conductivity (5.89×10-1 S•cm-1) and the largest surface area (167.85 m2 g-1) among the four samples. The as-prepared GeP3/C@rGO delivered a reversibly high capability of 1084 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, excellent rate capability (435.4 mA h g-1 at a high rate of 5 A g-1) and long-term cycling stability (400 cycles with a reversible capacity of 823.3 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1), all of which out-performance the other three samples. The kinetics investigation reveals a \"pseudocapacitive behaviour\" in GeP3/C and GeP3/C@rGO, where solely faradic reactions took place in bare GeP3 and GeP3@rGO with a typical \"battery behaviour\". Based on ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ex-situ Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the carbon matrix serves to activate and stabilize the interior of composite, while the graphene protects and restrains the exterior surface. Benefitting from the synergistic combination of these two components, GeP3/C@rGO achieved extremely stable cycling stability as well as outstanding rate performance.",

        "abstract": "P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a promising cathode for sodium‐ion batteries with features of high specific capacity and air resistance, whereas its cycling stability and rate performance are dissatisfactory suffering from the disastrous P2‐O2 phase transition and Na+/vacancy ordering during sodium‐ion de/intercalation, which makes it an obstruction for future practical applications. Herein, a delicate multicomponent modulation strategy is proposed to tackle these two issues simultaneously, in which Li+ and Ti4+ are introduced to replace the Ni2+ and Mn4+, respectively, whereas the Na+ content is also designed according to the principle of charge balance. Consequently, the designed cathode (Na0.72Ni0.28Li0.05Mn0.57Ti0.10O2) can deliver an enchanting cycling stability of 80% at 1 C after 200 cycles along with a considerable rate performance of 82.7 mAh g−1 at 5 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction measurement demonstrates the destructive P2‐O2 phase transition is suppressed and converted into a P2‐Z phase transition with superior reversibility as well as smooth charge/discharge curves with better Na+/vacancy disordering. In addition, the full cell matched with hard carbon anode delivers an excellent energy density of 263.4 Wh kg−1 at 37.3 W kg−1, exhibiting great practicality.

Therefore, a simple method to prepare graphene-coated FeS2 embedded in carbon nanofibers is employed; the double protection from graphene coating and carbon fibers ensures high reversibility of FeS2 during sodiation/desodiation and improved conductivity, resulting in high rate capacity and long-term life for Na+ (305.5 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 after 2450 cycles) and K+ (120 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 680 cycles) storage at room temperature.

Furthermore, the full-cells deliver promising discharge capacity (50 mAh g-1 at 0 °C, 43 mAh g-1 at -20 °C) and high energy density at low temperatures.

        "abstract": "Tin (Sn) is considered to be an ideal candidate for the anode of sodium ion batteries. However, the design of Sn-based electrodes with maintained long-term stability still remains challenging due to their huge volume expansion (≈420%) and easy pulverization during cycling. Herein, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (GQD) edge-anchored Sn nanodots as the pillars into reduced graphene oxide blocks (NGQD/Sn-NG) for ultrafast and ultrastable sodium-ion storage is reported. Sn nanodots (2-5 nm) anchored at the edges of \"octopus-like\" GQDs via covalent SnOC/SnNC bonds function as the pillars that ensure fast Na-ion/electron transport across the graphene blocks. Moreover, the chemical and spatial (layered structure) confinements not only suppress Sn aggregation, but also function as physical barriers for buffering volume change upon sodiation/desodiation. Consequently, the NGQD/Sn-NG with high structural stability exhibits excellent rate performance (555 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 198 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and ultra-long cycling stability (184 mAh g-1 remaining even after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1 ).

However, the lack of high-performance anode materials becomes a main obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here, we identify an ideal anode material, a metallic TiC3 monolayer with not only remarkably high storage capacity of 1278 mA h g-1 but also low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure calculations. TiC3 still keeps metallic after adsorbing two-layer Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the battery cycle. Besides, high melting point and superior dynamical stability are in favor of practical application. Its excellent performance can be mainly attributed to the presence of an unusual n-biphenyl unit in the TiC3 monolayer. High cohesive energy, originating from multibonding coexistence (e.g., covalent, ionic, and metal bonds) in the TiC3 monolayer, provides strong feasibility for experimental synthesis. In comparison with TiC3, functionalized TiC3 with oxygen shows a higher storage capacity; meanwhile, it keeps nearly the same barrier energy. This is in sharp contrast with metal-rich MXenes. These intriguing properties make the TiC3 monolayer a promising anode material for SIBs.",

However, the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion full cells (SIFCs) suffers severely from the irreversible consumption of sodium ions of cathode during the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation of hard carbon anode. Here, a high‐efficiency cathode sodiation compensation reagent, sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), which possesses both a high theoretical capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and a capacity utilization as high as 99%, is proposed. The implementation of Na2C2O4 as sacrificial sodium species is successfully realized by decreasing its oxidation potential from 4.41 to 3.97 V through tuning conductive additives with different physicochemical features, and the corresponding mechanism of oxidation potential manipulation is analyzed. Electrochemical results show that in the full cell based on a hard carbon anode and a P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 cathode with Na2C2O4 as a sodium reservoir to compensate for sodium loss during SEI formation, the capacity retention is increased from 63% to 85% after 200 cycles and the energy density is improved from 129.2 to 172.6 W h kg−1.

In this work, heterostructured Bi2S3-Bi2O3 nanosheets (BS-BO) have been prepared through an easy water-bath approach. The formation of such unique BS-BO heterostructures was achieved through a controllable thioacetamide-directed surfactant-assisted reaction process. Bi2O3 sheets and Bi2S3 sheets can be also prepared through simply modifying the synthetic recipe. When employed as the sodium-ion battery anode material, the resultant BS-BO displays a reversible capacity of ∼630 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1. In addition, the BS-BO demonstrates improved rate capability and enhanced cycle stability compared to its Bi2O3 sheets and Bi2S3 sheets counterparts. The improved electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the built-in electric field in the BS-BO heterostructure, which effectively facilitates the charge transport. This work would shed light on the construction of novel heterostructures for high-performance sodium-ion batteries and other energy-related devices.",

In this work, high-performance NIBs are demonstrated by designing a 3D interconnected porous structure that consists of N, S co-doped 3D porous graphene frameworks (3DPGFs-NS). The most typical electrode materials (i.e., Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 (NVP), MoS2 , and TiO2 ) are anchored onto the 3DPGFs-NS matrix (denoted as NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS; MoS2 @C@3DPGFs-NS and TiO2 @C@3DPGFs-NS) to demonstrate its general process to boost the energy density of NIBs. The N, S co-doped porous graphene structure with a large surface area offers fast ionic transport within the electrode and facilitates efficient electron transport, and thus endows the 3DPGFs-NS-based composite electrodes with excellent sodium storage performance. The resulting NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS displays excellent electrochemical performance as both cathode and anode for NIBs. The MoS2 @C@3DPGFs-NS and TiO2 @C@3DPGFs-NS deliver capacities of 317 mAhg-1 at 5 Ag-1 after 1000 cycles and 185 mAhg-1 at 1 Ag-1 after 2000 cycles, respectively. The excellent long cycle life is attributed to the 3D porous structure that could greatly release mechanical stress from repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. The novel structure 3D PGFs-NS provides a general approach to modify electrodes of NIBs and holds great potential applications in other energy storage fields.",

The demand of sustainable power supply requires high-performance cost-effective energy storage technologies.

The redox couple of manganese(I/II) in Prussian blue analogs enables a high-rate and stable anode. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering provide direct evidence suggesting the existence of monovalent manganese in the charged anode. There is a strong hybridization between cyano ligands and manganese- 3d states, which benefits the electronic property for improving rate performance. Additionally, we employ an organic–aqueous cosolvent electrolyte to solve the long-standing solubility issue of Prussian blue analogs. A full-cell sodium-ion battery with low-cost Prussian blue analogs in both electrodes and co-solvent electrolyte retains 95% of its initial discharge capacity after 1000 cycles at 1C and 95% depth of discharge.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon were prepared from Eucommia ulmoides barks by carbonization (1100 or 1300 °C) and then used as anode materials for sodium ion battery (SIB). Results showed that, although increased carbonization temperature had positive influence on the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of samples, the sample carbonized at higher temperature could not show higher specific capacities from 100 mA g^− 1 to 1 A g^− 1 (current density). This phenomenon could be attributed to few changes of specific surface area for samples carbonized at different temperature. Further studies showed that if the obtained hard carbon underwent high temperature treatment together with pitch powders (the hard carbon did not need to contact with pitch powders directly during the treating process), the specific surface area of samples decreased, while number of disordered bonds and interlayer distance of crystallites increased. The modification of structural defects made the samples show better electrochemical performances (ICE, specific capacity and cycling characteristic). Additionally, when the method (modifying defects) was used in Cupressus funebris (cypress wood) based anodes for SIB, the ICE and specific capacities at different current densities of samples could also be improved, which means the method may have good applicability for producing biomass-derived SIB anodes on a large scale.

        "abstract": "Hard carbons are emerging as the most viable anodes to support the commercialization of sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries due to their competitive performance. However, the hard carbon anode suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), and the ambiguous Na-ion (Na^+) storage mechanism and interfacial chemistry fail to give a reasonable interpretation. Here, we have identified the time-dependent ion pre-desolvation on the nanopore of hard carbons, which significantly affects the Na^+ storage efficiency by altering the solvation structure of electrolytes. Consummating the pre-desolvation by extending the aging time, generates a highly aggregated electrolyte configuration inside the nanopore, resulting in negligible reductive decomposition of electrolytes. When applying the above insights, the hard carbon anodes achieve a high average ICE of 98.21% in the absence of any Na supplementation techniques. Therefore, the negative-to-positive capacity ratio can be reduced to 1.02 for full cells, which enables an improved energy density. The insight into hard carbons and related interphases may be extended to other battery systems and support the continued development of battery technology. Hard carbon is regarded as a promising negative electrode for Na-ion batteries but suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Here, the authors identify the time-dependent ion pre-desolvation on the nanopore of hard carbons, which remarkably improves the ICE by simply extending the aging time.",

The utilization of SWCNT overcomes the structure instabilities during electrode preparation of thick electrodes. The incorporation of SWCNT and sulfur dopants in the CNT/S‐TiO2 composite not only enhances conductivity but also improves ion transport dynamics, resulting in rapid charge delivery and high specific capacity at the thick electrode level. Consequently, CNT/S‐TiO2 demonstrates excellent rate performance (from 0.3 to 15 C, with 72.4% capacity retention) and long cycling stability (10000 cycles at a load of 1.96 mg cm−2). More importantly, the high S‐TiO2 content (90%) in the thick electrode (21.2 mg cm−2) achieves a high areal capacity retention of 3.4 mA h cm−2 after 100 cycles, which surpasses the actual application requirements.",

Finding suitable anode materials for commercial alkali metal-ion batteries is not only urgent for the energy storage industry, but is also important for economic and sustainable development. In this work, we use fly ash carbon (FAC), a residue of crude oil combustion, as an anode material for alkali metal-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as promising supplementary for energy storage devices. Among various anode materials, carbon‐based materials have been considered ideal for SIBs due to their excellent electronic conductivity, great mechanical strength, and large surface area. However, the small interlayer distance and slower reaction kinetics significantly limit their practical application in SIBs. The study of carbon materials in SIBs found that heteroatom doping could help enlarge interlayer distance and adsorb more Na+ simultaneously. Hence, petroleum coke (PC), an industrial waste, is chosen as a precursor. A straightforward oxidation and carbonization process is employed to introduce oxygen atoms into the carbon skeleton (OPC). The heteroatom‐doped OPC exhibits a unique microcrystalline structure comprising both graphitic and disordered regions. This structure improves rate performance and enhances initial columbic efficiency (ICE) for sodium storage. Consequently, it can deliver a better cycling capacity of 209 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a high ICE of 51.3% (vs 66.9 mAh g−1 with ICE of PC 12.6%). This study shows that heteroatom doping and microstructural tailoring of materials derived from petroleum coke provide a viable approach for enhancing the electrochemical performance of SIBs, paving the way for sustainable and efficient sodium storage.",

        "title": "Boosting Sodium Storage Performance of Hard Carbon Anodes by Pore Architecture Engineering.",
        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) displays great potential for high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its cost-effective, simple fabrication and most likely to be commercialized. However, the complicated microstructures of HC lead to difficulties in deeply understanding the structure-performance correlation. Particularly, evaluation of influence of pore structure on Na storage performances is still causing disputes and rational strategies of designing pore architecture of HC are still necessary. In this work, the skillful and controllable phase-inversion method is applied to construct porous HC with abundantly interconnected and permeable tunnel-like pores, which can promote ionic diffusion and improve electrode-electrolyte interfacial affinity. Structure-performance investigation reveals that porous HC with cross-coupled macropore architecture can boost Na storage performances comprehensively. Compared to pristine HC with negligible pores, well-regulated porous HC anodes show an obvious enhancement on initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 68.3% (only 51.5% for pristine HC), reversible capacity of 332.7 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, rate performance with 67.4% capacity retention at 2 A g-1 (46.5% for pristine HC), and cycling stability with 95% capacity maintained for 90 cycles (86.4% for pristine HC). Additionally, the ICE can be optimized up to 76% by using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder. This work provides an important view of optimizing Na storage performances of HC anodes by pore engineering, which can be broadened into other electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Antimony is a competitive and promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity. However, the poor rate capability and fast capacity fading greatly restrict its practical application. To address the above issues, a facile and eco-friendly sacrificial template method is developed to synthesize hollow Sb nanoparticles impregnated in open carbon boxes (Sb HPs@OCB). The as-obtained Sb HPs@OCB composite exhibits excellent sodium storage properties even when operated at an elevated temperature of 50 °C, delivering a robust rate capability of 345 mAh g-1 at 16 A g-1 and rendering an outstanding reversible capacity of 187 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 10 A g-1 after 300 cycles. Such superior electrochemical performance of the Sb HPs@OCB can be attributed to the comprehensive characteristics of improved kinetics derived from hollow Sb nanoparticles impregnated into 2D carbon nanowalls, the existence of robust SbOC bond, and enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior. All those factors enable Sb HPs@OCB great potential and distinct merit for large-scale energy storage of SIBs.",

Lattice strain engineering controls the structural evolution during sodium ion insertion/extraction and minimizes the aggregation of active material and volume expansion during cycling. Herein, the ball milling technique is used to tune the lattice strain of NiS nanocomposite, which was later employed as anode material in SIBs. The structurally tuned anode exhibits high sodiation capacity, good rate capability (495.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, 383.2 mAhg−1 at 15 Ag−1), and exceptional cycling performance (16,000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Significantly, introducing a considerable amount of moderate strain into the structure by the ball milling technique, researchers can solve the problem of structure instability, volume expansion, and high-capacity loss of the electrode materials during repeated cycling. Therefore, lattice strain engineering using ball milling is a potential approach that may open the door to more sustainable and functional SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom‐doped carbon materials with expanded interlayer distance have been widely studied as anodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, it remains unexplored to further enlarge the interlayer spacing and reveal the influence of heteroatom doping on carbon nanostructures for developing more efficient SIB anode materials. Here, a series of N‐rich few‐layer graphene (N‐FLG) with tuneable interlayer distance ranging from 0.45 to 0.51 nm is successfully synthesized by annealing graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4) under zinc catalysis and selected temperature (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C). More significantly, the correlation between N dopants and interlayer distance of resultant N‐FLG‐T highlights the effect of pyrrolic N on the enlargement of graphene interlayer spacing, due to its stronger electrostatic repulsion. As a consequence, N‐FLG‐800 achieves the optimal properties in terms of interlayer spacing, nitrogen configuration and electronic conductivity. When used as an anode for SIBs, N‐FLG‐800 shows remarkable Na+ storage performance with ultrahigh rate capability (56.6 mAh g−1 at 40 A g−1) and excellent long‐term stability (211.3 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), demonstrating the effectiveness of material design.",

Herein, a high‐entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as‐prepared carbon‐free high‐entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE‐NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81 V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5 Wh kg−1, which is attributed by the diverse transition‐metal elemental substitution in high‐entropy crystalline. More importantly, high‐entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low‐voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na‐ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE‐NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8 Wh kg−1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg−1. This route means the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON‐type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating the mean working voltage for SIB cathodes.",

Nevertheless, the poor cyclic stability and rate performance at high current density impede their development. Therefore, defect‐enriched nano‐scale heterogeneous NiS2/Cu7.2S4 (NCSs) polyhedron with cavity structure are prepared through component regulation. The cavity structure is formed based on Kirkendall effect due to the component difference, tolerating the mechanical stress during the sodium storage process.

However, its electrochemical performance is constrained by connatural low electronic conductivity and inadequate sodium ion diffusion. Herein, a high-entropy substitution strategy is employed in NFPP to address these limitations. Ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a single-phase electrochemical reaction during the sodiation/desodiation processes and the increased configurational entropy in HE-NFPP endows an enhanced structure, which results in a minimal volume variation of only 1.83%. Kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculation further confirm that the orbital hybrid synergy of high-entropy transition metals offers a favorable electronic structure, which efficaciously boosts the charge transfer kinetics and optimizes the sodium ion diffusion channel. Based on this versatile strategy, the as-prepared high-entropy Na4 Fe2.5 Mn0.1 Mg0.1 Co0.1 Ni0.1 Cu0.1 (PO4 )2 (P2 O7 ) (HE-NFPP) cathode can deliver a prominent rate performance of 55 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 and an ultra-long cycling lifespan of over 18 000 cycles at 5 A g-1 .

It delivers high reversible capacity, super rate performance, and long cycling stability (473 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles for LIBs and 223 mA h g(-1) after 1200 cycles for SIBs, respectively, at the current density of 1000 mA g(-1) ), with a capacity decay of 0.0214% per cycle for LIBs and 0.0155% per cycle for SIBs. The results demonstrate that constructing 3D interdigital porous structure with reactive oxygen functional groups can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of oxygen-doped carbonaceous material.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) layered antimony (Sb) materials are of importance due to their unique physicochemical properties, and they can be easily electrochemically exfoliated from bulk Sb in Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. However, the exfoliation yield is quite low and the exfoliated products are easily oxidized to Sb2O3, which prohibits their practical engineering applications. Herein, an antimonene/carbon composite is successfully fabricated with a high exfoliation yield through electrochemical exfoliation of bulk antimony chunk in a mixed electrolyte solution consisting of Na2SO4 and ethylene glycol. When the as-fabricated antimonene/carbon composite is added into PAO6 oil, the lubrication system exhibits a selective lubrication performance when sliding against GCr15 and YG8 ball, and the antiwear enhancement can be further improved by sliding against a YG8 ball. Besides, the antimonene/carbon composite can provide reliability and enough ion corridors during the charge/discharge processes. When tested as an anodic material for sodium-ion batteries, it exhibits a large capacity of 485.0 mA h g-1 at a current density of 200 mA g-1 after 150 cycles and a remarkable rate capability (334.5 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1).",

The synergistic effect between components endows Ni2 P@C/GA electrode with high structural stability and electrochemical activity, leading to excellent electrochemical performance, retaining a specific capacity of 124.5 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 over 2000 cycles. The robust 3D GA matrix with abundant open pores and large surface area can provide unblocked channels for electrolyte storage and Na+ transfer and make fully close contact between the electrode and electrolyte. The carbon layers and 3D GA together build a 3D conductive matrix, which not only tolerates the volume expansion as well as prevents the aggregation and pulverization of Ni2 P nanoparticles during Na+ insertion/extraction processes, but also provides a 3D conductive highway for rapid charge transfer processes. The present strategy for phosphides via in situ phosphization route and coupling phosphides with 3D GA can be extended to other novel electrodes for high-performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise owing to the naturally abundant sodium resource and high safety. The research focus of SIBs is usually directed toward electrode materials, while the binder as an important component is rarely investigated. Herein, a cross-linked sodium alginate (SA)/graphene oxide (GO) binder is judiciously designed to serve as a robust artificial interphase on the surface of both anode and cathode of SIBs. Benefiting from the cross-linking continuous network structure as well as the highly hydrophilic nature, the SA-GO binder possesses a large tensile strength of 197.7 Mpa and a high ionic conductivity of 0.136 mS cm-1 , superior to pure SA (93.8 Mpa, 0.025 mS cm-1 ). Moreover, the structural design of SA-GO binder exhibits a strong binding ability to guarantee structural integrity during cycling. To demonstrate its effectiveness, polyanion-type phosphates (e.g., Na3 (VO)2 (PO4 )2 F) and chalcogenides (e.g., MoS2 , VS2 ) are adopted as cathode and anode materials of SIBs, respectively. As compared to traditional binders (e.g., PVDF, SA), electrodes with the SA-GO binder exhibits significantly increased rate capability and cycling stability, such as Na3 (VO)2 (PO4 )2 F (40 C fast-charge, 84% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). This work highlights the role of novel aqueous-based binders in developing next-generation sodium-storage devices.",

Herein, an effective strategy of polymorph engineering is proposed to boost the volumetric capacity of FeSe. Owing to the inherent metallic electronic conductivity of tetragonal‐FeSe, a conductive additive‐free electrode (hereafter denoted as CA‐free) can be assembled with an enhanced sodium storage volumetric capacity of 1011 mAh cm−3, significantly higher than semiconducting hexagonal‐FeSe. Impressively, the CA‐free electrode can achieve an extremely high active material utilization of 96.7 wt% and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96%, superior to most of the anodes for Na‐ion storage. Moreover, the design methodology is branched out using tetragonal FeSe as the cathode for Li‐ion batteries. The CA‐free tetragonal‐FeSe electrode can achieve a high volumetric energy density of 1373 Wh L−1 and power density of 7200 W L−1, outperforming most metal chalcogenides. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by in situ XRD for both sodium and lithium systems.

        "abstract": "SnS2/reduced graphite oxide (rGO) composite materials show great potential as high-performance anode candidates in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and power densities. However, the repeated formation/decomposition of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer around composite anodes usually consumes additional sodium cations, resulting in poor Coulombic efficiency and decreasing specific capacity upon cycling. Therefore, in order to compensate for the large irreversible sodium loss of the SnS2/rGO anode, this study has proposed a facile strategy by implementing organic solutions of sodium-biphenyl/tetrahydrofuran (Na-Bp/THF) and sodium-naphthylamine/dimethoxyethane (Na-Naph/DME) as chemical presodiation reagents. Particularly, the storage stability of Na-Bp/THF and Na-Naph/DME in ambient air accompanied by their presodiation behavior on the SnS2/rGO anode has been investigated, and both reagents exhibited desirable ambient air-tolerant storage stability with favorable sodium supplement effects even after 20 days of storage. More importantly, the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of SnS2/rGO electrodes could be controllably increased by immersing in a presodiation reagent for different durations. Consequently, with a facile chemical presodiation strategy of immersion in Na-Bp/THF solution for only 3 min in ambient air, the presodiated SnS2/rGO anode has exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high ICE of 95.6% as well as an ultrahigh specific capacity of 879.2 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles (83.5% of its initial capacity), highly superior to the pristine SnS2/rGO anode. This efficient and scalable presodiation strategy provides a new avenue for the prevailing application of other anode candidates in high-energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Given the widespread availability of sodium on our planet, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) hold substantial promise as cost-effective energy storage solutions. Red Phosphorus (red P) has emerged as a promising candidate for SIBs anodes due to its impressive theoretical capacity of 2596mAh g−1. However, red P faces inherent challenges, mainly due to its insulating nature and significant volume changes during cycling, which adversely affect its cycling and rate performance. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a novel material called P@C, composed of carbon-coated and porous carbon structures. The synthesis of P@C involves integrating red P with PVDF and a series of carefully controlled steps, including ultrasonic dispersion, magnetic stirring, centrifugation, and high-temperature calcination. This well-designed composite material facilitates electron transfer and provides ample space within its porous carbon structure to accommodate the substantial volume changes associated with phosphorus during sodium insertion/extraction. The use of PVDF as a carbon source contributes to the creation of a defined porous carbon framework, enhancing the material's flexibility, mechanical strength, and ease of processing. As a result, when employed as an anode material for SIBs, the P@C composite material exhibits exceptional cycling stability and remarkable rate performance. Notably, it demonstrates superior capacity retention, maintaining 336.7mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A/g, and excellent cycling durability, with minimal capacity degradation even after 500 cycles at 1 A/g.This innovative work, characterized by its strategic carbon-coating approach that effectively encapsulates the active material within porous structures, provides valuable insights into the development of high-performance electrode materials for metal-ion batteries and other energy storage applications.",

The obtained B3S2 monolayer has a high cohesive energy, ensuring the feasibility of experimental synthesis. These characteristics of the B3S2 monolayer prompt us to explore its application as an anode material. The B3S2 monolayer exhibits not only a metallic nature but also a low diffusion energy barrier (0.037 eV) and open-circuit voltage (0.09 V). More importantly, the B3S2 monolayer shows a very high theoretical capacity of 1658 mA h g-1 as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, which is comparable to other similar or common 2D materials. All of these intriguing properties make the B3S2 monolayer a promising 2D anode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "For most alloying- and conversion-type anode materials, a huge volume expansion and structure degradation of the electrodes always hinder their applications. In this work, a novel core-shell-shell Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C nanorod composite has been designed layer by layer, which includes an inner Sb2S3/Sb heterostructure core protected by an oxygen-deficient TiO2 shell and a conductive carbon shell. It is interesting to observe that, during the carbothermic reduction process, the previous Sb2S3 nanorod cores are partially reduced into a metallic Sb phase and the reduced TiO2 also creates many oxygen vacancies, which can greatly enhance the conductivity of the semiconductor Sb2S3. Thanks to the double effects of the TiO2 middle shell and carbon outer shell, the unique double-shelled structure design creates an enhanced dual protection, which can better accommodate the volume-expansive deformation and preserve the structural integrity of the active Sb2S3/Sb core. Especially, the TiO2 middle layer is self-assembled by numerous nanoparticles acting as a nanopillar backbone, which supports between the nanorod core and outer carbon shell to better buffer the volume changes. As a result, the core-shell-shell Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C anode shows lithium and sodium storage performances superior to those of the pristine Sb2S3 and core-shell Sb2S3@TiO2 electrodes. For lithium-ion batteries, the Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C nanorod composite achieves an initial discharge/recharge capacity of 1244.9/1005.1 mAh g-1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of about 80.7%, an enhanced rate capability with a capacity of 593.2 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1, and prolonged cycling life for 500 cycles with a reversible capacity of 495.8 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1.

        "title": "A Green Route to a Na2FePO4F-Based Cathode for Sodium Ion Batteries of High Rate and Long Cycling Life.",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising alternatives for large-scale energy storage due largely to the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance cathode materials at low cost represents a major obstacle toward broad commercialization of SIB technology. In this work, we report a green route strategy that allows cost-effective fabrication of carbon-coated Na2FePO4F cathode for SIBs. By using vitamin C as a green organic carbon source and environmentally friendly water-based polyacrylic latex as the binder, we have demonstrated that the Na2FePO4F phase in the as-derived Na2FePO4F/C electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 117 mAh g-1 at a cycling rate of 0.1 C. More attractively, excellent rate capability is achieved while retaining outstanding cycling stability (∼85% capacity retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a rate of 4 C). Further, in operando X-ray diffraction has been used to probe the evolution of phase structures during the charge-discharge process, confirming the structural robustness of the Na2FePO4F/C cathode (even when charged to 4.5 V). Accordingly, the poor initial Coulombic efficiency of some anode materials may be compensated by extracting more sodium ions from Na2FePO4F/C cathode at higher potentials (up to 4.5 V).",

        "abstract": "In the scenario of renewable clean energy gradually replacing fossil energy, grid-scale energy storage systems are urgently necessary, where Na-ion batteries (SIBs) could supply crucial support, due to abundant Na raw materials and a similar electrochemical mechanism to Li-ion batteries. The limited energy density is one of the major challenges hindering the commercialization of SIBs. Alloy-type anodes with high theoretical capacities provide good opportunities to address this issue. However, these anodes suffer from the large volume expansion and inferior conductivity, which induce rapid capacity fading, poor rate properties, and safety issues. Carbon-based alloy-type composites (CAC) have been extensively applied in the effective construction of anodes that improved electrochemical performance, as the carbon component could alleviate the volume change and increase the conductivity. Here, state-of-the-art CAC anode materials applied in SIBs are summarized, including their design principle, characterization, and electrochemical performance. The corresponding alloying mechanism along with its advantages and disadvantages is briefly presented. The crucial roles and working mechanism of the carbon matrix in CAC anodes are discussed in depth. Lastly, the existing challenges and the perspectives are proposed. Such an understanding critically paves the way for tailoring and designing suitable alloy-type anodes toward practical applications.",

A threefold strategy is adopted to achieve a high rate performance. First, the mesoporous structure with high specific surface area and large pore volume facilitates the transfer of electrolyte and accommodates the large volume change. Secondly, graphitic carbon encapsulation further improves the electronic conductivity of the nanocomposite. Finally, ultrafine Fe2 O3 nanocrystals effectively shorten the Na+ diffusion length. Consequently, this nanocomposite exhibits stable and fast Na+ storage, thus leading to excellent rate capability and cyclability. Pseudocapacitive behavior is found to dominate in the redox reactions, accounting for the outstanding rate and cycling performance.

        "abstract": "Developing high‐performance carbonaceous anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is still a grand quest for a more sustainable future of energy storage. Introducing sulfur within a carbon framework is one of the most promising attempts toward the development of highly efficient anode materials. Herein, a microporous sulfur‐rich carbon anode obtained from a liquid sulfur‐containing oligomer is introduced. The sodium storage mechanism shifts from surface‐controlled to diffusion‐controlled at higher synthesis temperatures. The different storage mechanisms and electrode performances are found to be independent of the bare electrode material's interplanar spacing. Therefore, these differences are attributed to an increased microporosity and a thiophene‐rich chemical environment. The combination of these properties enables extending the plateau region to higher potential and achieving reversible overpotential sodium storage. Moreover, in‐operando small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) reveals reversible electron density variations within the pore structure, in good agreement with the pore‐filling sodium storage mechanism occurring in hard carbons (HCs). Eventually, the depicted framework will enable the design of high‐performance anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries with competitive energy density.",

Herein, for the first time, large-area and ultrathin carbon nanosheets doped with N/O were constructed by stripping bulk chitin via a \"top-down\" method. On the basis of the specific layered structure composed of nanofibers, chitin samples after removing the protein and CaCO3 could be efficiently exfoliated into nanosheets (CNs) via the hydrothermal method, which were then carbonized into N/O co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (CCNs). The CCNs with a thickness of about 3.8 nm retained the original nanosheet structure consisting of nanofibers, leading to a 2D structure with hierarchical porosities. When used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the 2D porous nanostructures and abundant N/O doping of CCNs-600 (carbonized at 600 °C) enable a high reversible capacity of 360 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a good rate capability of 102 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1, and an excellent cycling stability of 140 mA h g-1 after 10 000 cycles at a high density of 5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Realizing high performances of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) working at low temperatures is a pressing need for the commercial applications of SIBs. In this work, nanodiamonds (NDs) are introduced in diglyme electrolytes (ND-Diglyme) to significantly improve the low-temperature performances of SIBs. The corresponding SIB achieves an initial reversible specific capacity of 324 mA h g-1 at -40 °C (slightly decreased from 357 mA h g-1 at 25 °C) and shows a capacity retention ratio of ≈82% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1. Moreover, it shows a capacity as high as 40 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1, nearly five times the date of the pure Diglyme electrolyte. Experimentally reveals that introducing NDs is helpful in inhibiting dendrite growth and improving the cyclic stability of anode at LT, because the ND with strong adsorption to sodium ions can not only assist in forming an effective solid electrolyte interface rich with NaF and Na2CO3 but also effectively reduce the activation energy (decreased from 426.68 to 370.51 meV) during the charge transfer processes. Hence, the proposed ND-assisted weakly ether electrolyte in this study presents a viable electrolyte additive solution to fulfill the rising low-temperature demands of SIBs.",

        "title": "Performance of carbon xerogels as anodes for sodium dual-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Carbon xerogel with different mean pore sizes (10, 50, 100, 500 nm) but analogous structure, chemical composition, surface area, and microporosity, which are produced by an energy-effective microwave-based process, and activated carbon xerogels (100 nm-pore size) with higher microporosity were investigated as anodes for sodium dual-ion batteries. The objective of this study was to optimize the material textural properties for this specific application to be further matched with a carbon xerogel-based cathode in a full battery configuration. To this end, the role of these properties was evaluated, specifically the pore size and the microporosity since the storage of the Na+ ions in these carbon xerogels was demostrated to occur mainly by a pseudocapacitive mechanism based on adsorption on surface, defects (i.e. microporosity) and pores. The balance between the pore size and the associated external surface area of the carbon xerogels was a determining factor for their anodic performance. In this context, a material pore size of ∼ 100 nm and an associated external surface area of ∼ 100 m2 g−1 was the optimum balance. For a given material pore size, the increase of the microporosity by physical activation improved the anode capacity as well as the cycling stability. However, the development of the microporosity in relation to the external surface area must be optimized to avoid an undesirable increase in the first cycle irreversible capacity. Overall, the physically activated carbon xerogel with a pore size of 100 nm, a micropore volume of 0.47 cm3 g−1 and an external surface of 123 m2 g−1 was the most suitable active anode material for sodium dual-ion batteries. This material provided a specific discharge capacity of ∼ 154 mAh g−1 after 300 discharge/charge cycles with excellent cycling stability and coulombic efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Although bismuth-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted wide attention, their large volume variation hinders their actual applications, especially in Bi2Te3 systems. In this study, Bi2Te3 nanosheets (BT-Ns) are fabricated by a novel strategy via a solvent reductive reaction. The elements Bi and Te are spontaneously grown into ultrathin nanosheets because the hexagonal crystal of Bi2Te3 has a strong tendency to grow horizontally. The crystal structure of the BT-Ns is well developed and the thickness is about 1.42 nm, which can not only offer more active sites but also promote electrical conductivity and the diffusion of Na ions and electrons. It exhibits excellent rate and long-term cyclic performance, delivering 364.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 1200 cycles. The high rate and long-term cyclic performance of the Bi2Te3 anodes is attributed to the facile design of the 2D nanosheet structure, presenting an effective strategy to construct anodes for SIBs. The sodium storage mechanism of Bi2Te3 follows a three-step crystallographic phase change of Bi2Te3, discovered by an in situ X-ray diffraction analysis. The applicability of BT-N anodes in full cells via pairing with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes delivers excellent performance (energy density of 107.2 W h kg-1) and satisfactory practical applied prospects.",

        "abstract": "To render the sodium ion battery (SIB) competitive among other technologies, the processes behind sodium storage in hard carbon anodes must be understood. For this purpose, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is usually undervalued, since fitting the spectra with equivalent circuit models requires an a priori knowledge about the system at hand. The analysis of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) is an alternative, which refrains from fitting arbitrarily nested equivalent circuits. In this paper, the sodiation and desodiation of a hard carbon anode is studied by EIS at different states of charge (SOC). By reconstructing the DRT function, highly resolved information on the number and relative contribution of individual electrochemical processes is derived. During the sloping part of the sodiation curve, mass transport is found to be the most dominant source of resistance but rapidly diminishes when the plateau phase is reached. An equivalent circuit model qualitatively reproducing the experimental data of the sloping region was built upon the DRT results, which is particularly useful for future EIS studies on hard carbon SIB anodes. More importantly, this work contributes to establish EIS as a practical tool to directly study electrode processes without the bias of a previously assumed model.",

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals that the doped phosphorus atoms can incorporate into the carbon framework and most of them are connecting with carbon atoms to form P-C bond. The (002) plane interlayer spacing was taken from the X-ray diffraction pattern, which shows a large spacing of 3.83 Å for the obtained P-doped hard carbon nanofibers. When used as an anode in sodium-ion batteries, the as-prepared P-doped hard carbon nanofibers can deliver a reversible capacity of 288 and 103 mAh g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1 and 2 A g-1, respectively. After 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1, the capacity retention of P-doped hard carbon nanofibers still reaches 87.8%, demonstrating good cycling durability. These excellent electrochemical performances of P-doped hard carbon nanofibers can be attributed to the macroporous structure, large interlayer spacing, and the formation of P-C bond.",

However, its practical application is still hampered by disadvantages such as large volume expansion during charging/discharging and limited cycle life. Therefore, reasonable structural design is of great importance in order to achieve an excellent sodium storage performance of the electrode materials for SIBs. Herein, nano-MnS@N,P dual-doped lignite based porous carbon (MnS@N,P-LPC) composite with a single MnS cube encapsulated in an N,P dual-doped lignite derived porous C is successfully prepared as superior anode material for SIBs. The multilayer pore structure and the combined effect of N and P dual-doping can enhance electrochemical performance by supplying more sodium storage sites.

It exhibits outstanding cycling stability and superior rate performance. This excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the presence of the multilayer pore N,P dual-doped C skeleton, which effectively addresses the volume expansion of MnS particles during charging/discharging and facilitates efficient transport of ions and electrons through an effective conductive network.",

        "abstract": "Transition‐metal selenides hold great promise as advanced anode candidates for fast‐charging sodium‐ion batteries. However, an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) caused by their enormous volume expansion and strong catalytic action results in the continuous degradation of their sodium‐storage performance with cycling. Herein, a novel structure with carbon nanotubes bridging the adjacent layers of Mxene is constructed for host material, which can enrich the transport paths of electrons and ions within the electrode triggering a two‐electron reaction during the electrolyte decomposition, thereby tailoring an ultrathin and robust SEI rich in Na2O inorganic component. Thus the prepared anode demonstrates the improved initial Coulombic efficiency (87%) and cycling lifespan (442.9 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 1470 cycles). Meanwhile, it delivers a high‐rate capacity of 394.3 mAh g−1 at up to 20 A g−1, and accomplishes capacity retention above 90% as the current density transitions from 10 to 20 A g−1. Even when the current density increases to 5 A g−1 for 1470 cycles, the capacity retention is still higher than 90%. This study illustrates the feasibility of tailoring SEI components through electrode structure engineering and opens a new avenue to the controllable modulation of electrode‐electrolyte interfacial chemistry.",

Based on the low strain volume and stable phase structure, herein, lithium titanate (LTO, Li4Ti5O12) was developed to store sodium ions between the working potential (∼0.8 V), which expands the lower plateau over than that of lithium ion storage (∼1.55 V) to obtain a high energy density of full batteries. The spinel lithium titanate shows negligible volume change and extremely stable structure under Na+-storage, which completely overcomes the shortage problems of the Na+-host. Additionally, by the detection of the transfer state of anions and cations in dual-ion batteries, the diffusion coefficient of the sodium ion in the LTO electrode is higher than that of the cathode, which shows that the transport process of sodium ions can meet the kinetic demands of full batteries. Such S-DIBs exhibit a large working voltage of 2.0–4.6 V and stable electrochemical performance over 1280 cycles, which is superior to conventional sodium-based systems, and further exhibit many advantages such as high energy density, environmental friendliness, and low cost.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) operating in aqueous electrolyte are an emerging technology that promises to be safer, cheaper, more sustainable and more efficient than their lithium-based counterparts. One of the great challenges associated with this technology is the development of advanced materials with high specific capacity to be used as electrodes. Herein, we describe an ingenious strategy to prepare unprecedented tri-component nanoarchitected thin films with superior performance when applied as anodes in aqueous SIBs. Taking advantage of the broadness and versatility of the liquid-liquid interfacial route, three transparent nanocomposite films comprising graphene, molybdenum sulphide and copper oxide nanoparticles have been prepared. The samples were characterized using several techniques, and the results demonstrated that depending on the specific experimental strategy, different nanoarchitectures are achieved, resulting in different and improved properties. An astonishing capacity of 1377 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a degree of recovery of 100% were observed for the film in which the interactions among the components were optimized. This is among the highest capacity values reported in the literature and demonstrates the potential of these tri-component materials to be used as anodes in aqueous sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Developing efficient anode materials with low electrode voltage, high specific capacity and superior rate capability is urgently required on the road to commercially viable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Aiming at finding a new SIB anode material, we investigate the electrochemical properties of NaxTiO2 compounds with unprecedented penta-oxygen-coordinated trigonal bipyramid (TB) structures by using first-principles calculations. Identifying the four different TB phases, we perform the optimization of their crystal structures and calculate their energetics such as sodium binding energy, formation energy, electrode potential and activation energy for Na ion migration. The computations reveal that the TB-I phase is the best choice among the four TB phases for a SIB anode material due to a relatively low volume change of under 4% upon Na insertion, low electrode voltage under 1.0 V with a possibility of realizing the highest specific capacity of ∼335 mA h g-1 from full sodiation at x = 1, and reasonably low activation barriers under 0.35 eV at the Na content from x = 0.125 to x = 0.5. Through the analysis of electronic density of states and charge density difference upon sodiation, we find that the NaxTiO2 compounds in TB phases change from electron insulating to electron conducting materials due to the electron transfer from Na atoms to Ti ions, offering the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple for SIB operation.",

To overcome these drawbacks, a facile strategy is developed to synergistically engineer the lattice defects (i.e., heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancy generation) and the fine microstructure (i.e., carbon hybridization and porous structure) of TiO2 -based anode, which efficiently enhances the sodium storage performance.

        "abstract": "Mesoporous carbon nanospheres (MCSs) are extensively employed in energy storage applications due to their ordered pore size, large specific surface area (SSA), and abundant active sites, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance for sodium storage. However, challenges persist in achieving precise structural control and stable synthesis reactions for these MCSs. Additionally, employing MCSs with a larger SSA in sodium storage applications can lead to increased side reactions and potential structural instability. To address these issues, we propose a solvent-induced self-assembly method for obtaining high nitrogen-containing multi-cavity MCSs with reduced SSA. The morphology and SSA of the nanospheres can be precisely adjusted by regulating the reaction time. Introducing an amine-phenol bridging structure into the polymer system significantly bolsters the structural and morphological stability of the mesoporous materials. The performance of these novel nanospheres in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is remarkable, exhibiting excellent sodium storage capability and exceptional ultra-long cycle stability. At a rate of 0.1 A g−1, the nanospheres achieved a high reversible capacity of 252 mAh g−1, and even after 20,000 cycles at 5 A g−1, a specific capacity of 136 mAh g−1 was retained.

However, the long-term cycling of V5S8 still suffers from volume expansion and low conductivity. Herein, a hollow nanotube V5S8@C (H-V5S8@C) with improved conductivity was synthesized by a solvothermal method to alleviate cracking caused by volume expansion. Benefiting from the large specific surface area of the hollow nanotube structure and uniform carbon coating, H-V5S8@C exhibits a more active site and enhanced conductivity. Meanwhile, the heterojunction formed by a few residual MoS2 and the outer layer of V5S8 stabilizes the structure and reduces the ion migration barrier with fast Na+ transport. Specifically, the H-V5S8@C anode provides an enhanced rate performance of 270.1 mAh g-1 at 15 A g-1 and high cycling stability of 291.7 mAh g-1 with a retention rate of 90.98% after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Because of the abundance and cost effectiveness of sodium, rechargeable sodium metal batteries have been widely studied to replace current lithium-ion batteries. However, there are some critical unresolved issues including the high reactivity of sodium, an unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), and sodium dendrite formation. While several studies have been conducted to understand sodium plating/stripping processes, only a very limited number of studies have been carried out under operando conditions. We have employed operando X-ray and optical imaging techniques to understand the mechanistic behavior of Na metal plating. The morphology of sodium metal plated on a copper electrode depends strongly on the salts and solvents used in the electrolyte. The addition of a fluorine-containing additive to a carbonate-based electrolyte, NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC):fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), results in uniform sodium plating processes and much more stable cycling performance, compared to NaClO4 in PC, because of the formation of a stable SEI containing NaF. A NaF layer, on top of the sodium metal, leads to a much more uniform deposition of sodium and greatly enhanced cyclability.",

        "abstract": "Ternary metal sulfides (TMSs), endowed with the synergistic effect of their respective binary counterparts, hold great promise as anode candidates for boosting sodium storage performance. Their fundamental sodium storage mechanisms associated with dynamic structural evolution and reaction kinetics, however, have not been fully comprehended. To enhance the electrochemical performance of TMS anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), it is of critical importance to gain a better mechanistic understanding of their dynamic electrochemical processes during live (de)sodiation cycling. Herein, taking BiSbS3 anode as a representative paradigm, its real-time sodium storage mechanisms down to the atomic scale during the (de)sodiation cycling are systematically elucidated through in situ transmission electron microscopy. Previously unexplored multiple phase transformations involving intercalation, two-step conversion, and two-step alloying reactions are explicitly revealed during sodiation, in which newly formed Na2BiSbS4 and Na2BiSb are respectively identified as intermediate phases of the conversion and alloying reactions. Impressively, the final sodiation products of Na6BiSb and Na2S can recover to the original BiSbS3 phase upon desodiation, and afterward, a reversible phase transformation can be established between BiSbS3 and Na6BiSb, where the BiSb as an individual phase (rather than respective Bi and Sb phases) participates in reactions. These findings are further verified by operando X-ray diffraction, density functional theory calculations, and electrochemical tests. Our work provides valuable insights into the mechanistic understanding of sodium storage mechanisms in TMS anodes and important implications for their performance optimization toward high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Developing high-rate and durable anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is still a challenge because of the larger ion radius of sodium compared with the lithium ion during charge-discharge processes. Herein, NiTe2 coupled with N-doped carbon (NiTe2/NC) hexagonal nanosheets has been fabricated through a solvothermal and subsequent carbonisation strategy. This unique hexagonal nanosheet structure offers abundant active sites and contact area to the electrolyte, which could shorten the Na+ diffusion path. The heterostructured N-doping carbon improves the electrochemical conductivity and accelerates the kinetics of Na+ transportation. Electrochemical analysis shows that the charge-discharge process is controlled by the pseudocapacitive behavior thus leading to high-rate capability and long lifespan in half batteries. As expected, high capacities of 311 mA h g-1 to 217 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 to 10 A g-1 are maintained after 800 and 1200 cycles, respectively. Furthermore, a full battery equipped with a Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode and a NiTe2/NC anode offers a maximum energy density of 104 W h kg-1 and a maximum power density of 9116 W kg-1.

The results indicate that the massive defects in the CoSeP@N-C sprout-like 3-D structure can offer high density of reaction sites and well accommodate the volume change during the sodiation/desodiation process, while rendering abundant channels for rapid transport of sodium ions, thereby synergistically making the CoSeP@N-C anode much more reversible for the sodium ion storage process and producing higher rate performance than those of CoP2 and CoSe2@N-C. The ex situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ Raman and ex situ TEM analyses further confirm the mechanism of sodium storage intercalation and transformation in CoSeP@N-C.

However, the exploration of this material still remains a great challenge to improve its cycling capacity. In this paper, nitrogen-doped conductive carbon/WS2 nanocomposites (WS2-NC) were fabricated based on the synthesis of the pure WS2 and conductive carbon/WS2 (WS2-C) nanocomposites. The reversible capacity of the as-prepared WS2-NC is stabilized at ∼360 mA h g(-1) at the density of 100 mA g(-1), even ∼200 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), presenting much better cycling performance than pure WS2 and conductive carbon/WS2 (WS2-C) samples. This excellent performance is further attributed to obviously promoted interfacial reaction in WS2 nanosheets at a low voltage platform (0.3-0.0 V), which is considered to closely relate to the incorporation of nitrogen-doped conductive carbon into WS2 nanosheets. Generally, this work presents an obviously enhanced Na storage performance by the incorporation of N-doped carbon into WS2 nanosheets to promote their interfacial reaction at low voltage platform.

In situ XRD demonstrates solid-solution reactions occurred during charge-discharge of NAVPF without two-phase reactions, indicating enhanced structural stability after F-doped.

Hard carbon (HC), which is low cost, exhibits a low redox potential, and a high capacity, is integral to achieve a practical large‐scale sodium‐ion battery. However, the energy density of the battery utilizing this anode material is hampered by its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, two strategies, namely i) additional pyrolysis and ii) presodiation by thermal decomposition of NaBH4, are explored to improve the ICE of pristine HC. Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations elucidate that the thermal treatment increases the Csp2 content in the HC structure, while the presodiation supplies the sodium to occupy the intrinsic irreversible sites. Consequently, presodiated HC exhibits an outstanding ICE (>99%) compared to the thermally treated (90%) or pristine HC (83%) in half‐cell configurations.

Coal char is an ultra-low cost hard carbon with promising application as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. During flash pyrolysis, char is heated at 1000 °C/s in a drop-tube furnace to create a highly-irregular structure. The larger d-spacing and smaller closed micropore diameter of flash-pyrolyzed char increases anode capacity compared to traditional slow-pyrolyzed char electrodes. The sodium-ion battery anode performance of flash-pyrolyzed char is further improved using an ether-based electrolyte in place of the traditional ester-based electrolyte. Performance improvements include greater initial Coulombic efficiency (58% in ester- vs. 64% in ether-based electrolyte) and improved specific capacity in an ether-based electrolyte. Overall, the combination of flash pyrolysis and ether-based electrolyte increases the sodium-ion battery discharge capacity of coal char by over 50%, from 72.5 mAh g−1 (slow-pyrolyzed char in ester-based electrolyte) to 109.4 mAh g−1 (flash-pyrolyzed char in ether-based electrolyte) (50 mA g−1 discharge rate).

Herein, we present an in-depth study to reveal the intrinsic reason for the pulverization of bismuth (Bi) materials upon (de)alloying and report a novel particle-in-bulk architecture with Bi nanospheres inlaid in the bulk carbon (BiNC) to achieve durable Na/K storage. We simulate the volume-expansion-resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a \"domino-like\" Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1 mAh cm-3 for SIBs, 848.1 mAh cm-3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3% for SIBs, 96.4% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000 cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state-of-the-art literature.

        "abstract": "The sodium storage mechanism of K-containing polyanion compounds is intricate and unclear. Here, the authors reveal that the residual K^+ pillars uphold K-containing polyanion structure upon sodium storage, enabling long-term cycling stability. K-containing polyanion compounds hold great potential as anodes for sodium-ion batteries considering their large ion transport channels and stable open frameworks; however, sodium storage behavior has rarely been studied, and the mechanism remains unclear. Here, using a noninterference KTiOPO_4 thin-film model, the Na^+ storage mechanism is comprehensively revealed by in situ/operando spectroscopy, aberration-corrected electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. We find that incomplete K^+/Na^+ ion exchange occurs and eventually 0.15 K^+ remains as a pillar to stabilize the tunnel structure. The pillar effect substantially maintains the volume change within 3.9%, much smaller than that of K^+(Na^+) insertion into KTiOPO_4(NaTiOPO_4) (9.5%; 5%), thus enabling 10,000 cycles. The powder electrode demonstrates comparable capacity and can work efficiently at commercial-level areal capacity of 2.47 mAh cm^−2. The quasi-solid-state pouch cell with high safety under extreme abuse also manifests long-term cycling stability. This pillar chemistry will inspire alkali metal ion storage in hosts containing heterogeneous cations.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfides with high theoretical capacity and low cost have attracted extensive attention as anode materials for sodium ion batteries. However, the inferior electrical conductivity and devastating volume change and interface instability have largely hindered their practical electrochemical properties. Here, ultrathin amorphous TiO2 layer is constructed on the surface of a metal-organic framework derived porous Fe7 S8 /C electrode via a facile atomic layer deposition strategy. By virtue of the porous structure and enhanced conductivity of the Fe7 S8 /C, the electroactive TiO2 layer is expected to effectively improve the electrode interface stability and structure integrity of the electrode. As a result, the TiO2 -modified Fe7 S8 /C anode exhibits significant performance improvement for sodium-ion batteries. The optimal TiO2 -modified Fe7 S8 /C electrode delivers reversible capacity of 423.3 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles with high capacity retention of 75.3% at 0.2 C. Meanwhile, the TiO2 coating is conducive to construct favorable solid electrolyte interphase, leading to much enhanced initial Coulombic efficiency from 66.9% to 72.3%. The remarkable improvement suggests that the interphase modification holds great promise for high-performance metal sulfide-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Heterostructure engineering and active component reconstruction are effective strategies for efficient and rapid charge storage in advanced sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, sandwich‐type CoSe2@MXene composites are used as a model to reconstruct new active Cu2Se@MXene heterostructures by in situ electrochemical driving. The MXene core provides interconnected pathways for electron and ion conduction, while also buffering volumetric expansion to stabilize the structure. This reconstructed Cu2Se@MXene heterointerface features abundant sodium storage active sites, enhanced Na+ adsorption, and diffusion kinetics, thus increasing sodium storage capacity. Moreover, the elevated Co valence state during the discharge process allows it to act as an electron reservoir to provide additional electron supply for Cu2Se conversion and accelerate the sodium storage kinetics. When employed as an anode in SIBs, the CoSe2@MXene electrode exhibits high capacity (694 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), excellent rate performance (425 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1), and exceptional durability (437 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g−1 with a 0.0014% capacity decay per cycle). The electrochemical reconstruction and sodium storage mechanism of Cu2Se@MXene anode is further revealed through ex situ characterization and theoretical calculations.

        "abstract": "For the performance optimization strategies of hard carbon, heteroatom doping is an effective way to enhance the intrinsic transfer properties of sodium ions and electrons for accelerating the reaction kinetics. However, the previous work focuses mainly on the intrinsic physicochemical property changes of the material, but little attention has been paid to the resulting interfacial regulation of the electrode surface, namely the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. In this work, element F, which has the highest electronegativity, was chosen as the doping source to, more effectively, tune the electronic structure of the hard carbon. The effect of F‐doping on the physicochemical properties of hard carbon was not only systematically analyzed but also investigated with spectroscopy, optics, and in situ characterization techniques to further verify that appropriate F‐doping plays a positive role in constructing a homogenous and inorganic‐rich SEI film. The experimentally demonstrated link between the electronic structure of the electrode and the SEI film properties can reframe the doping optimization strategy as well as provide a new idea for the design of electrode materials with low reduction kinetics to the electrolyte. As a result, the optimized sample with the appropriate F‐doping content exhibits the best electrochemical performance with high capacity (434.53 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1) and excellent rate capability (141 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their practical application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and interfacial instability of anode-active materials. Here, to circumvent these issues, we proposed the multiscale interface engineering of S-doped TiO2 electrodes with minor sulfur/carbon inlaying (S/C@sTiO2), where the electrode-electrolyte interface (SEI) and electrode-current collector interface (ECI) are tuned to improve the Na-storage performance. It is found that the S dopant greatly promotes the Na+ diffusion kinetics. Moreover, the ether electrolyte generates much less NaF in the cycled electrode, but relatively richer NaF in the SEI in comparison to fluoroethylene carbonate-contained ester electrolyte, leading to a thin (9 nm), stable, and kinetically favorable SEI film. More importantly, the minor sodium polysulfide intermediates chemically interact with the Cu current collector to form a Cu2S interface between the electrode and the Cu foil. The conductive tree root-like Cu2S ECI serves not only as active sites to boost the specific capacity but also as a 3D \"second current collector\" to reinforce the electrode and improve the Na+ reaction kinetics. The synergy of S-doping and optimized SEI and ECI realizes large specific capacity (464.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), ultrahigh rate capability (305.8 mAh g-1 at 50 A g-1), and ultrastable cycling performance (91.5% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5 A g-1). To the best of our knowledge, the overall SIB performances of S/C@sTiO2 are the best among all of the TiO2-based electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Tin sulfide (SnS) has emerged as a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity and large interlayer spacing. However, several challenges, such as severe insufficient electrochemical reactivity, rapid capacity degradation, and poor rate performance, still hinder its application in SIBs. In this study, in situ introduction of copper ions and a carbon conductive framework to form SnS nanocrystals embedded in a Cu2SnS3 lamellar structure heterojunction composite (SnS/Cu2SnS3/RGO) with graphene as the supporting material is proposed to achieve dual-driven sodium ion/electron migration during the continuous electrochemical process. The designed structure facilitates the preferential electrochemical reduction of copper ions into copper nanocrystals during the discharge process and functions as a catalytically active center to promote multivalence tin sodiation reaction. Furthermore, during the charging process, the presence of copper nanocrystals also facilitates efficient desodiation of NaxSn and further activates to form higher valence state sulfides. As a result, the SnS/Cu2SnS3/RGO composite demonstrates high cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of 395 mAh g-1 at 5A g-1 after 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85.6%. In addition, the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3∥SnS/Cu2SnS3/RGO sodium ion full cell achieves 93.7% capacity retention after 80 cycles at 0.5 A g-1.",

In this paper, new multicomponent metal compounds with heterointerface structure are firstly designed and suggested as anode for SIBs. The yolk-shell microsphere consisting of heterogeneous NiCo selenide@NiCo selenite core–shell nanospheres was prepared by spray pyrolysis and facile selenization and subsequently partial oxidation processes. NiCo selenide nanocrystals, which constitute the yolk-shell structure, are partially transformed into the NiCo selenide@NiCo selenite phase during the oxidation process. Notably, this process induces the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, leading to the transformation of the metal selenide nanocrystals into a hollow nanosphere morphology. As a result, the material adopts a hollow nanosphere structure with a NiCo selenide@NiCo selenite core–shell configuration. To the best of our knowledge, metal selenide@metal selenite core–shell configuration with hollow nanosphere is proposed for the first time.

For SIBs, antimony (Sb) shows potential as anode material but is impeded by the high volumetric variations. Here the challenges of Sb sodium storage by introducing the nanostructured Cu substrate for enhanced Sb adhesion and morphology optimization is addressed, which is realized by fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing of Cu substrate, subsequent high‐temperature sintering, and electrodeposition of Sb. In SIBs, the Sb deposited on three dimensional (3D) printed Cu substrate performs improved cycling stability compared with that of Sb@Cu with commercial Cu foil substrate, which can be attributed to the nanostructure of the 3D‐Cu substrate. Such architecture of 3D‐Cu induces the generation of pine‐leaf‐like Sb clusters to promote stability and kinetics, and it aids the adhesion between the Sb cluster and 3D‐Cu substrate for preventing the Sb detachment and restructuring the Sb cluster to the robust porous ligament‐channel Sb framework. The morphology evolution, (de)sodiation mechanism, and gas evolution are explored by ex situ scanning electron microscope, operando X‐ray diffraction, and operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry separately.

In this work, sodium-ion batteries using hard carbon microlattices produced by an inexpensive 3D printer are demonstrated. Controlled periodic carbon microlattices are created with enhanced ion transport through microchannels. Carbon microlattices with a beam width of 32.8 µm reach a record-high areal capacity of 21.3 mAh cm-2 at a loading of 98 mg cm-2 without degrading performance, which is much higher than the conventional monolithic electrodes (≈5.2 mAh cm-2 at 92 mg cm-2 ). Furthermore, binder-free, pure-carbon elements of microlattices enable the tracking of structural changes in hard carbon that support the hypothesized intercalation of ions at plateau regions by temporal ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements. These results will advance the development of high-performance and low-cost anodes for sodium-ion batteries as well as help with understanding the mechanisms of ion intercalations in hard carbon, expanding the utilities of 3D-printed carbon architectures in both applications and fundamental studies.",

The major drawbacks for the commercial application of SIBs lie in the slow kinetic processes and poor energy density of the devices. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS_2), a graphene-like material, is becoming a promising anode material for SIBs, because of its high theoretical capacity (670 mAh g^–1) and layered structure that suitable for Na^+ intercalation/extraction. However, the intrinsic properties of MoS_2, such as low conductivity, slow Na^+ diffusion kinetics and large volume change during charging/discharging, restrict its rate capability and cycle stability. Here, molybdenum disulfide and graphene oxide (3D MoS_2/GO) with excellent conductivity were fabricated through layer-by-layer method using amino-functionalized SiO_2 nanospheres as templates. The 3D MoS_2/GO composite demonstrates excellent cycling stability and capacity of 525 mA h g^–1 at 500 mA g^–1 after 100 cycles, which mainly due to the integrated MoS_2/GO components and unique 3D macroporous structure, facilitating the material conductivity and Na^+ diffusion rate, while tolerating the volume expansion of MoS_2 during the charge/discharge processes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal is a promising anode material for energy storage beyond lithium-ion batteries due to its abundance and low cost. However, the uncontrolled growth of dendrites and associated safety concerns have limited the practical application of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). By embedding nucleophilic tin seeds in a free-standing carbon film (FSF), here, an effective solution is developed to stabilize the sodium metal anode. The highly conductive and porous carbon matrix, intimately embedded with abundant Sn seeds (C@Sn), enables remarkably uniform sodium plating, and provides long-term stability for SMBs. Mechanistic studies confirm the formation of an Na─Sn alloy on interface which helps to lower the nucleation barrier for sodium plating. Hence, symmetric sodium cells equipped with C@Sn FSFs can sustain uninterrupted sodium plating and stripping for almost 2600 h at a high areal capacity of 4 mA h cm-2, achieving an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.88%. In addition, full cells prepared with commercial Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and C@Sn-FSFs anode deliver remarkable cycling (90 mA h g-1 beyond 1300 cycles at 1C) and excellent rate performance. This ingenious strategy of embedding Sn particles within a carbon matrix offers an overall compelling solution to enhance the longevity of sodium anodes.",

        "abstract": "Na2Ti3O7 has attracted attention as an alternative to hard carbon anode for Na-ion batteries due to suitable sodiation potential and, hence, no serious safety issues at high current densities. However, unfavorable electronic transport properties of Na2Ti3O7 need to be addressed to make it applicable for practice. Herein, a hydrothermal method was adopted to fabricate Na2Ti3O7 having a hierarchical micro/nano architecture and to dope it with copper through one stage. As compared to the non-doped Na2Ti3O7, the copper-containing product shows increased electronic conductivity (2.5 times higher) due to a smaller band gap (reduced by ∼1 eV). Because of Cu-doping, the Na2Ti3O7 crystal structure has evolved, and its unit cell volume has increased by about 9.5 %. Doping with Cu enhances the electrochemical performance of Na2Ti3O7 in Na-ion batteries, which demonstrates higher rate capability (2.0–2.5 times more capacity at high current densities) and remarkable cycleability (85 % capacity retention over 300 cycles at 2C). The calculations show that Cu-doped Na2Ti3O7 is characterized by improved Na+ ion diffusion and increased contribution of the pseudocapacitive current during the sodiation–desodiation process. The research discloses the aspects of copper-doping strategy that enable to unfold the capability of Na2Ti3O7 for energy storage applications.",

A porous organic polymer (POP) with a conjugated and hierarchical structure is designed and synthesized here. The unique molecule and structure endow the POP with electron delocalization, high ionic diffusivity, plentiful active sites, exceptional structure stability, and limited solubility in electrolytes. When evaluated as an anode for SIBs, the POP exhibits appealing electrochemical properties regarding reversible capacity, rate behaviors, and long‐duration life. Importantly, using judiciously combined experiments and theoretical computation, including in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ex situ spectroscopy, we reveal the Na‐storage mechanism and dynamic evolution processes of the POP, including 12‐electron reaction process with Na, low volume expansion (125–106% vs the initial 100%), and stable composition and structure evolution during repeating sodiation/de‐sodiation processes.

The designed FeS@NCG can provide a significant reversible capacity of 748.5 mAh g-1 at 0.3 A g-1 for 50 cycles and approximately 3.9-fold higher electrochemical performance than its oxide analog (Fe2O3@NCG, 192.7 mAh g-1 at 0.3 A g-1 for 50 cycles). The sulfur- and nitrogen-rich multilayer package structure facilitates efficient suppression of the porous FeS volume expansion during the sodiation process, enabling a long cycle life. The intimate contact between graphene and porous carbon-coated FeS nanofibers offers strong structural barriers associated with charge-transfer pathways during sodium insertion/extraction. It also reduces the dissolution of polysulfides, enabling efficient sodium storage with superior stable kinetics. Furthermore, outstanding capacity retention of 535 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 is achieved over 1010 cycles.

Although carbon materials are very attractive anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), they present several deficiencies when used in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The choice of an appropriate structural design and heteroatom doping are critical steps to improve the capacity and stability. Here, carbon-based nanofibers are produced by sulfur doping and via the introduction of ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles into the carbon fibers (CNF-S@TiO2 ). It is discovered that the introduction of TiO2 into carbon nanofibers can significantly improve the specific surface area and microporous volume for carbon materials. The TiO2 content is controlled to obtain CNF-S@TiO2 -5 to use as the anode material for SIBs/LIBs with enhanced electrochemical performance in Na+ /Li+ storage. During the charge/discharge process, the S-doping and the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into carbon fibers promote the insertion/extraction of the ions and enhance the capacity and cycle life. The capacity of CNF-S@TiO2 -5 can be maintained at ≈300 mAh g-1 over 600 cycles at 2 A g-1 in SIBs.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered an exemplary anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its lower voltage platform and higher layer spacing. However, the sodium storage performance of hard carbon is suboptimal, and its initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) is low, thus posing significant challenges to its practical application. Here, silicon-doped porous hard carbon is successfully synthesized as an anode material for SIBs through recycling low-cost Wuliangye distillers' grains as the precursor. The substitution of silicon atoms for carbon atoms in the carbon framework leads to an increased interlayer spacing, thereby enhancing the reversible specific capacity and ICE. Additionally, the linear control of the roasting temperature results in the production of hard carbon with a high specific surface area (525.23 m2 g-1). Concomitantly, the presence of micropores enhances the infiltration of the electrolyte and facilitates the transportation of sodium ions. As a result, the prepared silicon-doped hard carbon achieves a reversible specific capacity of 280.6 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, while maintaining a capacity retention of 102.6% after 100 cycles. Moreover, full sodium ion batteries are assembled to examine the application prospects using Mg-doped Na0.67MnO2 as the cathode and silicon-doped hard carbon as the anode, delivering a high reversible capacity of 281.5 mAh g-1 and a capacity retention rate of 91.9%.

The wasted grains derived from Chinese baijiu possess significant potential as biomass-based precursors for the production of hard carbon compounds.

Therefore, this research focuses on the use of discarded grains from baijiu as a raw material for the production of porous hard carbon materials, specifically for the anode of sodium-ion batteries. The proposed synthesis procedure involves the use of a ZnCl_2 chemical treatment to generate hard carbon materials that possess a porous structure and exhibit graphitic features. In comparison to the direct carbonization synthesis process, the use of ZnCl_2 treatment on porous hard carbon results in notable enhancements in electrochemical performance, including specific capacity and rate capability, while simultaneously preserving exceptional long-term cycle stability. Especially, the enhanced capacity mostly manifests in the low-voltage plateau region, and the high plateau capacity can maintained even at higher specific currents, which is suitable for high-rate application, exceeding the typical commercial hard carbon materials used in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have exhibited huge potential as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Most of them usually store sodium via an intercalation-conversion mechanism, but niobium sulfide (NbS2) may be an exception. Herein, through in situ transmission electron microscopy, we carefully investigated the insertion behaviors of Na ions in NbS2 and directly visualized anisotropic sodiation kinetics. Lattice-resolution imaging coupled with density functional theory calculations reveals the preferential diffusion of Na ions within layers of NbS2, accompanied by observable interlayer lattice expansion. Impressively, the Na-inserted layers can still withstand in situ mechanical testing. Further in situ observation vertical to the a/b plane of NbS2 tracked the illusive conversion reaction, which could result from interlayer gliding or wrinkling associated with stress accumulation. In situ electron diffraction measurements ruled out the possibility of such a conversion mechanism and identified a phase transition from pristine 3R-NbS2 to 2H-NaNbS2. Therefore, the NbS2 anode stores Na ions via only the intercalation mechanism, which conceptually differs from the well-known intercalation-conversion mechanism of typical TMDs. These findings not only decipher the whole sodiation process of the NbS2 anode but also provide valuable reference for unraveling the precise sodium storage mechanism in other TMDs.",

        "abstract": "As a promising energy-storage and conversion anode material for high-power sodium-ion batteries operated at room temperature, the practical application of layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is hindered by volumetric expansion during cycling. To address this issue, a rational design of MoS2 with enlarged lattice spacing aligned vertically on hierarchically porous Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with partially oxidized rutile and anatase dual-phased TiO2 (MoS2@MXene@D-TiO2) composites via one-step hydrothermal method without following anneal process is reported. This unique \"plane-to-surface\" structure accomplishes hindering MoS2 from aggregating and restacking, enabling sufficient electrode/electrolyte interaction simultaneously. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous structure among dual-phased TiO2, MoS2, and MXene could constitute a built-in electric field, promoting high Na+ transportation. As a result, the as-constructed 3D MoS2@MXene@D-TiO2 heterostructure delivers admirable high-rate reversible capacity (359.6 mAh g-1 up to 5 A g-1) at room temperature, excellent cycling stability (about 200 mAh g-1) at a low temperature of -30 °C, and superior electrochemical performance in Na+ full batteries by coupling with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode. This ingenious design is clean and facile to inspire the potential of advanced low-dimensional heterogeneous structure electrode materials in the application of high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "High gravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density energy storage devices are highly desirable due to the rapid development of electric vehicles, and portable and wearable electronic equipment. Electrospinning is a promising technology for preparing freestanding electrodes with high gravimetric and volumetric energy density. However, the energy density of the traditional electrospun electrodes is restricted by the low mass loading of active materials (e.g. 20%-30 wt%). Herein, a biomimetic strategy inspired by the phenomenon of the sticky spider web is demonstrated as a high performance anode, which simultaneously improves the gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Freestanding carbon nanofiber (CNF) membranes containing over 50 wt% of bismuth were prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. Membranes consisting of CNF network structures bonded tightly with active Bi cluster materials, resulting in excellent mechanical protection and a fast charge transport path, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. The composite membrane delivers high reversible capacity (483 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 200 cycles) and high rate performance (242 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1) as a lithium-ion battery anode. For use as a sodium ion battery, the composite membrane also shows a high reversible specific capacity of 346 mA h g-1 and outstanding cycling performance (186 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 after 100 cycles). This work offers a simple, low cost and eco-friendly method for fabricating free-standing and binder-free composite electrodes with high loading used in LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for their abundant resource availability, are emerging as a viable alternative to conventional batteries. Nevertheless, sluggish electrons/ions kinetics impedes further advancement in SIBs technology. Herein, a novel microcrystalline‐MoSe2/amorphous‐MoSexOy (C‐MoSe2/A‐MoSexOy) is developed through in situ low‐temperature oxidation of crystalline MoSe2. The microcrystalline MoSe2 acts as a robust framework, while the amorphous MoSexOy phase fills the interstitial spaces. This anode material is characterized by an optimized microcrystalline‐amorphous heterointerface. The resultant charge self‐regulation effect can be exploited to modulate active electron states, thereby ensuring high‐speed and stable sodium storage performance. The heterointerface demonstrates an ultrahigh specific capacity (641.0 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and maintains splendid rate performances up to 100 A g−1 (324.2 mAh g−1). Detailed theoretical and experimental researches indicate that the enhanced performance results from the production of active electronic states, which are initiated by the charge self‐regulation effect at the microcrystalline‐amorphous heterointerface in C‐MoSe2/A‐MoSexOy, featuring active Mo─Se bonds, which regulates the interfacial charge redistribution and facilitate electron transfer across the active interface between the microcrystalline and amorphous phases. The findings suggest that the charge self‐regulation effect, prompted by the heterointerface network, inherently accelerates electron/ion transport, offering a promising electrode design strategy for fast‐charging batteries.",

Here we report a high-capacity organic cathode, Na4 C6 O6 , that is chemically and electrochemically compatible with sulfide electrolytes. A bulk-type ASSSB shows high specific capacity (184 mAh g-1 ) and one of the highest specific energies (395 Wh kg-1 ) among intercalation compound-based ASSSBs. The capacity retentions of 76 % after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and 70 % after 400 cycles at 0.2 C represent the record stability for ASSSBs.

Herein, the robust 2D VS2/ Ti3C2Tx MXene nanostructures with the strong Ti─S covalent bond synthesized by a one‐pot self‐assembly approach are developed. The strong interfacial interaction renders the material of good structural durability and enhanced reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, the enlarged and few‐layered MXene nanosheets can be easily obtained according to this interaction, providing a conductive network for sufficient electrolyte penetration and rapid charge transfer. As predicted, the VS2/MXene nanostructures exhibit an extremely low sodium diffusion barrier confirmed by DFT calculations and small charge transfer impedance evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Therefore, the SIBs based on the VS2/MXene electrode present first‐class electrochemical performance with the ultrahigh average initial columbic efficiency of 95.08% and excellent sodium‐ion storage capacity of 424.6 mAh g−1 even at 10 A g−1. It also shows an outstanding sodium‐ion storage capacity of 514.2 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of nearly 100% within 500 times high‐rate cycling.

        "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) is a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its extremely high theoretical capacity. However, the large volume change and breaking of the layered structure result in rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, our in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study reveals the highly anisotropic Na diffusion and the formation of alternating layered and amorphous lamellas in BP nanosheets with small volume expansion induced by partial sodiation. Inspired by these results, we investigate systematically the cyclability of BP at controlled discharge capacities using half-cell SIBs, expecting to achieve good cyclability by sacrificing some of the capacity and preserving the layered structure of BP. Our results show that the cycling stability of BP is obviously improved by controlling the capacity appropriately. When the discharge capacity is limited at 400 mA h g-1, the half-cell can sustain more than 100 cycles with an active material mass loading of ∼2 mg cm-2, which is at least 4 times longer than when the capacity is limited at 600 mA h g-1 or above. The in situ TEM and electrochemical tests indicate that maintaining the layered structure by controlling the capacity is key to improve the cyclability of BP as an anode in SIBs.",

In-situ and ex-situ characterizations, along with theoretical simulations unlock that the in-situ formed Na-Bi alloy significantly accelerates sodium metal nucleation and sodium ion diffusion kinetics, enabling uniform sodium plating within the void spaces and a stable SEI outside the carbon fiber.

        "abstract": "Constructing unique and highly stable structures with plenty of electroactive sites in sodium storage materials is a key factor for achieving improved electrochemical properties through favorable sodium ion diffusion kinetics. An SnS_2@carbon hollow nanospheres (SnS_2@C) has been designed and fabricated via a facile solvothermal route, followed by an annealing treatment. The SnS_2@C hybrid possesses an ideal hollow structure, rich active sites, a large electrode/electrolyte interface, a shortened ion transport pathway, and, importantly, a buffer space for volume change, generated from the repeated insertion/extraction of sodium ions. These merits lead to the significant reinforcement of structural integrity during electrochemical reactions and the improvement in sodium storage properties, with a high specific reversible capacity of 626.8 mAh g^−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g^−1 and superior high-rate performance (304.4 mAh g^−1 at 5 A g^−1). Core–shell structured SnS_2@C hollow nanospheres were synthesized. The uniform carbon coating and hollow structure can alleviate the mechanical strain and therefore electrochemical performance.",

Here, a binder‐free electrode based on necklace‐like structures composed of Fe3N@C yolk–shell particles as an advanced anode for Na‐ion batteries is reported.

        "abstract": "Tin sulfide (Sn2 S3 ) has been recognized as a potential anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to its high theoretical capacities.

In this study, Sn2 S3 quantum dots (QDs) (≈1.6 nm) homogeneously embedded in an N, S co-doped carbon fiber network (Sn2 S3 -CFN) are successfully fabricated by sequential freeze-drying, carbonization, and sulfidation strategies. As anode materials, the Sn2 S3 -CFN delivers high reversible capacities and excellent rate capability (300.0 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 and 250.0 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1 for SIBs; 165.3 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 and 100.0 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 for PIBs) and superior long-life cycling capability (279.6 mAh g-1 after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g-1 for SIBs; 166.3 mAh g-1 after 5 000 cycles at 2 A g-1 for PIBs). According to experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, the exceptional performance of the Sn2 S3 -CFN composite can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the conductive carbon fiber network and the Sn2 S3 quantum dots, which contribute to the structural stability, reversible electrochemical reactions, and superior electron transportation and ions diffusion.",

        "abstract": "Co‐intercalation using ether‐based electrolytes renders graphite as a promising anode material in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). While most research on electrochemical solvent co‐intercalation in graphite has focused on linear ethers such as mono‐, di‐, tri‐, tetra‐, and penta‐glyme, we herein investigate the possibility of reversible electrochemical co‐intercalation with alternative solvents, especially cyclic ethers tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1,3‐dioxolane (DOL), which show no signs of co‐intercalation on their own. We demonstrate, however, that this reaction becomes feasible when incorporating diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (2G, diglyme) as an additive. Operando X‐ray diffraction and ex‐situ ss‐NMR techniques are employed comprehensively to understand the co‐intercalation reaction of these cyclic ethers, along with Na+‐glymes, into graphite during cycling. When using these mixed electrolytes i.e., THF/2G and DOL/2G, the voltage profiles changes compared to the pure glyme‐based electrolyte, while showing comparable specific capacities and good long‐term durability. Overall, we propose that even trace amounts of diglyme prompt the co‐intercalation of THF and DOL into graphite layers. This leads to the formation of quaternary graphite intercalation compounds (q‐GICs), expanding beyond the realm of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t‐GICs).",

        "abstract": "Nano-dispersed SnS_2 and CoS_2 phases endow CSC anode with electrolyte/structure-dependent cocktail mediation effect, showing superior rate capability and evidently lowered charge plateau compared with CoS_2 and SnS_2/CoS_2 mixture. Alternative electrochemical processes between nano-dispersed different metal sulfides and Na^+ carriers effectively overcome intrinsic flaws of monometallic sulfide, responsible for the lowered charge plateau of CSC. As-assembled CSC//Na_1.5VPO_4.8F_0.7 full-cell shows high-rate capability, and high discharge plateau up to 2.57 V, which is comparable to that with alloy-type anodes. As promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries, metal sulfides ubiquitously suffer from low-rate and high-plateau issues, greatly hindering their application in full-cells. Herein, exemplifying carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-stringed metal sulfides superstructure (CSC) assembled by nano-dispersed SnS_2 and CoS_2 phases, cocktail mediation effect similar to that of high-entropy materials is initially studied in ether-based electrolyte to solve the challenges. The high nano-dispersity of metal sulfides in CSC anode underlies the cocktail-like mediation effect, enabling the circumvention of intrinsic drawbacks of different metal sulfides. By utilizing ether-based electrolyte, the reversibility of metal sulfides is greatly improved, sustaining a long-life effectivity of cocktail-like mediation. As such, CSC effectively overcomes low-rate flaw of SnS_2 and high-plateau demerit of CoS_2, simultaneously realizes a high rate and a low plateau. In half-cells, CSC delivers an ultrahigh-rate capability of 327.6 mAh g^−1_anode at 20 A g^−1, far outperforming those of monometallic sulfides (SnS_2, CoS_2) and their mixtures. Compared with CoS_2 phase and SnS_2/CoS_2 mixture, CSC shows remarkably lowered average charge voltage up to ca. 0.62 V. As-assembled CSC//Na_1.5VPO_4.8F_0.7 full-cell shows a good rate capability (0.05 ~ 1.0 A g^−1, 120.3 mAh g^−1_electrode at 0.05 A g^−1) and a high average discharge voltage up to 2.57 V, comparable to full-cells with alloy-type anodes. Kinetics analysis verifies that the cocktail-like mediation effect largely boosts the charge transfer and ionic diffusion in CSC, compared with single phase and mixed phases. Further mechanism study reveals that alternative and complementary electrochemical processes between nano-dispersed SnS_2 and CoS_2 phases are responsible for the lowered charge voltage of CSC. This electrolyte/structure-dependent cocktail-like mediation effect effectively enhances the practicability of metal sulfide anodes, which will boost the development of high-rate/-voltage sodium-ion full batteries.",

        "abstract": "Nanostructured solid-state batteries (SSBs) are poised to meet the demands of next-generation energy storage technologies by realizing performance competitive to their liquid-based counterparts while simultaneously offering improved safety and expanded form factors. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is among the tools essential to fabricate nanostructured devices with challenging aspect ratios. Here, we report the fabrication and electrochemical testing of the first nanoscale sodium all-solid-state battery (SSB) using ALD to deposit both the V2O5 cathode and NaPON solid electrolyte followed by evaporation of a thin-film Na metal anode. NaPON exhibits remarkable stability against evaporated Na metal, showing no electrolyte breakdown or significant interphase formation in the voltage range of 0.05-6.0 V vs Na/Na+. Electrochemical analysis of the SSB suggests intermixing of the NaPON/V2O5 layers during fabrication, which we investigate in three ways: in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling, and cross-sectional cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We characterize the interfacial reaction during the ALD NaPON deposition on V2O5 to be twofold: (1) reduction of V2O5 to VO2 and (2) Na+ insertion into VO2 to form NaxVO2. Despite the intermixing of NaPON-V2O5, we demonstrate that NaPON-coated V2O5 electrodes display enhanced electrochemical cycling stability in liquid-electrolyte coin cells through the formation of a stable electrolyte interphase. In all-SSBs, the Na metal evaporation process is found to intensify the intermixing reaction, resulting in the irreversible formation of mixed interphases between discrete battery layers. Despite this graded composition, the SSB can operate for over 100 charge-discharge cycles at room temperature and represents the first demonstration of a functional thin-film solid-state sodium-ion battery.",

Scanning electron microscope images how irregular shape and agglomerated ZnO-NPs. The average particle sizes of ZnO-NPs range from 38 to 65 nm obtained from high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Nitrogen gas adsorption analysis revealed the pore size and pore volume decreased with the increasing calcination temperatures. The ZnO-NPs calcined at 700 °C exhibits the highest initial discharge capacity of 591 mAh g^−1 at 0.1 C up to 100 cycles and better rate capability and could be further exploited as anode materials in SIBs.",

By modifying the carbon coating layer, the migration of Ni/Co/P atoms is inhibited, thus the improvement of ICE and cycle stability is realized.

        "abstract": "Owing to the high theoretical sodiation capacities, intermetallic alloy anodes have attracted considerable interest as electrodes for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of intermetallic Fe-Sb alloy anode for SIBs via a high-throughput and industrially viable melt-spinning process. The earth-abundant and low-cost Fe-Sb-based alloy anode exhibits excellent cycling stability with nearly 466 mAh g-1 sodiation capacity at a specific current of 50 mA g-1 with 95% capacity retention after 80 cycles. Moreover, the alloy anode displayed outstanding rate performance with ∼300 mAh g-1 sodiation capacity at 1 A g-1. The crystalline features of the melt-spun fibers aid in the exceptional electrochemical performance of the alloy anode. Further, the feasibility of the alloy anode for real-life applications was demonstrated in a sodium-ion full-cell configuration which could deliver a sodiation capacity of over 300 mAh g-1 (based on anode) at 50 mA g-1 with more than 99% Coulombic efficiency. The results further exhort the prospects of melt-spun alloy anodes to realize fully functional sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP-HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (~7.4 nm) SEI was constructed on the DP-HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8%), the as-designed DP-HC exhibited a high ICE of >96.3% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for >1600 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP-HC full-cell with a 98.7% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP-HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.",

Although solvent co-intercalation is recognized as a simple and effective strategy, the challenge lies in the lack of durable electrolytes. Herein, we successfully apply low-concentration imidazole-based electrolytes to graphite anodes for sodium-ion batteries. Specifically, low concentrations ensure high ionic conductivity while saving on costs. Methylimidazole molecules can be co-intercalated with Na+, and a small amount of unreleased solvated Na+ serves the dual purpose of providing support to the graphite layer and preventing peeling off. The interphase formed in imidazole is more uniform and dense compared with that in ether electrolytes, which reduces side reactions and the risk of internal short circuits. The obtained battery demonstrates a long cycle life of 1800 cycles with a capacity retention of 84.6%. This success extends to other imidazole-based solvents such as 1-propylimidazole and 1-butylimidazole.",

        "abstract": "Na‐metal batteries are considered as the promising alternative candidate for Li‐ion battery beneficial from the wide availability and low cost of sodium, high theoretical specific capacity, and high energy density based on the plating/stripping processes and lowest electrochemical potential. For Na‐metal batteries, the crucial problem on metallic Na is one of the biggest challenges. Mossy or dendritic growth of Na occurs in the repetitive Na stripping/plating process with an unstable solid electrolyte interphase layer of nonuniform ionic flux, which can not only lead to the low Coulombic efficiency, but also can create short circuit risks, resulting in possible burning or explosion. In this communication, the atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 coating is first demonstrated for the protection of metallic Na anode for Na‐metal batteries. By protecting Na foil with ultrathin Al2O3 layer, the dendrites and mossy Na formation have been effectively suppressed and lifetime has been significantly improved. Furthermore, the thickness of protective layer has been further optimized with 25 cycles of Al2O3 layer presenting the best performance over 500 cycles. The novel design of atomic layer deposition protected metal Na anode may bring in new opportunities to the realization of the next‐generation high energy‐density Na metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Take advantage of its superior theoretical specific capacity, Fe2O3 based nanocomposites are promising candidates for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the complicate synthetic procedure hinders their further application. Herein, a facile ethanol diffusion flame synthesis approach is developed to prepare S-doped Fe2O3 composite on carbon cloth. The morphology of the Fe2O3 can be easily controlled by tuning the composition of the fuel and duration time of the flame treatment. Optimized composite with flake-like structure and heteroatom S-doped Fe2O3 (S/Fe2O3@CC-2) displayed enhanced electrochemical sodium storage performances. Specifically, sample S/Fe2O3@CC-2 maintained a reversible discharge capacity of 464.3 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. Besides, at current densities of 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 A g−1, capacities of 393.8, 311.2, 277.5 and 218.9 mAh g−1 could be maintained, respectively. Kinetic analysis implies that S/Fe2O3@CC-2 manifested an improved capacitive-controlled sodium storage process.

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials are competitive anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their advantages, such as low cost, abundant active sites, and porosity. However, this type of material still suffers from slow rate capability and low capacity, which greatly hinders its application. In this work, the biomass-derived carbon is optimized based on a layered montmorillonite (Mt) skeleton and the cobalt quantum dots (Co QDs). A three-dimensional (3D) combination, specifically a 3D flower-like structure, of 0D material (Co QDs) and a two-dimensional (2D) material (Mt) has been achieved. The optimization and local limited effects of the Co QDs on the electronic properties have been demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT). The metallic Co QDs and carbon could form a Mott-Schottky junction, enhancing the conductivity and Na+ adsorption. Due to the synergetic improvement of structure and conductivity, the stripped Mt embedded with Co QDs loaded with nitrogen doped carbon (FMt@Co-NC) shows ultra-stable cycle stability (99.12% retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 A/g). This is the first time that Mt has been employed in high performance SIBs, which incubates a grand blueprint for effectively utilizing similar inactive energy-storage materials, through a simple and reliable approach.",

        "abstract": "The transition metal oxides (TMOs) with high volumetric capacities are promising anodes for the future electronics, however, they usually suffer from severe capacity decay and poor rate capability. Carbon hybridization and nanosizing can resolve these challenges, yet these significantly compromise the volumetric capacity. Herein, both high capacity and long cycling stability are simultaneously achieved in the micrometer‐sized Mo‐based oxide particles by designing the dual conductive MoO2/β‐MoO3‐x mosaics. The rational combination of the highly electronically conductive MoO2 with the highly ionically conductive and open‐structured β‐MoO3 achieves a promising volumetric capacity of 1742 mAh cm−3, which is four times higher than the commercial graphite. Simultaneously, both stable cycling performance (87% retention after 500 cycles) and excellent rate capability (outperformed a majority of the MoO2‐based anodes reported in literature) are obtained in the lithium‐ion batteries. For the sodium‐ion batteries, the composite exhibits three times higher Na+ storage than pure MoO2. Moreover, the decisive role of the bond energy on the electrochemical performance of TMOs is also identified. This study may open up new perspectives for choosing and designing the TMO anodes with a high volumetric capacity for the practical applications.",

However, the Na-K alloy exhibits a very high surface tension preventing it from wetting the current collector surface. Herein, a novel homogeneous dual solid-liquid composite, in which the liquid alloy is fixed by the solid Na15Sn4 phase and perfectly stuffed into the grid of the mesh, has been designed and fabricated. Based on the liquid range of the Na-K alloy, the Na-K-Sn mixture possesses a theoretical specific capacity of 768 mAh g-1. The symmetric cells of the Na-K-Sn@mesh electrodes cycled at 2.0 mA cm-2 with 1.0 mAh cm-2 showed little fluctuations with the stable overpotential of ~200 mV for 550 h and the full cell coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 showed an initial discharge capacity of 103 mAh g-1 at 2 C with retention of 90% after 800 cycles.

However, it is ambiguous how the introduction of oxygen affects the changes in the molecular structure of cellulose as well as the micro-structure of hard carbon. We herein systematically investigate the effect of air pre-oxidation on the crystallinity and cross-linking structure of cellulose macro-molecules by controlling the degree of oxidation. The findings indicate that the introduction of air can break the hydrogen bonding network of cellulose in advance and release a large number of reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface to be oxidized to form ether and ester cross-linking bonds. Ether bonds can transversely cross-link and extend the carbon layer and the bent carbon layers enclose a well-developed connective pore structure. Additionally, the breakage of oxygen-containing functional groups leads to the escape of large amounts of oxygen-containing gases to etch out more open pore structures with large pore sizes. Benefiting from these advantages, the prepared hard carbon possesses a specific capacity of 335 mAh g−1 and 89 % of initial coulombic efficiency at 30 mA g−1 by pre-oxidating at 300 °C for 12 h.",

The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the hollow structure and the N, S co-doped carbon coating structure, which can reduce the diffusion distance for sodium ions and electrons, alleviate volume expansion during sodium ion insertion/extraction and retain structural integrity effectively. Furthermore, a two-step sodiation processes with FeS2 prior to the MnS was demonstrated by XRD, and the EIS profiles also confirmed that the pre-sodiation FeS2 can accelerate the ion and electron transfer, which contributed to the conversion reaction of the MnS.",

Here, a strategy to grow FeS2 on turbostratic carbon (t-carbon) assisted by chemical interactions between Fe and C electrons was realized via a simple and scalable mechanical alloying (MA) approach with a trace amount of CNTs. The structural change in CNTs synchronized with the in situ growth of FeS2 on the transformed t-carbon during the MA process, forming localised FeS2 nanocrystals wrapped in the frameworks of t-carbon. This intertwined structure within a grain consisted of chemical bonding by electronic hybridization between FeS2 and its adjacent carbon layer, resulting in enhanced structural stability upon cycling. Moreover, the localised FeS2 nanocrystals with an ultrasmall diameter of 10 nm encapsulated in the nanoframeworks of t-carbon could effectively shorten the diffusion paths of electrons/ions and withstand the volume expansion. The as-synthesized FeS2-C hybrid composite electrode exhibited a pseudocapacitive diffusion behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and remarkable rate capability.

        "abstract": "Transition-metal selenides have been considered as one of the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent rate performance. However, rapid capacity decay and poor cycling stability limit their practical application as the anode for SIBs. Carbon coating is one of the most effective ways to solve the above problems, but the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer are difficult to control. Herein, we successfully synthesize metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived porous N-doped carbon nanocubes homogeneously filled with ZnSe and Co0.85Se and interconnected by reduced graphene oxide (ZCS@NC@rGO). ZCS@NC@rGO with more active sites and the synergistic effect of the ZnSe and Co0.85Se heterojunction can enhance the sodium storage performance. The porous carbon nanocubes effectively prevent the agglomeration of active particles, and the rGO acting as a carbon network can significantly buffer the inevitable volume changes. At the same time, carbon nanocubes and the rGO are interconnecting to form a conductive network to accelerate electron transfer. Based on the aforementioned advantages, the ZCS@NC@rGO electrode shows an excellent sodium storage performance. Our investigation opens up a new horizon for the rational design of transition-metal selenide anodes for SIBs with a unique structure.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is the most promising anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The main obstacle to HC's application is its incompatibility with the phosphate flame‐retardant additive, a common SIB additive. This incompatibility arises from the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) caused by phosphate molecule decomposition. For the first time, in this work, a new type of highly adaptive flame‐retardant electrolyte is proposed. The electrolyte ensures the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface by the introduction of pioneering long‐chain nitrile as the SEI‐forming additive and solvated structural regulator. Long‐chain nitriles decompose before phosphate and form a stable SEI containing N element, which prevents the phosphate from inserting into the HC's layers and reduces its sodium‐storage capacity. As a proof of concept, the HC anode demonstrates a higher initial Coulombic efficiency of 80.78% in the as‐designed highly adaptive flame‐retardant electrolyte, which is about 1.8 times than that before regulation. It can cycle stably for 1250 cycles at 3 C with a capacity retention of 60%. Moreover, the electrolyte has good flame retardancy and can extinguish naturally within 1 s. In this work, an innovative method is provided for developing high‐safety SIBs based on HC anodes.",

All these electrochemical data are better than the undoped carbon cloth control, demonstrating the significance of P-doping to enhance the Na-storage properties of cotton-derived carbon anode. Furthermore, the technologies of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique are implemented to disclose the decrease of charge transfer resistance and improvement of Na-migration kinetics, respectively.",

High-performance anode materials for SIBs should possess intrinsically metallic characteristic and be composed of non-toxic, earth abundant, and lightweight elements. We predict a two-dimensional Mg material (named magnesene) to be an excellent anode material, which can meet these design requirements. It is demonstrated to be stable in terms of the cohesive energy, phonon spectrum, ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, and elastic constants. The magnesene monolayer exhibits good SIB performances, including a high storage capacity of 551.3 mA h g-1, low diffusion energy barrier (0.16-0.19 eV), low open-circuit voltage (0.71-0.82 V), and small volume change (4.7%). Moreover, graphene or h-BN on top of magnesene could serve as a protective cover to preserve the performances of pristine magnesene, such as metallicity, strong Na adsorption capability, and fast ionic mobility. These intriguing theoretical findings make magnesene a promising anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide has been considered as an ideal candidate anode material for alkali-ion batteries because of its unique layered structure as well as considerable theoretical capacity. However, poor electronic conductivity and large volume expansion in the repeatedly charging/discharging process impede its practical application. In this work, we fabricate a cobalt sulfide/molybdenum disulfide-based anode material with a heterostructure for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which can be constructed by combining a one-pot hydrothermal route with a solid-state sulfidation step. Compared with the anodes based on pure cobalt sulfide and pure molybdenum disulfide materials, the cobalt sulfide/molybdenum disulfide-based one displays superior cycling stability (e.g., 510.9 mAh g^−1 @1 A g^−1 at the 1000th cycle), and an extraordinary rate performance (341 mAh g^−1 @10 A g^−1). The material characterizations show that the obtained cobalt sulfide/molybdenum disulfide material has abundance mesopores. The kinetics analysis further confirms the decreasing of charge transfer resistance and the increasing of sodium ions diffusion coefficient with the cycling for this material. As a result, the reasonable design of the cobalt sulfide/molybdenum disulfide heterostructure can provide abundant active sites for the storage of sodium ions and facilitate surface capacity-controlling behavior. This work offers useful insights into the utilization of those heterostructured materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "A distinguishing feature of MAX phases and their MXene derivatives is their remarkable chemical diversity. This diversity, coupled with the 2D nature of MXenes, positions them as outstanding candidates for a wide range of electrochemical applications. Chemical disorder introduced by a solid solution can improve electrochemical behavior. Up to now, adding considerable amount of tungsten (W) in MAX phase and MXenes solid solutions, which can enhance electrochemical performance, proved challenging. In this study, the synthesis of M site Ti1‐xWx solid solution MAX phases are reported. The 211‐type (Ti1‐xWx)2AlC exhibits a disordered solid solution, whereas the 312‐type (Ti1‐xWx)3AlC2 displays a near‐ordered structure, resembling o‐MAX, with W atoms preferentially occupying the outer planes. Solid‐solution MXenes, Ti2.4W0.6C2Tz, and Ti1.6W0.4CTz, are synthesized via selective etching of high‐purity MAX powder precursors containing 20% W. These MXenes are evaluated as sodium‐ion battery anodes, with Ti1.6W0.4CTz showing exceptional capacity, outperforming existing multilayer MXene chemistries. This work not only demonstrates the successful integration of W in meaningful quantities into a double transition metal solid solution MAX phase, but also paves the way for the development of cost‐effective MXenes containing W. Such advancements significantly widen their application spectrum by fine‐tuning their physical, electronic, mechanical, electrochemical, and catalytic properties.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides, such as iron phosphide (FeP), have been considered as promising anode candidates for high-performance sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacity. However, the development of FeP is limited by large volume change, low electrical conductivity and sluggish kinetics with sodium ions. Moreover, the sodium storage kinetics and dynamics behavior in FeP are still unclear. Herein, improved sodium storage ability of FeP is achieved by volume regulation and surface engineering via a rationally designed hierarchical porous FeP@C/rGO nanocomposite. This FeP@C/rGO nanocomposite exhibits excellent rate capability and long cycle life as the anode of SIBs. Specifically, the FeP@C/rGO nanocomposite delivers high specific capacities of 635.7 and 343.1 mA h g-1 at 20 and 2000 mA g-1, respectively, and stable cycling with 88.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. The kinetics and dynamics studies demonstrate that the superior performance is attributed to the rationally designed hierarchical porous FeP@C/rGO with a high capacitive contribution of 93.9% (at 2 mV s-1) and a small volume expansion of only 54.9% by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results indicated that the significantly improved sodium storage ability of the Fe-doped sample should be mainly due to the increased oxygen vacancies, narrowed band gap, and lowered sodiation energy barrier, which enabled much higher electronic/ionic conductivities and more favorable sodium ion intercalation into rutile TiO2.",

        "abstract": "As a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting enormous attention due to the abundance of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance sodium anode materials limits the commercialization of SIBs. In this work, the dual enhancement of SnS2/graphene anodes in sodium storage is achieved through S-compositing and Co doping via an innovative one-step hydrothermal reaction at a relatively low temperature of 120 °C. The as-prepared 7% Co-SnS2/S@r-G composite consisting of 15.4 wt % S and 1.49 atom % Co shows both superior cycling stability (over 1000 cycles) and rate capability, giving high reversible specific capacities of 878, 608, and 470 mAh g-1 at 0.2, 5, and 10 A g-1, respectively. More encouragingly, the full-cell also exhibits an outstanding long-term cycling performance under 0.5 A g-1, which delivers a reversible capacity of 500 mAh g-1 over 200 cycles and still retains a high reversible capacity of 432 mAh g-1 over 400 cycles. The enhancement mechanism is attributed to the favorable three-dimensional structure of the composite, Co doping, and S-composition, which can induce a synergistic effect.",

        "abstract": "A free-standing flexible anode material for sodium storage with sandwich-structured characteristics was fabricated by modified vacuum filtration, consisting of stacked layers of Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@carbon nanotubes (NTO NW@CNT) and graphene oxide. The NTO NWs have a larger specific surface area for Na+ insertion/extraction with shortened ion diffusion pathways, accelerating the charge transfer/collection kinetics. The added CNTs both facilitate the uniform dispersion of the nanowires and nanotubes and also contribute to the connectivity of the nanowires, improving their conductivity. More importantly, the unique sandwichlike layered-structured film not only provides large numbers of electron-transfer channels and promotes the reaction kinetics during the charging and discharging process but also ensures the structural stability of the NTO NWs and the electrode. Electrochemical measurements suggest that this rationally designed structure endows the electrode with a high specific capacity and excellent cycling performance. A satisfactory reversible capacity as high as 92.5 mA h g–1 was achieved after 100 cycles at 2C; subsequently, the electrode also delivered 59.9 mA h g–1 after a further 100 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, after the rate performance test, the electrode could be continuously cycled for 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2C, which demonstrated that durable cyclic capacity with a high reversible capacity of 114.1 mA h g–1 was retained. This novel and low-cost fabrication procedure is readily scalable and provides a promising avenue for potential industrial applications.",

In this study, we report on expanded graphite material employing MoSx conversion reaction pillars (EG-MoSx) inserted into the interlayers and assess them as potential anode candidates for Na-ion batteries. We succeed in a tailored control of the insertion characteristics between one-phase reaction and two-phase reaction by modifying the crystal structure of EG-MoSx under different thermal treatment conditions. EG-MoSx-900 anode with an enlarged interlayer of ∼5.38 Å delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 501 mAh g-1. We successfully solve the irreversible capacity issues of the expanded graphite materials by forming chemical preformation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the electrode surface, thereby significantly increasing coulombic efficiencies of thermally tuned EG-MoSx (52.20 → 97.25%). We elucidate the electrochemical mechanism and structural properties of the EG-MoSx anode materials by ex situ characterizations. Inserting active sulfide pillars enables us to overcome the performance limitations of existing Na-ion battery technologies, and we expect that this strategy will be applied to realize another family of alkali-ion batteries.",

        "title": "A multi-layered composite assembly of Bi nanospheres anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets for ultrastable sodium storage.",
        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) is a promising anode candidate for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) with a high volumetric capacity (3765 mA h cm-3) and moderate working potential but suffers from large volume change (ca. 250%) during the sodiation/desodiation process, resulting in pulverization of the electrode, electrical contact loss, excessive accumulation of solid electrolyte interfaces, etc., devastating the cycling stability of the electrode seriously. Addressing this issue significantly relies on rational micro- and nano-structuring. Herein, we prepared a 3D multi-layered composite assembly of Bi/carbon heterojunctions with 0D bismuth nanospheres distributed and anchored on 2D nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (NCSs), using a preorganization strategy by taking full advantage of the strong complexation ability of Bi3+. The multi-layered composite assembly is periodic and close-packed, with Bi nanospheres <25 nm, carbon nanosheets ∼30 nm, and an average interlayer space of ∼75 nm. Such a specific architecture provides abundant electrochemically active surfaces and ion migration channels as the Bi nanospheres are attached to the 2D nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets via a point-to-surface pattern. Moreover, the mono-layer Bi nanospheres oriented along the 2D-surface of NCSs are kinetically favorable for the recognition of Na+ by the active sites of Bi nanospheres as well as for avoiding the long distance migration of Na+ (external diffusion of Na+). Furthermore, thermodynamically, the small size and high surface energy of ultrasmall Bi nanospheres could contribute to high ion mobility (internal diffusion of Na+) and promote electrochemical reactions as well. The multi-layered composite assembly of Bi@NCSs (ML-Bi@NCSs) not only provides a robust 3D framework guaranteeing the whole structural stability but also ensures direct and full contact of each active nano-building block with electrolyte, thereby forming a high-throughput electron/ion transport system. When evaluated as the anode for SIBs, ML-Bi@NCSs deliver superior high-rate capability up to 30 A g-1 (specific capacity: 288 mA h g-1) and long-term cycling stability (capacity retention: 95.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1 and 90.6% after 10 000 cycles at 20 A g-1, respectively).",

Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a bipolar material with excellent characteristics as both a cathode and an anode material in SIBs. Designing symmetric cells with NVP results in a single voltage plateau with significant specific capacity which is ideal for a full cell. Here we demonstrate for the first time a tremendous improvement in the performance of NVP symmetric full cells by introducing an ether-based electrolyte which favors fast reaction kinetics. In a symmetric full cell configuration, 75.5% of the initial capacity was retained even after 4000 cycles at 2 A g−1, revealing ultra-long cyclability. Excellent rate performances were obtained at current densities as high as 1000C, based on the cathode mass, revealing ultrafast Na+ transfer.

The superior sodium storage performance of the P@N‐MPC is mainly attributed to the novel structure. The N‐doped porous carbon with sub‐1 nm micropore facilitates the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and improves the conductivity of the encapsulated red P.

Vanadium diselenide (VSe_2), a transition metal disulfide compound with large layer spacing, is very promising to be utilized in sodium-ion batteries. However, the material suffers from great volume changes and disordered stacking agglomeration during battery charging and discharging, which brings bad effects on its electrochemical performance. For this reason, the nitrogen-fluorine co-doped three-dimensional carbon framework embedded VSe_2 nanosheet (VSe_2@3D-CNF) material was prepared by high-energy ball milling method. The three-dimensional carbon framework structure can well alleviate the volume expansion caused by charging and discharging, while avoiding the problem of no stacking of VSe_2 during charging and discharging, which is beneficial to improve the stability of the electrode material, and the N and F double doping can increase the active sites and improve the electron transfer rate.

Moreover, full-battery can complete a charge/discharge cycle in 7 mins and maintain a specific capacity of 53 mA h g -1 (calculated based on the mass of cathode material) after 7000 cycles. All electrochemical test results showed that Bi/MXene anode is a potential anode material with fast charge/discharge capability for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nitrides with two‐dimensional layered structures and high theoretical capacities are attractive as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries while their low crystallinity and insufficient structural stability strongly restrict their practical applications. Coupling carbon nitrides with conductive carbon may relieve these issues. However, little is known about the influence of nitrogen (N) configurations on the interactions between carbon and C3N4, which is fundamentally critical for guiding the precise design of advanced C3N4‐related electrodes. Herein, highly crystalline C3N4 (poly (triazine imide), PTI) based all‐carbon composites were developed by molten salt strategy. More importantly, the vital role of pyrrolic‐N for enhancing charge transfer and boosting Na+ storage of C3N4‐based composites, which was confirmed by both theoretical and experimental evidence, was spot‐highlighted for the first time. By elaborately controlling the salt composition, the composite with high pyrrolic‐N and minimized graphitic‐N content was obtained. Profiting from the formation of highly crystalline PTI and electrochemically favorable pyrrolic‐N configurations, the composite delivered an unusual reverse growth and record‐level cycling stability even after 5000 cycles along with high reversible capacity and outstanding full‐cell capacity retention. This work broadens the energy storage applications of C3N4 and provides new prospects for the design of advanced all‐carbon electrodes.",

        "abstract": "An efficient interface and composition modification strategy is proposed to significantly increase the rate capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of SnO anodes via energy band structure modulation for Na-ion batteries (SIBs). The as-fabricated SnO@Bi@C material with Bi nanocrystals homogeneously dispersed on and around the SnO surface is prepared by an electrospinning method. The excellently dispersed Bi nanocrystals realize an effective interface contact with SnO and Na2O, which effectively lowers the electron conduction barriers and promotes sodium-ion release and transport upon the desodiation process, increasing the rate capacity and ICE of the SnO anode. The prepared SnO@Bi@C exhibits a much higher rate capacity up to 10 A g-1, except an improved ICE of 80.67%, compared to 57.38% of SnO@C. Importantly, the intercalation of Na+ between layer-structured Bi galleries provides a good basis for excellent cycle stability due to the highways constructed inside the prepared composites. This finding provides an effective tactic to establish ion transport high-speed channels, which essentially increase the rate performance and the ICE of the SnO-based anodes.",

        "abstract": "Exploring a potential anode material is critical for developing efficient and long-cycling sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), where hard carbon is deemed to be in the forefront in this regard. Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to achieve a high-performance hard carbon anode from cost‐effective carbon sources. Here, we report a bio-waste-derived hard carbon from pomegranate peels as inexpensive and sustainable alternative for SIB anode. The pomegranate peels are pyrolyzed at temperatures between 1100 and 1300 °C to obtain the optimized hard carbon. The electrochemical performance of the hard carbons as an anode material in SIBs were investigated and the optimized pomegranate peels carbon (PGPC) heat treated at 1200 °C exhibited the maximum reversible capacity of 253 mAh g^−1 at 0.05 C. The excellent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the microporous morphology of the structure facilitating the electrolyte penetration into the interior regions of the electrode and to the disordered crystal structure providing sites for additional Na-ion storage. This work emphasizes the use of bio-waste-derived carbons as an efficient and affordable anode for high-energy SIBs.",

CoSe nanocrystals with an ultrafine size of 10–20 nm are distributed around cubic pores, and even move to other internal locations of the carbon nanofibers, achieving intimately coupling. CoSe nanocrystal@honeycomb porous carbon nanofiber is used as anode of sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance. The average discharge capacity at 0.1 A g−1 reaches 433 mAh g−1. It can deliver discharge capacity of 319 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 550 cycles, 254 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 500 cycles, 192 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. The various kinetics analyses indicate the favorable Na+ diffusion (10−10.9 to 10−12.0 cm2 s−1), low internal resistance, fast interface reaction, and dominant capacitive effect in electrochemical reaction. The structure stability is demonstrated by ex-situ observation of the cycled electrodes.

Herein, through a facile hydrothermal method combined with calcination process, Sn-doped MoSe2  nanosheets grown on graphene substrate in the vertical direction are fabricated. Benefiting from the improved electronic conductivity contributed by the abundant defects and expanded interlamellar spacing of MoSe2  originated from Sn doping, combined with a smart strategy of raising discharge cut-off voltage to 0.2 V during the actual performance testing for SIBs, the as-fabricated anode material delivers superior Na-ions storage performance in terms of electrons/ions transfer, reversible sodium storage as well as cycle stability. An ultra-stable reversible specific capacity of 268.5 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 can be maintained after 1600 cycles. Moreover, the great sodium storage property in the SIB full-cell system of the as-obtained nanocomposite illustrates practical potential.

Herein, a bottom-up gas phase pyrolysis strategy is introduced to avoid the tedious and time-consuming loading process of active nanostructures. With ferrocene and selenium powders as the raw materials, a carbon coated Fe7Se8 nanosheet/carbon nanotube (Fe7Se8@C/CNT) hybrid is synthesized. The critical role of selenium in the mass growth of CNTs at low deposition temperature is demonstrated for the first time. Benefiting from the molecular-level synthesis process, the carbon coated Fe7Se8 nanosheets are uniformly anchored on CNTs, and a porous hybrid network architecture is constructed.

Moreover, the full cell that coupled with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode also retains an undiscounted long-term cycling ability and high rate performance, reflecting its great potential for practical SIBs.

        "abstract": "For sodium-ion batteries, solving the issue of short cycle life is key to their large-scale adoption in the industry, and the electrolyte plays an important role on this. Herein, this work aims to design a practical sodium ion battery electrolyte with industrial application value and introduces anhydride compounds as additives for the first time. Meanwhile, by adjusting the solvent composition and using a combination of ether and ester solvents, the optimal electrolyte formulation of 1 M NaPF6 (sodium hexafluorophosphate) + DME (glycol dimethyl ether)/VC (vinylidene carbonate) (1 : 1, v/v) + 2 wt% GA (glutaric anhydride) is designed. Na+-VC, which has the highest occupied molecular orbital in this electrolyte, is preferentially oxidized to form a cathode electrolyte interface on the cathode. And synchronously, Na+-GA with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is preferentially reduced to form a surface electrolyte interface on the anode. This electrolyte can achieve simultaneous film formation on both sides of the electrode, thus greatly increasing the cycle life of the sodium-ion battery. For example, the Na‖NVP (sodium vanadium phosphate) battery still maintains a specific capacity of 91.16 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention rate of 85.06% after 2500 cycles. And the NVP‖HC (hard carbon) full battery also maintains a capacity retention rate of 66.50% after 800 cycles.

Here, a facile method is reported for fabricating hierarchical tubular nanocomposites with intimately coupled MoSe 2 and NC nanosheets.

Experimental results show MXenes possess excellent cycling performance as anode materials, especially at large current densities. However, the reversible capacity is relatively low, which is a significant barrier to meeting the demands of industrial applications. This work synthesizes N‐doped graphene‐like carbon (NGC) intercalated Ti3C2T x (NGC‐Ti3C2T x ) van der Waals heterostructure by an in situ method. The as‐prepared NGC‐Ti3C2T x van der Waals heterostructure is employed as sodium‐ion and lithium‐ion battery electrodes. For sodium‐ion batteries, a reversible specific capacity of 305 mAh g−1 is achieved at a specific current of 20 mA g−1, 2.3 times higher than that of Ti3C2T x . For lithium‐ion batteries, a reversible capacity of 400 mAh g−1 at a specific current of 20 mA g−1 is 1.5 times higher than that of Ti3C2T x . Both sodium‐ion and lithium‐ion batteries made from NGC‐Ti3C2T x shows high cycling stability. The theoretical calculations also verify the remarkable improvement in battery capacity within the NGC‐Ti3C2O2 system, attributed to the additional adsorption of working ions at the edge states of NGC. This work offers an innovative way to synthesize a new van der Waals heterostructure and provides a new route to improve the electrochemical performance significantly.",

Herein, we synthesise Cu@MOF and Cu@NH2-MOF as the precursor to prepare Cu1.95Se embedded into porous carbon matrix (Cu1.95Se@PC) and porous-N-doped carbon matrix (Cu1.95Se@NPC) via pyrolysis process of Cu@MOF and Cu@NH2-MOF, respectively. Cu1.95Se@PC and Cu1.95Se@NPC electrodes for half-cell LIBs and SIBs exhibit a high reversible capacity of 313.1, 480.9 (for LIBs), 216.3 and 303.8 (for SIBs) mAhg−1after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1, respectively. We assess the electrochemical performance of the Cu1.95Se@PC and Cu1.95Se@NPC anodes by integrating them with commercially available LiFePO4 (LFP) into full-cell LIBs. The LFP//Cu1.95Se@PC and LFP//Cu1.95Se@NPC full-cells have discharge capacities of approximately 330 and 293 mAh g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 at the initial cycle. In order to explore the sodium storage mechanism of the Cu1.95Se composites, we conducted an in situ XRD test during the first charge/discharge cycle, considering their favourable cycling and rate performance. Our work provides a promising anode electrode material for both half-cell LIBs and SIBs with high volume utilization and superior electrochemical performances.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), as the promising commercial energy system, are restricted by their sluggish kinetics and low sodium-ion storage. Metal selenide possesses good conductivity and capacity but still suffers from the stacked problem and volume expansion. Significantly, CoSe2/C is successfully prepared with the assistance of citric acid as both a chelating agent and carbon precursor, displaying that cobblestone-like nanospheres with the radii (<25 nm) distribute uniformly in the carbon matrix. It is expected that the established Co-O-C bonds enhance the stability of the structure with faster ion shuttling. With the available electrolyte (NaCF3SO3/diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in a potential window range from 0.5 to 3.0 V, the as-obtained sample shows the ultralong lifespan at 4.5 A g-1, retaining a capacity of 345 mA h g-1 after 10 000 cycles. From the detailed kinetic analysis, it is clear that the surface-controlled electrochemical behavior mainly contributes to the excellent large-current cycling stability and Na storage capacity. The ex situ results support that the crystal and morphological structure remains stable. This work is anticipated to enhance the in-depth understanding of the CoSe2/C anode and supply a facile manner to obtain electrode materials for SIBs.",

However, high-performance electrode materials are required for their successful application. Herein, we report a monoclinic-type CoMoO4 material which is synthesized by a simple solution method. An optimized calcination temperature with a high crystallinity and a rodlike morphology of the material are selected after analyzing the as-synthesized powder by temperature-dependent time-resolved X-ray diffraction. The CoMoO4 rods exhibit initial discharge and charge capacities of 537 and 410 mA h g-1, respectively, when used as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. The sodium diffusion coefficient in the bimetallic CoMoO4 anode is measured using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and calculated in the range of 1.565 × 10-15 to 4.447 × 10-18 cm2 s-1 during the initial cycle. Further, the reaction mechanism is investigated using ex situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and the obtained results suggest an amorphous-like structure and reduction/oxidation of Co and Mo during the sodium insertion/extraction process. Ex situ transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy images of the CoMoO4 anode in fully discharged and recharged state reveal the rodlike morphology with homogenous element distribution.",

We study the structural properties of nanostructured Na2Ti9O19, synthesized by a hydrothermal technique, upon electrochemical cycling vs Na. Average and local structures of Na2Ti9O19 are elucidated from neutron Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function (PDF), respectively, to investigate the initial discharge and charge events. Rietveld refinement reveals electrochemical cycling of Na2Ti9O19 is driven by single-phase solid solution reaction during (de)sodiation without any major structural deterioration, keeping the average structure intact. Unit cell volume and lattice evolution on discharge process is inherently related to TiO6 distortion and Na ion perturbations, while the PDF reveals the deviation in the local structure after sodiation. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies further corroborate the average and local structural behavior derived from neutron diffraction measurements. Also, Na2Ti9O19 shows excellent Na-ion kinetics with a capacitve nature of 86% at 1.0 mV s-1, indicating that the material is a good anode candidate for a sodium-ion hybrid capacitor. A full cell hybrid Na-ion capacitor is fabricated by using Na2Ti9O19 as anode and activated porous carbon as cathode, which exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, with a maximum energy density of 54 Wh kg-1 and a maximum power density of 5 kW kg-1. Both structural insights and electrochemical investigation suggest that Na2Ti9O19 is a promising negative electrode for sodium-ion batteries and hybrid capacitors.",

Herein, an optimized Co9S8/MoS2 heterojunction with preferred crystal orientation is delicately designed and successfully fabricated. Distinguish from the conventional heterostructure with anisotropic distribution, the preferred crystal orientation with isotropic structure can provide a rapid Na+‐diffusion pathway and regulate Na+‐concentration to promote its uniform distribution. Furthermore, it simultaneously realizes the even dispersion of inner stress and acquire the structural stability during the discharge/charge processes. Additionally, the abundant heterointerfaces with one direction effectively improve the charge transfer and reduce the Na+‐diffusion distance, ensuring the boosted reaction kinetic. As expected, ascribing to the synergetic effect, the Co9S8/MoS2 presents excellent ultra‐high rate performance and long‐term cycling stability for sodium ion batteries. Specifically, a high capacity of 492.1 mAh g−1 is maintained over 2000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1, and an ultrahigh capacity of 504 mAh g−1 is achieved even at ultrahigh rate of 15.0 A g−1.

However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, a highly reversible encapsulation‐based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (ZnSA‐HCNT) is achieved. The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched ZnSA sites provide abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF‐8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na+ due to its pore‐rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@ZnSA‐HCNT anodes present steady long‐term performance in symmetrical battery (>900 h at 10 mA cm−2). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@ZnSA‐HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.",

        "abstract": "The closed-pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure-electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell-shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed-pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed-pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (∼2 nm) and ultra-thin (1-3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g-1 at 6 A g-1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell-shearing chemistry for closed-pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Among various cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, Na3V2(PO4)3 has attracted much attention due to its outstanding electrochemical performance. However, the toxicity and expensive price of vanadium limit its practical application. Therefore, the substitution of vanadium with nontoxic and inexpensive transition metal elements is significant. We select the earth-abundant iron element to partially replace the vanadium element, and successfully synthesize Na3.36FeV(PO4)3 with a Na superionic conductor structure. Furthermore, a Na3.36FeV(PO4)3 cathode with an optimal carbon content can deliver an initial capacity of 97.6 mA h g-1 at 0.5C with a high capacity retention of 96.4% after 200 cycles. In addition, it also delivers an initial capacity of 90.4 mA h g-1 at 10C, and a capacity retention of 80% can be obtained after 5000 cycles. We also found that the lack of sodium in the material can be compensated by an electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, the in situ X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the sodium storage process follows a pseudo-solid-solution reaction mechanism and the volume change ratio is less than 3% during charging/discharging. In order to study the practical application capability of Na3.36FeV(PO4)3, we assemble the pre-activated cathode and a hard carbon anode into a full cell, which exhibits high initial discharge capacities of 103 and 91.3 mA h g-1 at 0.5C and 10C, respectively.

Here, we demonstrate a surface phosphorylation strategy to mitigate the degradation of three-dimensional MoO3 array electrodes. Such a phosphorylation strategy allows MoO3 arrays to sustain a capacity of 265 mAh g-1, or ~90% of the initial value, at a rate of 2 A g-1 over 1500 cycles, outperforming most reported MoO3 electrodes. Moreover, kinetic analysis unveils a capacitance-dominated Na+ storage feature of MoO3 arrays, owing to the enhanced electron mobility imparted by oxygen vacancies that are simultaneously introduced by phosphorylation.

        "abstract": "As promising alternatives to lithium‐ion batteries, sodium‐ion batteries suffer from low coulombic efficiency, which stems from Na‐deficiency and unstable interfaces for both cathode and anode materials. Exhibiting a favorable solvation structure, Na‐naphthalene/tetrahydropyran (Na‐NP/THP) is screened and selected as a full‐cell presodiation solution for hard carbon (HC) anodes and a P‐2 type Na0.67Fe0.1Al0.1Mn0.8O2 (NFAM) cathode, which are both Na‐deficient. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is revealed that the proposed presodiation agent not only boosts the initial coulombic efficiency of both HC and NFAM electrodes effectively, but also facilitates robust solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) on both electrodes. Consequently, the long‐term cycling and rate performance are greatly improved thanks to the stabilized structures of electrode materials. Furthermore, a proof‐of‐concept NFAM||HC pouch cell based on this presodiation strategy is assembled, showing a high reversible capacity and superior cycling performance. By offering a remedy to a full cell system subjected to severe Na‐deficiency, this work conceptually demonstrates a feasible strategy to fully tap the potential of high‐energy‐density materials in sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Constructing active heterointerfaces is powerful to enhance the electrochemical performances of transition metal dichalcogenides, but the interface density regulation remains a huge challenge. Herein, MoO2 /MoS2 heterogeneous nanorods are encapsulated in nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon matrix (MoO2 /MoS2 @NSC) by controllable sulfidation. MoO2 and MoS2 are coupled intimately at atomic level, forming the MoO2 /MoS2 heterointerfaces with different distribution density. Strong electronic interactions are triggered at these MoO2 /MoS2 heterointerfaces for enhancing electron transfer. In alkaline media, the optimal material exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances that significantly surpass carbon-covered MoS2 nanorods counterpart (η10 : 156 mV vs 232 mV) and most of the MoS2 -based heterostructures reported recently. First-principles calculation deciphers that MoO2 /MoS2 heterointerfaces greatly promote water dissociation and hydrogen atom adsorption via the O-Mo-S electronic bridges during HER process. Moreover, benefited from the high pseudocapacitance contribution, abundant \"ion reservoir\"-like channels, and low Na+ diffusion barrier appended by high-density MoO2 /MoS2 heterointerfaces, the material delivers high specific capacity of 888 mAh g-1 , remarkable rate capability and cycling stability of 390 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 as the anode of sodium ion battery. This work will undoubtedly light the way of interface density engineering for high-performance electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems.",

        "title": "Exploring the Potentials of Ti3CiN2-iTx (i = 0, 1, 2)-MXene for Anode Materials of High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) MXenes, including carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides MXene, have been proved to be a possible candidate as anode materials of sodium-ion batteries. This paper focuses on the electronic properties and the electrochemical performance of nitrides MXene. First, density functional theory simulations were utilized to disclose the geometric structure and electronic properties, Na diffusion path, and storage behaviors of titanium carbonitrides Ti3CNTx, nitrides MXene Ti3N2Tx, and carbides MXene Ti3C2Tx with oxygen terminations, predicting the more excellent performance of Ti3N2O2 than Ti3C2O2. Also, then the structure characterization and electrochemical performance experiments of Ti3C2Tx and Ti3CNTx were conducted to verify the theoretical predictions and test the cycling performances. The superior performance of Ti3N2O2 originates from the stronger connection of O-Ti-N than that of O-Ti-C, resulting in the stackings of Ti3N2O2 being tighter and the interlayer spacings being larger than that of Ti3C2O2, which is advantageous to sodiation and desodiation. The capacity of Ti3CNTx increased again to 145 mAh/g after 35 cycles at a current density of 20 mA/g, which demonstrated a better rate performance than Ti3C2Tx corroborated by the diffusion barriers of the theoretical calculation results. Ti3CNTx exhibits a good cycling performance of 110 mAh/g (≈60% of the initial value) after 200 cycles, which is better than that of 87 mAh/g (≈51% of the initial value) of Ti3C2Tx. It is worth noting that all these performances ensure that nitride MXene is more suitable as the anode material of Na-ion batteries than carbide MXene. These findings are conducive to expanding the MXene family and promoting their application in energy storage applications.",

However, their deployment hinges on the development of new anode materials, since it has been shown that many important anode materials employed in lithium ion batteries, such as graphite and silicon, are inadequate for sodium-ion batteries. We have simply prepared novel SnS/C nanocomposites through a top-down approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Their electrochemical performance has been significantly improved when compared to bare SnS, especially in terms of cycling stability and rate capabilities. SnS/C nanocomposites exhibit excellent capacity retention, at various current rates, and deliver capacities as high as 400 mA h g−1 even at the high current density of 800 mA g−1 (2C).

        "title": "Tailoring a Phenolic Resin Precursor by Facile Pre-oxidation Tactics to Realize a High-Initial-Coulombic-Efficiency Hard Carbon Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "As the leading anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), hard carbon (HC) still faces the puzzle of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) in achieving commercialization. From the perspective of precursors, the low ICE has been attributed to the large specific surface area and porosity produced by the rapid decomposition of polymers during the carbonization. Therefore, increasing the cross-linking degree of precursors will be an effective shortcut to improve the ICE. Herein, a facile pre-oxidation tactic was successfully employed to tailor the cross-linking degree of phenolic resin precursors to precisely control the specific surface area of the obtained HC. As the pre-oxidation time is increased, the optimal HC with the lowest specific surface area shows an ICE elevated by 22.2% (from 62.5 to 84.7%) compared to the original pre-oxidation HC and delivers a high reversible capacity of 334.3 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1. Besides, the pre-oxidation also introduces abundant carbonyl groups, which increase the disorder degree of HC and supply abundant adsorption sites of Na+, thus enhancing the rate performance. When matched with a layered O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the full cell achieves an energy density of ca. 256.2 Wh kg-1 with superior rate performance. This work sheds light on the positive effect of pre-oxidation in elevating the ICE of HC and provides effective guidance to achieve a high ICE for other HC materials.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides have captured sustainable research attention in energy storage and conversion field as promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, for the majority of transition metal selenides, the potential windows have to compress to 0.5-3.0 V for the maintenance of cycling and rate capability, which largely sacrifices the capacity under low voltage and impair energy density for sodium full batteries. Herein, through introducing diverse metal ions, transition metal selenides consisted of different compositions doping (CoM-Se2@NC, M=Ni, Cu, Zn) are prepared with more stable structures and higher conductivity, which exhibit superior cycling and rate properties than those of CoSe2@NC even at a wider voltage range for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Particularly, Zn2+ doping demonstrates the most prominent sodium storage performance among series materials, delivering high capacity of 474 mAh g-1 after eighty cycles at 500 mA g-1 and rate capacities of 511.4, 382.7, 372.1, 339.2, 306.8 and 291.4 mAh g-1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.4, 1.8 and 2.0 A g-1, respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting increasing attention due to their low cost of raw materials and high potential as an alternative to lithium‐ion batteries in energy storage systems. Owing to its favorable reaction potential (0.6 V vs Na/Na+) and high reversible capacity (660 mAh g−1), antimony (Sb) has been extensively studied as an anode material for SIBs. However, the poor cyclability of a pure Sb anode, induced by the mechanical stress mechanism, hinders its application. Herein, carbon microspheres catalyzing the in‐situ polymerization and coating of Sb are developed through a “solvothermal‐induced” synthesis method. During the solvothermal process in the presence of carbon microspheres, SbCl3 can react with ethylene glycol to generate an organic‐inorganic hybrid precursor. This precursor can be further reduced into carbon‐coated Sb with controllable carbon content. Benefiting from an in‐situ coating process that buffers the volume change of Sb, the as‐prepared carbon‐coated Sb anode shows improved Na‐storage performance. It achieves a capacity of 330 mAh g−1 (based on the total mass of Sb and carbon) at 0.1 A g−1 and exhibits good cycling stability at 1 A g−1. This work contributes to a facile approach for preparing a carbon‐coated metallic anode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Conversion-type anode materials possess high theoretical capacity for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to multielectron transmission (2-6 electrons). Mo-based chalcogenides are a class of great promise high-capacity host materials, but their development still undergoes serious volume changes and low transport kinetics during cycling process. Here, MoO2 nanoparticles anchored on N-doped carbon nanorod bundles (N-CNRBs/MoO2) are synthesized by a facile self-polymerized route and a following annealing. After hydrothermal sulfuration, N-CNRBs/MoO2 composites are encapsulated by surface growth of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets, acquiring hierarchical N-CNRBs/MoO2@MoS2 composites. Served as SIB anode, N-CNRBs/MoO2@MoS2 electrode exhibits significantly improved sodium-ion storage properties. The reversible capacity is up to 554.4 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and maintains 249.3 mA h g-1 even at 10.0 A g-1. During 5000 cycles, no obvious capacity decay is observed and the reversible capacities remain 334.8 mAh g-1 at 3.0 A g-1 and 301.4 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1. These properties could be ascribed to the vertical encapsulation of MoS2 nanosheets on high-crystalline N-CNRBs/MoO2 substrates. The hierarchical architecture and unique heterostructure between MoO2 and MoS2 synergistically facilitate sodium-ion diffusion, relieve volume changes and boost pseudocapacitive charge storage of N-CNRBs/MoO2@MoS2 electrode. Therefore, the rational growth of nanosheets on complex substrates shows promising potential to construct anode materials for high-performance batteries.",

In this regard, sodium disulphide (NiS2) has been prepared as a composite with activated carbon (C) using a facile hydrothermal synthesis route in the past. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-prepared NiS2/C composite material shows well-defined diffraction peaks of NiS2. Most carbonaceous materials are amorphous, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) study shows that the surface area is close to 148 m2 g-1.

The NiS2/C composite electrode provides an exceptional rate capability by delivering a capacity of 270 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 2000 mA g-1, suggesting the suitability of the NiS2/C composite for SIBs. Ex situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses at the Ni K-edge have been used to examine the type of chemical bonding present in the anode and also how it changes during electrochemical redox cycling.

However, the proximity of the plateau capacity to the cut-off voltage of battery operation and the premature cut-off voltage response caused by polarization at high rates greatly limit the exploitation of plateau capacities, raising big concerns about inferior rate performance of high-plateau-capacity hard carbon. In this work, a facile pre-oxidation strategy is proposed for fabricating lignin-derived hard carbon. Both high-plateau capacity and sodiation kinetics are significantly enhanced due to the introduction of expanded pseudo-graphitic domains and high-speed closed pores. Impressively, the optimized hard carbon exhibits an increased reversible capacity from 252.1 to 302.0 mAh g-1, alongside superior rate performance (174.7 mAh g-1 at 5 C) and stable cyclability over 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Herein, we report a general route for the uniform coating of hard carbon (HC) powders via fluidized bed chemical vapor deposition. Carbon-based fine powders are excellent substrate materials for many catalytic and electrochemical applications but intrinsically difficult to fluidize and prone to elutriation. The reactor was designed to achieve as much retention of powders as possible, supported by a computational fluid dynamics study to assess the hydrodynamic behavior for varying gaseous flow rates. Solutions of the tin seleno- and thio-ether complexes [SnCl4{nBuSe(CH2)3SenBu}] and [SnCl4{nBuS(CH2)3SnBu}] were used as single source precursors and injected at high temperature into a fluidized bed of HC powders under nitrogen flow. The method allowed for the synthesis of HC-SnSx–SnSe2 composites at the gram scale with potential applications in electrocatalysis and sodium-ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "Mixed transition metal sulfides (MTMSs) have been regarded as a potential anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high reversible specific capacity. Herein, nanoflower-like few-layered cobalt-tin-based sulfide (F-CoSnS) with a large interlayer spacing is synthesized via a facile route for superior sodium storage. The growth mechanism of this unique F-CoSnS is systematically studied. Such distinctive nanostructured engineering synergistically combines broad interlayer spacing (~0.85 nm), the functionalities of few (2-3) layers, and the introduction of heterogeneous metal atom, reducing ions diffusion energy barrier for high-efficiency intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ ions, as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. With further incorporation of three-dimensional (3D) conductive network, the F-CoSnS@C electrode shows a large sodium storage capacity (493.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1), remarkable rate capability (316.1 mAh g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and superior cycling stability (450 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 with 91.2% capacity retention, 0.044% fading rate per cycle and approximately 100% coulombic efficiency after 200 cycles). This work demonstrates that the few-layered ternary MTMSs are highly applicable for the development of advanced SIBs anode materials with high performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium/potassium-ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) arouse intensive interest on account of the natural abundance of sodium/potassium resources, the competitive cost and appropriate redox potential. Nevertheless, the huge challenge for SIBs/PIBs lies in the scarcity of an anode material with high-capacity and stable structure, which are capable of accommodating large-size ion during cycling. Furthermore, using the sustainable natural biomass to fabricate electrodes for energy storage applications is a hot topic. Herein, we reasonably design a ultra-small few-layer nanostructured MoSe2 entrenches on N, P co-doped bio-carbon by using chlorella as the adsorbent and reactor. As a consequence, the MoSe2/NP-C-2 composite represents exceedingly impressive electrochemical performance for both sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). It displays a prominent reversible capacity (523 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles) and impressive long-term cycling performance (192 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 even after 1000 cycles) in SIBs, which are one of the best properties of MoSe2-based anode materials for SIBs till date. To further probe the great potential applications, full SIBs by pairing the MoSe2/NP-C-2 composite anode with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode also exhibit satisfactory capacity of 215 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 after 100 cycles. Moreover, it also delivers a decent reversible capacity of 131 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 even after 250 cycles for PIBs.",

Good control over crystallinity, morphology, and dispersion of the nanohybrid is achieved because of the thermosetting nature of the resin polymer. The effects of the nickel nanoparticle on the composition, crystallographic phase, structure, morphology, tap density, specific surface area, and electrochemical performance as both lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery anodes are systematically investigated. It is found that the incorporation of the in situ formed nickel nanoparticles with certain content effectively enhances the electrochemical performance including reversible capacities, cyclic stability and rate performance as both lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery anodes. The experimental I-V profiles at different temperatures and theoretical calculations reveal that the charge carriers are accumulated in the amorphous carbon regions, which act as scattering centers to the carriers and lower the carrier mobility for the composite. With increasing nickel content, the mobility of the charge carriers is significantly increased, while the number of the charge carriers maintains almost constant. The nickel nanoparticles provide extra pathways for the accumulated charge, leading to reduced scatterings among the charge carriers and enhanced charge-carrier transportation.",

However, they are still plagued by inevitable volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation and an unclear energy storage mechanism. Herein, a one-step sulfidation-carbonization strategy is proposed for in situ confined growth of Cu1.96S nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu1.96S@NC) using octahedral metal-organic framework (Cu-BTC) as a precursor and investigate the driving effect of Cu current collector on its sodium storage. The generation of S─C bonds in Cu1.96S@NC avoids the volume change and structural collapse of Cu1.96S nanoparticles during the cycling process and improves the adsorption and transport capacity of the material for Na+. More exciting, the Cu species in the Cu current collector are self-induced forming Cu2S quantum dots to enter the original anode material during the initial few charging and discharging cycles, which unique small-size effect and abundant edge-active sites enhance the energy storage capacity of Cu1.96S. Thus, the Cu1.96S@NC exhibits a superior first discharge capacity of 608.56 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 with an initial Coulomb efficiency (ICE) of 75.4%, as well as provides excellent rate performance and long cycle durability up to 2000 cycles.",

The uniform bismuth nanosheets are prepared via a molten salt-assisted aluminum thermal reduction method. Compared with the commercial bismuth powder, the bismuth nanosheets present a larger specific surface area and interlayer spacing, which is beneficial for sodium ion insertion and release. As a result, the bismuth nanosheet anode presents excellent sodium storage properties with an ultralong cycle life of 6500 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1, and an excellent capacity retention of 87% at an ultrahigh current rate of 30 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Careful development and optimization of negative electrode (anode) materials for Na-ion batteries (SIBs) are essential, for their widespread applications requiring a long-term cycling stability. BiFeO3 (BFO) with a LiNbO3-type structure (space group R3c) is an ideal negative electrode model system as it delivers a high specific capacity (770 mAh g-1), which is proposed through a conversion and alloying mechanism. In this work, BFO is synthesized via a sol-gel method and investigated as a conversion-type anode model-system for sodium-ion half-cells. As there is a difference in the first and second cycle profiles in the cyclic voltammogram, the operating mechanism of charge-discharge is elucidated using in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In the first discharge, Bi is found to contribute toward the electrochemical activity through a conversion mechanism (Bi3+ → Bi0), followed by the formation of Na-Bi intermetallic compounds. Evidence for involvement of Fe in the charge storage mechanism through conversion of the oxide (Fe3+) form to metallic Fe and back during discharging/charging is also obtained, which is absent in previous literature reports. Reversible dealloying and subsequent oxidation of Bi and oxidation of Fe are observed in the following charge cycle. In the second discharge cycle, a reduction of Bi and Fe oxides is observed. Changes in the oxidation states of Bi and Fe, and the local coordination changes during electrochemical cycling are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the optimization of cycling stability of BFO is carried out by varying binders and electrolyte compositions. Based on that, electrodes prepared with the Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder are chosen for optimization of the electrolyte composition. BFO-CMC electrodes exhibit the best electrochemical performance in electrolytes containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive. BFO-CMC electrodes deliver initial capacity values of 635 and 453 mAh g-1 in the Na-insertion (discharge) and deinsertion (charge) processes, respectively, in the electrolyte composition of 1 M NaPF6 in EC/DEC (1:1, v/v) with a 2% FEC additive. The capacity values stabilize around 10th cycle and capacity retention of 73% is observed after 60 cycles with respect to the 10th cycle charge capacity.",

The strong interaction between Na-Sn alloy and PF6 - anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn-PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 h with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5 mV under harsh condition of 10 mA cm-2 and 10 mAh cm-2.

Through a three-electrode cell setup, we discover that it is the overpotential of the sodium counter electrode that drives the half-cells to the lower cutoff potential prematurely during hard carbon sodiation, particularly at high current rates, which prevents the hard carbon anode from being fully sodiated.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising substitute for lithium batteries due to their abundant resources and low cost. Metal sulfides are regarded as highly attractive anode materials due to their superior mechanical stability and high theoretical specific capacity. Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, 3D porous network shaped Sb2S3/FeS2 composite materials with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through a simple solvothermal and calcination method, which is predicted to facilitate favorable Na+ ion diffusion, is synthesized. Benefiting from the well-designed structure, the resulting Sb2S3/FeS2 exhibit a remarkable reversible capacity of 536 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g-1 and long high-rate cycle life of 3000 cycles at a current density of 30 A g-1 as SIBs anode. In situ and ex situ analyses are carried out to gain further insights into the storage mechanisms and processes of sodium ions in Sb2S3/FeS2@rGO composites. The significantly enhanced sodium storage capacity is attributed to the unique structure and the heterogeneous interface between Sb2S3 and FeS2. This study illustrates that combining rGO with heterogeneous engineering can provide an ideal strategy for the synthesis of new hetero-structured anode materials with outstanding battery performance for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The incorporation of oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 has been studied as a promising way to accelerate the transport of electrons and Na+ ions, which is important for achieving excellent electrochemical properties for anatase TiO2. However, wittingly introducing oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 for sodium-ion anodes by a facile and effective method is still a challenge. In this work, we report an innovative method to introduce oxygen vacancies into the urchin-like N-doped carbon coated anatase TiO2 (NC-DTO) by a facile plasma treatment. The superiorities of the oxygen vacancies combined with the conductive N-doped carbon coating enable the obtained NC-DTO of greatly improved sodium storage performance. When served as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, the NC-DTO electrode shows superior electrochemical performance (capacity: 272 mA h g-1 at 0.25 C, capacity retention: 98.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, as well as ultrahigh capacity: 150 mA h g-1 at 15 C). Density functional theory calculations combined with experimental results suggest that considerably improved sodium storage performance of NC-DTO is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity from the N-doped carbon layer as well as narrowed band gap and lowered sodiation energy barrier from the introduction of oxygen vacancies. This work highlights that introducing oxygen vacancies into TiO2 by plasma is a promising method to enhance the electrochemical property of TiO2, which also can be applied to different metal oxides for energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Anodes that engage in conversion as well as alloying reactions are highly attractive candidates for sodium/potassium-ion batteries (SIBs and PIBs) because of their high theoretical specific capacities. Herein, Tin sulphide@reduced graphene oxide (SnS2 nanopetal@rGO) composite material is investigated as an advanced anode material for SIBs and PIBs. In this work, a simple hydrothermal synthesis of ultrathin SnS2 nanopetals covalently decorated on the surface of rGO is demonstrated as an anode material for SIBs and PIBs. The as prepared SnS2@rGO displays an initial charge capacity of 749 (at 0.2 A g\n                     −1) and 852 mAh g\n                     −1 (at 0.1 A g\n                     −1) for SIBs and PIBs respectively. The SnS2@rGO hybrid exhibited excellent cycle life which is attributed to the introduction of rGO in the composite as well as the in-built formed C-S bond. Moreover, the rGO matrix, firmly anchored with C–S bonds, envelops the outer SnS2, effectively inhibiting direct contact between SnS2 and the electrolyte. These combined effects contribute to impede the irreversible conversion of sulfur to sulfite, thus ensuring excellent structural stability throughout electrochemical cycling. The well-engineered nanoarchitecture not only guarantees the fast electrode kinetics, but also confirms excellent pseudo capacitance contribution during repetitive cycles which is confirmed by kinetic studies. Thus, SnS2@rGO is found to be a most promising electrode for sodium/potassium-ion batteries.",

However, traditional methods of preparing HC require special equipment, long reaction times, and large energy consumption, resulting in low throughputs and efficiency. In our contribution, a novel synthesis method is proposed, involving the formation of HC nanosheets (NS‐CNs) within minutes by creating an anoxic environment through flame combustion and further introducing sulfur and nitrogen sources to achieve heteroatom doping. The effect of heterogeneous element doping on the microstructure of HC is quantitatively analyzed by high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy and image processing technology. Combined with density functional theory calculation, it is verified that the functionalized HC exhibits stronger Na+ adsorption ability, electron gain ability, and Na+ migration ability. As a result, NS‐CNs as SIB anodes provide an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 542.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and excellent rate performance with a reversible capacity of 236.4 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 1200 cycles. Furthermore, full cell assembled with NS‐CNs as the can present 230 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 150 cycles. Finally, in/ex situ techniques confirm that the excellent sodium storage properties of NS‐CNs are due to the construction of abundant active sites based on the novel synthesis method for realizing the reversible adsorption of Na+. This work provides a novel strategy to develop novel carbons and gives deep insights for the further investigation of facile preparation methods to develop high‐performance carbon anodes for alkali‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is widely regarded as the most promising anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). For improving the sodium storage capacity of HC anode, current research primarily focuses on the high‐voltage slope region. Actually, increasing the storage capability in the low‐voltage plateau region is more important for enhancing the energy density of full cells. Therefore, in this study, HC anode with rich closed pore structure is designed and constructed with the help of carbon dots (CDs), and it is demonstrated that the presence of closed pore structure can provide more sodium storage sites in the plateau region, resulting in an obvious increase of sodium storage capacity. Moreover, the pore‐filling and intercalation mechanism for sodium storage in plateau region is revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is worth noting that the increase in capacity induced by closed pore‐filling is not accompanied by a decrease in initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), due to the fact that the introduction of closed pores does not increase the contact area between electrode and electrolyte. This work presents novel concepts for the structural design of HC and provides valuable insights into the effective utilization of plateau region in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Nanoengineering of metal electrodes are of great importance for improving the energy density of alkali-ion batteries, which have been deemed one of most effective tools for addressing the poor cycle stability of metallic anodes. However, the practical application of nanostructured electrodes in batteries is still challenged by a lack of efficient, low-cost and scalable preparation methods. Herein, we propose a facile chemical dealloying approach to the tunable preparation of multidimensional Sb nanostructures. Depending on dealloying reaction kinetics regulated by different solvents, zero-dimensional Sb nanoparticles (Sb-NP), two-dimensional Sb nanosheets (Sb-NS) and three-dimensional nanoporous Sb are controllably prepared via etching Li-Sb alloys in H2O, H2O-EtOH, and EtOH, respectively. Morphological evolution mechanisms of the various Sb nanostructures are analyzed by SEM, TEM and XRD measurement. When applied as anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), the as-prepared Sb-NS electrodes without any chemical modifications exhibit high reversible capacity of 620 mAh g-1 and retain 90.2% of capacity after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1. The excellent Na+ storage performance observed is attributable to the 2D nanostructure, which ensures high degrees of Na+ accessibility, robust structural integrity, and rapid electrode transport. This facile and tunable approach can broaden ways of developing high performance metal electrodes with designed nanostructures for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.",

The stable graphene supporting layer and nanowire heterostructure guarantee an outstanding structural stability to tolerate certain volume changes during the charge/discharge process. The rational construction of NiS2 -MoS2 heterostructures induces abundant interfaces and unique ion diffusion channels, which render fast electrochemical kinetics and superior reversible capacities for high-performance SIBs.

        "abstract": "Antimony (Sb) has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and attracted much attention in recent years. Alleviating the volumetric effect of Sb during charge and discharge processes is the key point to promote Sb-based anodes to practical applications. Carbon dioxide (CO2) activation is applied to improve the rate performance of the Sb/C nanohybrid anodes caused by the limited diffusion of Li/Na ions in excessive carbon components. Based on the reaction between CO2 and carbon, CO2 activation can not only reduce the excess carbon content of the Sb/C nanohybrid but also create abundant mesopores inside the carbon matrix, leading to enhanced rate performance. Additionally, CO2 activation is also a fast and facile method, which is perfectly suitable for the fabrication system we proposed. As a result, after CO2 activation, the average capacity of the Sb/C nanohybrid LIB anode is increased by about 18 times (from 9 mA h g−1 to 160 mA h g−1) at a current density of 3300 mA g−1. Moreover, the application of the CO2-activated Sb/C nanohybrid as a SIB anode is also demonstrated, showing good electrochemical performance.",

However, the growth of dendrites results in poor battery performance and severe safety problems, inhibiting the commercial application of SMBs. To stabilize sodium metal anodes, various methods have been developed to optimize the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and adjust the electroplating/stripping behavior of sodium. Among the methods, developing anode host materials and adding electrolyte additives to build a protective layer are promising and convenient. However, the understanding of the interaction process between sodium metal and those organic materials is still limited, but is essential for the rational design of advanced anode hosts and electrolyte additives. In this study, we use copper(II) hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F_16CuPc), and copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc), as model systems to unravel the sodium interaction with polar functional groups by in-situ photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that sodium atoms prefer to interact with the inner pyrrolic nitrogen sites of CuPc, while they prefer to interact with the outer aza bridge nitrogen atoms, owing to Na-F interaction at the Na/F_16CuPc interface. Besides, for the both organic molecules, the central Cu(II) ions are reduced to Cu(I) ions by charge transfer from deposited sodium. The fluorine-containing groups are proven to promote the interaction process of sodium in organic materials, which sheds light on the design of functional interfaces in host materials and anode protective layers for sodium metal anodes.

At 1000 mA g-1, the specific capacities maintaine stable values of ∼620 mAh g-1 within 2000 cycles as anodes in lithium ion battery, while the specific capacity keeps at 229 mAh g-1 within 150 cycles as sodium ion battery anode. Our work shows comparable cycling performance in lithium ion battery but even better high-rate cycling stability as sodium ion battery anode. Herein, we provide a facile method to construct high electrochemical performance oxide/N-C composite electrode using new MOFs as sacrificial template.",

        "abstract": "The development of Sn-based materials with electrochemically inactive matrices is a novel strategy to alleviate the volume expansion and giant structure strain/stress during the sodiation/desodiation process. In this work, a freestanding membrane based on the unique bean pod-like host composed by nitrogen-doped carbon fibers and hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) encapsulated with SnCo nanoparticles is synthesized by electrospinning (B-SnCo/NCFs). In this unique bean pod-like structure, Sn acts as a host for Na+ storage, while the Co plays the important role of an electrochemically inactive matrix that can not only buffer the volume variations but also inhibit aggregation and particle growth of the Sn phase during the electrochemical Na-Sn alloying process. Meanwhile, the introduction of hollow carbon spheres can not only provide enough sufficient void space to withstand the volume expansion during the (de)sodiation processes but also improve the conductivity of the anode along the carbon fibers. Furthermore, the B-SnCo/NCF freestanding membrane can increase the contact area between the active material and the electrolyte, which can provide more active sites during the cycling process. When used as an anode material for Na-ion batteries, the freestanding B-SnCo/NCF anode exhibits an outstanding rate capacity of 243.5 mA h g-1 at 1.6 A g-1and an excellent specific capacity of 351 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for 300 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) has emerged as a promising anode material for fast-charging and long-cycling sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its dramatically volumetric variations during cycling will undesirably cause the pulverization of active materials, severely limiting the electrochemical performance of Bi-based electrodes. Constructing hollow nanostructures is recognized as an effective way to resolve the volume expansion issues of alloy-type anodes but remains a great challenge for metallic bismuth. Here, we report a facile iodine-ion-assisted galvanic replacement approach for the synthesis of Bi nanotubes (NTs) for high-rate, long-term and high-capacity sodium storage. The hollow tubular structure effectively alleviates the structural strain during sodiation/desodiation processes, resulting in excellent structural stability; the thin wall and large surface area enable ultrafast sodium ion transport. Benefiting from the structural merits, the Bi NT electrode exhibits extraordinary rate capability (84% capacity retention at 150 A g-1) and outstanding cycling stability (74% capacity retention for 65,000 cycles at 50 A g-1), which represent the best rate performance and longest cycle life among all reported anodes for SIBs. Moreover, when coupled with the Na3(VOPO4)2F cathode in full cells, this electrode also demonstrates excellent cycling performance, showing the great promise of Bi NTs for practical application. A combination of advanced research techniques reveals that the excellent performance originates from the structural robustness of the Bi NTs and the fast electrochemical kinetics during cycling.",

To address the issue, a Janus heterointerface with a Mott-Schottky structure is proposed to optimize the interface atomic structure, weaken interatomic resistance, and improve ion transport kinetics. Herein, Janus Co/Co2P@carbon-nanotubes@core-shell (Janus Co/Co2P@CNT-CS) refined urchin-like architecture derived from metal-organic frameworks is reported via a coating-phosphating process, where the Janus Co/Co2P heterointerface nanoparticles are confined in carbon nanotubes and a core-shell polyhedron.

The Janus Co/Co2P@CNT-CS refined urchin-like architecture composed of a core-shell structure and the grafting carbon nanotubes enhances the structure stability and electronic conductivity. Benefiting from the spaced-confined Janus heterointerface engineering and synergistic effects between the core-shell structure and the grafting carbon nanotubes, the Janus Co/Co2P@CNT-CS refined urchin-like architecture demonstrates the fast ion transport rate and excellent pseudocapacitance performance for LIBs/SIBs.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices and have been gradually grasping market share for their low cost and similar reaction mechanism and production process as compared to lithium-ion batteries. However, the low energy density of SIBs restricts their practical applications. For example, regular full cells of a Prussian blue cathode and NASICON anode have only a low discharge capacity (about 77 mA h/g at 1 C). Taking into account the compatibility of the electrolyte and electrode materials, a novel strategy for a viable aqueous dual-electrolyte sodium-ion battery (ADESIB) has been proposed using Na2SO4 solution as the anolyte and redox-active sodium hexacyanoferrate Na4Fe(CN)6 solution as the catholyte to accommodate a NASICON NaTi2(PO4)3 anode and Prussian blue Na2NiFe(CN)6 cathode. The capacity of Na+ ion deinsertion/insertion electrodes combined with the redox chemistry of the Na4Fe(CN)6 catholyte thus enhances overall charge storage and energy density. The ADESIB delivers a capacity of about 113 mA h/g at 1 C, showing a 43% improvement over batteries with a regular single Na2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, the dual-electrolyte full-cell system is proved to reach a 84.7% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, mainly due to the synergy of the electrolytes in both sides. This pioneering research proposes an aqueous dual-electrolyte sodium-ion full cell, showing potential applications in a new sodium-ion full battery system.",

However, their inherent defects, such as low electronic conductivity and severe volume expansion, seriously limit the further development of TMC-based anodes. Here, a novel composite material of CoSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in a dual one-dimensional (1D) carbon composite structure (CoSe2@CNTs/N-CNFs) was designed deliberately. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were grown in situ on the surface of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with eco-friendly ethanol as the carbon source, while electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers were pyrolyzed to form nitrogen-doped nanofibers. It is noted that the wrapping with the composite carbon structure greatly improved the stability of CoSe2 NPs and solved its inherent defects as an anode material. When assembled into a half-cell, the CoSe2@CNTs/N-CNFs electrode exhibited outstanding sodium storage performance with a reversible specific capacity of 442 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, as well as excellent rate performance, and the discharge specific capacity still reached 265 mA h g-1 even after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g-1.

In this work, composite hard carbon is developed by integrating graphitic carbon with biomass waste (banana peel)-derived activated carbon (AC). In this design, N-doped pseudographite layer is stacked at the entrance of open pores, forming a long-range graphitic layer without excessive graphitization. As a result, the surface area of AC is decreased by 170 times down to less than 10 m3 g-1, and the corresponding open pores are in situ converted into closed pores. In an optimized electrolyte solvation structure, the obtained HC anode achieves the reversible sodium-storage capacity up to 524 mAh g-1. In particular, a large portion of the capacity (490 mAh g-1) lies below the plateau of 0.25 V, which originates from the pore-filling mechanism as revealed by in situ Raman. This study provides a straightforward method to modulate the pore structure of carbon materials, and an energy-efficient (900 °C) synthesis for HC compared to traditional high-temperature routes (e.g., ≈1300-2000 °C).",

However, its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and sluggish sodium-ion diffusion greatly limit its further practical applications. Herein, we report a one-step prepotassiation strategy to modify commercial TiO2 by a spontaneous chemical reaction using potassium naphthalene (K-Nt). Prepotassiation effectively compensates for the irreversible Na loss and induces a homogeneous, dense, and robust artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on its surface. The well-distributed artificial SEI suppresses the excessive electrolyte decomposition, contributing to rapid interfacial kinetics and stable Na+ insertion/extraction. Therefore, such modified commercial TiO2 anodes demonstrate significantly improved ICE (72.4%) and outstanding rate performance (176.4 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1). This simple and efficient method for promoting ICEs and interfacial chemistry also demonstrates universality and practical value for other anodes in SIBs.",

High-capacity anode materials, such as antimony (Sb), which are potential energy boosters for SIBs, suffer from battery degradation owing to large-volume-changes and structural instability. The rational design of bulk Sb-based anodes to enhance the initial reversibility and electrode density inevitably requires atomic- and microscale-considered internal/external buffering or passivation layers. However, unsuitable buffer engineering causes electrode degradation and lowers energy density. Herein, the rationally designed intermetallic inner and outer oxide buffers for bulk Sb anodes are reported. The two chemistries in the synthesis process provide an atomic-scale aluminum (Al) buffer within the dense microparticles and an external mechanically stabilizing dual oxide layer. The prepared nonporous bulk Sb anode maintained excellent reversible capacity at a high current density and Na-ion full battery evaluations with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) showing negligible capacity decay over 100 cycles. The demonstrated buffer designs for commercially favorable micro-sized Sb and intermetallic AlSb shed light on the stabilization of high-capacity or large-volume-change electrode materials for various metal-ion rechargeable batteries.",

For SIBs, the SCE electrodes show a specific capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and high rate capacity (∼150 mA h g(-1) remains) at high current densities up to 5 C (5000 mA g(-1)).",

        "abstract": "Reducing material accumulation and designing reasonable sizes are critical strategies for increasing the rate and cycling stability of electrode materials. Herein, we presented a double-walled hollow carbon spheres (DWHCSs) loading strategy for achieving ultrafine SnS2 nanosheet adhesion by utilizing three-sided active sites of the interior/exterior carbon walls. The structure effectively shortened the electron/ion transport path, increased the effective contact between electrolyte and electrode material, and promoted ion diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the hollow structure can adapt to the volume change of the electrode during the cycle, preventing active substances from draining. Based on the above advantages, SnS2@DWHCSs as an anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) exhibited a distinguished reversible capacity of 665.7 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, and a superior rate ability of 377.6 mA h g-1 at an ultrahigh rate of 10 A g-1. The outstanding electrochemical performance revealed that the structure exhibited a broad application prospect in the field of energy storage and provided a reference for the rational design of other 2D materials.",

        "abstract": "As a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), cobalt sulfide (CoS_2) has attracted extensive attention due to its high theoretical capacity, easy preparation, and superior electrochemical activity. However, its intrinsic low conductivity and large volume expansion result in poor cycling ability. Herein, nitrogen-doped carbon-coated CoS_2 nanoparticles (N–C@CoS_2) were prepared by a C_3N_4 soft-template-assisted method. Carbon coating improves the conductivity and prevents the aggregation of CoS_2 nanoparticles. In addition, the C_3N_4 template provides a porous graphene-like structure as a conductive framework, affording a fast and constant transport path for electrons and void space for buffering the volume change of CoS_2 nanoparticles. Benefitting from the superiorities, the Na-storage properties of the N–C@CoS_2 electrode are remarkably boosted. The advanced anode delivers a long-term capacity of 376.27 mAh g^−1 at 0.1 A g^−1 after 500 cycles. This method can also apply to preparing other metal sulfide materials for SIBs and provides the relevant experimental basis for the further development of energy storage materials.",

Based on first-principles calculations and a tight-binding model, we demonstrate that the metallicity originates from the synergistic contribution of the p-orbital of the sp2-hybridized B and N atoms, while the ductility is due to the unique configurations of B-B and N-N dimers in the structure. More importantly, this boron nitride allotrope exhibits a high reversible capacity of 582.21 mA h g-1 in gravimetric density and 663.72 mA h cm-3 in volumetric density, fast Na-ion transport dynamics with low energy barriers ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 eV, a small volume change of 2.77%, and a long cycle-life. This study not only expands the family of conventional boron nitride materials with new features, but also enriches the family of anode materials for SIBs with high performance.",

        "abstract": "To attain both high energy density and power density in sodium‐ion (Na+) batteries, the reaction kinetics and structural stability of anodes should be improved by materials optimization. In this work, few‐layered molybdenum sulfide selenide (MoSSe) consisting of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases is designed to provide high ionic/electrical conductivities, low Na+ diffusion barrier, and stable Na+ storage. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as a conductive matrix to form 3D electron transfer paths. The resulting MoSSe@rGO anode exhibits high capacity and rate performance in both organic and solid‐state electrolytes. The ultrafast Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO anode is attributed to the surface‐dominant reaction process and broad Na+ channels. In situ and ex situ measurements are conducted to reveal the Na+ storage process in MoSSe@rGO. It is found that the MoS and MoSe bonds effectively limit the dissolution of the active materials. The favorable Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO electrode are ascribed to its low adsorption energy of −1.997 eV and low diffusion barrier of 0.087 eV. These results reveal that anion doping of metal sulfides is a feasible strategy to develop sodium‐ion batteries with high energy and power densities and long life‐span.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium-based composite anodes have been designed for applications in alkali metal ion batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, the problems of inferior long-term cycling stability caused by the large volume change and dissolution of vanadium-based active materials during cycles and slow diffusion for large radii of Na+ and K+ still limit their underlying capability and need to be addressed. In the present work, we initially designed and fabricated a vanadium nitride/carbon fiber (VN/CNF) composite via a facile electrospinning method followed by the ammonization process. The obtained VN/CNF composite anode exhibited excellent half/full sodium and potassium storage performance. When used as an anode material for SIBs, it delivered a high capacity of 403 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and as large as 237 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 even after 4000 cycles with negligible capacity fading. More importantly, the VN/CNFs//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell by coupling the VN/CNF composite anode with the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode also exhibited a desirable capacity of 257 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1 after 50 cycles. Besides, when further evaluated as an anode for PIBs, the VN/CNF composite anode achieved a large capacity of 266 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 and maintained a stable capacity of 152 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 even after 1000 cycles, showing significant long-term cycling stability. This is one of the best performances of vanadium-based anode materials for SIBs and PIBs reported so far.",

In this work, a three‐dimensional self‐supporting titanium dioxide nanoparticle rich in bulk vacancies (L‐TiOx) on titanium substrate is synthesized by pulsed laser. Different from the surface vacancies, the bulk oxygen defects of L‐TiOx cause a uniform and bulk phosphorus (P) doping with a high concentration of ~5.71 at %, which endows the elevated electronic conductivity, and accelerates the transport of Na+.

        "abstract": "The potential for energy storage in carbonaceous materials has been demonstrated. Heteroatom doping, particularly nitrogen (N) doping can further enhance their electrochemical performance. The type of N configuration determines the reactivity of doped carbon. It remains a challenge, however, to achieve a high ratio of active N (N-5) in N doped carbon. Herein, a high proportion of active nitrogen-doped hard carbon (PTA-Lys-800) is synthesized by rational design of classical Mannich reaction using tannic acid (TA) and amino acid as precursors. For sodium ion batteries (SIBs), the PTA-Lys-800 provides outstanding cycling stability and rate performance (338.8 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 for 100 cycles, a capacity retention of 86%; 131.1 mAh g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 5000 cycles). The excellent performance of PTA-Lys-800 is attributed to stable hierarchical pore structures, abundant defects, and high proportion of N-5 are formed during the carbonization process. Based on the results of detailed fundamental analysis, the pseudocapacitance mechanism contributes to the higher sodium storage process in PTA-Lys-800. The Na-adsorption mechanism is further explored through ex situ Raman technology. As a result of this work, a new scheme is presented for designing carbonaceous anode materials with high capacity and long cycle life.",

MoTe2/C-2 delivers a higher specific capacity (276 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 300 cycles), much more than MoTe2/C-1 (201 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 300 cycles), and exhibits a long-time cycling performance (131 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 2000 cycles). The excellent sodium-storage performance derived from the rational structure design is beneficial for shortening the ion paths, facilitating the sodiation/desodiation process, and reinforcing the intrinsic structural stability, thus boosting the reaction kinetics and prolonging the cycling life. Meanwhile, the assembled full-cell maintains 101 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 50 cycles and lights an electric watch. The findings provide several new views for preparation of more transition-metal tellurides with multi-ion/electron migration channel engineering.",

        "abstract": "Layered Na-birnessites are promising cathode materials for aqueous sodium-ion batteries due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental benignity. However, the general O'3 Na-birnessites possess low Na content and dominant inactive {001} exposed facets, which compromise their Na storage capability and cycling stability. Herein, we develop a high-Na-content P'3-Na0.71MnO2·0.15H2O with highly enriched {010} active facets by a hydrothermal conversion method. In comparison with the O'3 Na-birnessite, the P'3 Na-birnessite with a high ratio of {010}/{001} exposed facets provides greatly increased open channels for Na+ diffusion, while the P'3 stacking affords a lower Na+ diffusion barrier, resulting in improved electrode kinetics with a large specific capacity of 176 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. More importantly, the P'3 Na-birnessite manifests solo Na+ intercalation/deintercalation with extraordinary cycling stability in an aqueous electrolyte, achieving 90.5% capacity retention after 60,000 cycles. When coupled with the NaTi2(PO4)3 anode, the P'3 Na-birnessite-based full cell delivers both high energy density and long cycle life, demonstrating the potential application in aqueous sodium-ion batteries. This study demonstrates an efficient method to prepare high-Na-content P'3 birnessite with tunable exposed facets and provides important insights into developing highly stable layered cathodes for sustainable aqueous sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Poor air stability and severe structure pulverization are crucial issues for metal nitrides in metal-ion batteries. Herein, core-shell hybrid fibers (CSHN fiber) filled with metal nitride@C hollow nanocubes are introduced to be a new self-supporting anode for sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries. The hierarchical carbon network provides fast electronic pathways and gives high protection for iron nitrides. Meanwhile, the self-supporting electrode avoids the complicated electrode fabrication process and decreases the opportunity to air exposure. Moreover, its porous nature ensures high buffer to volumetric expansion and improves the cycling stability. Therefore, it is a good platform to realize fast kinetics and high durability. For the first time, Fe2N@N-doped carbon CSHN hybrid fibers are constructed. Their influences on air stability and electrochemical behaviors are studied. Impressively, they achieve high stabilities in both lithium-ion (92.8%, at 5 A g-1, 1000 cycles) and sodium-ion (95.6%, at 2 A g-1, 2000 cycles) batteries. Therefore, this work introduces a new method to construct superior performance nitride anodes.

        "abstract": "High‐capacity O3‐type layered sodium oxides are considered one of the most promising cathode materials for the next generation of Na‐ion batteries (NIBs). However, these cathodes usually suffer from low high‐rate capacity and poor cycling stability due to structure deformation, native air sensitivity, and interfacial side reactions. Herein, a multi‐site substituted strategy is employed to enhance the stability of O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2. Simulations indicate that the Ti substitution decreases the charge density of Ni ions and improves the antioxidative capability of the material. In addition, the synergistic effect of K+ and Ti4+ significantly reduces the formation energy of Na+ vacancy and delivers an ultra‐low lattice strain during the repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. In situ characterizations verify that the complicated phase transformation is mitigated during the charge/discharge process, resulting in greatly improved structure stability. The co‐substituted cathode delivers a high‐rate capacity of 97 mAh g−1 at 5 C and excellent capacity retention of 81% after 400 cycles at 0.5 C. The full cell paired with commercial hard carbon anode also exhibits high capacity and long cycling life. This dual‐ion substitution strategy will provide a universal approach for the new rational design of high‐capacity cathode materials for NIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries remains a challenge because of their low capacity, which limits their commercial application. Compared with carbon-based materials, metallic Sb and SnO-based anodes have received extensive attention because of their high theoretical specific capacity and safe working potential. The main problem faced is the serious volume expansion during charging and discharging, leading to irreversible loss of capacity and poor cycle life. In this paper, Sb/SnO@C composite material with adjustable ratio of Sb/SnO was prepared via electrospinning by encapsulating Sb and SnO particles in lantern-like carbon nanocages which connected through the nanofibers. The unique structure can not only effectively mitigate the volume changes during the cycle, but also provide multiple effective paths for ion and electron transport. The kinetic analysis is further performed with the assist of CV and EIS. The results show that the prepared composite can provide impressive Na+ ions storage and transport performance, and can still deliver a reversible charging capacity of 413mAhg−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 50mAg−1, with a capacity retention ratio of 84%.

        "abstract": "Silver molybdate, Ag2 Mo2 O7 , has been prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction. Its electrochemical properties as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been comprehensively examined by means of galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling, cyclic voltammetry, and rate performance measurements. At operating voltages between 3.0 and 0.01 V, the electrode delivered a reversible capacity of nearly 190 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1) after 70 cycles. Ag2 Mo2 O7 also demonstrated a good rate capability and long-term cycle stability, the capacity reaching almost 100 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) , with a capacity retention of 55 % over 1000 cycles. Moreover, the sodium storage process of Ag2 Mo2 O7 has been investigated by means of ex situ XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and HRTEM. Interestingly, the anode decomposes into Ag metal and Na2 MoO4 during the initial discharge process, and then Na(+) ions are considered to be inserted into/extracted from the Na2 MoO4 lattice in the subsequent cycles governed by an intercalation/deintercalation mechanism. Ex situ HRTEM images revealed that Ag metal not only remains unchanged during the sodiation/desodiation processes, but is well dispersed throughout the amorphous matrix, thereby greatly improving the electronic conductivity of the working electrode. The \"in situ\" decomposition behavior of Ag2 Mo2 O7 is distinct from that of chemically synthesized, metal-nanoparticle-coated electrode materials, and provides strong supplementary insight into the mechanism of such new anode materials for SIBs and may set a precedent for the design of further materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) metal battery is regarded as one of the most promising candidates for large‐scale energy storage devices, benefiting from the abundant sodium reserves and low cost. However, its practical application is hindered by the dendrite growth and unstable electrode‐electrolyte interface. Herein, a 3D sodiophilic structure composed of a carbon matrix overlaid with g‐C3N4 coating layers (g‐C3N4/3D‐C) is designed to stabilize the Na plating/stripping behavior. The sodiophilicity is endowed by a highly reversible adsorption‐intercalation process at the hetero‐interface, which can guide conformal Na deposition and induce the formation of inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphases with high structural stability and fast Na‐ion transport. Meanwhile, the 3D scaffold can effectively accommodate Na deposition during Na plating/stripping and depress the dendrite formation. As a result, the half cell assembled with g‐C3N4/3D‐C electrode delivers long‐term cycling performance at 1.0 mA cm−2 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% for over 2000 cycles and of 99.94% even at 5 mA cm−2, 10 mAh cm−2. The practical feasibility of the g‐C3N4/3D‐C is verified with full cells, which shows favorable rate capability and long‐cycle performance.

Here, the first solution synthesis of millimeter‐size crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with a clear lamellar structure, which can be exfoliated into micrometer‐size few‐layer 2DP sheets via both micromechanical cleavage and liquid sonication, is reported. The obtained CTFs or 2DPs show a unique staggered AB stacking with a dominant pore size of ≈0.6 nm, which is different from the common eclipsed AA stacking in various covalent organic frameworks. The preference for AB stacking is due to the specific interaction of triflic acid with CTFs as revealed computationally. When explored as new polymeric anodes for sodium‐ion batteries, both crystalline bulk CTF and exfoliated 2DP exhibit very high capacities (225 and 262 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, respectively), impressive rate capabilities (67 and 119 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1, respectively), and excellent cycling stability (95% capacity retention after 1200 cycles) due to their robust conjugated porous structure, outperforming most organic/polymeric sodium‐ion battery anodes ever reported.",

It is unveiled that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p‐band center, respectively, and balance of Ea and Eb is critical in enhancing the charge‐storage kinetics. The charge‐storage mechanism in HCs is evidenced through comprehensive in(ex) situ techniques.

        "title": "Insights to Oxygen Vacancy Engineering of TiO2 Anode for Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Rational construction of oxygen vacancies in electrode materials can effectively enhance the comprehensive sodium storage performance of the material. However, how to precisely control and regulate the oxygen vacancies concentration remains to be investigated, and the impact on electrochemical performance is still unclear. Herein, TiO2 nanoparticles with tunable oxygen vacancies concentrations are used as research models, which were fabricated through a simple and effective plasma method. The experimental results reveal that a moderate concentration of oxygen vacancies can significantly improve the electrochemical kinetics and charge conductivity of the TiO2 electrodes. In addition, oxygen vacancies promote the release of fluorine from the fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in the electrolyte, inducing a NaF‐rich solid electrolyte interphase, thus ensuring interfacial stability and inhibiting excessive electrolyte decomposition. Consequently, the well‐designed anode exhibits outstanding rate capability (147 mAh g‐1 at 5 A g1) and extremely stable cycling performance (nearly 100%, 3000 cycles). This work provides a feasible method for realizing defect concentration modulation in energy storage materials and offers new insights into interfacial chemistry for improving battery performance.",

        "title": "Synergetic Dual-Additive Electrolyte Enables Highly Stable Performance in Sodium Metal Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-metal batteries (SMBs) are considered one of the most promising candidates for the large-scale energy storage market owing to their high theoretical capacity (1,166 mAh g-1) and the abundance of Na raw material. However, the limited stability of electrolytes still hindered the application of SMBs. Herein, sulfolane (Sul) and vinylene carbonate (VC) are identified as effective dual additives that can largely stabilize propylene carbonate (PC)-based electrolytes, prevent dendrite growth, and extend the cycle life of SMBs. The cycling stability of the Na/NaNi0.68Mn0.22Co0.1O2 (NaNMC) cell with this dual-additive electrolyte is remarkably enhanced, with a capacity retention of 94% and a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9% over 600 cycles at a 5 C (750 mA g-1) rate. The superior cycling performance of the cells can be attributed to the homogenous, dense, and thin hybrid solid electrolyte interphase consisting of F- and S-containing species on the surface of both the Na metal anode and the NaNMC cathode by adding dual additives. Such unique interphases can effectively facilitate Na-ion transport kinetics and avoid electrolyte depletion during repeated cycling at a very high rate of 5 C. This electrolyte design is believed to result in further improvements in the performance of SMBs.",

The electrochemical tests indicate that FeV_2O_4 is generally controlled by pseudo-capacitive process. Using cost-effective and eco-friendly aqueous based binders, Sodium-Carboxymethylcellulose/Styrene butadiene rubber, a highly stable capacity of ~97 mAh∙g^−1 is obtained after 200 cycles. This is attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups indicating superior binding with the active material and current collector which is confirmed by the ex-situ cross-section images of the electrode. Meanwhile, only ~27 mAh∙g^−1 is provided by the electrode using poly(vinylidene difluoride) due to severe detachment of the electrode material from the Cu foil after 200 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), based on hard carbon anodes and Na+‐intercalation compound cathodes, have gained significant attention. Nonetheless, hard carbon anodes involve the storage of Na+ at a low potential, typically below 0.1 V (vs Na/Na+), which increases the risk of dendritic Na growth on the anode surface during overcharging. Herein, a safe organic/inorganic composite anode containing tetrasodium 3,4,9,10‐perylenetetracarboxylate (Na4PTC) and Metallic bismuth (Bi) with a weight ratio of 7:2, which exhibits an average potential of 0.7 V (vs Na+/Na) and a capacity of 150 mAh g−1 is proposed. The electrode reaction involves a reversible coordination reaction within the organic host and alloying reactions within the metallic Bi component. Importantly, the organic component efficiently buffers the volume changes in Bi during the alloying reaction, while the metallic Bi enhances the electronic conductivity of the organic material. As a result, this composite anode shows high cycle stability and rate performance, even under high mass loadings ranging from 10 to 50 mg cm−2. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the Na‐ion full cell, consisting of the composite anode and the Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathode, exhibits minimal capacity degradation over 100 cycles while maintaining a high areal capacity of 1.1 mA cm−2.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional layer structured MoS2 anode material emerges as a prospective candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), while its poor electronic conductivity and structural degradation still induce the unsatisfying rate performance and limited cycling stability. Herein, a novel freestanding MoS2/C anode material is fabricated by growing MoS2 nanosheets with flower-like nanostructure on 3D interconnected N, S co-doped carbon nanofibers. The constructed freestanding 3D conductive matrix can efficiently promote the electron transfer and ion transport as well as ameliorate the volume variations and avoid the aggregation of the MoS2 nanosheets to maintain the structural stability. The boosting effect of N, S co-doping was further confirmed by the first-principles calculation, which can accelerate conductivity, lower the Na+ adsorption energy, introduce more heteroatomic defects and offer plentiful active sites for Na+ storage, thus enhancing the electrochemical properties. The as-prepared free-standing MoS2/N, S co-doped carbon anode exhibits excellent long cycle and high rate properties, showing higher reversible capacities of 500 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, 327 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 and remarkable high-rate response up to 8 A g−1.

Herein, a carbon coated CoSe2/Sb2Se3 heterojunction (CoSe2/Sb2Se3@C) is designed and constructed via an ion-exchange reaction between Co and Sb, and the subsequent selenization step. It is found that the hetero-structure and carbon shell effectively boost the charge transfer in the CoSe2/Sb2Se3@C composite electrode. The highly pseudocapacitive Na+ storage contribution is acquired due to the structural benefits of the heterojunction. Therefore, the CoSe2/Sb2Se3@C anode affords good cycling stability (264.5 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (266.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1). This study supplies a reference for developing an advanced anode with multicomponent and heterojunction structures for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "The efficient synthesis of crystalline two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) with designed structures and properties is highly desired but remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of two-dimensional polyimide (2DPI) nanosheets via hydrogen-bond-induced preorganization and subsequent imidization reaction. The formed intermolecular hydrogen bonds can significantly improve the internal order and in-plane periodicity of 2DPI. The crystalline few-layer 2DPI nanosheets are micrometer-size, solvent dispersible, and thermally stable. Interestingly, the 2DPI with π-conjugation shows a favorable bandgap of 2.2 eV and can function as a p-type semiconducting layer in field-effect transistor devices with an appreciable mobility of 4.3 × 10-3 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, when explored as a polymeric anode for sodium-ion batteries, the 2DPI exhibits ultrahigh capacity (312 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), impressive rate capability (137 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1), and excellent cycling stability (95% capacity retention after 1100 cycles) due to its robust 2D conjugated porous structure, outperforming most organic/polymeric anodes ever reported. This work provides a versatile strategy for synthesizing 2DP nanosheets with promising electronics and energy-related applications.",

The sodium-ion battery has the potential application in the field of low-speed electric vehicle, which puts forward the requirement for the development and application of fast charging technology. However, the slow dynamics of traditional anode materials for sodium-ion batteries limit their application in fast charging conditions. The development of anode materials with fast sodium-ion diffusion ability is the key to achieve fast charging sodium-ion batteries.

Herein, the synthesis of mesoporous carbon nanospheres with highly disordered graphitic domains and MoC nanodots modification via a surface stretching strategy is reported. The MoOx surface coordination layer inhibits the graphitization process at high temperature, thus creating short and wide graphite domains. Meanwhile, the in situ formed MoC nanodots can greatly promote the conductivity of highly disordered carbon. Consequently, MoC@MCNs exhibit an outstanding rate capacity (125 mAh g-1 at 50 A g-1 ). The \"adsorption-filling\" mechanism combined with excellent kinetics is also studied based on the short-range graphitic domains to reveal the enhanced slope-dominated capacity. The insight in this work encourages the design of HC anodes with dominated slope capacity toward high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Na battery chemistries show poor passivation behavior of low voltage Na storage compounds and Na metal with organic carbonate-based electrolytes adopted from Li-ion batteries. Therefore, a suitable electrolyte remains a major challenge for establishing Na batteries. Here we report highly concentrated sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) in dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolytes and investigate them for Na metal and hard carbon anodes and intercalation cathodes. For a DME/NaFSI ratio of 2, a stable passivation of anode materials was found owing to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface, which was characterized spectroscopically. This permitted non-dentritic Na metal cycling with approximately 98 % coulombic efficiency as shown for up to 300 cycles. The NaFSI/DME electrolyte may enable Na-metal anodes and allows for more reliable assessment of electrode materials in Na-ion half-cells, as is demonstrated by comparing half-cell cycling of hard carbon anodes and Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathodes with a widely used carbonate and the NaFSI/DME electrolyte.",

Although hard carbon (HC) is considered the most promising negative electrode material for SIBs, research on the thermal safety and electrochemical stability of HC electrode and electrolyte remains limited. The electrochemical performance of HC in ester-based and ether-based electrolytes is investigated in this work. Ether-based electrolytes exhibit superior cycling and rate performance compared to ester-based electrolytes, attributed to a thinner solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, the flammability of electrolytes and the thermal stability of sodiated HC with various electrolytes are examined. Ether-based electrolytes surpass that of ester-based electrolytes, with sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4)/tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) and sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6)/TEGDME electrolytes showing optimal performance. These findings offer valuable insights for the selection of suitable electrolytes for HC SIBs.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, heterogeneous cobalt phosphosulfide (Co4S3/Co2P) nanocrystals anchoring on few-layered MXene nanosheets (MXene@Co4S3/Co2P) were prepared by in situ growth and the subsequent high-temperature phosphorization/sulfidation processes. Thanks to the synergistic effect and the abundant phase interfaces of Co4S3, Co2P, and MXene, the electron transfer and Na+ diffusion processes were greatly accelerated. Meanwhile, the high electrical conductivity of MXene nanosheets and the heterogeneous structure of Co4S3/Co2P effectively avoided the MXene restacking and the agglomeration of phosphosulfide particles, thus mitigating volumetric expansion during charging and discharging. The results show that the MXene@Co4S3/Co2P heterostructure presents good rate capability (251.08 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (198.69 mAh g-1 after 407 cycles at 5 A g-1). Finally, the storage mechanism of Na+ in the heterostructure and the multistep phase transition reaction were determined by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. This study provides a new perspective on the formation of metal phosphosulfide and MXene hybrids with multiple heterointerfaces as well as demonstrates MXene@Co4S3/Co2P composites as the promising anode material in sodium-ion batteries.",

As a result, the fiber-in-tube hybrid anode shows a high specific capacity of 616 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 . At 1 A g-1 , a capacity of ca. 451 mAh g-1 can be achieved after 500 cycles.

However, it is still a significant challenge to develop highly flexible ARSIBs ascribing to the lack of flexible electrode materials. In this work, nanocube-like KNiFe(CN)_6 (KNHCF) and rugby ball-like NaTi_2(PO_4)_3 (NTP) are grown on carbon nanotube fibers via simple and mild methods as the flexible binder-free cathode (KNHCF@CNTF) and anode (NTP@CNTF), respectively. Taking advantage of their high conductivity, fast charge transport paths, and large accessible surface area, the as-fabricated binder-free electrodes display admirable electrochemical performance. Inspired by the remarkable flexibility of the binder-free electrodes and the synergy of KNHCF@CNTF and NTP@CNTF, a high-performance quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped ARSIB (FARSIB) is successfully assembled for the first time. Significantly, the as-assembled FARSIB possesses a high capacity of 34.21 mAh cm^−3 and impressive energy density of 39.32 mWh cm^−3. More encouragingly, our FARSIB delivers superior mechanical flexibility with only 5.7% of initial capacity loss after bending at 90° for over 3000 cycles.

        "abstract": "MoS2 is regarded as a hopeful anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their various merits such as high specific capacity, abundant raw material reserves and low cost. However, their practical application is impeded by unsatisfied cycling ability due to the intense mechanical stress and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during Na+ insertion/extraction process. Herein, spherical MoS2@polydopamine derived highly conductive N-doped carbon (NC) shell composites (MoS2@NC) are designed and synthesized to promote the cycling stability. The internal MoS2 core is optimized and restructured from the original micron-sized block to the ultra-fine nanosheets during initial 100–200 cycles, which not only improves the utilization of electrode materials but also shortens the ion transport distance. The outer flexible NC shell effectively maintains the original spherical structure of the overall electrode material and prevents the occurrence of large-scale agglomeration, which is conducive to form a stable SEI layer. Therefore, the core–shell MoS2@NC electrode presents a remarkable cyclic stability and a capable rate performance. Under a high rate of 20 A g−1, the high capacity of 428 mAh g−1 can be acquired after over ultra-long 10,000 cycles without obvious capacity loss. Moreover, the MoS2@NC‖Na3V2(PO4)3 full-cell assembled by employing commercial Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode can achieve a high capacity retention of 91.4% after 250 cycles at 0.4 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Coal-based carbon material, characterized by abundant resources and low cost, has gained considerable interests as a promising anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the coal-based carbon generally shows inferior Na-storage performance due to its highly-ordered microstructure with narrow interlayer spacing. Herein, a salt-assisted mechanical ball-milling strategy is proposed to disrupt the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure in anthracite molecules, thereby reducing the microcrystalline regularity of the derived carbon during following pyrolysis process. In addition, the induced C─O─C bonds during ball-milling process can alter the pyrolysis behavior of anthracite and restrain the formation of surface defects. Consequently, in contrast to pristine anthracite-based pyrolytic carbon, which exhibits a Na-storage capacity of 198.4 mAh g-1 with a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 65.1%, the ball-milling modified carbon assisted by NaCl salt (NAC), with enhanced structural disordering and reduced surface defects, demonstrate significantly improved Na-storage capacity of 332.1 mAh g-1 and ICE value of 82.0%. The NAC electrode also realizes excellent cycle and rate performance, retaining a capacity of 196.0 mAh g-1 at 1 C after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, when coupled with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the assembled Na-ion full cell deliveres an exceptional electrochemical performance, highlighting its promising prospect as high-performance anode for SIBs.",

However, it remains a challenge to easily obtain 2D MO nanosheets by a generalized synthetic pathway. Here, we report a general and facile strategy for the synthesis of 2D MO nanosheets induced by nonionic surfactant micelles. Notably, the novel strategy primarily relies on the thermoregulated phase transition of the micelles. The resulting 2D MO nanosheets show high specific surface areas. As a demonstration, Sb2O3 nanosheets synthesized by our method as anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have a high reversible capacity of 420 mA h g-1 and a high capacity retention of 99% after 150 cycles at 0.1 A g-1. Mn3O4 nanosheets for supercapacitors have a remarkable specific capacitance of 127 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. Even at a large current density of 5 A g-1 after 10 000 cycles, 96% of the specific capacitance is retained, demonstrating the remarkable performance of these nanosheets for energy storage applications.",

The synthetic parameters and the electrochemical properties of these terpolymers as Na-ion negative electrodes in half cells were studied. Reversible capacities of 300 mAh g-1 (50 wt % conducting carbon) and 200 mAh g-1 (20 wt % conducting carbon) were achieved in powder and Cu-supported electrodes, respectively, for a polySchiff-polyether terpolymer synthesized by using a poly(ethylene oxide) block of 600 g mol-1 in place of one third of the aniline units. The new redox-active polymers were also used as a binding agent of another anode material (hard carbon), which led to an increase of the total capacity of the electrode compared to that prepared with other standard fluorinated polymer binders such as poly(vinylidene) fluoride.",

Herein, phosphorus-doped hollow carbon nanorods (P-HCNs) are obtained by a one-step synthesis with a high phosphorus content of 7.5 atom %. By controlling the P configuration, the P-HCNs03 exhibits reversible capacity as high as 260 mA h g-1 at the current density of 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles with an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 73%. When the amount of phosphorus in the as-prepared materials is changed, the different structures of the P-doped carbon lattices are analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Based on the first-principles calculation, although the P-O bond has the most configurations, the excellent reversible capacity of the electrode is attributed to the strong Na-absorption ability of P═O and P-C bonds. The sodium-based dual-ion batteries (NDIBs) assembled with P-HCNs03 as an anode and expanded graphite as a cathode (P-HCNs03//EG) exhibited a high energy density of 138 W h kg-1 at a power density of 159 W kg-1.

The Na storage mechanism is also elucidated through in situ/ex situ characterizations. Moreover, the hollow VS4 microspheres demonstrate reliable rate performance at a low temperature of -40 °C (e.g., the capacity is ≈163 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 ).

Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to rationally design heterointerface engineering and understand the synergistic effect reaction mechanisms. In this paper, the two-phase heterointerface engineering (Sb2 S3 and FeS2 ) is well designed to incorporate into N-doped porous hollow carbon nanofibers (Sb-Fe-S@CNFs) by proper electrospinning design. The obtained Sb-Fe-S@CNFs are used as anode in SIBs to evaluate the electrochemical performance. It delivers a reversible capacity of 396 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g-1 and exhibits an ultra-long high rate cycle life for 16 000 cycles at 10 A g-1 . The admirable electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the following reasons: The porous carbon nanofibers serve as an accelerator of the electrons/ions and a buffer to alleviate volume expansion upon long cyclic performance. The abundant phase boundaries of Sb2 S3 /FeS2 exert low Na+ adsorption energy and greatly promote the charge transfer in the internal electric field calculated by first-principle density functional theory. Therefore, the as-prepared Sb-Fe-S@CNFs represents a promising candidate for an efficient anode electrode material in SIBs.",

It maintains ca. 100 mAh·g^−1 capacity after 100 cycles at 0.1C rate. What’s more, it displays about 206.4, 181.2, 151.8, 129.0, 100.3, and 63.4 mAh g^−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C current rate, respectively. A capacity of 156.4 mAh·g^−1 is recovered when the current density is back to 0.2 C. Density functional theory (DFT) together with molecular dynamics (MD) is used to reveal the Na^+ intercalation and diffusion mechanism. Theoretical calculation shows highly active Na^+ migration on the b–c planes, with a minimal 0.22 eV energy barrier and the highest diffusion coefficient of 3.8 × 10^−7 cm^2 s^−1 along the b -axis, at the fully charged state. The high vitality of Na^+ is maintained until the intercalation level x is more than 0.5. After that, the mobility of Na^+ is greatly prohibited, leading to an energy barrier of more than 0.7 eV and a diffusion coefficient within the range 10^−14–10^−15 cm^2 s^−1 at the fully discharged state of Na_4Ti_3O_7. The formation energy convex hull determined by means of cluster expansion enables the calculation of voltage profile and the variation of cell parameters, which reveals the low strain (< 1%) feature during the battery cycles. The calculation of electronic structure also reveals an insulator–metal transition upon the sodiation of the Na_2Ti_3O_7 material.",

The structure exhibits a high theoretical capacity due to its wide interlayer spacing (∼6.2 Å). Therefore, MoS2 has recently been used as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it exhibits inferior cycle performance and rate characteristics due to its low electronic conductivity and volume change during continuous operation, which restrict its use as an anode material in SIBs. Herein, a MoS2 surface modified with hydrophobic reduced graphene oxide (rGO-MoS2) was dispersed in silicone oil, which is the starting material for silicon oxycarbide (SiOC), and subsequently used to prepare a MoS2 composite with a SiOC coating-layer surface modified with rGO (rGO-MoS2@SiOC) via single pyrolysis reaction. rGO expands the interlayer spacing of MoS2, improving the electronic conductivity, and the SiOC layer capable of accommodating the volume expansion of MoS2 supports the insufficient buffer layer provided by rGO alone to form a conductive pathway that suppressed any adverse reactions at the electrode and electrolyte interface. The rGO-MoS2@SiOC composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of ∼532.5 mAh g−1, no capacity fading even after 100 cycles, and superior rate characteristics.",

The CoSx quantum dots are in situ formed within ultrafine carbon nanosheets without further sulfidation, thus resulting in ultrafine CoSx particle size and embedded heterostructure. Meanwhile, enriched N and S codoping in the carbon nanosheets greatly enhances the electrical conductivity for the conductive matrix and creates more active sites for sodium storage. As a result, the hybrid CoSx@NSC electrode shows excellent rate capability (600 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and 500 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and outstanding cycling stability (87% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 A g-1), making it promising as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.

This protective layer, employing a flexible chain doping strategy, combines the benefits of 2D graphdiyne and linear chain structures to achieve 2D mechanical stability, electronic and ion conductions, ion selectivity, adequate elongation, and flexibility. It establishes close contact with the Sn particles and can adapt to dynamic size changes while effectively facilitating both electronic and ion transports. It successfully mitigates the detrimental effects of particle pulverization and coarsening induced by large‐volume changes. The as‐obtained Sn electrodes demonstrate exceptional stability, enduring 1800 cycles at a high current density of 2.5 A g−1.

The excellent structural integrity of the novel anode was further visualized during cycling by using in situ experiments inside a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), and the associated sodiation/desodiation mechanism was also thoroughly investigated. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the N-doped graphene not only contributes to an increase in capacity for sodium storage but also is beneficial in regards to improved rate performance of the anode.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is the most suitable anode material for pragmatic Sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs). Despite various studies, there is still significant scope for improvement in the understanding of the (de)sodiation mechanism. Here, we study Sn incorporation in hard carbons and its effects on the electrochemical performance.  Sn incorporation leads to improved first cycle coulombic efficiency and capacity, specifically increase in the plateau capacity. An improvement from 220 mAh/g to 285 mAh/g and 325 mAh/g is respectively obtained for 7% and 15% Sn in hard carbon‐Sn composites (HC/Sn). Sn incorporation in both commercial and sucrose‐derived hard carbons has been shown to improve the electrochemical performance. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) studies show that number of graphene layers in nano‐graphitic domains is reduced after Sn incorporation with no change in interlayer spacing, thus highlighting the role of the nature of graphitic domains in designing the hard carbons. Full cells with commercial cathodes are also presented. Cost analysis of the Sn doping routes in this study is presented to demonstrate the commercial viability of the strategy.",

        "abstract": "It remains a big challenge to identify high-performance anode materials to promote practical applications of sodium-ion batteries. Herein, the facile synthesis of CoS nanoflowers wrapped in reduced graphene oxides (RGO) is reported, and their sodium storage properties are systematically studied in comparison with bare CoS. The CoS@RGO nanoflowers deliver a high reversible capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 and superior rate capability with discharge capacity of 329 mAh g-1 at 4 A g-1 , much higher than those of the bare CoS. Evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectra and ex-situ SEM images, the improvement in the sodium storage performance is found to be due to the introduction of RGO which serves as a conducting matrix, to not only increase the kinetic properties of CoS, but also buffer the volume change and maintain the integrity of working electrodes during (de)sodiation processes. More importantly, the pseudocapacitive contribution of more than 89 % is only observed in the CoS@RGO nanocomposites, owing to the enhanced specific area and surface redox behavior.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfides are widely explored as anodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to high theoretical capacities and low cost, but their practical application is still impeded by poor rate capability and fast capacity decay. Herein, for the first time, we construct highly dispersed Fe7S8 nanoparticles anchored on a porous N-doped carbon nanosheet (CN) skeleton (denoted as Fe7S8/NC) with high conductivity and numerous active sites via facile ion adsorption and thermal evaporation combined procedures coupled with a gas sulfurization treatment. Nanoscale design coupled with a conductive carbon skeleton can simultaneously mitigate the above obstacles to obtain enhanced structural stability and faster electrode reaction kinetics. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the synergistic interaction between CNs and Fe7S8 can not only ensure enhanced Na+ adsorption ability but also promote the charge transfer kinetics of the Fe7S8/NC electrode. Accordingly, the designed Fe7S8/NC electrode exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance with superior high-rate capability (451.4 mAh g-1 at 6 A g-1) and excellent long-term cycling stability (508.5 mAh g-1 over 1000 cycles at 4 A g-1) due to effectively alleviated volumetric variation, accelerated charge transfer kinetics, and strengthened structural integrity.

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries have promising prospects in large-scale electrical energy storage, which lack of suitable cathode with high specific capacity and long cycle lifespan, unfortunately. Manganese-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) (KMnHCF/NaMnHCF) are ideal candidates for low-cost and high theoretical specific capacity merits. But the rapid decline hinders their application, due to side reactions caused by water imbalance. Here, an equilibrium strategy, which can balance the interstitial water supplement and water attack, is proposed. As proof of the concept, xCS (x: proportion, CS: co-solvent, such as polyethylene glycol and trimethyl phosphate) equilibrium electrolytes are introduced to solve the rapid decline. Assisting with the electrolyte, KMnHCF realizes excellent performance (10 000 cycles), which is beyond most cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries. The full batteries composed of KMnHCF cathode and NaTi2 (PO4 )3 anode also display outstanding performance (7000 cycles) and promising application prospects at low-temperature and engineering scenes. And then, the equilibrium electrolyte concept is verified by NaMn0.8 Fe0.2 HCF and NaMnHCF, proving its universality for low-cost and long-life manganese based PBAs.",

        "abstract": "The sodium storage behavior in the plateau region is crucial for determining the capacity and rate capability of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Key structural features for achieving excellent plateau performance include extended graphite domains and increased interlayer spacing. However, synchronously optimizing these two structures is challenging due to their inherent trade‐off. Herein, a tandem catalytic carbonization strategy is developed to construct HC with long graphite domains (La = 5.31 nm) and large interlayer spacing (d002 = 0.389 nm) simultaneously. Comprehensive in situ and ex situ tests unravel the catalytic selective bond breaking and aromatization effects of ZnCl2, the catalytic graphitic layers enlargement and occupied effects of formed ZnO and Zn in different temperature stages, leading to the formation of the unique structure. The optimal HCZ‐0.1 exhibits a high reversible capacity of 346.9 mAh g−1 with a plateau capacity of 249.4 mAh g−1, and high‐rate performance (114.0 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). In addition, the sodium storage mechanism and origin of enhanced Na+ kinetics of HCZ‐0.1 are also revealed. This work offers a precise method to engineer the graphite microcrystal structure in HC for superior sodium storage in the plateau region.",

However, they still suffered from volume expansion and sluggish kinetics, resulting in serious cycle capabilities. Herein, through controlling the kind of molten salts (Na2SO4, NaCl, and Na2CO3) in salt melt synthesis (SMS), a series of NiS with an N, S-codoped carbon layer was successfully prepared, accompanied with different morphologies and structures (earthworm-like belts and triangular and spherical particles). Tailored by the ionic strength and viscosity of molten salts, the as-prepared samples displayed different crystallization behaviors, bringing about a difference in electrochemical performance. As earthworm-like NiS@C was explored as an anode material for SIBs, an initial capacity of 712.5 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 could be obtained, and it still kept 527.4 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. Even at 2.0 A g-1, a capacity of 508.6 mAh g-1 could be achieved. Meanwhile, with the assistance of detailed kinetic analysis, the rapid diffusion behaviors of Na+ and redox reaction mechanisms of as-fabricated samples were proven for the enhanced electrochemical properties. Given this, this work is expected to provide a method for designing the morphology and structure of metal sulfides, while shedding light on the orientation of fabricating advanced electrode materials for SIBs.",

First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant.

However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles.",

        "title": "Three-dimensional N/O co-doped hard carbon anode enabled superior stabilities for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Hard carbons (HCs) with low working potential have been considered one of the most promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), whereas the intrinsic poor rate performance and inferior cyclic stability hindered their practical application. Porosity designing and heteroatom doping are considered essential for high rate performance as well as durability by relieving volume expansion with Na-interaction and providing rapid Na+ diffusion paths. Herein, a three-dimensional N/O co-doped HCs (NOHCs) is synthesized as an anode for ultrastable SIBs. Combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we find that the content of pyrrolic-N is positively correlated with carbon interlayer distance, and the CO group could provide more active sites, thus superior reaction kinetics could be observed in NOHCs samples. In-situ Raman and ion diffusion kinetic analysis (GITT and CV) suggest that the integrated strategy of hetero doping and designed pore structure enables highly reversible electrochemical reactions and fast diffusion kinetics. Thus obtained NOHC-2 anode exhibits excellent capacity retention (69.8% after 15,000 cycles, 10.0 A g−1) and rate performance (160.2 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1) with Na metal as the counter electrode. More importantly, the full cell composed of NOHCs anode and Prussian blue cathode delivers a high energy density of 97.3 Wh kg−1 with a power density of 985.7 W kg−1.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for large‐scale energy storage due to the low cost and abundant sodium resources. However, the formation of sodium dendrites on the surface of hard carbon (HC) anodes is the most intractable challenge for full cells during charging, leading to severe performance degradation and safety hazards. Here, a robust additive‐induced borate and fluoride‐rich interphase is constructed by introducing sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) as additive in the ether‐based electrolyte to relieve the performance deterioration for SIBs. NaDFOB can participate in the passivation process of electrolyte‐electrode interfaces through preferential oxidation and reduction of DFOB− to effectively restrain the growth of sodium dendrites. Moreover, the electrolyte decomposition and dissolution of transition metal ions are effectively inhibited. Benefiting from that, FeMn‐based Prussian blue (FeMnHCF) || HC full cell with a negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio) of 1.09 displays a capacity retention of 82.1%, especially with a low N/P ratio of 0.96 the cell still demonstrates a stable Coulombic efficiency of over 99.9% after 500 cycles via using NaDFOB as additive. As a practical demonstration, the designed 18650 full cells display enhanced cycling stability with NaDFOB additive. The findings provide insights into the additive‐induced inorganic‐rich interfacial layers for dendrite‐free SIBs.",

However, the poor conductivity and significant volume effect of red phosphorus inevitably deposited on the outer surface of P/C composites may incur significant capacity decay and structural degradation. This work reports a method for preparing surface-modified micro-sized P/C composites with built-in nanoscale features. Through thermal vapor sulfurization, the obtained micron-sized sulfur-modified P/C (S-P/C) composites not only fulfill the requirements of the battery manufacture but also maintain their nano-in-micro structure. It can eliminate the detrimental red phosphorus on the outer surface of P/C composites and convert it into the ion conductive layer of Na3PS4, limiting its volume effect and significantly promoting ion conduction. As a result, S-P/C composites exhibit excellent cyclic stability in a half cell (610 mAh/g at 0.2 A/g and capacity retention of 94.2 % after 100 cycles) and reach a high areal capacity level (1.99 mAh cm−2) in a full cell.",

Thermal treatment of the supported nanofilm yields a sequence of nanocrystalline phases of vanadium oxide (V3O7, VO2) as a function of temperature.

The large number of recently reported peroxide-rich crystalline materials suggests that the process can be a useful general route for nanofilm formation. The V3O7@GO composite product was tested as a sodium ion battery anode and showed high charge capacity at high rate charge-discharge cycling (150 mAh g-1 at 3000 mA g-1 vs 300 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1) due to the nanomorphology of the vanadium oxide.",

        "abstract": "Realization of the conversion type electrode materials in Na-ion battery (NIB) have been hindered due to the nucleation property of the active material. During the sodiation, the transition metal (TM) cations reduce to the metallic state and the respective anions react with the sodium ions. As a result, the metal particles are surrounded by the matrix of insulating sodium compound, resulting in loss of electrical contact among the TM particles. Here, an amorphous molybdenum sulfide (a-MoSx) electrode is made highly reversible by suppressing TM particle growth via elongating cation diffusion pathway. Because of the long distance among Mo atoms in a-MoSx, the growth of Mo nuclei is limited. This leads to more frequent nucleation and formation of smaller particles (3-5 nm in diameter). Since the smaller particles have larger surface area than the bigger particles, the electrical contacts among Mo particles are clearly retained. The a-MoSx anode for NIBs demonstrates the high capacity and excellent cycling retention. This work establishes that the amorphous structure enhances the reversibility and cycling stability of conversion reaction-based electrodes by elongating the diffusion pathway of the metal ions.",

        "abstract": "Single-atom metals (SAMs), despite being promising for high-utilization catalysis, biomedicine, and energy storage, usually suffer from limited catalytic performance caused by low metal loading. Herein, via an oriented diffusion strategy, all-region ultrahigh-loading (18.9 wt.%) Sn-SAMs over carbon nanorings matrix (Sn-SAMs@CNR) are initially achieved based on the transformation of a g-C3N4@SnO2@polydopamine ring-like nested structure. The formation process of Sn-SAMs involves a critical conversion from oxygen-coordination (SnO2) to nitrogen-coordination (Sn-N4) and simultaneous anti-Osterwalder ripening promoted under spatial confinement. Notably, the g-C3N4-derived N-containing gaseous intermediates dynamically drive the oriented diffusion (inside-out diffusion) of Sn-SAMs across the carbon nanorings, realizing an all-region ultrahigh loading of SAMs throughout the carbon matrix. This strategy is also applied to other metal materials (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sb), and features excellent universality. When applied as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, experimental analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that high-loading Sn-N4 active sites significantly optimize electron density distribution and improve reaction kinetics. Consequently, Sn-SAMs@CNR exhibits outstanding durability of 364 mAh g-1   even after 5000 cycles with an impressively low (0.00068%) capacity decay per cycle. This work opens up a universally new avenue for all-region ultrahigh loading of SAMs to carbon matrix for high-performance energy storage.",

In this work, hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) with different shell thickness as a model material to investigate the correlation between the microstructural change and resulting Na+ storage behavior during charge/discharge cycles are designed and synthesized. Ex situ X-ray diffraction and Raman evidences reveal that an interlayer spacing change of the graphitic nanodomains occurs in HCS electrode, leading to a shift of the reversible capacity from the high-potential sloping (HPS) region to the low-potential plateau (LPP) region. This unusual capacity shift suggests a microstructure-dependent Na+ storage reaction on the HCS electrode and can be well explained by \"adsorption-intercalation\" mechanism for these HCS materials. This work strengthens the understanding of the sodium storage behavior and provides a new perspective for the morphological and structural design of hard carbon anode materials for high-performance SIBs.",

Carbon polymer dots (CPDs) are incorporated to prepare three-dimensional (3D) nanoflower-like spheres of MoS2 @CPDs through the self-assembly of MoS2 2D nanosheets, followed by annealing at 700 °C. The CPDs play a main role in the creation of the nanoflower-like spheres and also mitigate the MoS2 nanosheet limitations.

However, the introduction of carbon often leads to a loss in specific capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). In this work, a new perspective is adopted by focusing on improving the “sloping capacity” contribution of carbon (C) in Sb/C composites, rather than solely increasing the platform capacity of Sb as traditionally done. Theoretical predictions indicate that constructing Sb/C composites with high Sb and carbon interfacial areas can provide more Na adsorption sites, thus enhancing the “sloping capacity” of amorphous carbon. Guided by DFT, a rational Sb/C/NSCDs‐2(N) is successfully developed by self‐embedding Sb nanodots into 2D‐amorphous carbon sheets doped with N/S. Sb/C/NSCDs‐2(N) exhibits abundant Sb/carbon interfacial areas and excellent nanoscale effects, demonstrating ideal electrochemical sodium storage performances. Impressively, the Sb/C/NSCDs‐2(N) provides a “sloping capacity” close to 160 mAh g−1. Significantly, owing to the fact that these interfaces and defects are not in direct contact with the electrolyte, the side reaction of electrolyte is effectively inhibited, leading to no decrease of ICE.",

Herein, using pure Sn, an irreversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (SnO), and a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (Sn4P3) as samples, we demonstrate that the pulverization and aggregation of the alloy anode can be partially recovered and the accumulation of pulverization and aggregation during charge/discharge cycles can be terminated using a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction. The cycling stability of three Sn-based anodes increases in order of Sn4P3 > SnO > Sn. The enhancement in Sn4P3 can be attributed to a reversible reaction of Sn4P3 + 9Na ↔ 4Sn + 3Na3P, which repairs the cracks, damage, and aggregation of Sn particles that occurred in the alloy process of 4Sn + 15Na ↔ Na15Sn4 during cycling and, hence, terminates the pulverization. The repair mechanism looks like the self-healing feature in nature, where the damage can be healed by itself. Therefore, the suggested mechanism can be called self-healing, while the repaired anode can be termed as the self-healing anode. The use of self-healing strategies to build an electrode architecture is new and highly desirable because it can increase the cycle life and provide a general approach toward stable electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "We report evidence for the electrochemical activity of transition-metal carbodiimides versus lithium and sodium. In particular, iron carbodiimide, FeNCN, can be efficiently used as negative electrode material for alkali-metal-ion batteries, similar to its oxide analogue FeO. Based on (57)Fe Mössbauer and infrared spectroscopy (IR) data, the electrochemical reaction mechanism can be explained by the reversible transformation of the Fe-NCN into Li/Na-NCN bonds during discharge and charge. These new electrode materials exhibit higher capacity compared to well-established negative electrode references such as graphite or hard carbon. Contrary to its oxide analogue, iron carbodiimide does not require heavy treatments (such as nanoscale tailoring, sophisticated textures, or coating) to obtain long cycle life with current density as high as 9 A g(-1) for hundreds of charge-discharge cycles. Similar to the iron compound, several other transition-metal carbodiimides M(x)(NCN)y with M=Mn, Cr, Zn can cycle successfully versus lithium and sodium. Their electrochemical activity and performance open the way to the design of a novel family of anode materials.",

        "abstract": "Elucidating the macro–micro structures of hard carbon is critical to address the issues of deficient Na+ storage capacity at the anode in Na+ ion batteries. Herein, hard carbon materials with various macro–micro structures were synthesized by pyrolyzing the spores of Calvatia Gigantea (SCG) as precursors treated by a coupling strategy with a dehydration process via concentrated H2SO4 treatment and the removal of inherent Si species by NaOH. Research results demonstrate that the process of concentrated H2SO4 pretreatment can induce the collapse of original hollow spheres of SCG to form specific hard carbon hollow hemispheres, while the NaOH leaching treatment can further modulate the microstructures of hard carbon. Attributed to the unique characteristics of specific hollow hemi-spherical morphology, ultra-low surface area, rich closed pore and appropriate layer spacing, the hard carbon not only exhibits outstanding specific capacity up to 500 mA h g−1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 90.23 % for Na+ storage, but also presents excellent high-rate capability with 254.88 mA h g−1 at 5 A/g and cycling stability with a capacity retention rate of ≥80 % after 4102 cycles. The outstanding performance exceeds the vast majority of reported hard carbons for Na+ storage. Theoretical analysis further reveals that increasing closed pores constructed by distorted graphite-like layers together with proper lattice distance and curvature in hard carbon is essential to improve Na+ storage capacity. The coupling strategy of tuning the morphologies and microstructures of spore-derived hard carbon in the work provides new insights for developing advanced hard carbon with efficient Na+ storage performance.",

        "abstract": "To tune electronic conductivity and improve capacity and stability of hard carbon anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), sulfur (S) atom doping is considered an effective approach. However, the relationship between S-regulation and the surface capacitive behavior is still unclear. This work obtains in-situ S-doped porous carbon materials (SPCs) with S-containing species varying with calcination temperature. This work discovers that S-regulation has a modulating effect on all sodium storage stages: “adsorption-intercalation-pore filling”. In surface-dominated process, C-S, chain sulfur bonds, and C-SO2 bonds with effective negative potentials are considered have higher adsorb capability, providing additional adsorption sites for SPCs. During intercalation stage, the balance between the interlayer spacing and the graphitization degree of SPCs, can promote satisfactory intercalation capacity. Additionally, the S-containing inorganic templates provides sufficient mesopores for SPCs, enabling efficient sodium storage during the pore-filling stage. The SPC carbonized at 600 °C with regulated S-doping provides 260.5 mAh g−1 and 721.4 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 in SIBs and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and shows a high retention of 92.9 % and 95.4 % after 50th in SIBs and LIBs full-cells. This work provides guidance for understanding the contribution of S-regulation to surface-domainted capacitive behavior and designing tailor-made S-regulated carbon anodes.",

        "abstract": "Manganese sulfide (MnS) has gained significant attention as a high capacity and durable anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity and decent redox reversibility. However, sluggish Na+ diffusion and significant volume variation during charge/discharge cycles limited its rate capability and cycling stability. Here, a new MnS/CoS heterojunction embedded in S-doped carbon (MnS/CoS@C) is designed through sulfurization of a bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF). The synergistic effect of heterojunction design and carbon framework encapsulation integrates several benefits, including facilitating ion/electron transport, alleviating volume variation, and preventing the agglomeration of metal sulfide nanoparticles. Therefore, the MnS/CoS@C composite manifests remarkable rate capability (526.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 273.7 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1) and stable long-term cycle life (214.8 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1). Meanwhile, the sodium storage mechanism is examined using in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Coupled with a carbon nanosheet cathode, a prototype sodium-ion capacitor (SIC) has been fabricated. The SIC can achieve a high energy density of 120.7 W h kg-1 and a maximum power density of 12 250 W kg-1, demonstrating the high application potential of the composite for sodium-ion based energy storage systems.",

Electrochemical kinetics test, structure characterization and finite element analysis confirm the double-layer mesoporous hollow spheres structure can provide buffer space to relieve volume expansion of SnSe2 and offer mesoporous channel to promote ions diffusion, thus enhancing cycling stability and rate performance. The full cell SnSe2@N,Se-C//Na3V2(PO4)3 was assembled to verify its potential applications in SIBs, leveraging the enhanced capacity, rate ability, and durability offered by the unique structure of SnSe2 hollow sphere coupled with mesoporous hollow carbon sphere. This work proposes an innovative anode material of SnSe2@N,Se-C for LIBs and SIBs, as same as serving as a valuable reference for the design of double-layer hollow spheres.",

        "abstract": "Since Co_2VO_4 possesses a solid spinel structure and a high degree of stability, it has gained interest as a possible anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, the application of this electrode material is still hampered by its poor electrical conductivity and severe volume expansion. Uniform Co_2VO_4 nanoparticles (CVO) were grown on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a simple solvothermal method to form string-like conductive networks (CVO/CNTs). The flexible and highly conductive three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotubes and small-sized CVO NPs can enhance the rapid transport of electrons, thereby enhancing the conductivity of the composite. String-like conductive network structures have a larger specific surface area, enhancing electron/ion transmission by fully contacting the electrolyte. The findings demonstrate the superior Na^+ storing capability of the CVO/CNTs composite. The battery has a great rate performance (148.2 mAh·g^−1 at 5 A·g^−1) and outstanding long-term cycling performance (147.3 mAh·g^−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A·g^−1).

Herein, ultrafast and long-life sodium storage of metal selenides is rationally demonstrated by employing micron-sized nanosheets (Cu-CoSe@NC) through electron accumulation engineering. The nanosheet structure proves to be effective in reducing the transport distance of sodium ions. Furthermore, the addition of Cu ions enhances the electron conductivity of CoSe and accelerates charge delocalization. As an anode for sodium-ion batteries, Cu-CoSe@NC exhibits a noticeably enhanced specific capacity of 527.2 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Additionally, Cu-CoSe@NC maintains a capacity of 428.5 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 after 800 cycles. It is possible to create sodium-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 101.1 W h kg-1.

        "abstract": "The bismuth anode has garnered significant attention due to its high theoretical Na-storage capacity (386 mAh g-1). There have been numerous research reports on the stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) facilitated by electrolytes utilizing ether solvents. In this contribution, cyclic tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) ethers are employed as solvents to investigate the sodium-ion storage properties of bismuth anodes. A series of detailed characterizations are utilized to analyze the impact of electrolyte solvation structure and SEI chemical composition on the kinetics of sodium-ion storage. The findings reveal that bismuth anodes in both THF and MeTHF-based electrolytes exhibit exceptional rate performance at low current densities, but in THF-based electrolytes, the reversible capacity is higher at high current densities (316.7 mAh g-1 in THF compared to 9.7 mAh g-1 in MeTHF at 50 A g-1). This stark difference is attributed to the formation of an inorganic-rich, thin, and uniform SEI derived from THF-based electrolyte. Although the SEI derived from MeTHF-based electrolyte also consists predominantly of inorganic components, it is thicker and contains more organic species compared to the THF-derived SEI, impeding charge transfer and ion diffusion.

Herein, ZnS/SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) as p-n heterojunctions that are uniformly anchored to reduced graphene oxides (ZnS-SnO2 @rGO) are designed and engineered. Combining the merits of fast electron transport via the internal electric field and a greatly shortened Li/Na ion diffusion pathway in the ZnS/SnO2 QDs (3-5 nm), along with the excellent electrical conductivity and good structural stability provided by the rGO matrix, the ZnS-SnO2 @rGO anode exhibits enhanced electronic and ionic conductivity, which can be proved by both experiments and theoretical calculations. Consequently, the ZnS-SnO2 @rGO anode shows a significantly improved rate performance that simple counterpart composite anodes cannot achieve. Specifically, high reversible specific capacities are achieved for both lithium-ion battery (551 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 , 670 mA h g-1 at 3.0 A g-1 after 1400 cycles) and sodium-ion battery (334 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 , 313 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 after 400 cycles).

The unique microstructure of CrGO provides stability during the sodium storage process and exhibits fast ion capacitive adsorption behavior, enhancing reaction kinetics. CrGO, with an initial reversible capacity of up to 331 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.03 A g−1, achieves a specific capacity of 75 mA h g−1, even at a high current density of 10 A g−1.

However, the cycle stability of micrometer Bi with great commercial potential needs to be improved. Because the large volume change occurs during alloying/dealloying of Bi and sodium (Na) resulting in the crack of Bi, which reduces the stability of the battery. Herein, we design a Bi/Bi2O3@C composite where a double-layer carbon coated commercial micrometer Bi/Bi2O3 particles. The heat generated by Bi/Bi2O3 particles under ultraviolet (UV) exposure (called photothermal effect) accelerates the decomposition rate of photoinitiator, which in turn improves the polymerization rate of the monomer on the surface of Bi/Bi2O3 particles. So that, the surface of Bi/Bi2O3 particles is coated with a dense polymer, while the polymer away from the particle is relatively loose, thus forming a dense-loose double-layer carbon during the annealing process. The dense carbon layer can effectively protect against the volume effect of Bi/Bi2O3, and the loose carbon layer can provide channels for the transport of Na+. As a result, Bi/Bi2O3@C exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention rate of 94.5 % after 1600 cycles at 10 A g−1.",

Comprehensively considering the specific capacities, cycling stability, and rate capability, the optimized x value in Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.3O2-xFx is determined to be 0.05. In the half cells, Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.3O1.95F0.05 (F-0.05) maintains a capacity of 90.5 mA h g-1 in the first cycle at 1.0 A g-1, giving a capacity retention of 78% within 900 cycles. The superior rate capability of F-0.05 is guaranteed by the larger diffusion coefficient of Na+ (DNa) combined with higher charge transfer speed. In addition, when coupled with MoSe2/PC anodes, the full cells also exhibit impressive electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "The metal anode|solid electrolyte interface in sodium-ion batteries has become a critical focus in advancing next-generation batteries. Current interface characterization relies on postmortem analysis, which can compromise the chemical integrity of the interface. In this study, an innovative technique is presented for in situ investigation of the interface under vacuum using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Our findings demonstrate that metallic Na+ ions from the anode can diffuse, inducing charge/discharge cycling through the solid electrolyte, and mimic the behavior of conventional symmetric cells to form an in situ interface. Interface evolution and factors affecting the homogeneity of Na+ ion diffusion were observed, indicating an interphase formation, suggested to be Na2ZrO3, and homogeneity influenced by electrochemical age—inhomogeneous diffusion for non-aged and homogeneous diffusion for aged samples. This work offers an approach to probe interface evolution and sodium plating mechanisms at the metal anode|solid electrolyte interface under different electrochemical conditions.",

In addition, the intercalation chemistry of inorganic NH4+ with this POP is investigated, illustrating that the pyrazine sites in this POP are the redox centers to reversibly combine with NH4+.

Nevertheless, it still has a common bottleneck issue that is the sluggish kinetics of Na+/K+ intercalation, which raises more rigorous requirement on the electrode candidates regarding the morphology, dimension and architecture. Herein, we have constructed the unique MoSe2 based hybrid nanotubes with wall structures composed of highly disordered MoSe2 layers embedded in phosphorus and nitrogen co-doped carbon matrix (denoted as MoSe2⊂PNC-HNTs), by a facile two-step strategy using Se nanorods as the dual-functional template, i.e. shape-directed agent and in-situ selenization resources. Benefitting from the combined features of the 1D hollow interior, hybrid wall structure with high disorder and the phosphorus and nitrogen co-doping induced abundant defect sites in carbon matrix, the MoSe2⊂PNC-HNTs anode exhibits high specific capacity with 280 and 262 mAh g-1 over 200 cycles at the current density of 0.1 A g-1 for Na+ and K+ storage, respectively, and achieves remarkable capacity retention rates of 87.0 % at 2 A g-1 over 3500 cycles for Na-ion storage, and 80.1 % at 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles for K-ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) metal batteries receive increasing attention because of their high energy densities and low costs that are enabled by the abundant Na resources. However, dendritic growth and low efficiency of Na-metal anodes limit the practical applications of Na-metal batteries. Here, we propose a three-dimensionally pillared structure in which carbonized nanoparticles of zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) are sandwiched between reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets (ZIF-8-C@rGO). Such a pillared structure enables two advantages over rGO. First, the sodiation products of ZIF-8 (NaZn13, Na2O, and N-doped carbon) have a strong chemical affinity to Na metal, thereby inducing favorable nucleation of Na metal to guide Na deposition. Second, the pillared structure could facilitate the diffusion of Na ions through rGO sheets and help homogenize the current distribution, leading to a uniform deposition of Na metal. As a result, ZIF-8-C@rGO exhibits a dendrite-free morphology during Na plating/stripping and excellent cycling stability with high Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8% for at least 2000 h. A symmetric cell could maintain more than 4000 h with a stable average overpotential of only 30 mV at a capacity of 1 mA h cm-2. This work demonstrates that the design of a ZIF-pillared structure could combine thermodynamic and kinetic regulating factors to offer an alternative solution to the development of durable Na electrodes for high-performance Na-metal batteries.",

Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium-ion storage, wherein a record-high reversible degree of 85.65% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen-doped carbon-supported single atom Mn (NC-SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In-situ/ex-situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC-SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier.As a result, the nanoreactor-promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra-stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86% after 200 cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two-dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion-type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long-cycled SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides have been expected huge practical potential for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which are mainly owing to their admirable merits of natural abundance, low price, and high theoretical capacity. However, the inferior electrical conductivity and enormous volume variation originating from sodiation/desodiaziton reactions usually result in unsatisfied rate and cycling properties. In this work, a coprecipitation with a following sulfurization method has been rationally designed to prepare the triphasic heterostructured hollow Zn–Sn–S nanoboxes encapsulated by N, S-codoped carbon (ZSS@NCS) as anodes for SIBs. The coexistence of triphasic ZSS heterostructures that consist of ZnS, SnS2, and Sn2S3 effectively facilitates the fast Na + diffusion. The N, S-codoped carbon (NSC) derived from the polydopamine is coated outside of the ZSS heterostructures, which provides infinite affinity between ZSS and NSC that efficiently accelerates the electron transport and maintains the structural stability via the confinement effect. The synergistic effects of the heterostructured ZSS and NSC endow the ZSS@NSC anode with favorable sodium storage properties including decent discharge capacity (683.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), satisfying rate (232.6 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1) and cycling properties (402.2 mAh g−1 over 150 cycles).",

As well as providing efficient channels for charge transfer and diffusion, highly conductive CNTs also have a degree of volume elasticity and excellent electrical conductivity to ensure migration of sodium ions, enabling both fast kinetics and long-term stability.

Furthermore, by combining the ex-situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results, sodium ion storage mechanism of the FMO@CNT electrode obeys a conversion mechanism.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is attractive and cost-effective for energy storage due to the high abundance of sodium. Anodes with complex electrochemical mechanisms significantly impact the performance and safety of battery systems. In recent times, cobalt-based binary metal sulfides have received enormous attention in energy storage applications. However, high volume expansion, limited cycle life, and low initial Coulombic efficiency are major problems of SIB in a practical application perspective. Herein, a novel binder-free electrode is designed by synthesizing polypyrrole-coated zinc cobalt sulfide nanosheets on carbon cloth (PPy/ZnCoS@CC) as the anode of SIB via a hydrothermal process for the first time. The PPy coating on the ZnCoS surface is to control the volume expansion and solve the long-term stability issue. The thickness of PPy on ZnCoS is controlled by using different polymerization reaction times. The optimal PPy/ZnCoS@CC electrode demonstrates a high areal capacity of 2.33 mAh/cm2 at 0.1 mA/cm2 and retains 75% of the areal capacity after 100 cycles. The galvanic intermittent titration technique analysis is also used to measure the diffusion coefficient of anodes.

Benefitting from these advantages, (CoSn)S/C composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 463 mAh g−1 and superior durability (368 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 1000 cycles).

Na+-coordination effect assistants the dissolution of Na2S, further delocalizing Na2S from the reaction interface under the function of electric field, which leads to the solo oxidation of the discharge product element metal without the participation of Na2S. Besides, the higher highest occupied molecular orbital of Na2S suggest the facilitated Na2S solo oxidation to produce sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Based on these, lowering the Na+ concentration of the electrolyte is proposed as a potential improvement strategy to change the coordination environment of Na2S, suppressing the side reactions of the solo-oxidation of element metal and Na2S. Consequently, the enhanced conversion reaction reversibility and prolonged cycle life are achieved. This work renders in-depth perception of failure mechanism and inspiration for realizing advanced conversion-type anode.",

        "abstract": "Due to abundant resources and low prices, biomass-derived carbons as anodes for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been widely reported. However, it is still a challenge to design a biomass-derived carbon material that has immunity to environmental influences, stable chemical composition and controllable morphology. In this paper, tannic acid (TA) as a precursor is first reported to synthesize rod structures with abundant mesopores and defects (PTA-700). These features can provide more active sites and space for lithium and sodium ions storage, which is conducive to lithium and sodium ions transfer. Excellent electrochemical performance is observed in LIBs (535 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.1 A/g) and SIBs (114.0 mAh/g after 3000 cycles at 1 A/g). Kinetics analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to further analyze the superior lithium and sodium ions storage performance of PTA-700. More importantly, PTA-700 solves many problems faced by traditional biomass-derived carbons in commercialization. Our work suggests an effective way to develop high-performance biomass-derived carbon anode materials for LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Compared to the scarce resources of lithium-ion batteries, sodium ion batteries have gradually become an ideal carrier for large-scale energy storage systems due to their abundant raw material resources. In recent years, hard carbon as an anode material for sodium ion batteries has attracted much attention. Biomass materials have become an ideal hard carbon precursor due to their natural and renewable advantages. This article evaluates the effect of hard carbon derived from three types of biomass waste (peanut shell, coffee grounds, and sugarcane bagasse) on the electrochemical performance of sodium ion batteries through pre carbonization pyrolysis method. The three materials exhibit different structures and surface functional group contents. Compared with coffee grounds and sugarcane bagasse, peanut shell-derived hard carbon has lower structural ordering and smaller specific surface area, and exhibits a higher initial Coulombic efficiency of 53.84 %. The initial reversible capacity of the HC-P electrode is 203.6 mAh/g, and the Coulombic efficiency of the electrode is close to 100 % with a reversible capacity of 127.1 mAh/g and a capacity retention of 81.4 % after cycling 100 at 1C current. The excellent electrochemical properties of HC-P can be attributed to its higher C=O bond content, larger layer spacing and lamellar structure.",

        "abstract": "The combination of the high-power density of supercapacitors and the high energy density of batteries makes hybrid sodium-ion capacitors (HSICs) a promising device. HSICs can provide better performance characteristics by harnessing both ion adsorption/desorption in the capacitor-type electrode and sodium-ion intercalation in the battery-type electrode. Here, the synthesis of MXene (Ti3C2Tx), a two-dimensional (2D) carbide and nitride is reported. Delaminated MXene (D-Ti3C2Tx) is a promising candidate for anode material in HSIC due to its large surface area (∼ 42 m2/g) and good electronic conductivity. Electrochemical study indicates that D-Ti3C2Tx anode exhibits a high discharge capacity of ∼213 mAh/g at a current rate of 20 mA/g. Further the presodiated D-Ti3C2Tx anode is paired with Na [Ni0.60Mn0.35Co0.05] O2 (P2-NMC) cathode to obtain the configuration of HSIC. The HSIC exhibits good specific capacitance of ∼187 F/g and specific discharge capacity of ∼110 mAh/g at a current density of 10 mA/g, according to the electrochemical analysis. A notable improvement in specific energy density (∼ 256 Wh/kg) and specific power density (∼579 W/kg) is also demonstrated by the HSIC. With P2-NMC being used as the cathode material rather than traditional activated carbon, there has been a rise in specific energy density.",

The increase of the reactivity of the radical intermediates is desirable to maximize the capacity and enhance the rate capability but is detrimental to cycling stability. Therefore, it is a great challenge to controllably balance the redox reactivity and stability of radical intermediates to optimize the electrochemical properties with a good combination of high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long-term cycle life. Herein, we reported the redox and tunable stability of radical intermediates in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) considered as high capacity and stable anode for sodium-ion batteries. The comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulation confirmed that the redox of C-O· and α-C radical intermediates play an important role in the sodiation/desodiation process. Specifically, the stacking behavior could be feasibly tuned by the thickness of 2D COFs, essentially determining the redox reactivity and stability of the α-C radical intermediates and their contributive capacity. The modulation of reversible redox chemistry and stabilization mechanism of radical intermediates in COFs offers a novel entry to design novel high performance organic electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) metal is regarded as an ideal anode for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, its utilization is still restricted by the notorious dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, a zinc nanoparticle decorated 2D diamond (diamane) modulated commercial polypropylene (Zn‐diamane/PP) separator is dedicated to mitigating these issues for the longevity of sodium metal anodes. Interestingly, the sodiophilic Zn‐diamane/PP separator significantly accelerates the sodium ion mobilization and promotes a uniform flux, thus effectively preventing dendrite growth and enhancing the stability of the SEI layer. A Na||Na symmetric cell with Zn‐diamane/PP separator demonstrates a prolonged lifespan exceeding 5000 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2. Notably, it sustains stability for >1000 h at an ultra‐high current density at 25 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2. The dendrite‐free deposition morphology and the formation of an inorganic‐rich inner SEI layer have been investigated through comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations analysis. Furthermore, a full cell comprising a Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode, Zn‐diamane/PP separator, and Na metal anode demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 90 mAh g−1 over 500 cycles. These results demonstrate the potential of Zn‐diamane/PP separator for long‐cycle lifespan SMBs.",

        "abstract": "One of the most demanding goals in the field of Na-ion batteries is to find an appropriate anode material that delivers high capacities and can endure numerous cycles without structural degradation. Antimony stands out with a theoretical capacity of 660 mAh·g\n                     −1 and relatively high electrical conductivity. However, its challenges are pulverization and degradation of its microstructure due to volume changes. In this work, we used a solvothermal reaction to synthesize the composite material Sb/Sb4O5Cl2/C, which is made of Sb with branch-shaped morphology and Sb4O5Cl2 with cuboids-shaped morphology. The mechanism of the (de)sodiation of the composite material was analyzed both through operando and ex-situ measurements: X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, dilatometry, and online electrochemical mass spectrometry. The results show great mechanical integrity of the electrode, ensured by a lot of space for volume changes in the branch-shaped microstructure, buffered expansion/contraction by the amorphous matrix (sodiated Sb4O5Cl2), and high electronic conductivity, thanks to carbon. The microstructural features and the multistep (de)sodiation mechanism of the Sb/Sb4O5Cl2/C composite result in excellent cycling stabilities.",

The Mn3O4 obtained exhibits a unique architecture, consisting of small clusters composed of numerous tiny nanoparticles. The Mn3O4 material could deliver high capacity (522 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1), reasonable cyclic stability (158 mAh g–1 after 200 cycles), and good rate capability (73 mAh g–1 at 1000 mA g–1) even without further carbon coating, which is a common exercise for most anode materials so far. The sodium insertion/extraction was also confirmed by a reversible conversion reaction by adopting an ex situ X-ray diffraction technique.

The coating of the carbon layer could effectively relieve structural strains stemmed from the large volume change and improve electrical conductivity. More importantly, by skillfully constructing the heterostructure, an internal electric field formed on the heterointerface provides a rapid diffusion of ion and charge. As a consequence, the BMS@NC composite showed excellent electrochemical performance for both sodium-ion batteries (a capacity of 381.5 mA h g-1 achieved at a current density of 5.0 A g-1 and 412 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 400 cycles) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) (a high specific capacity of 382.8 mA h g-1 achieved after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1).

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its sodium storage mechanisms in terms of crystal structure transformation during sodiation/de-sodiation processes are far from clear. Here, by analyzing the redox thermodynamics and kinetics under near-equilibrium states, we observe, for the first time, that upon Na-ion uptake, the anatase TiO2 undergoes a phase transition and then an irreversible crystal structure disintegration. Additionally, unlike previous theoretical studies which investigate only the two end points of the sodiation process (i.e., TiO2 and NaTiO2), we study the progressive crystal structure changes of anatase TiO2 upon step-by-step Na-ion uptake (NaxTiO2, x = 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) for the first time. It is found that the anatase TiO2 goes through a thermodynamically unstable intermediate phase (Na0.25TiO2) before reaching crystalline NaTiO2, confirming the inevitable crystal structure disintegration during sodiation. These combined experimental and theoretical studies provide new insights into the sodium storage mechanisms of TiO2 and are expected to provide useful information for further improving the performance of TiO2-based anodes for SIB applications.",

The combined precursors with a tunable cross-linked structure prefer to generate a large interlayer spacing (0.399 nm) and abundant closed pore structure by suppressing the graphitization of precursors during the carbonization, relative to the individual precursor, which contributes greatly to the ion diffusion kinetics. Benefiting from the unique structure, HCMS exhibits an impressively high reversible specific capacity of 373.4 mA h g-1 in SIBs and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88%, retaining 90.2% of the initial capacity even after 150 cycles, which presented comparable capacities with commercial graphite in lithium-ion batteries. Besides, excellent rate capability was also demonstrated with HCMSs (250 and 117 mA h g-1 at 300 and 600 mA g-1). Notably, the interlayer distance and closed pore structure are tunable just by adjusting the ratio of the two precursors. The tunable and extendable fabrication process, together with its amazing high carbon yield of 48 wt % (1400 °C) and high tap density close to 0.8 g cm-3, makes this strategy promising in the practical application for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Solid-state sodium-ion batteries are attracting great attention due to their high energy density and high safety. However, the Na dendrite growth and poor wettability between sodium and electrolytes seriously limit its application. Herein, we designed a stable and dendrite-suppressed quasi-liquid alloy interface (C@Na-K) for solid sodium-ion batteries (SSIBs). The batteries exhibit excellent electrochemical performance thanks to better wettability and accelerated charge transfer and nucleation mode shifts. The thickness of the liquid phase alloy interface fluctuates along with the exotherm of the cell cycling process, which leads to better rate performance. The symmetrical cell can cycle steadily over 3500 h at 0.1 mA/cm2 at room temperature, and the critical current density can reach 2.6 mA/cm2 at 40 °C. The full cells with the quasi-liquid alloy interface also show outstanding performance; the capacity retention can reach 97.1%, and the average Coulombic efficiency can reach 99.6% of the battery at 0.5 C even after 300 cycles. These results proved the feasibility of using a liquid alloy interface of the anode for high-energy SSIBs, and this innovative approach to stabilizing the interface performance could serve as a basis for the development of next-generation high-energy SSIBs.",

        "title": "Unlocking the potential of a chemically modified blue phosphorene as anode materials for high-performance sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Blue phosphorene (Blu-Pn) has recently been identified as a new two-dimensional (2D) form of black phosphorus via the epitaxial growth method and has shown the ability to host a substantial amount of Na while serving as an anode in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, its structural instability is an issue that hinders its further exploitability in NIBs. In this paper, we propose to chemically modify the Blu-Pn network by substituting six phosphorus atoms with a carbon source in the form of a C6 ring, constructing a new and robust CP2 nanosheet. Based on the state-of-the-art non-local van der Waals corrected density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations, we systematically explore the feasibility of the designed CP2 as a potential anode material for NIBs. Adding a C6 ring in the Blu-Pn lattice reduces its energy gap from 2 eV to 1.3 eV, which disappears after Na adsorption, indicating a conductive character. Attributed to the synergistic effect, the adsorption energy of Na on CP2 nanosheet (−2.22 eV) is greatly decreased in comparison to the pristine carbon source (e.g., graphene with −0.78 eV) and pristine Blu-Pn (−1.85 eV). The Na diffusivity on CP2 at 300 K is predicted to be 4.90 × 10−11 m2/s by AIMD. The specific capacity is up to 604.1 mAh/g, which exceeds that of the commercialized graphite anode (372 mA h/g). Ultimately, the designed electrode provides a small open circuit potential of 0.66 V that falls within a desirable voltage range. This work paves the way for exploring Blu-Pn 2D anode materials for NIBs technology and provides valuable insights into surface chemical modification towards the long-term stability of Blu-Pn.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have attracted increasing attention as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Cobalt phosphide (CoP) has been deemed as prospective anode materials owing to its high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, the defects of cobalt phosphides are evident. Low conductivity, the non-negligible volume expansion and aggregation of particles during sodiation/desodiation process result in poor cycling performance and rapid capacity decay, which greatly limit their applications. Herein, we designed a hollow-nanotube structure of sulfur-doped cobalt phosphide (S-CoP) nanoparticles coated by nitrogen-doped porous carbon (S-CoP@NPC), which can be successfully synthesized via an ordinary hydrothermal process followed by the low-temperature phosphorization/sulfuration treatment. The doping of sulfur element provides more active sites, meanwhile, the carbon coating largely helps to avoid the agglomeration of nanoparticles, alleviate volume expansion and improve the conductivity of materials. The S-CoP@NPC composite presents stable cycling performance, showing a discharge specific capacity of 230 mAh g−1 over 370 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. In addition, it also exhibits good rate capability with a discharge specific capacity of 143 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1, even when the current density returns to 0.2 A g−1, the discharge specific capacity can recover 213 mAh g−1. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of S-CoP@NPC composite explains that the excellent cycling and rate performance benefit from the extrinsic pseudocapacitive behavior.",

While developing high-capacity nanosized metal sulfides, issues like low stability and rapid initial capacity decline are common.

We introduce CNT-Cu2S, featuring Cu2S nanoplates integrated onto the surface of MWCNTs, and assess its electrochemical properties for SIBs. Cu2S initially exhibited a rapid decrease in capacity and then showed increased capacity. In contrast, CNT-Cu2S demonstrated a stable capacity of 344.8 mAh g–1 at 2.0 A g–1 over 800 cycles, close to the theoretical capacity with capacitive behavior. This paper carried out analysis using data from in situ EIS and overpotential data from GITT to explain the different outcomes between the Cu2S and CNT-Cu2S experiments.

        "abstract": "The exploitation of electrode materials with ability to balance capacity and kinetics between cathode and anode is a challenge for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs). Mn-based anode materials are limited by poor electrical conductivity, sluggish reaction kinetics, large volume variation, weak cycling stability, and inferior reversible capacity. Herein, MnS nanocubes encapsulated in S-doped porous carbon matrix (MSC) with strong sulfur-bridged bond interactions (CSMn) are successfully synthesized by solvent-free tactics. The CSMn bonds generated between MnS and carbon significantly inhibit the aggregation of nanostructural MnS cubes, restrict the volume expansion, and stabilize the nanostructure, which improves the Na+ storage reversibility and stability. Moreover, S-doped porous carbon enhances the electrical conductivity and electrons/ions diffusion rate, which boosts a fast kinetic reaction. As expected, MSC anode presents an outstanding reversible capacity of 600 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and a long-term stable capacity of 357 mAh g-1 for 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g-1 in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

The optimal SnS2 and U/s-SnS2 anodes respectively show the specific capacities of 187.7 and 326.3 mAh/g at 1.6 A/g. After 100 cycles, the U/s-SnS2 anode still attains specific capacities of 308.7 and 438.9 mAh/g at 1.0 and 0.1 A/g corresponding to capacity retentions of 74.5% and 80.1%, respectively. The excellent rate performance and cycling stability of the U/s-SnS2 anode are attributed to the smaller charge-transfer resistance and the larger Na+ diffusion coefficient. This work successfully brings a blueprint for adopting several useful strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of SnS2. The effects for all parameters are also carefully explained.",

        "abstract": "Alloy‐type anodes are of interest for their resource‐rich and high theoretical capacity performance in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, severe volume expansion may lead to rapid capacity decay and electrode pulverization. In this work, metallic Bi with better structure stability is rationally selected as a skeleton to form a 2D BiSb alloy to alleviate the volume expansion. Interestingly, by combining in‐situ XRD and ex‐situ TEM characterizations, a reversible multi‐step alloying sodium storage mechanism of BiSb ↔ Na(Bi, Sb) ↔ Na3(Bi, Sb) in Bi0.4Sb0.6 anode is elucidated, and the partial amorphization and expanded interlayer spacing of BiSb alloy is also revealed, which greatly alleviate volume expansion thereby enhancing electrochemical stability. Furthermore, density functional theory and kinetic calculations demonstrate that Bi0.4Sb0.6 demonstrates lower Na+ adsorption energy and Na+ diffusion energy barriers, ensuring fast electron and ion transportation during sodium storage. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of binary alloy, Bi0.4Sb0.6 exhibits a high reversible capacity and cycling stability of 446 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 70% high capacity after 1100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1.

In this work, switchgrass as a biomass example was carbonized under an ultrahigh temperature, 2050 °C, induced by Joule heating to create hard carbon anodes for sodium ion batteries. Switchgrass derived carbon materials intrinsically inherit its three-dimensional porous hierarchical architecture, with an average interlayer spacing of 0.376 nm. The larger interlayer spacing than that of graphite allows for the significant Na ion storage performance. Compared to the sample carbonized under 1000 °C, switchgrass derived carbon at 2050 °C induced an improved initial Coulombic efficiency. Additionally, excellent rate capability and superior cycling performance are demonstrated for the switchgrass derived carbon due to the unique high temperature treatment.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials have attracted considerable attention as anodes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. This work reports an advanced carbon nanostructure that takes advantage of the chelation effect of glucose and metal ions, which ensures the uniform dispersion of metal in the precursor. Thus, an effective catalytic conversion from sp3 to sp2 carbon occurs, enabling simultaneously formation of pores with catalyzed graphitic structures. Due to the low carbonization temperature and short carbonization time as well as the different catalytic degree of various metals, a series of expanded graphitic layers from 0.34 to 0.44 nm with defects and amorphous carbon structure are obtained. The structure not only offers accessible graphitic spacings for reversible lithium/sodium ion insertion, but also provides abundant active sites for lithium/sodium ion adsorption in the defects and amorphous structure. Moreover, the hierarchical interconnected porous structure combining graphitic ribbons is beneficial for fast electronic/ionic transport and favorable electrolyte permeation. More importantly, such advanced carbon materials prove their feasibility for balancing the pore structure and degree of graphitization. When serving as the electrode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, excellent electrochemical performance along with fast kinetics and long cycle life is achieved.",

        "abstract": "In hard carbon (HC) anodes, elucidating the relationship between the solid electrolyte interphase formation and the solvated Na+ co-intercalation mechanism is crucial, particularly considering different anionic salts in ether-based electrolytes. Here, we comprehensively explore the impact of different anionic salts on the electrochemical performance of HC/Na half-cell and elucidate the underlying mechanism through experimental studies and theoretical calculations. The surface morphology of the HC anode and its interphasial property are further investigated to evaluate the differences endowed by the presence of various anionic salts in diglyme (2G). The HC/Na half-cells with NaPF6-2G and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3)-2G display superior electrochemical performance with faster kinetics and lower interfacial resistance than those with NaClO4-2G, sodium bis-(fluorosulfonyl) imide (NaFSI)-2G and sodium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (NaTFSI)-2G. NaClO4-2G forms a relatively thick interphase layer with high resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface owing to its insufficient stability. NaFSI-2G and NaTFSI-2G exhibit severe side reactions with Na metal, producing a thick interphase layer on the HC surface with high interfacial resistance from excess electrolyte decomposition, thus deteriorating the electrochemical performance. In summary, the study on the stability of different anionic salts in ether-based electrolyte for the HC anode with the intercalation mechanism provides valuable insights for screening appropriate conductive salts for high-performance sodium-ion batteries, especially when considering Na metal counter/reference electrodes.",

Moreover, making full use of the stepwise redox reactions of Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+, this cathode reveals excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 85.4% after 2500 cycles at 10 C. Matching with commercial hard carbon anodes, the assembled full cell keeps a capacity retention of 92.1% with the Coulombic efficiency close to 100% after 600 cycles at 1 C.

        "abstract": "Sodium iron phosphate (NaFePO4) has attracted significant attention because of its high theoretical capacity (155 mA h g−1), remarkable structural stability, and abundant elemental composition. However, the electrochemical reversibility of maricite NaFePO4 is generally considered inactive. Herein, a nanoengineering strategy to activate the electrochemical activity of maricite NaFePO4 is presented. This approach involves the construction of ultrasmall maricite NaFePO4 nanoparticles encapsulated within an ultrathin carbon layer (denoted as m‐NFP@C), which greatly improves the electrochemical properties of the material. Notably, the optimized m‐NFP@C nanoparticles exhibit an impressive reversible capacity of 101.4 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g−1, demonstrating a remarkable capacity retention of 90.5%. Furthermore, when coupled with the bismuth–carbon microfoam‐like compound (Bi@NC‐MF) anode, the fabricated sodium‐ion full cell exhibits exceptional cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90.6% over 250 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical performance of this material can be attributed to its excellent structural stability, ultrafine nanostructure, and uniform carbon coating, which effectively shorten the Na+ diffusion pathways, prevent the aggregation and fragmentation of nanoparticles, and enhance electronic conductivity. This work is anticipated to open up a new route for activating maricite NaFePO4 and advancing the development of polyanion‐type electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal trithiophosphates (TMPS3, TM = Mn, Fe, Co, etc.) with high theoretical capacity (>1 300 mAh g-1) are potential anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the strong bonding between P2 dimers and S atoms in TMPS3 hinders the efficient alloying reaction between P2 dimers and Na+, resulting in practical capacities much lower than theoretical values. Herein, a polar molecule diisopropylamine (DIPA) is intercalated into MnPS3 for the first time to improve the sodium storage performance effectively. Theoretical calculations show that the electron transfer between DIPA and MnPS3 induces more delocalized S p states and weaker P─S bonds, significantly enhancing the electrochemical activity and sodiation/desodiation reaction kinetics. Moreover, the expanded interlayer spacing from 6.48 to 10.75 Å enables faster Na+ diffusion and more active sites for Na+ adsorption. As expected, the DIPA-MnPS3 exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of 1,023 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and excellent cycling performance (≈100% capacity retention after 4 200 cycles at 10 A g-1), far outperforming those metal thiophosphates anodes reported for SIBs.

        "title": "Amorphous Fe2O3/Graphene Composite Nanosheets with Enhanced Electrochemical Performance for Sodium-Ion Battery.",
        "abstract": "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Nanoscale Sn-based alloy materials are high-performance anode materials for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), however, the insertion and extraction of Li+/Na+ during the charging and discharging process can lead to dramatic expansion of the electrode volume as well as collapse and crushing of the structure. Therefore, we successfully synthesized a new mesoporous Sn/SnO2-Ni@C composite anode material. Mesoporous Sn/SnO2-Ni@C has excellent electrochemical properties and can reach large reversible capacities after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g\n                     −1 (LIBs: 1020.7 mAh g\n                     −1, SIBs: 342.6 mAh g\n                     −1) as well as remarkable stability after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g\n                     −1 (LIBs: 864.6 mAh g\n                     −1, SIBs: 219.3 mAh g\n                     −1). In addition, mesoporous Sn/SnO2-Ni@C also has outstanding rate performance (LIBs: 564.6 mAh g\n                     −1 at 5.0 A g\n                     −1, SIBs: 212.5 mAh g\n                     −1 at 1.0 A g\n                     −1). In particular, the unique mesoporous structure not only provides additional transport channels for Li+/Na+ and electrons, but also enables the electrode material to be fully immersed in the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between Sn/SnO2-Ni alloy can prevent shuttle effect and alleviate volume expansion, the presence of Ni can prevent the coarsening of Sn. Thus, mesoporous Sn/SnO2-Ni@C has fast kinetics and is a promising anode material for LIBs/SIBs.",

But the increased ceramic filler mass fraction decreases the flexibility, which increases the interfacial resistance. To alleviate interfacial resistance further, a gradient composite electrolyte (GCE) using a Sc, Ge-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) as the ceramic filler and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the polymer matrix is proposed. The outer layer contains a low concentration of ceramic filler to improve interfacial contact, and the central layer contains a high concentration of ceramic filler to inhibit dendrite penetration. This GCE possesses an enhanced conductivity (4.0 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 30 °C) and a reduced interfacial resistance. Furthermore, the safety was boosted using Sn4P3@CNT/C as the high-capacity anode active material and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode active material.

Ni0.85 Se/C hollow nanowires are employed as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, and their electrochemical performance is evaluated via the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy combined with ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. It is found that Ni0.85 Se/C hollow nanowires exhibit greatly enhanced cycle stability and rate capability as compared to Ni0.85 Se nanoparticles, with a reversible capacity around 390 mA h g-1 (the theoretical capacity is 416 mA h g-1 ) at the rate of 0.2 C and 97% capacity retention after 100 cycles. When the current rate is raised to 5 C, they still deliver capacity of 219 mA h g-1 .

        "abstract": "The layered bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl), with a theoretical capacity of 618 mAh g−1, offers advantages such as favorable redox potential and efficient sodium ion diffusion pathways. However, its performance is impeded by the limited electrical conductivity and significant volume changes during cycling. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Mn-doped BiOCl nanosheets (Mn-BiOCl) as a hopeful anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The incorporation of Mn into the BiOCl structure strengthens the Mn-O bonds and enhances the stability of sodium ion adsorption, as validated by density functional theory calculations. This modification leads to improved capacity and superior electrochemical stability. In-situ XRD analysis reveals that Mn-BiOCl experiences an irreversible conversion reaction to Na3Bi during the initial discharge cycle, followed by an invertible alloying and dealloying process between Bi and NaBi/Na3Bi in subsequent cycles. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that Mn-BiOCl delivers an impressive capacity of 347.8 mAh g−1, with 79.1 % capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1, highlighting its exceptional durability for practical applications. Furthermore, a full cell incorporating Mn-BiOCl as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode achieves a notable energy density of 250.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 783 W kg−1. This study presents an innovative approach for identifying effective anode materials for SIBs.",

We explore the microstructure and electrochemical performance of ASIC materials synthesized at various pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 700 to 1400 °C. ASIC-9, pyrolyzed at 900 °C, exhibits multilayer stacked sheets with the highest specific surface area, and the least lateral size and stacking height. ASIC-14, pyrolyzed at 1400 °C, demonstrates the most ordered carbon structure with the least defect concentration and the highest stacking height and an increased lateral size. ASIC-9 achieves the highest capacities (676 mAh/g at 0.134C) and rate performance (94 mAh/g at 13.4C) for hosting Li+ ions, while ASIC-14 exhibits superior electrochemical performance for hosting Na+ ions, maintaining a high specific capacity after 300 cycles with over 99.5% Coulombic efficiency.

These layers provide uniform seeding sites with high sodiophilicity and support fast ion transport.

        "abstract": "Semicoke, a coal pyrolysis product, is a cost‐effective and high‐yield precursor for hard carbon used as anode in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, as a thermoplastic precursor, semicoke inevitably graphitizes during high‐temperature carbonization, so it is not easy to form the hard carbon structure. Herein, we propose an oxidation‐crosslinking strategy to realize fusion‐to‐solid‐state pyrolysis of semicoke. The semicoke is first preoxidized using a modified alkali‐oxygen oxidation method to enrich its surface with carboxyl groups, which are localization points and the cross‐linking reactions occur with citric acid to build the semicoke precursor with homogeneous and abundant ‐C‐(O)–O‐ groups (up to 21 at% oxygen content). The ‐C‐(O)–O‐ groups effectively prevent the rearrangement of carbon microcrystals in semicoke during carbonization, resulting in the formation of an abundant pseudographite structure with larger carbon interlayer spacing and micropores. The optimized semicoke‐based hard carbon shows both a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81% and a specific capacity of 307 mAh g−1, with low‐voltage plateau capacity increased to 2.5 times, compared to that of the unmodified semicoke carbon. By the combination of detailed discharge curves and in situ X‐ray diffraction analysis, the plateau capacity of semicoke‐based hard carbon is mainly derived from interlayer intercalation of Na+ ion. The proposed oxidation‐crosslinking strategy can contribute to the usage of low‐cost and high‐performance hard carbons in advanced SIBs.",

However, the sluggish kinetics of Se cathodes and the unpredictable metal electrodeposition of Na at the anode remain critical challenges. In this work, we reveal the catalytic effect of atomic Fe on the conversion of polyselenides (SPSs) to Na2Se by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Then, we prepare a lignin-derived flexible porous carbon matrix loaded with atomic Fe (Fe-BC/rGO, BC: lignin-derived porous carbon material; rGO: reduced graphene oxide) as a Se host to further verify the DFT calculation results. Due to the encapsulation of Se into the porous carbon matrix, the catalytic effect of atomic Fe on the conversion of SPSs to Na2Se and the continuous electron/ion transportation path, the prepared Se@Fe-BC/rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 213 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1, which is much better than the electrochemical performance of a Se cathode without atomic Fe loading (Se@BC/rGO). In addition, we further reveal the advantageous effect of the presence of the Fe-BC/rGO film in regulating the interfacial Na electrodeposition at the anode. Due to the porous structure and the catalytic effect of atomic Fe, a very low nucleation overpotential of 15.3 mV is achieved at a current density of 1 mA cm-2, which is much lower than that of the BC/rGO film. Therefore, this work provides a low-cost and sustainable strategy for simultaneously solving the challenges of the Se cathode and the Na metal anode for future Na-Se batteries.",

        "abstract": "Solid sodium-ion batteries (SSIBs) are considered as one of the promising energy storage systems because of their high safety and high energy density. However, the sodium metal anode presents poor wettability with a solid electrolyte, resulting in high interface impedance and dendrite growth, which severely limits their application in practice. Herein, a novel liquid film (Na-BP) interface is constructed between sodium and solid electrolyte (Na3Hf2Si2PO12) with an excellent kinetic mass transfer ability and good fluidity, which could guarantee a close contact and fast charge transfer at interface. The symmetric cells with the designed interface show a high-rate and long-cycle performance and could cycle stably more than 1000 and 700 h at 0.2 and 0.5 mA cm-2, respectively. The critical current density of the cells can reach 3.6 mA cm-2 at room temperature, which is the highest value in similar works.",

Herein, we report an ultrathin SEI (3-4 nm) induced by Cu+-tailored double electrical layer (EDL) to suppress electrolyte consumption and enhance cycling stability of CuS anode in sodium-ion batteries. Unique EDL with SO3CF3-Cu complex absorbing on CuS in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte is demonstrated by in-situ surface-enhanced Raman, Cyro-TEM and theoretical calculation, in which SO3CF3-Cu could be reduced to CuF2-rich SEI. Dispersed CuF2 and F-containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption and reduce activation energy of Na+ transport. As a result, the modified CuS delivers high capacity of 475 mAh g-1 after 7000 cycles without capacity decay. The insights of SEI construction pave a way for high-stability electrode.",

In this study, a facile activation and annealing process combined with freeze drying and KOH treatment was used to successfully prepare nitrogen-doped onion-derived carbon materials (dried onion (DO) and freeze-dried onion (FDO)) with high specific surface areas. The obtained carbon materials exhibited excellent electrochemical performances as anodes for SIBs, delivering high discharge reversible capacities of 140.5 (DO) and 151.4 (FDO) mAh/g at a current density of 0.05 A/g after 30 cycles.

The structural evolution, reaction mechanism, and reaction dynamics of hybrid electrodes during the sodium insertion/desertion process are carefully investigated. In situ synchrotron X‐ray powder diffraction (SXRD) characterization is performed and the result indicates that Na+ inserts into tunnel structure with occurring solid solution reaction and intercalates into Na2Ti3O7 structure with appearing a phase transition in a low voltage. The reaction dynamics reveals that sodium ion diffusion of tunnel Na2Ti6O13 is faster than that of layered Na2Ti3O7.

Nevertheless, poor active reaction dynamics, dissolution of intermediates and electrolyte matching problems are significant challenges that need to be solved. Herein, dimensional gradient structure of sheet–tube–dots is constructed with CoSe_2@CNTs–MXene. Gradient structure is conducive to fast migration of electrons and ions with the association of ether electrolyte. For half-cell, CoSe_2@CNTs–MXene exhibits high initial coulomb efficiency (81.7%) and excellent cycling performance (400 mAh g^−1 cycling for 200 times in 2 A g^−1). Phase transformation pathway from crystalline CoSe_2–Na_2Se with Co and then amorphous CoSe_2 in the discharge/charge process is also explored by in situ X-ray diffraction. Density functional theory study discloses the CoSe_2@CNTs–MXene in ether electrolyte system which contributes to stable sodium storage performance owing to the strong adsorption force from hierarchical structure and weak interaction between electrolyte and electrode interface. For full cell, CoSe_2@CNTs–MXene//Na_3V_2 (PO_4)_3/C full battery can also afford a competitively reversible capacity of 280 mAh g^−1 over 50 cycles. Concisely, profiting from dimensional gradient structure and matched electrolyte of CoSe_2@CNTs–MXene hold great application potential for stable sodium storage.

In this paper, the NiP 2 nanoparticles encapsulated in three-dimensional graphene (NiP 2 @rGO) were obtained from the flower-like sphericalα-Ni(OH) 2 by phosphating and carbon encapsulation processes. When used as a sodium-ion batteries anode material, NiP 2 @rGO composite shows excellent cycling performance (117 mA h g -1 at 10 A g -1 after 8000 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical performance of NiP 2 @rGO is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the rGO and NiP 2 core. The rGO wrapped on the NiP 2 nanoparticles build a conductive way, improving ionic and electronic conductivity. The effective combination of NiP 2 nanoparticles with graphene greatly reduces the NiP 2 nanoparticles aggregation and pulverization during the discharge/charge process.

The physico-chemical encapsulation geometry of graphene and N-doped C is conductive to acquiring excellent electrode integrity by accommodating large lattice strain, as well as boosting fast electrochemical kinetics process by dispelling the band gap and decreasing Na-ion diffusion barrier.

On the basis of the comprehension of the Na-ion storage mechanism, the behavior is demonstrated to be related with the gradual formation of amorphous phase resulting from the phase transition during discharge. In addition, the level of phase transition is determined by the discharge rates and cycle numbers, which strongly affects the electrochemical performance of anatase TiO2. Via a quick formation process of the amorphous phase in the initial cycles, the capacity activation is accelerated, and high initial capacity is achieved with no fading after 500 cycles. Particularly, anatase TiO2 displays surprisingly unique properties in the fast charge (even at 20 C, 6.7 A g-1) mode, delivering a 179 mA h g-1 charge capacity. This study is significant for the comprehensive understanding of the controversial sodium storage mechanisms and unclear special behaviors occurring in anatase TiO2, thus greatly contributing to better guidance on the computational studies and experiment technologies for further performance promotion.",

The abundant pores and defects of the CK anode can improve the ICE and rate performance of SIBs in ether-based electrolytes, whereas they are confined in carbonate ester-based electrolytes. Notably, ether-based electrolytes enable CK anode to possess excellent ICE (82.9%) and high-rate capability (111.2 mAh g-1 at 50 A g-1). Even after 5500 cycles at a large current density of 10 A g-1, the capacity retention can still be maintained at 73.1%. More importantly, the full cell consisting of the CK anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode delivers a high energy density of 204.4 Wh kg-1, with a power density of 2828.2 W kg-1. Such outstanding performance of the CK anode is attributed to (1) hierarchical pores, oxygen doping, and defects that pave the way for the transportation and storage of Na+, further enhancing ICE; (2) a high-proportion NaF-based solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) layer that facilitates Na+ storage kinetics in ether-based electrolytes; and (3) ether-based electrolytes that determine Na+ storage kinetics further to dominate the performance of SIBs. These results provide compelling evidence for the promising potential of our synthetic strategy in the development of carbon-based materials and ether-based electrolytes for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, stable sodium plating/stripping has been achieved on bare aluminium current collector, without any surface modifications or artificial SEI deposition. The crucial role of pre-deposited sodium using cyclic voltammetry on bare aluminium as a matrix for plating/stripping has been highlighted using different protocols for cycling. The pre-deposition strategy ensures stable and efficient cycling of sodium in anode-free sodium batteries without dendritic formations. The study highlights the difference of sodium plating/stripping in carbonate and glyme solvent electrolytes on the bare aluminium current collector. Contrary to the carbonate solvent electrolyte, cell with tetraglyme solvent electrolyte and sodium loading of 1 mAh/cm2 has overpotential under 20 mV during the sodium plating/stripping cycles at 0.5 mA/cm2 for a testing period of 650 hrs. Overpotentials under 40 and 100 mV have been achieved at current densities up to 1 and 2 mA/cm2 for loadings up to 5 and 10 mAh/cm2 respectively for testing time up to 1500 hrs. DFT simulations have been performed to obtain the solvation energies, and the HOMO-LUMO band gap of the solvent-sodium ion complexes for the glyme solvent electrolytes and their trends have been correlated with the experimental observations.",

        "abstract": "On account of the high theoretical capacity and preferable electrochemical reversibility, tin selenides have emerged as potential anode materials in the field of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Unfortunately, the large volume changes, low electrical conductivity, and shuttling effect of polyselenides have impeded their real application. In this work, we present a spatially confined reaction approach for controllable fabrication of SnSe spheres, which are embedded in polydopamine (PDA)-derived N, Se dual-doped carbon networks (SnSe@NSC) through a one-step carbonization and selenization method. The NSC shell can not only buffer the volume changes during the cycling but also ensure strong coupling interaction between the SnSe core and carbon shell through Sn-C bonds, leading to excellent conductivity and structural integrity of the composite. Meanwhile, DFT theory calculations confirm that N, Se codoping in the carbon shell can endow the composite with enhanced adsorption energy and accelerated transfer ability of Na+. Consequently, the SnSe@NSC anode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 302.6 mA h g-1 over 500 cycles at 1 A g-1 and a competitive rate capability of 285.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1. Additionally, a sodium ion full battery is assembled by coupling the SnSe@NSC anode with the cathode of Na3V2(PO4)3 and verified with good cycling durability (190 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 over 500 cycles) and high energy density (204.3 W h kg-1). Our scalable and facile design of heterostructured SnSe@NSC provides a new avenue to develop novel advanced anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "FeNCN is a potentially fast-charging sodium ion anode due to the presence of lots of broad tunnels and its high electronic conductivity. However, FeNCN has been rarely investigated due to its complicated synthetic process and unclear synthetic mechanism, which affect the precise control of its phase and crystallinity. In this work, phase- and crystallinity-controlled FeNCN polyhedrons grown on nitrogen-doped carbon (FeNCN/NC) are successfully fabricated by adjusting the growing time and temperature. Moreover, the synthesis mechanism is disclosed in this paper. High-crystallinity FeNCN grows along the [001] direction, which exposes sufficient broad channels on the {010} planes and significantly improves the diffusion rate of sodium ions. Moreover, high-crystallinity FeNCN exhibits higher mechanical strength, which reduces its pulverization rate and endows it with durable cycling stability. When applied as an anode in a sodium-ion battery, high-crystallinity FeNCN/NC exhibits a high rate capability of 332 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 and a stable cycling performance of 368 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A g-1. This work confirms that the sodium-ion storage performance of FeNCN can be further improved by tuning its crystallinity.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the abundant reserves and low cost, sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered unprecedented attention. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the scarcity of alternative anodes with fast‐charging capability and high stability. To overcome this challenge, a fast‐charging SIB anode, N‐doped Bi/BiOCl embedded in a carbon framework (Bi/BiOCl@NC) with a fast Na+ transport channel and ultra‐high structural stability, is developed. During cycling in ether electrolyte, Bi/BiOCl@NC undergoes a remarkable transformation into a 3D porous skeleton, which significantly reduces the Na+ transport pathway and accommodates volume changes. By employing density functional theory calculations to simulate the storage behavior of Na+ in the structure, Bi/BiOCl@NC is theoretically characterized to have a low Na+ transport barrier (0.056 eV) and outstanding electronic conductivity. Such unique characteristics induce Bi/BiOCl@NC anode to have an ultra‐high Na+ storage capacity of 410 mAh·g−1 at 20 A·g−1 and exhibit outstanding cycling stability with over 2300 cycles at 10 A·g−1. This study provides a rational scenario for the fast‐charging anode design and will enlighten more advanced research to promote the exploitation of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles study is carried out to investigate the potential of phosphorene-like SiS and SiSe monolayers as anode materials for sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries. Results show that both SiS and SiSe have large adsorption energies towards single Na atom of −0.94 and −0.43eV, owing to the charge transfers from Na to SiS or SiSe. In addition, it is found that the highest Na concentration for both SiS and SiSe is x\n                     =1 with the chemical formulas of NaSiS and NaSiSe, corresponding to the high theoretical specific capacities for Na storages of 445.6 and 250.4mAhg−1, respectively. Moreover, Na diffusions are very fast and show strong directional behaviors on SiS and SiSe monolayers, with the energy barriers of only 0.135 and 0.158eV, lower than those of conventional anode materials for Na-ion batteries such as Na2Ti3O7 (0.19eV) and Na3Sb (0.21eV). Finally, although SiS and SiSe show semiconducting behaviors, they transform to metallic states after adsorbing Na atoms, indicating enhanced electrical conductivity during battery cycling. Given these advantages, it is expected that both SiS and SiSe monolayers are promising anode materials for Na-ion batteries, and in principle, other Na-based batteries as well.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides based on a conversion mechanism possess high theoretical specific capacity, making them suitable for high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay when assembled into full batteries due to dynamic hysteresis and large volume expansion. In this paper, the architectural engineering approach to construct MoS2/Fe2O3 @ carbon fiber heterostructures is proposed to overcome the above issues. The heterojunction formed by MoS2 and Fe2O3 would promote ion/electron transfer, while the carbon nano-fibers serve as a holder to maintain structural stability and ensure the rapid transport of electrons. The full battery in which the as-prepared MoS2/Fe2O3 @ carbon fiber anode is paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 61.1 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 for 1600 cycles without attenuation. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculation results show that this structural engineering approach improves the ion diffusion efficiency, enhances the conductivity, provides a more appropriate sodium ion adsorption energy, and thus extends the cycling life of the SIB. This work demonstrates the efficiency of architectural engineering and paves the way to design ultra-long-cycling Na-ion batteries.",

Herein, we report a core-shell Sb@Co(OH)2 nanosheet anode fabricated via magnetron sputtering Sb onto the mass-productive Co(OH)2 substrate anchored on stainless-steel mesh, which is scalable and suitable for flow-line production. In SIBs, the Sb@Co(OH)2 anode displays superior rate performance (383.5 mAh/g at 30 A/g), high discharge capacity, and excellent stability. Compared with the sputtered Sb film electrode, the improved performance of the core-shell Sb@Co(OH)2 nanosheet anode can be attributed to the open framework of the Co(OH)2 substrate, not only accelerating the ion and electron transfer but also serving as the buffer for alleviating the volumetric variation and the supporting scaffold for prohibiting the aggregation. More importantly, the (de)sodiation mechanism of the Sb@Co(OH)2 anode was explored by operando ( in situ) X-ray diffraction, and the similar alloying-dealloying processes (Sb ↔ Na xSb ↔ Na3Sb) for the 1st, 13th, and 30th cycles illustrate the excellent stability of the electrode.",

The Fe doping and carbon membrane could synergistically induce the formation of flower-like hierarchical microstructure during the crystal growing process. The unique hierarchical microstructure could increase the contact area between electrode and electrolyte and accommodate the volume expansion during cycling. The hierarchical Fe doped CoP directly grown on the carbon membrane could increase the active sites for sodium species intercalation and further promote the internal electron conduction in the Fe doped CoP/CM electrode. Thereby, the Fe doped CoP/CM as anode electrode for sodium ion batteries exhibits high specific capacity of 515 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles.

However, their low‐temperature performance, especially fast charging capability, is hindered by difficult desolvation and slow pass solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) together with sluggish diffusion within the electrode. Herein, a “single‐solute–single‐solvent” electrolyte is developed and a through‐hole hollow carbon sphere (TH‐HCS) is constructed, and it is demonstrated through theoretical calculations and experimental investigations that the weakly solvated structure and high ionic conductivity facilitate the Na+ transportation at low temperatures, the highly fluorinated SEI facilitates the Na+ migration, and the through‐hole hollow structure alleviates the volume expansion during sodiation, thus ensuring fast kinetics and structural stability. As expected, TH‐HCS using this electrolyte exhibits a high specific capacity of 87.5 mAh g−1 after 11 000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 and −40 °C. Coupled with activated carbon, the assembled SIHC displays an energy density of 106.1 and 52.0 Wh kg−1 at 25 and −40 °C, respectively, far exceeding the performance of commercial energy storage systems at low temperature.",

Herein, trimetallic sulfides embedded into the carbon matrix with a microsphere shape (denoted as CoNiZnS/C) were successfully prepared by a facile solid sulfidation of tri-metal-organic frameworks. The nanorods-assembled microsphere structure with abundant phase boundaries of multiphase in the CoNiZnS/C would provide abundant active sites and defects for storing sodium ions and rich voids to alleviate the volumetric strains. As the anode material of SIBs, the optimum composite named as CoNiZnS/C-2 in this work demonstrated high initial Coulombic efficiency (96.52% at 0.1 A g−1), good cycling stability (maintaining 410.7 mA h g−1 at the 960th cycle at 2.0 A g−1) and excellent rate performance (477.0 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1). Thus, such a multi-metal sulfide composite with special physical-chemical properties may offer a new insight to promote the electrochemical performance of sulfide-based anode materials for the SIBs.",

        "abstract": "As a promising cathode material of sodium-ion battery, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) possesses a theoretically high capacity and working voltage to realize high energy storage density. However, it still suffers from poor cycling stability mainly incurred by the undesirable P2-O2 phase transition. Herein, the electrochemically active Fe3+ ions are introduced into the lattice of NNMO, forming Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3- xFe xO2 ( x = 0, 1/24, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6) to effectively stabilize the P2-type crystalline structure. In such Fe-substituted materials, both Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples take part in the redox reactions, and the P2-O2 phase transition is well restrained during cycling, as verified by ex situ X-ray diffraction. As a result, the optimized Na2/3Ni1/3Mn7/12Fe1/12O2 (1/12-NNMF) has a long-term cycling stability with the fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 300 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the 1/12-NNMF delivers excellent rate capabilities (65 mA h g-1 at 25 C) and superior low-temperature performance (the capacity retention of 94% at -25 °C after 80 cycles) owing to the enhanced Na diffusion upon Fe doping, which is deduced by the studies of electrode kinetics. More significantly, the 1/12-NNMF also displays remarkable sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with an LS-Sb@G anode, thus implying the possibility of their practical application.",

As experimental and simulation results, 2H‐C of metalloid properties after carbon atom modulation exhibit superior sodium storage kinetics and reversibility by a unique mechanism that promotes ion intercalation under high voltage window, and further good for the later uniformly conversion at lower voltage (intercalation‐conversion mechanism). The 2H‐C anode material delivers a remarkable reversible capacity of 156 mAh g−1 at ultra‐high 100.0 A g−1, long‐term life of 6000 cycles, and superior performance at low temperatures of −10 °C.

However, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the sodium metal plating/stripping process represents a serious issue for the Na anode, which hinders achieving higher energy density. Herein, we report that the Na+ solvation structure, particularly the type and location of the anions, plays a critical role in determining the Na anode performance. We show that the low CE results from anion-mediated corrosion, which can be tackled readily through tuning the anion interaction at the electrolyte/anode interface. Our strategy thus enables fast charging Na-ion and Na-S batteries with remarkable cycle-life. The presented insights differ from the prevailing interpretation that the failure mechanism mostly results from sodium dendrite growth and/or solid electrolyte interphase formation.

        "abstract": "Due to the relatively high capacity and lower cost, transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode show promising potential in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a binary metal sulfide hybrid consisting of carbon encapsulated CoS/Cu2 S nanocages (CoS/Cu2 S@C-NC) is constructed. The interlocked hetero-architecture filled with conductive carbon accelerates the Na+ /e- transfer, thus leading to improved electrochemical kinetics. Also the protective carbon layer can provide better volume accommondation upon charging/discharging. As a result, the battery with CoS/Cu2 S@C-NC as anode displays a high capacity of 435.3 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1 (≈3.4 C). Under a higher rate of 10.0 A g-1 (≈17 C), a capacity of as high as 347.2 mAh g-1 is still remained after long 2300 cycles. The capacity decay per cycle is only 0.017%. The battery also exhibits a better temperature tolerance at 50 and -5 °C. A low internal impedance analyzed by X-ray diffraction patterns and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, narrow band gap, and high density of states obtained by first-principle calculations of the binary sulfides, ensure the rapid Na+ /e- transport. The long-cycling-life SIB using binary metal sulfide hybrid nanocages as anode shows promising applications in versatile electronic devices.",

Currently, organic electrode materials for SIBs are mainly used as cathodes because of their relatively high redox potentials (>1 V). Organic electrodes with low redox potential that can be used as anode are rare. Herein, a novel organic anode material (tetrasodium 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylate, Na4TDC) has been developed with low redox potential (<0.7 V) and excellent cyclic stability. Its three-sodium storage mechanism was demonstrated with various in-situ/ex-situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, showing a high capacity of 208 mAh/g and an average decay rate of merely 0.022% per cycle. Moreover, the Na4TDC-hard carbon composite can further acquire improved capacity and cycling stability for 1200 cycles even with a high mass loading of up to 20 mg cm−2. By pairing with a thick Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (20.6 mg cm−2), the as-fabricated full cell exhibited high operating voltage (2.8 V), excellent rate performance and cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 88.7% after 200 cycles, well highlighting the Na4TDC anode material for SIBs.",

In this study, we focus on the development and potential upscaling of sustainable hard carbon materials as anodes for NIBs. The synthesis of hard carbon starts from D‐glucose, a scalable and environmentally benign precursor. A facile process combining hydrothermal carbonisation and subsequent pyrolysis at 1500°C allows the hard carbon to become an industrially viable material. The resulting hard carbon demonstrates competitive performance metrics including a high initial Coulombic efficiency, high reversible capacity, long‐term cycling stability, and rate capability.

It has drawn wide attention because of its stable three-dimensional NASICON-type structure, proper redox potential, and large accommodation space for Na+.

Therefore, this paper proposes a material with carbon-coated porous NTP olive-like nanospheres (p-NTP@C) to tackle the issues above. Based on experimental data and theoretical calculations, the porous structure of the material is found to be able to provide more active sites and shorten the Na+ diffusion distance. In addition, the carbon coating can effectively improve the electron and Na+ diffusion kinetics. As the anode material for SIBs, the p-NTP@C olive-like nanospheres exhibit a high reversible capacity (127.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C) and ultrastable cycling performance (84.8% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 C). Furthermore, the sodium-ion full cells, composed of p-NTP@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3@carbon cathode, also deliver excellent performance (75.7% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C).

The optimized HCNFs featuring short-range graphitic layers with sufficient interlayer spacings (0.37-0.40 nm) for Na+ intercalation deliver a high reversible capacity (388 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1 ) and good rate capability.

Combined with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the detailed relationship between pore-filling plateau capacity and interlayer spacing is disclosed. It is found that sufficient interlayer spacings (>0.37 nm) provide diffusion channels for Na+ to reach the pores for further filling.

        "abstract": "The alloying mechanism of high-capacity tin anodes for sodium-ion batteries is investigated using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. Ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) and high-throughput screening using a species-swap method provide insights into a range of possible sodium-tin structures. These structures are linked to experiments using both average and local structure probes in the form of operando pair distribution function analysis, X-ray diffraction, and 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR), along with ex situ 119Sn ssNMR. Through this approach, we propose structures for the previously unidentified crystalline and amorphous intermediates. The first electrochemical process of sodium insertion into tin results in the conversion of crystalline tin into a layered structure consisting of mixed Na/Sn occupancy sites intercalated between planar hexagonal layers of Sn atoms (approximate stoichiometry NaSn3). Following this, NaSn2, which is predicted to be thermodynamically stable by AIRSS, forms; this contains hexagonal layers closely related to NaSn3, but has no tin atoms between the layers. NaSn2 is broken down into an amorphous phase of approximate composition Na1.2Sn. Reverse Monte Carlo refinements of an ab initio molecular dynamics model of this phase show that the predominant tin connectivity is chains. Further reaction with sodium results in the formation of structures containing Sn-Sn dumbbells, which interconvert through a solid-solution mechanism. These structures are based upon Na5-xSn2, with increasing occupancy of one of its sodium sites commensurate with the amount of sodium added. ssNMR results indicate that the final product, Na15Sn4, can store additional sodium atoms as an off-stoichiometry compound (Na15+xSn4) in a manner similar to Li15Si4.",

        "abstract": "Niobium-based phosphates have the advantages of high stability and environmental protection and have good application prospects in sodium-ion batteries. The pure phase of Na(NbO_2)_2PO_4 (NNP) powder was successfully synthesized by different methods in this work, and the materials were characterized via XRD, XPS, SEM, and electrochemical methods. At the current density of 100 mA g^−1, the discharge-specific capacity of NNP is 521.8 mAh g^−1 in the first cycle and remains at 462.4 mAh g^−1 after 200 cycles, indicating that it has good cycling stability. The kinetic results obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) show the pseudo-capacitance contribution accounts for a large percentage of the capacity. The charge transfer resistance of NNP is 260.3 Ω, which is significantly smaller than the others derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). These pointed to the advantages of NNP in anode material for SIBs.",

Herein, in situ sulfur-mediated interface engineering is developed to effectively raise the kinetics properties of the SnS nanosheet anodes, which is realized by a synchronous reduction and carbon deposition/doping process. The sulfur in the raw SnS2 directly induces the sulfur-doped amorphous carbon layer onto the in situ reduced SnS nanosheet. In situ and ex situ electrochemical characterizations suggest that the sulfur-mediated interface layer can enhance the reversibility and kinetics properties, promote the ion/electron swift delivery, and maintain the configurational wholeness of the SnS nanosheet anodes. Consequently, a relatively high Li-storage capacity of 922 mAh g-1 and Na-storage capacity of 349 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 even after 1000 and 300 long-term cycles are achieved, respectively. The facile method and excellent performance suggest the effective interface tuning for developing the SnS-based anodes for batteries and beyond.",

In this work, a strategy of increased covalency of the NASICON framework combined with the reversible activation of V4+/V5+ couple is proposed to improve the electrochemical performance together with energy density of V‐based cathodes. Making full use of V2+/V3+/V4+/V5+ and Ti3+/Ti4+ redox couples, Na2.5VTi0.5Al0.5(PO4)3 exhibits admirable electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacity of 160.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and favorable cycling stability (a capacity retention of 88.3% at 20 C after 1000 cycles). Moreover, this cathode displays outstanding low temperature performance at 0 °C with a capacity retention of 89% after 1200 cycles at 5 C. In situ XRD and EIS analysis are conducted to reveal the Na+ storage mechanism. The cathode reveals a lattice volume variation of 2.16% upon cycling, which is responsible for the high structural stability during the extraction and intercalation process of Na+. Applying Na2.5VTi0.5Al0.5(PO4)3 as both cathode and anode electrode, the symmetric cell is assembled and displays exceptional capacity of 59.8 mAh g−1 at 20 C.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) remains the most viable choice as a negative electrode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) owing to its higher energy density (discharge up to zero volts), higher capacity (distinct storage mechanisms), and cycling stability. Herein, a biomass jute fiber precursor HC anode (JPC) with varying porosity is reported for the first time as a low-cost and sustainable high-performance HC anode for SIBs and PIBs. Direct carbonization results in micro-meso porous HC (JPC-D), and micro-wave pretreated jute fiber results in ultramicroporous HC (JPC-M). The mesoporosity generated in JPC-D during synthesis outperforms the ultramicroporous JPC-M with a high reversible capacity of 328 mAh g-1 (iCE = 66%) at a current density of 30 mA g-1 (0.1C) with superior capacity retention of 84% after 100 cycles in SIBs. The Na+ ion and K+ ion storage in HCs, especially at lower voltages, shows distinct storage mechanisms that depend on the morphology and porosity of the material. JPC-D contributed 39% of its total capacity through the plateau region capacity (PRC), suggesting more pore filling from hierarchical porosity in SIBs. JPC-D and JPC-M exhibit more insertion-based capacity than pore-filling processes in PIBs. The presence of inorganic impurities (Ca, Si, Al, and Fe) encapsulated in the carbon structure plays a critical role in developing mesopores. The yield (%) of HC from direct carbonization per kilogram of jute is ∼34%, which makes it cheaper than HC from sugar-based precursors and 1.5 times more affordable than other biomass-derived HC. The jute-based micro-mesoporous HC is a novel, cost-effective, sustainable approach to designing HC for a PRC-based battery-type anode in SIBs and PIBs.",

        "abstract": "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",

By protecting Na anode with controllable alucone layer, the dendrites and mossy Na formation have been effectively suppressed and the lifetime has been significantly improved. Moreover, the molecular layer deposition alucone coating shows better performances than the atomic layer deposition Al2O3 coating.

The non-graphitizable amorphous characteristics are determined from the obtained two broad diffraction peaks at 22.7° and 43.8°. The observed D-band at 1325 cm-1 and G-band at 1586 cm-1 confirm the disordered graphitic structure, attributed to the measured specific surface area of 54 m2 g-1. Mesoporous weaved wave-shape carbon sheet architecture is confirmed by surface morphological studies, showing lattice fringes of disordered graphitic structures and dispersed ring patterns for the non-crystalline characteristics. The predominant stable redox peak at 0.014 V/0.185 V and the broader rectangular shape between 0.9 and 0.15 V depict the adsorption-micropore filling mechanism.

Besides, in situ multimode calorimetry results disclose that the micropore filling Na+ ion storage shows a higher released total heat energy of 721 J g-1 than the adsorption (471 J g-1). Ultimately, differential scanning calorimetry analysis of micropore filling Na+ ion storage (discharged state at 0.01 V) has revealed a predominant exothermic peak at 156 °C with the highest released total heat energy of 2183 J g-1 compared to adsorption (553 J g-1) and deintercalation (85 J g-1), indicating that micropore filling status is more unsafe than the adsorption and deintercalation for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has captured enormous attention as a potential cathode for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), owing to its sturdy crystal structure and high theoretical capacity. Nonetheless, its poor intrinsic electronic conductivity has led to inferior electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and long cycling performance. To address this problem, a combined strategy is adopted, such as (1) carbon coating and (2) high valent Sn4+ ion doping in the lattice site of vanadium in the NVP cathode. Carbon coating can effectively enhance the surface electronic conductivity, wherein high-valent Sn4+ improves the bulk intrinsic electronic conductivity of the materials. Moreover, Sn is a well-known alloying/dealloying type anode for SIBs; thus, doping of such metal in cathode materials will assume the role of structure stabilizing pillars and establishing high-performing cathode materials. Herein, Na3V2-xSnx(PO4)3/C (denoted as Sn(x)-NVP/C, where x = 0.00, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1) were synthesized via sol-gel route, followed by calcination at 800 °C. XRD, Raman, XPS, and electron microscopy data confirmed the high purity of the synthesized cathode. The optimized Sn(0.07)-NVP/C exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in terms of high rate capability and long cycling performance, a high appreciable capacity of 98 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles. Similarly, at a high current of 20C, it is still able to deliver a stable capacity of 76 mAh g-1 with 85% capacity retention after 3000 cycles. The rate capability study indicates the high current tolerance of Sn(0.07)-NVP/C up to 70 C with a capacity delivery of 55 mAh g-1. It is worth mentioning that CV and EIS analysis for Sn(0.07)-NVP/C cathode displayed minimum voltage polarization and enhanced diffusion coefficient. Moreover, DFT calculation also proved that the electronic and ionic conductivity of NVP is promoted by Sn doping. Hence, the present results demonstrated that Sn(0.07)-NVP/C is considered a promising cathode for sodium-ion battery application.",

        "abstract": "Developing high-performance electrode materials with high energy and long-term cycling stability is a hot topic and of great importance for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a highly porous carbon/tin sulfide aerogel with a \"skeleton/skin\" morphology (SSC@SnS2) has been developed and further used as a binder-free anode for SIBs. This SSC@SnS2 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 612 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, a good rate capability, and a long-term cycling stability up to 1000 times with an average Coulombic efficiency of ∼99.9%. Meanwhile, this SSC@SnS2 aerogel also achieves a stable cycling performance even at a high current density up to 5.0 A g-1. The fast-yet-stable sodium ion storage performance of the prepared SSC@SnS2 aerogel can be ascribed to the reasons that (i) the carbon nanofiber/graphene skeleton provides unimpeded pathways for the rapid transfer of electrons; (ii) thin SnS2 skin with nonaggregated morphology can provide a great number of active sites for sodium ion storage; (iii) the porous structure of the SSC@SnS2 aerogel ensures a rapid penetration of electrolyte and can further accommodate the volume expansion of active SnS2 nanoflakes; and (iv) the intermediate product of Na15Sn4 alloy contributes greatly to the sodium ion storage performance of the SSC@SnS2 aerogel. The excellent electrochemical performances coupling with the unique structural features of this SSC@SnS2 aerogel make it a promising anode candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gained increasing attention owing to the abundant and cost-effective availability of sodium precursors. However, the quest for cost-effective and high-performing anode materials for SIBs remains a challenging task. In this study, we employed a straightforward pyrolysis method to fabricate nitrogen (N)- and oxygen (O)-doped hard carbon (HC) using waste cow leather, a low-cost biomass with high yield, as a carbon source. Our findings reveal that the pyrolysis temperature significantly influences the sodium storage performance of cow leather-derived HCs by modulating their microstructures and compositions. Specifically, the cow leather-derived HC pyrolyzed at 1100 °C exhibits a high reversible specific capacity of 207.9 mAh g−1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 0.1 C. Additionally, a reversible capacity of 142 mAh g−1 is maintained after 200 cycles at 1 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate that N/O codoping in HCs enhances the presence of defects and active sites and facilitates electron transfer, thereby improving sodium storage performance. This work provides insights into the sodium storage behavior of cow leather-derived HCs carbonized at different temperatures and presents a promising avenue for converting solid waste into high-performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Constructing heterojunction and introducing interfacial interaction by designing ideal structures have the inherent advantages of optimizing electronic structure and macroscopic mechanical property. An exquisite hierarchical heterogeneous of bimetal sulfide Sb2S3@FeS2 hollow nanorods embedded into nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is fabricated by a concise two-steps of solvothermal method. The FeS2 interlayer bulges in-situ grow on the interface of hollow Sb2S3 nanorods within the nitrogen-doped graphene matrix, forming a delicate heterostructure. Such a well-designed architecture affords rapid Na+ diffusion and improves charge transfer at the heterointerfaces. Meanwhile, the strongly synergistic coupling interaction among the interior Sb2S3, interlayer FeS2, and external nitrogen-doped carbon matrix creates a steady nanostructure, which extremely accelerates the electronic/ion transport and effectively alleviates the volume expansion upon long cyclic process. As a result, the composite, as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, exhibits superior rate capability of 537.9 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1, excellent cyclic stability with 85.7 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the existing constructing heterojunction in this composite can not only optimize the electronic structure to enhance the conductivity, but also favor the Na2S adsorption energy to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The outstanding electrochemical performance sheds light on the strategy by rational designing of hierarchical heterogeneous nanostructure for energy storage applications.",

Herein, we reported a Sn-pillared pyknotic graphene conductive network with high-level N-doping.

Moreover, theoretical simulations have indicated that the charge accumulation around the N-doped region is more pronounced compared to the pristine one, and electrons accumulate around the N atom while loss occurs at the Na atom. These studies also suggest that it might possibly contribute to higher conductivity and stronger electrophilic reactivity, thereby resulting in enhanced Na-ion storage performance. As a result, the as-obtained electrode material exhibits competitive volumetric capacity (1462 mAh cm-3 at 0.1 A g-1), cycling performance (1207 mAh cm-3 after 100 cycles), and promising rate behavior simultaneously.",

Constructing heterojunction incorporating multiple active components has been emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate these limitations. In this study, high lattice matching FeS2/NiS2 heterojunction nanoparticles anchored on a carbon skeleton (FeS2/NiS2@NC) were synthesized by a facile high-temperature pyrolysis and sulfidation process. The combination of experimental characteristics and theoretical simulations confirms that this unique heterojunction, characterized by an electric field at the interface, offers an adjustable electronic structure and strong Na+ adsorption energy, thus expediting Na+ diffusion kinetics. Consequently, the FeS2/NiS2@NC electrode demonstrates superior rate capabilities (491.2 mAh/g at 10.0 A/g) and enhanced cycling stability (490.8 and 274.7 mAh/g at 10.0 and 20.0 A/g over 5000 cycles) when employed as anode in SIBs.

This is largely due to the amorphous nature of the active materials upon cycling and its possible structural change at a small length scale (e.g., nanometers), making it difficult to access the phase/structural evolution of the electrode. In the present work, we show that the phase/structural change of the Cu4SnP10 nanowire electrode can be systematically investigated using a comprehensive set of ex situ transmission electron microscopy-based techniques, which are ideal for decay mechanism analysis of electrode materials of amorphous nature and with nanoscale structural evolution. The compositional elements of Cu4SnP10 nanowires are found to be spatially redistributed at a nanometer scale upon the initial sodiation, and this is partially reversible in the following desodiation process. Damage accumulates until a critical size of phase separation/segregation is reached, when the active material loss takes place, leading to fast deterioration of the entire Cu4SnP10 nanowire structure and thus its electrochemical performance. The phase segregation driven-active material loss is found to dominate the cycle-dependent capacity decay of the Cu4SnP10 nanowire electrode.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract more attention because of sodium's abundant availability, affordable price, and potential to be an effective anode material. Meanwhile, carbon-based materials provide the most promising anode materials. Because of the large radius of sodium ions, SIBs do not exhibit favorable electrochemical performance. Introducing heteroatoms into the carbon-lattice is an effective strategy to enlarge the interlayer space of carbon-based materials which can improve carbon's electrochemical performance. In addition, anode materials with a surface-induced capacitive process can enhance the SIB's electrochemical performance because its capacitive process increases the kinetics of ion diffusion. Here, we describe an SIB's anode material containing nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene sheets [denoted as poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)] which are synthesized via carbonization of PDMcT polymerized on the surface of GO. PDMcT/RGO exhibited high capacities (240 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1), improved rate performance (144 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and good cycling stability (153 mA h g-1 after 5000 cycles at 5000 mA g-1). These unique results are attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and electronic conductivity from the heteroatoms which facilitate the sodium ion's insertion and electron transport. These results represent that PDMcT/RGO is a great potential anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "High energy density and flexible electrodes, which have high mechanical properties and electrochemical stability, are critical to the development of wearable electronics. In this work, a free-standing MXene bonded SnS2 composited nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (MXene/SnS2 @NCFs) film is reported as a flexible anode for sodium-ion batteries. SnS2 nanoparticles with high-capacity properties are covalently decorated in bio-derived nitrogen-doped 1D carbon fibers (SnS2 @NCFs) and further assembled with highly conductive MXene sheets. The addition of bacterial cellulose (BC) can further improve the flexibility of the film. The unique 3D structure of points, lines, and planes can not only offset the disadvantage of low conductivity of SnS2 nanoparticles but also expand the distance between MXene sheets, which is conducive to the penetration of electrolytes. More importantly, the MXene sheets and N-doped 1D carbon fibers (NCFs) can accommodate the large volume expansion of SnS2 nanoparticles and trap polysulfide during the cycle. The MXene/SnS2 @NCFs film exhibits better sodium storage and excellent rate performance compared to the SnS2 @NCFs. The in situ XRD and ex situ (XRD, XPS, and HRTEM) techniques are used to analyze the sodiation process and to deeply study the reaction mechanism of the films. Finally, the quasi-solid-state full cells with MXene/SnS2 @NCFs and Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 @carbon cloth (NVP@CC) fully demonstrate the application potential of the flexible electrodes.",

Although its 3D structure enables high Na-ion diffusivity, low electronic conductivity severely limits NTP's practical application in SIBs. Herein, we report porous NTP/C nanofibers (NTP/C-NFs) obtained via an electrospinning method. The NTP/C-NFs exhibit a high reversible capacity (120 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C) and a long cycling stability (a capacity retention of ∼93% after 700 cycles at 2 C). Furthermore, sodium-ion full cells and hybrid sodium-ion capacitors have also been successfully assembled, both of which exhibit high-rate capabilities and remarkable cycling stabilities because of the high electronic/ionic conductivity and impressive structural stability of NTP/C-NFs. The results show that the nanoscale-tailored NTP/C-NFs could deliver new insights into the design of high-performing and highly stable anode materials for room-temperature SIBs.",

        "abstract": "It is a significant way to improve the sodium storage performance of mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) by adjusting the size and microcrystalline structure of it. A petroleum-based MCMBs with an ultra-large size and loose microcrystalline structure was synthesized by introducing functionalized graphene (FNG). The results indicate that the FNG can hinder the ordered stacking of planar aromatic macromolecules, prevent the coalescence and prolong the growth time of mesophase spheres. Mesophase spheres are easier to grow to an ultra-large size with looser microcrystalline structure. The MCMBs with a size of 250 µm and a larger microcrystalline spacing can be achieved by adding 1.0 wt% FNG during the polycondensation process. Such MCMBs deliver a competitive specific capacity of 123.4 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 81.79% and an excellent stability of cycle performance when applied as anode of SIBs. This work provides a valuable and efficient method to enhance the SIB performance by designing the size and microcrystalline structure of MCMBs.",

The interconnected SnS2 nanoflowers with cross-linking nanosheets and rich pores assembled to form one layer of continuous network structure, which tightly adhered on the surface of graphene. The porous graphene supported by NF built a conductively integral highway that is preferable for the charge transfer kinetics, while the hierarchical pores from the SnS2 nanoflowers and NF are particularly beneficial for mitigating the volume expansion and promoting electrolyte penetration. The as-constructed Ni foam/reduced graphene oxide/SnS2 (NF/RGO/SnS2) composite exhibited dramatically enhanced reversible capacity, remarkable rate capability, and long-term cycling stabilities without the use of any binders and conductive additives. Especially, NF/RGO/SnS2 composite remained the specific capacity as high as 561.9 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 1000 mA g−1 after continuous tests for 160 cycles, which is much higher than conventional SnS2/RGO composite.

        "abstract": "Tin disulfide (SnS2) has emerged as a promising anode material for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to its unique layered structure, outstanding electrochemical properties and low cost. However, its poor cycling life and time-consuming synthesis as well as low-yield production hinder the practical utilization of nanostructured SnS2. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and reliable dissolution-regeneration strategy to construct a flexible SnS2/sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (S-rGO) composite as anodes for LIBs and SIBs, highlighting its mass-production feature. In addition, the robust affinity between SnS2 and S-rGO without interstitial volume is very beneficial for preventing the SnS2 particles from breaking themselves away from the rGO nanosheets into free nanoparticles. As a result, the SnS2/S-rGO composite as anodes delivers high reversible capacities of 1078 mA h g-1 and 564 mA h g-1 (at 0.1 A g-1) for LIBs and SIBs, respectively, and excellent rate capabilities and cycling stability (e.g. 532 mA h g-1 during the 600 cycles at 5.0 A g-1 for LIBs). Our proposed strategy may also possess great potential for the practical application of other electrochemically active metal sulfide composites for energy devices.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as economic candidates have received considerable attention for large-scale energy storage applications. However, crystalline metal compounds with specific transport routes and rigid structures restrict their practical applications. Herein, the atomically dispersed N-rich amorphous WN clusters confined in the carbon nanosheets (WN/CNSs) are reported. Through advanced tests and calculations, the structural advantages, reaction mechanisms, and kinetic behaviors of the clusters are systematically analyzed. Compared with the crystalline W2 N with low theoretical capacity (only 209.3 mAh g-1 ), the amorphous WN clusters have the advantages of atomic disorders and non-grain boundaries and can afford abundant active sites (unsaturated dangling bonds) and isotropic charge transfer channels, which can be further enhanced by the N-rich characteristics and high electronegativity of the clusters. The encapsulation of CNSs has high conductivity and structural stability, which promotes electron transfer and effectively buffers volume expansions. As a SIB anode, the reversible capacity of WN/CNSs reaches 421.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 . Even at 20 A g-1 , the reversible capacity of 170.7 mAh g-1 is maintained after 8000 cycles.

In this study, the role of the acid is investigated systematically by adjusting the reaction temperature and time, using different kinds and amounts of acid, and changing the amount of PVP surfactant added. It is found that the acid can not only trigger the chemical reaction to form cubic PB, but also act as an etching reagent to tailor the morphology. The as-obtained cubic PB with concave centers demonstrates a superior cycle stability and rate performance, which can achieve a capacity of 107 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 . The corresponding capacity retention is 74 % after 500 cycles relative to the second cycle. Even at a current density of 5 A g-1 , the specific capacity remains at 82 mA h g-1 . Furthermore, the full cell, using PB as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode, exhibits a high capacity of 70 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , and can power an LED light successfully.

The unique structural properties of the 1D single‐crystal nanobelts offer excellent electrochemical activity, electrochemo‐mechanical stability, and well‐maintained structural integrity, leading to highly efficient sodium ion storage performance. Insights into the electrochemical reaction processes, as revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy, in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the 1D single‐crystal nanobelts enable favorable sodium ion storage kinetics and a low‐strain characteristic. This facilitates fast charge/discharge capability and long‐term cycling stability for up to 5000 cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the 1D single‐crystal nanobelts demonstrate practical applicability. A pouch cell assembled with the 1D single‐crystal nanobelts anode and iron‐based Prussian blue cathode exhibits highly stable cycling, achieving a low capacity fading ratio of ≈0.05% per cycle over 150 cycles.

To date, the pursuit of high-performance anode materials remains a great challenge for the SIBs. In this work, carbon-stabilized interlayer-expanded few-layer MoSe2 nanosheets (MoSe2@C) have been fabricated by an oleic acid (OA) functionalized synthesis-polydopamine (PDA) stabilization-carbonization strategy, and their structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties have been carefully characterized and compared with the carbon-free MoSe2. When evaluated as anode for sodium ion half batteries, the MoSe2@C exhibits a remarkably enhanced rate capability of 367 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1, a high reversible discharge capacity of 445 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1, and a long-term cycling stability over 100 cycles. To further explore the potential applications, the MoSe2@C is assembled into sodium ion full batteries with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as cathode materials, showing an impressively high reversible capacity of 421 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Such results are primarily attributed to the unique carbon-stabilized interlayer-expanded few-layer MoSe2 nanosheets structure, which facilitates the permeation of electrolyte into the inner of MoSe2 nanosheets, promoting charge transfer efficiency among MoSe2 nanosheets, and accommodating the volume change from discharge-charge cycling.",

        "abstract": "Since sodium-ion batteries are considered to be the promising energy storage devices, carbon materials as the anodes have been intensively studied. They have good cycling stability, but their capacities are generally not high enough to meet the increasing demands. In order to solve this problem, a carbon-bimetallic composite is synthesized in one step using a simple pyrolysis method with low-cost biomass and cobalt ferrate as the precursors. This simple synthesis method allows the in-situ production of bi-alloys embedded into disordered carbon matrix derived from the tapioca starch to form high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The initial discharge capacity is 712 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1and the initial Coulombic efficiency is 89.2%. Moreover, the introduction of bi-alloys not only facilitates the reaction kinetics, but also effectively mitigates the volume expansion and consequently promotes the cyclability. As a result, the half-cell sodium-ion battery delivers a capacity of more than 419 mA h g−1 at a high current of 10 A g−1, and after 200 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, its capacity degradation is only 0.2% per cycle with a Coulombic efficiency of about 100%.

In addition, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance technology confirmed that the separator with strong dipole moments prevented the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. SEI with high NaF content and few oligomers is smooth and robust, obviously decreasing the interface impedance of the Na anode. The symmetric Na||Na cells, equipped with the functionalized separator, efficiently operated for 1400 hours with a stable 72 mV overpotential at 0.25 mA cm-2, exhibiting low energy barrier and fast ion transport kinetics.

        "abstract": "Ether-based electrolytes exhibit excellent performance when applied in different anode materials of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but their exploration on cathode material is deficient and the degradation mechanism is still undiscovered. Herein, various battery systems with different operation voltage ranges are designed to explore the electrochemical performance of ether electrolyte. It is found for the first time that the deterioration mechanism of ether electrolyte is closely related to the \"redox shuttle\" between cathode and low-potential anode. The \"shuttle\" is discovered to occur when the potential of anodes is below 0.57 V, and the gas products coming from \"shuttle\" intermediates are revealed by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Moreover, effective inhibition strategies by protecting low-potential anodes are proposed and verified; ethylene carbonate (EC) is found to be very effective as an additive by forming an inorganics-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on low-potential anodes, thereby suppressing the deterioration of ether electrolytes. This work reveals the failure mechanism of ether-based electrolytes applied in SIBs and proposes effective strategies to suppress the \"shuttle,\" which provides a valuable guidance for advancing the application of ether-based electrolytes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Achieving wide‐temperature operation is a crucial objective for the practical deployment of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, the development of suitable electrolytes is hindered by significant challenges, including compromised ionic dynamics at low temperatures and interphase instability at high temperatures. Herein, this study proposes a novel interphase enhancement mechanism utilizing a sulfur‐rich strategy, grounded in rational solvent selection. This approach enriches the electrolyte with sulfur‐containing species that exhibit high Na+ affinity and efficient ionic migration at both the cathode and anode sides. Consequently, this strategy significantly enhances interfacial charge transfer and interphase integrity, confirmed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements. The designed electrolyte demonstrates robust performance in half‐cells based on Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) across a wide temperature range from −25 to 60 °C. Furthermore, the full‐cell, featuring an NVP cathode paired with a hard carbon anode, exhibits exceptional stability. Specifically, the full cell achieves reversible capacities of 56.1 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at −25 °C and 74.9 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 60 °C, with impressive capacity retentions of 87.7% and 88.2%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries, reducing the reliance on scarce transition metals. Converting agricultural biomass into SIB anodes can remarkably enhance sustainability in both the agriculture and battery industries. However, the complex and costly synthesis and unsatisfactory electrochemical performance of biomass-derived hard carbon have hindered its further development. Herein, we employed a hydrothermally assisted carbonization process that converts switchgrass to battery-grade hard carbon capable of efficient Na-ion storage. The hydrothermal pretreatment effectively removed hemicellulose and impurities (e.g., lipids and ashes), creating thermally stable precursors suitable to produce hard carbon via carbonization. The elimination of hemicellulose and impurities contributes to a reduced surface area and lower oxygen content. With the modifications, the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and cycling stability are improved concurrently. The optimized hard carbon showcased a high reversible specific capacity of 313.4 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1, a commendable ICE of 84.8%, and excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 308.4 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles. In short, this research introduces a cost-effective method for producing anode materials for SIBs and highlights a sustainable pathway for biomass utilization, underscoring mutual benefits for the energy and agricultural sectors.",

However, critical issues arise from soluble sodium polytellurides, leading to the shuttle effect. This phenomenon can result in the loss of active materials, self-discharge, and anode instability. Here, we introduce polypyrrole-coated tellurium nanotubes as the cathode materials, where polypyrrole plays a crucial role in preventing the dissolution of polytellurides, as confirmed through operando optical microscopy. The polypyrrole-coated tellurium nanotubes exhibited an outstanding rate performance and long cycle stability in sodium-tellurium batteries.

However, the unsatisfactory electrochemical performance induced by the huge volume change and sluggish kinetics hampered the practical application of SIBs. Herein, guided by the heterostructure interface engineering, novel multicomponent metal sulfide-based anodes, including SnS, FeS, and Fe3N embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets (SnS/FeS/Fe3N/NC NSs), have been synthesized for high-performance SIBs. The as-prepared SnS/FeS/Fe3N/NC NSs with abundant heterointerfaces and high conductivity of N-doped carbon nanosheet matrix can shorten the Na+ diffusion path and promote reaction kinetics during the sodiation/desodiation process. Moreover, the presence of Fe3N can promote the reversible conversion of SnS and FeS during the cycling process. As a consequence, when evaluated as anode materials for SIBs, the SnS/FeS/Fe3N/NC NSs can maintain a high sodium storage capacity of 473.6 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles at 2.0 A g-1 and can still provide a high reversible capacity of 537.4 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1 This discovery offers a novel strategy for constructing metal sulfide-based anode materials for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Highlights We developed an efficient and extensible strategy to produce the single-phase ternary NbSSe nanohybrids with defect-enrich microstructure. The anionic-Se doping play a key role in effectively modulating the electronic structure and surface chemistry of NbS_2 phase, including the increased interlayers distance (0.65 nm), the enhanced intrinsic electrical conductivity (3.23 × 10^3 S m^-1) and extra electroactive defect sites. The NbSSe/NC composite as anode exhibits rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics and increased capacitance behavior for Na^+ storage, resulting in high reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability. Abstract Sodium-based dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) have gained tremendous attention due to their virtues of high operating voltage and low cost, yet it remains a tough challenge for the development of ideal anode material of SDIBs featuring with high kinetics and long durability. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of N-doped carbon film-modified niobium sulfur–selenium (NbSSe/NC) nanosheets architecture, which holds favorable merits for Na^+ storage of enlarged interlayer space, improved electrical conductivity, as well as enhanced reaction reversibility, endowing it with high capacity, high-rate capability and high cycling stability. The combined electrochemical studies with density functional theory calculation reveal that the enriched defects in such nanosheets architecture can benefit for facilitating charge transfer and Na^+ adsorption to speed the electrochemical kinetics. The NbSSe/NC composites are studied as the anode of a full SDIBs by pairing the expanded graphite as cathode, which shows an impressively cyclic durability with negligible capacity attenuation over 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g^−1, as well as an outstanding energy density of 230.6 Wh kg^−1 based on the total mass of anode and cathode.",

Effects on an ultrathin carbon nitride film deposited on a copper metal electrode are presented. The combination of effects show an unusually high capacity to store sodium metal. The g‐C3N4 film is as thin as 10 nm and can be fabricated by an efficient, facile, and general chemical‐vapor deposition method. A high reversible capacity of formally up to 51 Ah g−1 indicates that the Na is not only stored in the carbon nitride as such, but that carbon nitride activates also the metal for reversible Na‐deposition, while forming at the same time an solid electrolyte interface layer avoiding direct contact of the metallic phase with the liquid electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "The increasing global demand for sustainable energy sources has driven research into sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) for large-scale energy storage. However, their electrochemical performance is hindered by poor reaction kinetics and significant volume expansion in electrode materials. In this work, we developed a dual-carbon-confined SnO2 nanocrystal anode (CNTs@SnO2@NC) designed for high-performance SIBs. This innovative structure uses carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) coating to stabilize SnO2, ensuring structural integrity during charge/discharge cycles. The CNTs network in CNTs@SnO2@NC can alleviate the agglomeration of SnO2 nanocrystals to a certain extent; With its superior electronic conductivity, CNTs can enhance the anode's conductivity and function as an electronic highway; The sodiophilic properties and good electrical conductivity of CNTs enable sodium ions to migrate rapidly on the surface of the nanotubes. Moreover, numerous external defects and active sites generated by nitrogen doping enhance the sodium ion absorption capabilities; The existence of nitrogen-doped carbon coating can effectively accommodate the volume changes of SnO2 and enhance the structural stability of CNTs@SnO2@NC composites during the repeated charge and discharge cycles. As a result, the CNTs@SnO2@NC composite demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance, achieving capacity of 235 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 over 100 cycles and 102 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 over 300 cycles. In a full-cell configuration with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, it delivers 38 mAh g−1 at 100th cycle at 0.1 A g−1. This study underscores the substantial improvements achieved by dual-carbon confinement for high-performance SIB anodes, offering a promising direction for future anode material design.",

Exploring facile synthesis of a carbon-based anode materials with capable electrochemical performance is key to promoting the practical application of SIBs. In this work, a combination of petroleum pitch and recyclable sodium chloride is selected as the carbon source and template to obtain hard carbon (HC) anode for SIBs. Carbonization times and temperatures are optimized by assessing the sodium ion storage behavior of different HC materials. The optimized HC exhibits a remarkable capacity of over 430 mA·hg^−1 after undergoing full activation through 500 cycles at a density of current of 0.1 A·g^−1. Furthermore, it demonstrates an initial discharge capacity of 276 mAh·g^−1 at a density of current of 0.5 A·g^−1. Meanwhile, the optimized HC shows a good capacity retention (170 mAh·g^−1 after 750 cycles) and a remarkable rate ability (166 mAh·g^−1 at 2 A·g^−1). The enhanced capacity is attributed to the suitable degree of graphitization and surface area, which improve the sodium ion transport and storage.",

        "abstract": "Employing copper (Cu) as an anode current collector for metal sulphides is perceived as a general strategy to achieve stable cycle performance in sodium-ion batteries, despite the compatibility of the aluminium current collector with sodium at low voltages. The capacity retention is attributed to the formation of copper sulphide with the slow corrosion of the current collector during cycling which is not ideal. Conventional reports on metal sulphides demonstrate excellent electrochemical performances using excessive carbon coatings/additives, reducing the overall energy density of the cells and making it difficult to understand the underlying side reaction with Cu. In this report, the negative influence of the Cu current collector is demonstrated with in-house synthesised, scalable NiS2 nanoparticles without any carbon coating as opposed to previous works on NiS2 anodes. Ex situ TEM and XPS experiments revealed the formation of Cu2S, further to which various current collectors were employed for NiS2 anode to rule out the parasitic reaction and to understand the true performance of the material. Overall, this study proposes the utilisation of carbon-coated aluminium foil (C/Al) as a suitable current collector for high active material content NiS2 anodes and metal sulphides in general with minimal carbon contents as it remains completely inert during the cycling process. Using a C/Al current collector, the NiS2 anode exhibits stable cycling performance for 5000 cycles at 50 A g-1, maintaining a capacity of 238 mA h g-1 with a capacity decay rate of 8.47 × 10-3% per cycle.",

        "abstract": "An engaging area of research in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has been focusing on discovery, design and synthesis of high-capacity cathode materials in order to boost energy density to levels close enough to the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Of particular interest, P2-type layered oxide, Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2, has been researched as a potential cathode in SIBs based on its high theoretical capacity of 260 mAh/g and use of non-critical materials. However, the reported synthesis methods are not only complex and energy-demanding, but also often yield inhomogeneous and impure materials with capacities less than 200 mAh/g under impractical test conditions. Here, we report a novel synthesis route using low temperature eutectic reaction to produce highly homogeneous and crystalline, and impurity-free P2-NaxFe1/2Mn1/2O2 with enhanced Na-ion diffusivity and kinetics. The overall electrochemical performances of the Na-ion cells have been improved by pairing the P2-cathode with pre-sodiated hard carbon anodes, leading to reversible capacities in the range of 180 mAh/g. This new approach is a contribution towards the simplification of synthesis and scalability of sodium-based cathodes with high crystallinity and fine-tuned morphology, and the realization of a sodium-ion battery system with lower cost and improved electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "CuO and its gallium composites with various compositions are successfully fabricated by using a hydrothermal technique followed by calcination at 900 °C. The added Ga precursors formed oxides in the composites, such as Ga2O3, CuGa2O4 and Cu4O3, as confirmed through the X-ray diffraction patterns as well as the HRTEM and SAED patterns. Further HRTEM analysis also confirmed that Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 phases reside on the surface of CuO in the composites with a CuO : Ga ratio of 90 : 10. The contents of various oxide phases varied when we increased the amount of Ga in the CuO composites. Changing the ratios of CuO and Ga precursors in the composites is quite effective in tailoring the sodium-ion storage behaviour of CuO. The resultant CuO/Ga composites exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries in terms of capacity, rate capability and cycling performance. The composite containing 90% CuO and 10% Cu/Ga oxides delivers the highest charge capacity of 661 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.07 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 73.1% even after 500 cycles. The structure and morphology of the composite (90% CuO and 10% Cu/Ga oxides) was successfully retained after 500 cycles, which was confirmed through ex situ XRD, SEM and HRTEM analyses. The composite also exhibited remarkable rate capability in which it delivered 96 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 6.6 A g−1. The enhanced electrochemical performances of CuO and its gallium composites are attributed to the presence of Cu4O3 and CuGa2O4 phases. The Cu4O3 phase is actively involved in the redox reaction and the CuGa2O4 phase stabilizes the CuO phase and buffers the volume expansion of CuO during cycling. The present approach eplores great opportunities for improving the electrochemical performance of oxide based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Metallic Sn has provoked tremendous progress as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, Sn anodes suffer from a dramatic capacity fading, owing to pulverization induced by drastic volume expansion during cycling. Herein, a flexible three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical conductive network electrode is designed by constructing Sn quantum dots (QDs) encapsulated in one-dimensional N,S co-doped carbon nanofibers (NS-CNFs) sheathed within two-dimensional (2D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) scrolls. In this ingenious strategy, 1D NS-CNFs are regarded as building blocks to prevent the aggregation and pulverization of Sn QDs during sodiation/desodiation, 2D rGO acts as electrical roads and “bridges” among NS-CNFs to improve the conductivity of the electrode and enlarge the contact area with electrolyte. Because of the unique structural merits, the flexible 3D hierarchical conductive network was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for SIBs, exhibiting ultra-long cycling life (373 mAh g^−1 after 5000 cycles at 1 A g^−1), and excellent high-rate capability (189 mAh g^−1 at 10 A g^−1). This work provides a facile and efficient engineering method to construct 3D hierarchical conductive electrodes for other flexible energy storage devices. 3D hierarchical conductive Sn quantum dots encapsulated in N,S co-doped carbon nanofibers sheathed within rGO scrolls (Sn/NS-CNFs@rGO) were prepared through an electrospinning process.

        "abstract": "A dual-mechanism energy storage strategy is proposed, involving the electrochemical process of sodium ion battery (SIB) and sodium metal battery (SMB). This strategy is expected to achieve a higher capacity than SIB, and obtain dendrite-free growth of SMB with a well-designed anode. Here, self-constructed bismuth with \"sodiophilic\" framework and rapid ion transmission characteristics is employed as the sodium host (anode) integrating alloy/de-alloy and plating/stripping process that suppresses the dendrite growth and overcomes the limited capacity of traditional anode. Benefited from this, the capacity (capacity contributed by alloy and plating of sodium in total) of 2000 mAh g-1 can be reached, which can retain up to 800 h at 1 A g-1 . Also, the capacity of 3100 mAh g-1 can be achieved that is ≈7.7 times than that of alloyed-bismuth (Bi). This work proposes a dual-mechanism strategy to tackle the dilemma of high-performance sodium (Na) storage devices, which opens a new avenue for the development of next-generation energy storage device.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is an attractive anode material for low cost and high energy density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), however, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) limits its practical battery application. To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process. More importantly, this presodiation reaction is very mild, highly eﬃcient and can be widely extended to a variety of Na-storage materials, offering a new route to develop high performance Na-storage materials for practical battery applications.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of a high-capacity anode material has been urgently required for commercializing sodium-ion batteries with a high energy density and an improved working safety. In the absence of thermodynamically stable sodium intercalated compounds with graphite, constructing nanostructures with expanded interlayer distances is still the mainstream of developing high-performance carbonaceous anodes. In this regard, a surface-functionalized and pore-forming strategy through a facile CO2 thermal etching route was rationally adopted to engineer negligible oxygenated functionalities on commercial carbon for boosting the sodium storage process. Due to the abundant ionic/electronic pathways and more active reaction sites in microporous structure with the noticeable pseudocapacitive behaviors, the functionalized porous carbon could achieve a highly reversible capacity of 505 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, an excellent rate performance of 181 mAh g-1 at 16000 mA g-1, and an exceptional rate cycle stability of 176 mAh g-1 at 3200 mA g-1 over 1000 cycles. These outstanding electrochemical properties should be ascribed to a synergistic mechanism, fully utilizing the graphitic and amorphous structures for synchronous intercalations of sodium ions and solvated sodium ion compounds, respectively. Additionally, the controllable generation and evolution of a robust but thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film with the emergence of obvious capacitive reactions on defective surface, favoring the rapid migrations of sodium ions and solvated species, also contribute to the remarkable electrochemical performances of porous carbon black.",

        "abstract": "Alloying‐type bismuth with high volumetric capacity has emerged as a promising anode for sodium‐ion batteries but suffers from large volume expansion and continuous pulverization. Herein, a coordination constraint strategy is proposed, that is, chemically confining atomic Bi in an intercalation host framework via reconstruction‐favorable linear coordination bonds, enabling a novel quasi‐topological intercalation mechanism. Specifically, micron‐sized Bi0.67NbS2 is synthesized, in which the Bi atom is linearly coordinated with two S atoms in the interlayer of NbS2. The robust Nb−S host framework provides fast ion/electron diffusion channels and buffers the volume expansion of Na+ insertion, endowing Bi0.67NbS2 with a lower energy barrier (0.141 vs. 0.504 eV of Bi). In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal that Bi atom alloys with Na+ via a solid‐solution process and is constrained by the reconstructed Bi−S bonds after dealloying, realizing complete recovery of crystalline Bi0.67NbS2 phase to avoid the migration and aggregation of atomic Bi. Accordingly, the Bi0.67NbS2 anode delivers a reversible capacity of 325 mAh g−1 at 1 C and an extraordinary ultrahigh‐rate stability of 226 mAh g−1 at 100 C over 25 000 cycles. The proposed quasi‐topological intercalation mechanism induced by coordinated mode modulation is expected to be be conducive to the practical electrode design for fast‐charging batteries.",

Herein, a novel single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu-C3 site (Bi@SA Cu-C) have been designed via the simple pyrolysis of metal-organic framework. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate the Cu-C3 sites accelerate the dissociation of P-F and C-O bonds in NaPF6-ether-based electrolyte and catalyze the formation of inorganic-rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase. In addition, the Cu-C3 sites with delocalized electron around Cu trigger an uneven charge distribution and induce an in-plane local electric field, which facilitates the adsorption of Na+ and reduces the Na+ migration energy barrier. Consequently, the obtained Bi@SA Cu-C achieves a state-of-the-art reversible capacity, ultrahigh rate capability, and long-term cycling durability. The as-constructed full cell delivers a high capacity of 351 mAh g-1 corresponding to an energy density of 265 Wh kg-1.

        "abstract": "Antimony tin (SnSb) based materials have become increasingly attractive as a potential anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their prominent merit of high capacity. However, cyclic stability and rate capability of SnSb anodes are currently hindered by their large volume change during repeated cycling, which results in severe capacity fading. Herein, we introduce carbon-coated centrifugally-spun SnSb@carbon microfiber (CMF) composites as high-performance anodes for SIBs that can maintain their structural stability during repeated charge-discharge cycles. The centrifugal spinning method was performed to fabricate SnSb@CMFs due to its high speed, low cost, and large-scale fabrication features. More importantly, extra carbon coating by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been demonstrated as an effective method to improve the capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency of the SnSb@CMF anode. Electrochemical test results indicated that the as-prepared SnSb@CMF@C anode could deliver a large reversible capacity of 798 mA h∙g−1 at the 20th cycle as well as a high capacity retention of 86.8% and excellent Coulombic efficiency of 98.1% at the 100th cycle. It is, therefore, demonstrated that SnSb@CMF@C composite is a promising anode material candidate for future high-performance SIBs.",

As anode for SIBs, the hGnw present outstanding sodium ion storage properties with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 82.4%, high reversible capacity (e.g., 416.1 mAh g−1 at 0.03 A g−1), excellent rate capability (e.g., 153.3 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1), and long‐term cycling stability (e.g., 152.7 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at 1.5 A g−1).",

In particular, SnS2 /Sb2 S3 heterostructures exhibited outstanding rate performance with capacities of 593 and 567 mA h g-1 at high current densities of 2 and 4 A g-1 , respectively, which could be ascribed to the dramatically improved Na+ diffusion kinetics and electrical conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Organic materials have attracted much attention in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) because of their advantages such as being environmentally benign and having high designability. Capacities and cycle life of organic materials are the most important parameters in most research which has been paid much effort to obtain an impressive electrochemical performance on the material level, and the sodium‐detachable ability of these materials to directly match with the sodium‐free anode is neglected. In this work, one organic sodium salt (C6H2Na2O6) exhibits the unique ability (charging first in half cell) unlike other reported organic cathode materials (normally discharging first) for SIBs. The redox mechanism and structure change are investigated by in situ and ex situ tests to give a better understanding for C6H2Na2O6. Satisfying electrochemical performance (74% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 0.05 A g−1 and 63% capacity retention at 5 A g−1 when compared with capacity at 0.05 A g−1) is achieved by the C6H2Na2O6 electrode. In addition, matched with hard carbon, full cells are assembled successfully like other transition metal containing cathode materials because C6H2Na2O6 electrode can deliver its sodium ions to a sodium‐free anode directly without any presodiation.",

        "abstract": "Explosive growth of the electric vehicle market has led to a substantial accumulation of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), causing significant environmental pollution and the wastage of precious metal resources. Thus, we developed a simple hydrothermal method to convert the spent LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC-811) cathode into CoNi-MOF. After the subsequent sulfidation process, waxberry-like Co0.11Ni0.89S@N-doped carbon composites (Co0.11Ni0.89S@NC), as a bimetallic sulfide solid solution, can be successfully synthesized to serve as high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The waxberry-like structure and strong S-C bonds between the carbon matrix and transition metal sulfides ensure the structural stability of the material during the cycle. Besides, the coexistence of Co and Ni in the bimetallic sulfide solid solution generates abundant lattice defects and modifies the electronic structures that significantly improve the charge transfer ability and Na+ diffusivity. The as-prepared Co0.11Ni0.89S@NC exhibits a high specific capacity of 622 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1, outstanding rate capacity of 370 mAh g−1 at 5000 mA g−1 and good cycling stability (330 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles at 5000 mA g−1). This study presents a promising approach for the recycling of spent LIBs into high-performance anodes for SIBs, thus achieving the transformation of waste into valuable resources.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides are promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their structural diversity and high theoretical capacity, but the severe capacity decay and inferior rate capability caused by poor structural stability and sluggish kinetics impede their practical applications. Herein, a cobalt-doped amorphous VS4 wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (i.e., Co0.5 -VS4 /rGO) is developed through a Co-induced defect engineering strategy to boost the kinetics performances. The as-prepared Co0.5 -VS4 /rGO demonstrates excellent rate capacities over 10 A g-1 and superior cycling stability at 5 A g-1 over 1600 cycles, which is attributed to the defects formed by Co doping, the formed amorphous structure and the robust rGO substrate. The great features of Co0.5 -VS4 /rGO anode are further confirmed in sodium-ion capacitors when the active carbon cathode is used. Additionally, the relationships between metal doping, the derived defects, the amorphous structure, and the sodium storage of VS4 are uncovered. This work provides deep insights into preparing amorphous functional materials and also probes the potential applications of metal sulfide-based electrode materials for advanced batteries.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulphides based on conversion reaction mechanism have attracted much attention as anode materials for sodium ion batteries owing to their theoretical specific capacity and potential long lifespan. The unsatisfactory Coulombic efficiency, however, inhabits the cycling lifespan due to the intermediate polysulphide formation (Na2Sx; 4 ≤ x ≤ 6) and chain reactions. To enhance the polysulphide adsorption capability and capacity, a hybrid with synergistic sodium storage and polysulphide adsorption capability was designed, in which massive CoS2 nanoparticles (CoS2 NP) were utilized as electrons supplier to enhance the adsorption energy of three‐dimensional nitrogen‐doped carbon (3D‐NC) framework towards sodium polysulphide. Combining the experimental and computational results, the encapsulated CoS2 can dramatically optimize the local electronic structure and function as a powerful electron reservoir to increase the effective adsorption to Na2Sx (4 ≤ x ≤ 6). Meanwhile, the electron transferring between CoS2 NP and 3D‐NC can facilitate the conversion of Na2S to Na2Sx. An ultra‐high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.05% and 98.38% can be achieved at current densities of 0.06 mA g‐1 and 0.4 A g‐1, respectively. Beneficial from the high reversible capability, a superior cycling lifespan is obtained up to 800 long cycles at current densities of 0.6 A g‐1.",

Here, a high‐rate and ultrastable alloying‐type anode based on the rolled‐up amorphous Si nanomembranes is demonstrated. The rolled‐up amorphous Si nanomembranes show a very small volume change during the sodiation/desodiation processes and deliver an excellent rate capability and ultralong cycle life up to 2000 cycles with 85% capacity retention. The structural evolution and pseudocapacitance contribution are investigated by using the ex situ characterization techniques combined with kinetics analysis. Furthermore, the mechanism of efficient sodium‐ion storage in amorphous Si is kinetically analyzed through an illustrative atomic structure with dangling bonds, offering a new perspective on understanding the sodium storage behavior. These results suggest that nanostructured amorphous Si is a promising anode material for high‐performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The engineering of plant-based precursor for nitrogen doping has become one of the most promising strategies to enhance rate capability of hard carbon materials for sodium-ion batteries; however, the poor rate performance is mainly caused by lack of pyridine nitrogen, which often tends to escape because of high temperature in preparation process of hard carbon. In this paper, a high-rate kapok fiber-derived hard carbon is fabricated by cross-linking carboxyl group in 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid with the exposed hydroxyl group on alkalized kapok with assistance of zinc chloride. Specially, a high nitrogen doping content of 4.24% is achieved, most of which are pyridine nitrogen; this is crucial for improving the defect sites and electronic conductivity of hard carbon. The optimized carbon with feature of high nitrogen content, abundant functional groups, degree of disorder, and large layer spacing exhibits high capacity of 401.7 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1, and more importantly, good rate performance, for example, even at the current density of 2 A g−1, a specific capacity of 159.5 mAh g−1 can be obtained. These findings make plant-based hard carbon a promising candidate for commercial application of sodium-ion batteries, achieving high-rate performance with the enhanced pre-cross-linking interaction between plant precursors and dopants to optimize aromatization process by auxiliary pyrolysis.",

        "abstract": "Layered SnS_2 nanosheets/reduced graphene fiber (SnS_2@rGF) hybrid fabrics were fabricated as binder-free electrodes. Ultralight rGF fabrics could increase the active materials loading to a high level of 67.2 wt% in the whole electrode, which is much higher than that of traditional slurry coating electrodes by using Cu or Al foil as current collectors. The practical capacity based on the weight of electrode could increase to as high as ~ 538 mAh g^−1 exceeding to the slurry coating electrodes. Generally, the practical capacity of an electrode should include the weight of non-active components such as current collector, polymer binder, and conductive additives, which were as high as 70 wt% in current reported works, seriously limiting the practical capacity. This work pioneered the usage of ultralight reduced graphene fiber (rGF) fabrics as conductive scaffolds, aiming to reduce the weight of non-active components and enhance the practical capacity. Ultrathin SnS_2 nanosheets/rGF hybrids were prepared and used as binder-free electrodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The interfused graphene fibers endow the electrode a porous, continuous, and conductive network. The in situ phase transformation from SnO_2 to SnS_2 could preserve the strong interfacial interactions between SnS_2 and graphene. Benefitting from these, the designed binder-free electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 500 mAh g^−1 after 500 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 A g^−1 with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the weight percentage of SnS_2 in the whole electrode could reach up to 67.2 wt%, much higher than that of common electrode configurations using Cu foil, Al foil, or carbon cloth, significantly highlighting the ultralight characters and advantages of the rGF fabrics for using as binder-free electrodes of SIBs.",

Hard carbon with a free-standing structure and plenty of active sites is considered to be the most potential anode material for SIBs. However, keeping a balance between the excellent performance and low cost for the large-scale commercial production of carbon anodes is still a great difficulty. Herein, a free-standing nitrogen-doped 3D hierarchically porous carbon monolith (denoted as 3DHPCM) anode for SIBs is successfully fabricated via a novel supercritical CO2 foaming technology and thermal treatment. Thanks to the tunable macro-meso-microporous and disordered structures, the 3DHPCM exhibits a high reversible specific capacity (281 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 50 mA g-1), superior rate performance (67 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and excellent long-term cycling stability (175 mA h g-1 after 3000 cycles at 500 mA g-1). Remarkably, the 3DHPCM with such a high performance is fabricated via an environmentally friendly strategy from low-cost polyacrylonitrile and polymethyl methacrylate. Therefore, the strategy has great potential in practical application for fabricating high-performance hard carbon anodes and other composite electrodes for SIBs and more energy storage devices.",

The Ni3 Se4 /CoSe2 @C exhibits excellent cyclic performance with a capacity of 420 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles for Na-storage and 330.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles for K-storage.

The sodium storage mechanism of the Ni3 Se4 /CoSe2 @C is revealed by ex situ X-ray powder diffraction, ex situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and in situ electrochemical impedance spectra analyses.

        "title": "Nitrogen-Doped TiO2–C Composite Nanofibers with High-Capacity and Long-Cycle Life as Anode Materials for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Abstract Nitrogen-doped TiO_2–C composite nanofibers (TiO_2/N–C NFs) were manufactured by a convenient and green electrospinning technique in which urea acted as both the nitrogen source and a pore-forming agent. The TiO_2/N–C NFs exhibit a large specific surface area (213.04 m^2 g^−1) and a suitable nitrogen content (5.37 wt%). The large specific surface area can increase the contribution of the extrinsic pseudocapacitance, which greatly enhances the rate capability. Further, the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions ( D _Na+) could be greatly improved by the incorporation of nitrogen atoms. Thus, the TiO_2/N–C NFs display excellent electrochemical properties in Na-ion batteries. A TiO_2/N–C NF anode delivers a high reversible discharge capacity of 265.8 mAh g^−1 at 0.05 A g^−1 and an outstanding long cycling performance even at a high current density (118.1 mAh g^−1) with almost no capacity decay at 5 A g^−1 over 2000 cycles. Therefore, this work sheds light on the application of TiO_2-based materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Olive-shaped anatase TiO2 with tunable sizes in nanoscale are designed employing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as structure directing agents to exert dramatic impacts on structure shaping and size manipulation. Notably, the introduced PVA simultaneously serves as carbon sources, bringing about a homogenous carbon layer with intimate coupling interfaces for boosted electronic conductivity. Constructed from tiny crystalline grains, the uniformly dispersed carbon-coated TiO2 nano-olives (TOC) possess subtle loose structure internally for prompt Na+ transportations. When utilized for sodium-ion storage, the size effects are increasingly significant at high charge-discharge rates, leading to the much superior rate performances of TOC with the smallest size. Bestowed by the improved Na+ adsorption and diffusion kinetics together with the promoted electron transfer, it delivers a high specific capacity of 267 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (33.6 mA g-1 ) and sustains 110 mAh g-1 at a rather high rate of 20 C. Even after cycled at 10 C over 1000 cycles, a considerable capacity of 125 mAh g-1 with a retention of 94.6% is still obtained, highlighting its marvelous long-term cyclability and high-rate capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have attracted considerable attention as potential organic anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their flexible chemical structure, high porosity, environmental friendliness, and cost effectiveness. However, the inherent shortcomings of organic electrodes, such as low conductivity, high solubility in electrolyte, narrow material utilization, etc., limit their further development. In this work, we successfully prepared a novel porous polyimide PPD containing multicarbonyl active centers via the polycondensation of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (DAAQ). The stable conjugated structure and multiple redox centers give the polymer high reversible specific capacity (244.6 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 100 mA/g), ultra-long cycle stability (100.7 mAh/g after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A/g), and predominant rate capability. Meanwhile, the sodium storage mechanism of the electrode materials during the charging and discharging process is investigated by ex-situ XPS/SEM analysis. Due to the exceptional electrochemical properties and simple synthesis method, this work may shed light on the preparation of polyimide-based anodes for high specific capacity and rate capability secondary batteries.",

The novel electrolyte combination developed here circumvents the dendritic Na deposition that is one of the primary concerns for battery safety and constructs the uniform ionic interlayer achieving highly reversible Na plating/stripping reactions.

We evaluate the suitability of monolayer Cu2N as an anode material for Li and Na-ion batteries by examining its storage capacity, diffusion barrier, open-circuit voltage (OCV), volume expansion, and the impact of defects on its electrochemical performance. The monolayer Cu2N demonstrates a storage capacity of 379.88 mAh.g−1 for both Li and Na, comparable to that of commercial graphite for Li (372 mAh.g−1) and significantly higher for Na (less than 35 mAh.g−1). The migration barriers for Li and Na are found to be 0.1 eV and 0.01 eV, respectively, substantially lower than those theoretically reported for commercial anodes TiO2 (0.4–1.0 eV) and graphite (∼0.4 eV), which imply that monolayer Cu2N demonstrates excellent charge/discharge capabilities. Moreover, the volume growth of monolayer Cu2N is 4.14 % with maximal Li adsorption, which is 2.4 times less than graphite. The analysis of vacancy defects reveals a significant enhancement in the binding energies of Li and Na atoms, accompanied by minimal changes in diffusion barriers. Since monolayer Cu2N has already been successfully synthesized, these findings would pave the way for large-scale experimental fabrication of monolayer Cu2N as a battery anode.",

        "abstract": "The hard carbon (HC) was emerging as one of the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Incorporation of cations into HC lattice proved to be effective to regulate their d-interlayer spacing with the modified SIBs performance. However, the complexity and high-cost of current synthetic processes limited its large-scale application in SIBs. Through the natural hyperaccumulation process, a cost-effective and scale up-driven procedure to produce Ca-ion self-incorporated HC materials was proposed by applying tamarind fruits as precursor with the enrichment of Ca-ions. In virtue of one-step pyrolysis, the self-incorporated and well-distributed Ca-ions in tamarind fruits had successfully served as the buffer layer to expand the d-interlayer spacing of HC materials. Furthermore, the natural porosity hierarchy could be largely preserved by the optimization of calcination temperature. As a result, the Ca-rich HC material had exhibited the optimized cycling performance (326.7 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and capacity retention rate of 89.40 % after 250 cycles) with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 70.39 %. This work provided insight on applying the hyperaccumulation effect of biomass precursors to produce doped HC materials with ions self-incorporation and the optimized d-interlayer spacing, navigating its large-scale application for the high-performance SIBs.",

Herein, a synergetic effect of atomic-interface engineering is employed for constructing 2H-MoS2 layers assembled on single atomically dispersed Fe-N-C (SA Fe-N-C) anode material that boosts its reversible capacity. The work-function-driven-electron transfer occurs from SA Fe-N-C to 2H-MoS2 via the Fe-S bonds, which enhances the adsorption of Na+ by 2H-MoS2, and lays the foundation for the sodiation process. A phase transfer from 2H to 1T/2H MoS2 with the ferromagnetic spin-polarization of SA Fe-N-C occurs during the sodiation/desodiation process, which significantly enhances the Na+ storage kinetics, and thus the 1T/2H MoS2/SA Fe-N-C display a high electronic conductivity and a fast Na+ diffusion rate.",

Nevertheless, the energy density (<100 Wh·kg-1) is usually limited by low specific capacity anodes (<150 mAh·g-1) and \"kinetics mismatch\" between the electrodes. Hence, we report a high energy density (153 Wh·kg-1) SHC based on a highly pseudocapacitive interface-engineered 3D-CoO-NrGO anode. This high-performance anode (445 mAh·g-1 @0.025 A·g-1, 135 mAh·g-1 @5.0 A·g-1) consists of CoO (∼6 nm) nanoparticles chemically bonded to the NrGO network through Co-O-C bonds. Exceptional pseudocapacitive charge storage (up to ∼81%) and capacity retention (∼80% after 5000 cycles) are also identified for this SHC. Excellent performance of the 3D-CoO-NrGO anode and SHC is owing to the synergistic effect of the CoO conversion reaction and pseudocapacitive sodium-ion storage induced by numerous Na2O/Co/NrGO nanointerfaces. Co-O-C bonds and the 3D microstructure facilitating efficient strain relaxation and charge-transfer correspondingly are also identified as vital factors accountable for the excellent electrochemical performance.

The density functional theory calculation indicates that the heterojunction interface between MnSe and FeSe2 has been successfully engineered so that Na+ can be readily adsorbed and rapidly converted, thus promoting the reaction kinetics and extending the cyclic life. As expected, the 3DOM-MnFeSex@C composite delivers excellent rate performance (277.6 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and prolonged cycling life (191.6 mA h g-1 even after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1) as a sodium storage anode.

        "abstract": "Recently, it has been reported that MXene is a promising pseudocapacitive material for energy storage, primarily due to its intercalation mechanism. However, Ti3C2Tx MXenes face challenges, such as inadequate layer spacing and low specific capacity, which greatly hinder their potential as anode materials for sodium storage. In this study, MXene was doped with sulfur to create a three-dimensional porous structure that resulted in an increased layer spacing. The sulfur-doped porous MXene (SPM) demonstrated exceptional performance as sodium ion battery anodes, with a capacity of 335.2 mA h g-1 after 490 cycles at 2 A g-1 and a long-term cycling performance of 256.1 mA h g-1 even after 2480 cycles at 5 A g-1. It is worth noting that the porous structure formed after sulfur-doping exhibits superior sodium storage performance compared to previously reported MXene-based electrodes. This highlights the feasibility of the structural construction strategy, offering an effective solution for energy storage and conversion applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as competitive substitutes for low-temperature applications due to severe capacity loss and safety concerns of lithium-ion batteries at − 20 °C or lower.

Such a hybrid shows an unprecedented rate performance (237.9 mAh g^−1 at 2 A g^−1) at − 60 °C, outperforming all reported SIB anode materials. Coupled with a Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 cathode, the energy density of the full cell can reach to 181.9 Wh kg^−1 at − 40 °C. Based on this work, a novel strategy of high-rate activation is proposed to enhance performances of Bi-based materials in cryogenic conditions by creating new active sites for interfacial reaction under large current.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries hold great promise for large-scale energy storage, but face significant challenges at extreme temperatures. Especially at high temperatures, side reactions and electrode dissolution are exacerbated by repeated cycling. It is therefore essential to optimize the electrolyte formulation. Here, a series of siloxane molecules are screened to boost the high-temperature performance of anode materials in SIBs. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening prefers to interact with anions, resulting in reduced P-F bonding and the formation of a NaF-rich solid electrolyte interphase. This association also raises the oxidation potential and improves the Na-ion transfer. Additionally, MDM inhibits the hydrolysis of PF6-, reducing the deleterious species in the electrolyte. Therefore, commercial Sn microparticles show a reversible capacity of 752 mAh g-1 at 60 oC after 750 cycles at 2 A g-1, much better than the case without MDM. This result exceeds the reported data at high temperatures. MDM as an electrolyte additive also improves the high-temperature performance of Bi and hard carbon. These results provide useful guidance for the rational selection of electrolyte additives for high-temperature sodium-ion batteries.",

By coupling with NaTi2 (PO4 )3 grown on CC as an anode, a quasi-solid-state flexible ARSIB with a high output voltage plateau of 1.6 V is successfully assembled, exhibiting a superior areal capacity of 0.56 mAh cm-2 and energy density of 0.92 mWh cm-2 .

While studies on local structural ordering have primarily focused on the intra-layer ordering, there has been limited research on the inter-layer stacking for the layered cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, the impact of the intra-layer and inter-layer local structural regulation on anionic kinetics and the structure stability are explored through experimental analysis and theoretical calculations. Cu2+ substitution is introduced to adjust the transition metal inter-layer structure of P2-Na0.67Mg0.28Mn0.72O2, obtaining a zig-zag stacked honeycomb superlattice structure in P2- Na0.67Cu0.14Mg0.14Mn0.72O2. The local structure regulation mitigates the cation migration, improves the structure reversibility even at a deeply desodiation state of Na0.05, and the reductive coupling between cationic and anionic redox processes facilitates electron transfer from oxygen to copper ions and governs the properties of electrochemical kinetics and hysteresis. A full cell with hard carbon anode shows commendable energy density at high power density. This study paves an optional path for enhancing the structure stability and dynamics of oxygen redox chemistry in P2-type cathode materials for sodium-ion battery systems.",

        "abstract": "MOF-based materials are a class of efficient precursors for the preparation of heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials that have been widely applied as anode materials for Na-ion batteries. Thereinto, sulfur is often introduced to increase defects and act as an active species to directly react with sodium ions. Although the sulfur introduction and high surface area can synergistically improve capacity and rate capability, the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and electrical conductivity of carbon material are inevitably reduced. Therefore, balancing sodium storage capacity and ICE is still the bottleneck faced by adsorbent carbon materials. Here, sulfur-encapsulated microporous carbon material with nitrogen, sulfur dual-doping (NSPC) is synthesized by postprocessing, achieving the reduced specific surface area by encapsulating sulfur in micropores, and the increased active sites by edge sulfur doping. The synergy between encapsulation and sulfur doping effectively balances specific capacity, rate capability, and ICE. The NSPC material exhibits capacities of 591.5 and 244.2 mAh g-1 at 0.5 and at 10 A g-1, respectively, and the ICE is as high as 72.3%. Moreover, the effect of nitrogen and sulfur on the improvement of electron/ion diffusion kinetics is resonantly demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. This synergistic preparation method may reveal a feasible thought for fabricating excellent-performance adsorption-type carbon materials for Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium dual-ion batteries (NDIBs) are attracting extensive attention recently because of their low cost and abundant sodium resources. However, the low capacity of the carbonaceous anode would reduce the energy density, and the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the anode during the initial cycles will lead to large amount consumption of Na+ in the electrolyte, which results in low Coulombic efficiency and inferior stability of the NDIBs. To address these issues, a phosphorus-doped soft carbon (P-SC) anode combined with a presodiation process is developed to enhance the performance of the NDIBs. The phosphorus atom doping could enhance the electric conductivity and further improve the sodium storage property. On the other hand, an SEI could preform in the anode during the presodiation process; thus the anode has no need to consume large amounts of Na+ to form the SEI during the cycling of the NDIBs. Consequently, the NDIBs with P-SC anode after the presodiation process exhibit high Coulombic efficiency (over 90%) and long cycle stability (81 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 after 900 cycles with capacity retention of 81.8%), far more superior to the unsodiated NDIBs. This work may provide guidance for developing high performance NDIBs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Graphite is currently utilized as anode materials for Li-ion batteries, but it is well-known that graphite does not show good electrochemical performances as the anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). It was also reported that the low electrochemical performances of graphite originated from the larger ionic radius of the sodium ion due to the required higher strain energy for sodium-ion intercalation into graphite leading to an unstable sodium-ion intercalated graphite intercalation compound (GIC). In this work, using first-principles calculations, we introduce pillaring effects of NanX (n = 3 and 4; X = F, Cl, or Br) halide clusters in GICs, which become electrochemically active for Na redox reactions. Specifically, to enable sodium-ion intercalation into graphite, the interlayer spacing of graphite is required to increase over 3.9 Å, and NanX halide cluster GICs maintain an expanded interlayer spacing of >3.9 Å. This enlarged interlayer spacing of NanX halide cluster GICs facilitates stable intercalation of sodium ions. Na3F, Na4Cl, and Na4Br halide clusters are identified as suitable pillar candidates for anode materials because they not only expand the interlayer spacing but also provide reasonable binding energy for intercalated sodium ions for reversible deintercalation. Based on the model analysis, theoretical capacities of Na3F, Na4Cl, and Na4Br halide cluster GICs are estimated respectively to be 186, 155, and 155 mA h g–1. These predictions would provide a rational strategy guiding the search for promising anode materials for SIBs.",

Herein, manganese is substituted with iron to synthesize a series of Na4Mn3‐xFex(PO4)2P2O7 (0≤x≤2, NMFPP) materials. Among these, the optimized Na4Mn1.5Fe1.5(PO4)2P2O7 (NMFPP‐1.5) sample exhibits the highest thermodynamic stability and electronic conductivity via theoretical calculations. Practically, NMFPP‐1.5 exhibits not only the largest gravimetric energy density of 378.5 Wh kg−1 (14.4% higher than NMPP) in SIBs, but also the least Mn dissolution and the fastest Na‐ion diffusion kinetics. In situ investigations illustrate the Na‐ion extraction/insertion of NMFPP‐1.5 as an imperfect solid‐solution reaction with lattice distortions. Notably, a kinetic‐controlled electrochemical‐chemical‐coupling discharge mechanism is proposed to understand the voltage hysteresis and additional voltage plateau phenomenon caused by the great kinetics difference between Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples. This coupling process facilitates the fast discharge capability of NMFPP‐1.5, guaranteeing for grid‐scale energy storage system application. Furthermore, the practical usability is validated by fabricating NMFPP‐1.5 with hard carbon.

        "abstract": "Highlights Hard-carbon anode dominated with ultra-micropores (< 0.5 nm) was synthesized for sodium-ion batteries via a molten diffusion–carbonization method. The ultra-micropores dominated carbon anode displays an enhanced capacity, which originates from the extra sodium-ion storage sites of the designed ultra-micropores. The thick electrode (~ 19 mg cm^−2) with a high areal capacity of 6.14 mAh cm^−2 displays an ultrahigh cycling stability and an outstanding low-temperature performance. Abstract Pore structure of hard carbon has a fundamental influence on the electrochemical properties in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Ultra-micropores (< 0.5 nm) of hard carbon can function as ionic sieves to reduce the diffusion of slovated Na^+ but allow the entrance of naked Na^+ into the pores, which can reduce the interficial contact between the electrolyte and the inner pores without sacrificing the fast diffusion kinetics. Herein, a molten diffusion–carbonization method is proposed to transform the micropores (> 1 nm) inside carbon into ultra-micropores (< 0.5 nm). Consequently, the designed carbon anode displays an enhanced capacity of 346 mAh g^−1 at 30 mA g^−1 with a high ICE value of ~ 80.6% and most of the capacity (~ 90%) is below 1 V. Moreover, the high-loading electrode (~ 19 mg cm^−2) exhibits a good temperature endurance with a high areal capacity of 6.14 mAh cm^−2 at 25 °C and 5.32 mAh cm^−2 at − 20 °C. Based on the in situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance results, the designed ultra-micropores provide the extra Na^+ storage sites, which mainly contributes to the enhanced capacity. This proposed strategy shows a good potential for the development of high-performance SIBs.",

The local structure of carbons is well-described by bilayers of curved graphene fragments, with fragment size increasing, and curvature decreasing with increasing pyrolysis temperature. A correlation is observed between the higher-voltage (slope) capacity and the defect concentration inferred from the size and curvature of the fragments. Meanwhile, a larger lower-voltage (plateau) capacity is observed in samples modeled by larger fragment sizes. Operando PDF data on two commercially relevant hard carbons reveal changes at higher-voltages consistent with sodium ions stored close to defective areas of the carbon, with electrons localized in the antibonding π*-orbitals of the carbon. Metallic sodium clusters approximately 13-15 Å in diameter are formed in both carbons at lower voltages, implying that, for these carbons, the lower-voltage capacity is determined by the number of regions suitable for sodium cluster formation, rather than by having microstructures that allow larger clusters to form. Our results reveal that local atomic structure has a definitive role in determining storage capacity, and therefore the effect of synthetic conditions on both the local atomic structure and the microstructure should be considered when engineering hard carbons.",

        "abstract": "Sn shows high volume expansion corresponding to its high capacity, hindering cycle performance. To resolve the problem, studies are being conducted on alloying metal elements with the Sn anode. For an overall analysis or optimization of various alloying conditions, atomistic simulations are used to investigate the atomic scale structural evolution in Sn anodes during Na infusion.\n                  In the present study, we choose Cu, Mn, and Ni as candidate metal elements for alloying, considering the conditions of metal elements. Then, the clustering behavior of metal elements as sodium infuses into Sn-M (M = Cu, Mn, Ni) alloy is investigated using an atomistic simulation. We find that Sn-M alloy is stable in an amorphous solid solution, and as Na atoms infuse, a phase transformation occurs such that M elements are separated out, forming M clusters and a NaxSn amorphous phase, which eventually causes a reduction in volume. Finally, a diffusion simulation is also conducted for Na infusion into spherical Sn-M nanoparticles, to see if the alloying element decreases the Na diffusion rate severely. The comparison of volume reduction and Na infusion rate suggests that Cu is the best alloying element for the Sn base alloy anode materials.",

Unlike MIL-101 with large pore structures, the pores in flexible MIL-53 and MIL-88B swell spontaneously upon the accommodation of PMo12. Particularly, the PMo12/MIL-88B/GO composites deliver an excellent specific capacity of 214.2 mAh g-1 for 600 cycles at 2.0 A g-1, with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 51.0%. The so-called \"breathing effect\" of flexible MOFs leads to the relatively tight confinement space for PMo12, which greatly modulates its electronic structure, affects the adsorption energy of Na+, and eventually reduces the trapping of sodium ions. Additionally, the straight and multidimensional channels in MIL-88B significantly accelerate ion diffusion, inducing favored energetic kinetics and thus generating high-rate performance.",

Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are heralded as the promising candidate for grid-scale energy storage systems due to their low cost and abundant sodium resources. Excellent rate capacity and outstanding cycling stability are always the goals for the SIBs. Up to now, nearly all the attentions are focused on the control of morphology and structure of the electrode material, but the influence of binder on its performance is neglected especially in the cathode material. Herein, using Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) as a subject, the influence of four different binders (sodium alginate, SA; carboxymethylcellulose sodium, CMC; polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF and polyacrylic latex, LA133) on its electrochemical performance was studied. As a result, when using SA as binder, the electrochemical performance of the NVPOF electrode is improved significantly, which is mainly because of the high water solubility, rich carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, high adhesive and cohesive properties of SA binder, leading to the uniform distribution of active materials NVPOF and carbon black in electrodes, good integrity, low polarization and superior kinetic properties of NVPOF electrodes, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. More importantly, when coupled with a hard carbon anode, the fabricated sodium-ion full-cells also exhibit excellent rate performance, thus providing a preview of their practical application. This work shows that the battery performance can be improved by matching the suitable binder systems, which is believed to have a great importance on the further optimization the electrochemical performance of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Waste tires provokeenvironmental problems, including harmful emissions from incineration and the ecological harms caused by landfilling, leading to increased interest in sustainable recycling methods for waste tires. In this study, we present an efficient methodology for converting waste tires to produce hard carbon, which can be used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. We specifically employed microwave heating, which offers selective and rapid heating by focusing on the fact that waste tires are mainly composed of carbon black and rubber. While rubber is not responsive to microwaves, the carbon black is highly effective microwave-absorbent. By exploiting this characteristic, microwave irradiation could instantly heat the carbon black within the waste tire and facilitate the carbonization process in only 1 min. When compared to the previously reported studies about waste tire derived carbon materials, which required approximately 24 h of processing time including sulfuric acid treatment and prolonged heat treatment, processing time was significantly reduced. Moreover, the electrochemical performance of SIBs based on the 1-minute microwave carbonization of waste tires demonstrated higher capacity and greater stability, even at high current densities, compared to a previous study that required 24 h of processing time.",

        "abstract": "Intensifying fossil fuel crisis has raised significant attention to the utilization of biomass energy, particularly biomass gasification technology, which is pivotal for its large-scale application. However, the generation of biomass tar during gasification remains a major obstacle. Due to the high carbon content of biomass tar and its compositional and property similarities to coal tar and pitch, this study explores the synthesis of nitrogen-doped biochar by combining urea with biomass tar, and evaluates its potential use as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. The synthesized material, denoted as NT2–1000 (with a urea-to-biomass tar mass ratio of 2:1 and a carbonization temperature of 1000 °C), exhibited a reversible capacity of 257.49 mAh g−1 at a current density of 25 mA g−1, achieving an initial coulombic efficiency of 59.34 %. After 50 cycles at 50 mA g−1, the capacity almost unchanged. At a higher current density of 1000 mA g−1, the material retained 70.33 % of its initial capacity of over 200 cycles (122.6 mAh g−1), demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability, which is desirable for sodium-ion battery anodes. This research presents a novel method for valorizing carbon from biomass tar, thus promoting the high-value use of waste products generated in energy production processes.",

However, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Na plating/stripping process and the problem of safety hinder their practical application.

The fluorinated phosphate molecules reduce the polarity of the solvent and lower the coordination number to Na+, which makes it possible to form the anion-induced ion-solvent-coordinated (AI-ISC) structures with high reduction tolerance. Moreover, the fluorination treatment enhances the oxidation resistance of the phosphate solvent, enabling compatibility with the high-voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode.

Notably, these nanosheets inherit an abundance of nitrogen sites from the precursor molecules, which are highly advantageous for sodium ion storage. In addition, the ultrathin nature of these nanosheets leads to significantly shorter ion transport pathways, enhancing their capacity for rapid ion storage compared to C2N particles.

The discharge capacity of the NCO-NBs remained 1080 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles at a current rate of 500 mA g(-1) and 884 mA h g(-1) could be obtained at a current density of 2000 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles. Even when cycled at a high density of 8000 mA g(-1), a comparable capacity of 630 mA h g(-1) could be achieved. Meanwhile, the Na storage behavior of NCO-NBs as anode materials of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) was initially investigated and they exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 826 mA h g(-1), and a moderate capacity retention of 328 mA h g(-1) was retained after 30 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance for NCO-NBs could be attributed to the hierarchical hollow structure and the desirable composition, which provide enough space to alleviate volume expansion during the Li(+)/Na(+) insertion/extraction process and facilitate rapid transport of ions and electrons.",

        "abstract": "Fast-charging sodium ion batteries remain deeply challenged by the lack of suitable carbonaceous anodes that exhibit intercalation plateau with fast kinetics. Here we develop a few-layer graphitic carbon with nanoscale architecture, which enables shortened Na+ ion diffusion path and fast formation of fully intercalated phase at the same time. Combined in situ Raman and electrochemical test reveal that this graphitic carbon with highly crystalline few layers follows surface-controlled intercalation rather than typical diffusion-controlled kinetics observed in natural graphite. As a result, a few-layer graphitic carbon anode maintains the reversible capacity of 106 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 and achieves 87% capacity retention even after 10 000 cycles at 1 A g-1. This work provides new insight on the Na storage mechanism in fast-charging graphitic carbon as well as the design of carbon anodes for high-rate sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Polyanion-type Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is an overwhelmingly attractive cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high structural stability and fast Na+ mobility. However, its practical application is strongly plagued by either nanoscale particle size or poor rate performance. Herein, a micro/nanocomposite NVP cathode with a hierarchical porous structure is proposed to solve the problem. The microscale NVP material assembled by interconnected nanoflakes with N-doped carbon coating that is capable of simultaneously providing fast carrier transmission dynamics and outstanding structural integrity exhibits precedent sodium-storage behavior. It delivers a superior rate capability (79.1 mAh g-1 at 200C) and excellent long-life cycling (capacity retention of 73.4% after 10 000 cycles at 100C). Remarkably, a pouch-type sodium-ion full cell consisting of the as-obtained NVP cathode and a hard carbon anode demonstrates the gravimetric energy density as high as 212 Wh kg-1 and an exceptional rate performance (71.8 mAh g-1 at 10C). Such structural design of fabricating micro/nanocomposite electrode materials is expected to accelerate the practical applications of SIBs for large-scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "The characteristics of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at both the cathode and anode interfaces are crucial for the performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The research demonstrates the merits of a balanced organic component, specifically the organic sodium alkyl sulfonate (ROSO2Na) featured in this work, in conjunction with the inorganic sodium fluoride (NaF), to enhance the interfacial stability. Using a customized electrolyte, it has optimized the interphase, curbing excess NaF production, and created a thin and uniform NaF/ROSO2Na-rich SEI layer. It offers exceptional protection against interface deterioration, transition metal dissolution, and concurrently ensures a consistent reduction in interfacial impedance. This creative approach results in a substantial improvement in the performance of both the Na0.9Ni0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 cathode and the hard carbon anode. The cathode demonstrates remarkable average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.9% and a capacity retention of 81% after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Ah-level pouch cell has shown outstanding performance with an 87% capacity retention after 400 cycles.

        "abstract": "High-energy sodium-ion batteries have a significant prospective application as a next-generation energy storage technology. However, this technology is severely hindered by the lack of large-scale production of battery materials. Herein, a self-standing film, assembled with SnS-Sn/multiwalled carbon nanotubes encapsulated in carbon fibers (SnS-Sn/MCNTs@CFs), is prepared using ball milling and electrospinning techniques and used as sodium-ion battery anodes. To compensate the poor internal conductivity of SnS-Sn nanoparticles, MCNTs are used to interweave SnS-Sn nanoparticles to improve the conductivity. Moreover, the designed three-dimensional carbon fiber conductive network can effectively shorten the diffusion path of electron/Na+, accelerate the reaction kinetics, and provide abundant active sites for sodium absorption. Benefiting from these unique features, the self-standing film offers a high reversible capacity of 568 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability at 1 A g-1 with a reversible capacity of 359.3 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles. In the sodium-ion full cell device, the capacity is stable at 283.7 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current of 100 mA g-1.

A general strategy for the preparation of hierarchical carbon-coated metal sulfide (MS⊂C) spheres through thermal sulfurization of metal glycerate has been developed. We demonstrate the concept by synthesizing highly uniform hierarchical carbon coated vanadium sulfide (V2 S3 ⊂C) spheres, which exhibit a highly reversibly sodium storage capacity of 777 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 , excellent rate capability (410 mAh g-1 at 4000 mA g-1 ), and impressive cycling ability.",

Here, we report the preparation of a N, S co-doped carbon nanotube hollow architecture confining CoS2 (CoS2/NSCNHF) derived from bimetal-organic-frameworks. The rationally designed structure possesses excellent Li+/Na+ storage performances. Further investigation of the Li+/Na+ storage behavior indicated the presence of a partial pseudocapacitive contribution, facilitating the fast Li+/Na+ interaction/extraction process and thus giving it superb electrochemical property. This work may represent an important step forward in the fabrication of MOF-derived hierarchical hybrids combined with a hollow structure and TMCs to help such TMCs achieve their potential in energy storage systems.",

However, the inadequate transport kinetics of Na+ ions and complex interfacial reactions at the hard carbon anode surface hinder the practical implementation of commercial sodium‐ion batteries. Herein, a novel approach to address this issue by introducing a homogenized functional carbon coating layer with a locally curved configuration is proposed. This coating layer is designed to accommodate single CoN4 sites on the surface of commercial hard carbon particles, resulting in enhanced sodium storage performance at low temperatures. The surface‐modified hard carbon anode material (HC‐Z1) demonstrates a commendable rate performance of 220.6 mAh g−1 at 3 A g−1@25 °C and a substantial reversible capacity of 288.7 mAh g−1 with an 89% capacity retention at 0.06 A g−1@‐20 °C. Furthermore, even at a temperature as low as −40 °C, the reversible capacity remains at 270 mAh g−1 at 0.06 A g−1. Extensive characterizations and theoretical calculations provide evidence that the optimized interface between the electrode and electrolyte effectively enhances the desolvation and migration of Na+ ions, particularly at low temperatures.",

The thermal runaway onset temperature for such cells is noticeably higher than that for the NMC‐based LIBs. We show that thermal runaway is triggered by the anode and the separator decomposition rather than by the processes at the cathode.

        "abstract": "One obstacle in sodium ion batteries is the lack of suitable anode materials. As recently shown, the most common anode material of the state of the art lithium ion batteries, graphite, can be used for sodium ion storage as well, if ether-based electrolyte solvents are used. These solvents cointercalate with the sodium ions leading to the highly reversible formation of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GIC). In order for the solvent cointercalation to work efficiently, it is expected that only a very thin surface layer forms during electrochemical cycling. In this article, we therefore present the first dedicated study of the surface layer evolution on t-GICs using soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This technique with its inherent high surface sensitivity and low probing depth is an ideal tool to study the underlying interfacial reactions during the sodiation and desodiation of graphite. In this report, we apply this approach to graphite composite electrodes cycled in Na half cells with a 1 M sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide/tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (NaFSI/TEG-DME) electrolyte. We have found a surface layer on the cycled electrodes, mainly composed of salt decomposition products and hydrocarbons, in line with irreversible capacity losses observed in the electrochemical cycling. Although this surface layer does not seem to block cointercalation completely, it seems to affect its efficiency resulting in a low Coulombic efficiency of the studied battery system.",

Combining the merits of both yolk-shell structure and conductive SWNT channels, the as-prepared Fe1-xS/SWNT@C composite manifests high reversible capacity and ultralong cycling stability up to 8700 cycles. Moreover, it displays the best rate capability (317 mA h g-1 at 20 A g-1 for Na+, and 236 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 for K+) among the reported yolk-shell structures and iron sulfide-based anodes thus far. The kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations further reveal that the Fe1-xS/SWNT heterointerface can effectively enhance the reversibility of K+ storage and decrease the K+ diffusion energy barrier, leading to excellent pseudocapacitive behavior and fast ion transportation for outstanding rate capability.",

        "title": "Rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within ZnSe-C hollow porous spheres for high-performance lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "Rechargeable battery systems, including Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries, have attracted great interest in energy storage because of their high energy density, low cost, efficient energy storage and suitable redox potential. Nevertheless, their rapid development is still greatly hampered by some typical constraints including low coulombic efficiency, large volume changes and severe particle agglomeration and pulverization during the charge-discharge process. Here, we fabricate a few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe-C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite through a simple self-assembly strategy followed by selenization, which efficiently circumvents these problems. The fabricated ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode demonstrates diverse advantages, including the existence of a few-layer structure, an in situ porous carbon matrix, multicomponent coordination and excellent pseudocapacitive behavior. When used as an anode material, it displays extraordinarily attractive electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The reversible capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C for LIBs reaches as high as 1051 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 (150 cycles). A long-term high-rate cycling test reveals an excellent stability of 524 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 600 cycles. In addition, for SIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C also manifests a high initial coulombic efficiency of 89% at 0.2 A g-1 and a remarkable reversible capacity of 381 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 4 A g-1 even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. This is one of the best performances of ZnSe-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. The regulation strategy reported in the present work is expected to offer new insights into the fabrication of high performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are regarded as one of the ideal anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacity and strong electrochemical activity; nonetheless, it still faces challenges such as large volume variation and low conductivity during chemical reactions for applications. Herein, the nanocubes of carbon-encapsulated NiS2/CoS2 embedded porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrixes (NiS2/CoS2@NC@C) are synthesized as a high-performance anode by in-situ carbonizing and subsequently sulphurating the resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF)-coated Ni-Co-based Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The RF-derived carbon shell acts as a rigid skeleton to effectively relieve the bulk stress during charging and discharging for ensuring the structure integrity, while the porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix improves the electronic conductivity, presents rich channels for ion/electron transfer and inhibits the agglomeration of active material during chemical reaction. In addition, the lattice distortion at the heterogeneous interface of the NiS2/CoS2 allows the redistribution of electrons, promoting the chemical reaction kinetics. Consequently, the NiS2/CoS2@NC@C nanocubes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties: a high discharge capacity of 489.9 mA h g−1 after 170 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 (920.6/807.9 mA h g−1 for the initial discharge/charge capacity with the initial coulomb efficiency of 87.7%) and a discharge capacity of 349.7 mA h g−1 with the CE close to 100.0% at 5.0 A g−1 even after 2000 cycles. This study proposes a viable approach for the effective construction of advanced anodes with unique micromorphology and chemical composition based on bimetallic PBAs for SIBs.",

The glass fiber matrix provided mechanical strength to the CSE and enabled a robust, self-supporting separator. This strategy enabled the development of CSEs with high loadings of PEG as a plasticizer to enhance the ionic conductivity. The fabrication of these CSEs was done under ambient conditions, which was highly scalable and can be easily implemented in roll-to-roll processing. While NaClO4 was found to be unstable with the sodium-metal anode, the use of a NaFSI salt was found to promote stable stripping and plating in a symmetric cell, reaching current densities of as high as 0.67 mA cm-2 at 60 °C. The PEGDA + PEG + NaFSI separators were then used to form solid-state full cells with a cobalt-free, low-nickel layered Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode and a sodium-metal anode, achieving a full capacity utilization exhibiting 70% capacity retention after 50 cycles at a cycling rate of C/5 at 60 °C.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is one of potential alternatives to lithium-ion battery, because of abundant resources and lower price of sodium. High electrical conductivity and long-term durability of MXene are advantageous as the anode material of SIB, but low energy density restricts applications. Tin phosphide possesses high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, and large energy density, but volume expansion reduces its cycling stability. In this study, tin phosphide particles are in-situ encapsulated into MXene conductive networks (SnxPy/MXene) by hydrothermal and phosphorization processes as novel anode materials of SIB. MXene amounts and hydrothermal durations are investigated to evenly distribute SnxPy in MXene. After 100 cycles, SnxPy/MXene reaches high specific capacities of 438.8 and 314.1 mAh/g at 0.2 and 1.0 A/g, respectively. The capacity retentions of 6.0% and 73.6% at 0.2 A/g are respectively obtained by SnxPy and SnxPy/MXene. The better specific capacity and cycling stability of SnxPy/MXene are attributed to less volume expansion of SnxPy during charge/discharge processes and relieved self-stacking of MXene by encapsulating SnxPy particles between MXene layers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique are also applied to analyze the charge storage mechanism in SIB. Higher sodium ion diffusion coefficient and smaller charge-transfer resistance are obtained by SnxPy/MXene.",

        "abstract": "Heterostructure design and integration with conductive materials play a crucial role in enhancing the conversion kinetics of electrode materials for metal-ion batteries. However, integrating nanocrystal heterojunctions into a conductive layer to form a superstructure is a significant challenge, mainly due to the difficulty in maintaining the structural integrity. Here we report a unique glucose-induced heterogeneous nucleation method that enables the independent manipulation of nucleation and growth of Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanocrystals within 2D layers. Our investigations reveal that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO superstructure is formed by a topological transformation induced by subsequent heat treatment of the initial hydrothermally prepared rGO-MoO2-rGO precursor. This novel structure embeds Mo2C/MoC heterojunction nanocrystals within a 2D graphene matrix, providing enhanced mechanical stability, accelerated Na+ transport, and improved electron conduction. Ex situ XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses reveal that the rGO-Mo2C/MoC-rGO superstructure significantly enhances the stability and reversibility of anodes. Leveraging these unique characteristics, the newly developed superstructural anode exhibits remarkable long-term cycling stability and outstanding rate performance. As a result, superstructure anodes demonstrate superior electrochemical capabilities, delivering a specific capacity of 106 mAh/g after enduring 5000 cycles at 1 A/g. Our study underscores the critical importance of superstructure design in propelling the advancement of battery materials.",

However, the limited electronic conductivity and large volume expansion severely hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a covalent coupling strategy for TMS-based anode materials using amide linkages to bind TMSs and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In the synthesis, the thiourea acts as not only the capping agent for morphology control but also the linking agent for the covalent coupling. As a proof of concept, the covalently coupled ZnS/CNT composite (CC-ZnS/CNT) has been prepared, with ZnS nanoparticles (∼10 nm) tightly anchored on CNT bundles. The compact ZnS-CNT heterojunctions are greatly beneficial to facilitating the electron/ion transfer and ensuring structural stability. Due to the strong coupling interaction between ZnS and CNTs, the composite presents prominent pseudocapacitive behavior and highly reversible electrochemical processes, thus leading to superior long-term stability and excellent rate capability, delivering reversible capacities of 333 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 over 4000 cycles for LIBs and 314 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 500 cycles for SIBs.

In this work, nongraphitic high-surface porous carbons (NGHSPCs) exhibited an unprecedented formation of n-stages (stage-1 and stage-2) due to the co-intercalation of sodium (Na(dgm)2C20) with diglyme. X-ray diffraction patterns, Patterson diagram, Raman spectra, and IR spectra suggested the presence of n-stages. This phenomenon implies an increase of the initial capacity (∼200 mAh g-1) and good Na-ion diffusion (2.97 × 10-13 cm2 s-1), employing diglyme as compared to standard electrolytes containing propylene carbonate and fluoroethylene carbonate. Additionally, the current approach is scalable to full Na- and Mg-ion cells by using t-Na5V(PO4)2F2 and MgMnSiO4 cathodes, respectively, reaching 250 and 110 W h kg-1 based on the anode mass.

        "abstract": "Hollow K0.27MnO2 nanospheres as cathode material were designed for aqueous sodium ion batteries (SIBs) using polystyrene (PS) as a template. The samples were systematically studied by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. As cathode materials for aqueous SIBs, the hollow structure can effectively improve the sodium storage property. A coin cell with hollow K0.27MnO2 as cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as anode exhibits a specific capacity of 84.9 mA h g(-1) at 150 mA g(-1), and the capacity of 56.6 mA h g(-1) is still maintained at an extremely high current density of 600 mA g(-1). For full cell measurement at the current density of 200 mA g(-1), 83% capacity retention also can be attained after 100 cycles. The as-designed hollow K0.27MnO2 nanospheres demonstrate long cyclability and high rate capability, which grant the potential for application in advanced aqueous SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The practical application of sodium (Na) metal anode has been seriously hindered by the uncontrolled Na dendrite growth and severe volume expansion inducing short battery lifespan and safety concerns. Here, highly sodiophilic and ultrafine ZnS‐modified carbon fibers have been rationally constructed as a scaffold to obviate these drawbacks. The in situ generated Na2S‐reinforced fast ion transport interphase and the effective space confinement synergistically facilitate the fast sodium ion interfacial transfer and the homogeneous and dendrite‐free Na deposition, thus enabling high‐rate and dendrite‐free Na metal anode. The modified Na metal demonstrates ultrahigh rate capability (15 mA cm−2) and ultralong cycling life (5300 cycles). Moreover, the Na|Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cell delivers ultrahigh rate capability (80 C) and extraordinarily ultralong lifespan cycling durability (2980 cycles). The Na|NVP pouch cell also exhibits an extraordinarily ultralong‐term cycle life of over 1070 cycles with an extremely low capacity decay rate of 0.0088% per cycle at 10 C. This work provides a facile and efficient strategy to propel the Na metal anode towards practicability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion energy storage is of the most attractive candidate for commercialization adoption due to the safety and cost demands of large‐scale energy storage systems, but its low energy density, slow charging capability, and poor cycle stability are yet to be overcome. Here, a strategy is reported to realize high‐performance sodium‐ion energy storage using battery‐type anode and capacitor‐type cathode materials. First, nitrogen‐doped mesoporous titanium dioxide (NMTiO2) structures are synthesized via the controlled pyrolysis of metal–organic frameworks. They exhibit interconnected open mesopores allowing fast ion transport and robust cycle stability with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, along with rich redox‐reactive sites allowing high capacity even at a high rate of ≈90 C. Moreover, assembling the NMTiO2 anode with the nitrogen‐doped graphene (NG) cathode in an asymmetric full cell shows a high energy density exceeding its counterpart symmetric cell by more than threefold as well as robust cycle stability over 10 000 cycles. Additionally, it gives a high‐power density close to 26 000 W kg−1 outperforming that of a conventional sodium‐ion battery by several hundred fold, so that full cells can be charged within a few tens of seconds by the flexible photovoltaic charging and universal serial bus charging modules.",

        "abstract": "Antimony (Sb)-based materials have shown great promise as anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their elevated theoretical capacity and favorable operating voltage. Nevertheless, a significant challenge limiting their practical application is the considerable volume change experienced during charge and discharge cycles. Herein, Sb/SnO2@C hybrid nanocomposites were synthesized utilizing glucose as a carbon source through a one-step hydrothermal self-assembly method. The coexistence of Sb and SnO2 phases within the carbon layer will mutually buffer due to their different reaction potentials, effectively alleviating volume expansion. Meanwhile, the highly disordered and amorphous carbon component of the composite has numerous defects, which provide abundant active sites and further mitigate the volume expansion effects to some degree. As a result, the Sb/SnO2@C composite, when utilized as an anode in LIBs, exhibits a reversible capacity of 302.6 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 100 mA/g and demonstrates remarkable long-term cycle stability, maintaining a capacity of 208.6 mAh/g at 1000 mA/g after 3000 cycles. When applied in SIBs, it achieves a reversible specific capacity of 305.8 mAh/g following 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA/g and maintains a capacity of 115.3 mAh/g following 2000 cycles at 1000 mA/g.

        "abstract": "Sn4P3, owing to its high theoretical volumetric capacity, good electrical conductivity, and relatively appropriate potential plateau, has been recognized as an ideal anode for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, the current synthetic routes for Sn4P3-based nanohybrids typically involve foreign-template-based multistep procedures, limiting their large-scale production and applications in NIBs. Using commercial red phosphorus (CRP) as the phosphorus source and nontoxic ethanolamine as the solvent, we herein report a facile and scalable solvothermal protocol for the one-step preparation of Sn4P3-reduced oxide graphene (denoted as Sn4P3-rGO) hybrid materials. Benefiting from the novel strategy and elaborate design, ultrasmall Sn4P3 nanoparticles (2.7 nm on average) are homogeneously anchored onto rGO. The high conductivity of the rGO network and the short electron/ion diffusion path of ultrasmall Sn4P3 nanoparticles give the Sn4P3-rGO hybrid high capacities and stable long-term cyclability. Specifically, the optimized Sn4P3-rGO hybrid displays a remarkable reversible capacity of 663.5 mA h g-1 at a current density of 200 mA g-1, ultralong-term cycle life (301 mA h g-1 after 2500 cycles at a high current density of 2000 mA g-1), and excellent rate capability, presenting itself as a highly promising anode material for NIBs.",

This work shows that in situ carbon coating during the synthesis process has multiple synergistic effects and can effectively stabilize the material structure and improve the cyclability. It is found that sodium vacancy and carbon coating in NaCrO2 synchronously occur, which improve its sodium‐ion transport kinetics, structural stability during cycling and the air stability. More importantly, the strategy is universal in that various sources of carbon display similar effect. As a result, the asphalt‐derived carbon coated material has a high initial capacity of 129 mAh g‐1 at 0.1 C rate with an initial Coulombic efficiency up to 98.2%. In addition, it shows an excellent rate capability and cycling performance with 81.1% retention after 1000 cycles at 5 C in half cell. Moreover, a full cell has constructed by coupling with hard carbon anode, which shows a high discharge capacity of 121.9 mAh g‐1 with a high Coulomb efficiency of 94.7%, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability.

Hence, controlling the solubility and improving the thermal stability of compounds are essential to make them more viable options for use as battery electrodes. This study shows a crystal engineering approach to stabilize the cluster with organic guanidinium (Gdm+) cation through the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the amino groups of the cation and the anion. The comparison of solubility and thermal stability of the Gdm{V10} with another cluster bearing tetrabutylammonium (Tba+) cation reveals the better stability of cation-anion assembly in the former than the latter. As a result, the Gdm{V10} delivers better rate capability and cycling stability than Tba{V10} when tested as anode material in a half-cell configuration of a sodium-ion battery. Finally, the performance of the Gdm{V10} anode is also investigated in a lithium-ion battery full cell with LiFePO4 cathode.",

The doped oxygen atoms exist dominantly in the form of carbon-oxygen double bonds, supplying sufficient Na storage sites through an addition reaction. More importantly, it is unexpected that the random carbon layers on the surface are reconstructed into a quasi-ordered arrangement by robust mechanical force, which is low-defect and favorable for suppressing the formation of thick solid electrolyte interfaces. As such, the obtained carbon presents a large reversible capacity of 363 mAh g-1 with a high ICE up to 83.1%. In addition, owing to the surface-dominated capacity contribution, an ultrafast Na storage is achieved that the capacity remains 139 mAh g-1 under a large current density of 100 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Biomass‐derived carbon as energy storage materials have gradually attracted widespread attention due to their low cost, sustainability, and inherent structural advantages. Herein, hard carbon (H‐1200) and porous carbon (PC‐800) for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), sodium‐ion capacitors (SICs) half cells and sodium‐ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have been synthesized from the same biomass precursor of Camellia shells through different treatments. H‐1200 synthesized by directly high‐temperature carbonization possesses a rational graphitic layer structure and plentiful heteroatoms. When applied as anode for SIBs, it exhibits a reversible capacity of 365.5 mAh g–1 at 25 mA g–1 and capacity retention 89.0% after 400 cycles at 200 mA g–1. Additionally, PC‐800 prepared by catalytic carbonization of K2C2O4/CaC2O4 hybrid catalyst has a sophisticated porous structure and a high surface area of 2186.9 m2 g–1. When employed as a cathode for SICs, it delivers a maximum capacity 104.2 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1 and 35.0 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1. Furthermore, the all carbon assembled SIHC (H‐1200||PC‐800) using H‐1200 as anode and PC‐800 as cathode, features a broad output voltage range (0.01 ~ 4.1 V), high energy density of 161.5 Wh kg–1, power density of 12896.1 W kg–1, and superior capacity retention of 90.32% after 10000 cycles at 10 A g–1. This research result provide a new horizon for constructing low‐cost and large‐scale production of biomass derived carbon for energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Futuristic wearable electronics desperately need power sources with similar flexibility and durability. In this regard, the authors, therefore, propose a scalable PAN-PMMA blend-derived electrospinning protocol to fabricate free-standing electrodes comprised of cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanocube cathode and tin metal organic framework-derived nanosphere anode, respectively, for flexible sodium-ion batteries. The resulting unique inter-networked nanofiber mesh offers several advantages such as robust structural stability towards repeated bending and twisting stresses along with appreciable electronic/ionic conductivity retention without any additional post-synthesis processing. The fabricated flexible sodium ion full cells deliver a high working voltage of 3.0 V, an energy density of 273 Wh·kg-1 , and a power density of 2.36 kW·kg-1 . The full cells retain up to 86.73% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at a 1.0 C rate. After intensive flexibility tests, the full cells also retain 78.26% and 90.78% of the initial capacity after 1000 bending and twisting cycles (5 mm radius bending and 40o axial twisting), respectively. This work proves that the proposed approach can also be employed to construct similar robust, free-standing nanofiber mesh-based electrodes for mass-producible, ultra-flexible, and durable sodium ion full cells with commercial viability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium titanate (Na2Ti6O13) exhibits great potential as a sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anode material, nevertheless the limited electronic conductivity markedly hampers its applications. To combat this shortcoming, carbon coating has been widely employed to fabricate Na2Ti6O13/C composites; however, this method requires a high-temperature processing that is energy-intensive releases environmental pollutants. Herein, silver is used as a novel conducting agent, and we demonstrated a simple and efficient method to prepare Ag@Na2Ti6O13 composites. We find that nano-sized silver particles (3%) are well distributed on the Na2Ti6O13 surface, leading to boosted conductivity of the composites. As a result, the Ag@Na2Ti6O13 electrode exhibits an excellent performance for Na+ insertion, where after 100 cycles a discharge capacity of 189 mAh g\n                     −1 is achieved, demonstrating superior capacity retention of 97.9%. The result of silver coating on the battery performance was investigated coherently by various techniques, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

        "abstract": "As a star representative of transition metal sulfides, SnS is viewed as a promising anode-material candidate for sodium ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and unique layered structure. However, the extremely poor electrical conductivity and severe volume expansion strongly hinder its practical application while achieving a high reversible capacity with long-cyclic stability still remains a grand challenge. Herein, different from the conventional enhancement method of elemental doping, we report a rational strategy to introduce PO4\n                     3− into the SnS layers using phytic acid as the special phosphorus source. Intriguingly, the presence of PO4\n                     3− in the form of Sn–O–P covalent bonds can act as a conductive pillar to buffer the volume expansion of SnS while expanding its interlay spacing to allow more Na+ storage, supported by both experimental and theoretical evidences. Profiting from this effect combined with microstructural metrics by loading on high pyridine N-doped reduced graphene oxide, the as-prepared material presented an unprecedented ultra-long cyclic stability even after 10,000 cycles along with high reversible capacity and excellent full-cell performances. The findings herein open up new opportunities for elevating electrochemical performances of metal sulfides and provide inspirations for the fabrication of advanced electrode materials for broad energy use.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential as an emerging energy storage solution. Tin sulfide (SnS) has emerged as a promising anode material for SIBs due to its impressive theoretical specific capacity of 1022 mA h g-1 and excellent electrical conductivity. However, its practical application has been hindered by issues such as large volume expansion, which adversely affects cycling stability and rate performance during the charge/discharge processes. In this study, a novel approach to address these issues by synthesizing the bean pod cube hollow metal-organic framework (MOF)-SnSx/NC@N-doped carbon nanofibers through a process involving electrospinning, PDA coating, and calcination. The Sn-MOF serves as a self-sacrificing template, facilitating the simultaneous dissociation of MOF and polymerization of dopamine, leading to the creation of hollow intermediates that retain tin components. Subsequent sulfidation results in the integration of the hollow MOF-SnSx/NC nanoparticles within 3D nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers, forming the distinctive bean pod cube composite structure. This unique configuration effectively shortens the diffusion path and mitigates volume expansion for sodium ions, ultimately yielding an exceptional high rate performance of 130 mA h g-1 (10 A g-1) and an ultralong cycling performance of 328 mA h g-1 even after 3500 cycles (2 A g-1) as the anode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials are promising sodium-ion battery anodes. Improving their performance requires a detailed understanding of the ion transport in these materials, some important aspects of which are still under debate. In this work, nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon spheres (N-PHCSs) are employed as a model system for operando analysis of sodium storage behavior in a commercial liquid electrolyte at the nanoscale. By combining the ex situ characterization at different states of charge with operando transmission electron microscopy experiments, it is found that a solvated ionic layer forms on the surface of N-PHCSs at the beginning of sodiation, followed by the irreversible shell expansion due to the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and subsequent storage of Na(0) within the porous carbon shell. This shows that binding between Na(0) and C creates a Schottky junction making Na deposition inside the spheres more energetically favorable at low current densities. During sodiation, the SEI fills the gap between N-PHCSs, binding spheres together and facilitating the sodium ions' transport toward the current collector and subsequent plating underneath the electrode. The N-PHCSs layer acts as a protective layer between the electrolyte and the current collector, suppressing the possible growth of dendrites at the anode.",

In compositions with large amounts of copper oxide (x > 35), Cu2O crystallizes, suggesting the presence of Cu+ and Cu2+ with different valence states in the glass. Heat treatment in a mixed atmosphere of hydrogen and nitrogen resulted in the crystallization of bismuth oxide and their reduction to form glass ceramics with dispersed bismuth and copper particles. As bismuth and copper are consumed from the glass matrix by phase separation, a cross-linked structure of silica develops in residual glass matrix. The resulting bismuth particles was small in size than borate-based glass ceramics, indicating that the cross-linked silicates have an inhibiting effect on bismuth grain growth. Charge-discharge tests in a sodium ion battery showed a reversible charge-discharge profile without the initial irreversible reaction of bismuthate reduction.",

These issues significantly impair the performance. To effectively address these challenges, we employed a systematic design approach to develop a bimetallic ZnS/MoS2 hierarchical heterostructure coated with nitrogen-doped carbon (T-MS/C). This advanced structure was synthesized using a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a template, followed by hydrothermal synthesis. The resulting heterostructure features multiple layers arranged hierarchically, incorporating various phase interfaces and smaller crystal domains due to the MOF templating process. This design significantly enhances reactivity, electrical conductivity, and ionic diffusion, ultimately leading to the development of an optimized Na-storage performance T-MS/C anode. The T-MS/C anode exhibits remarkable Na-storage capability, with capacities of 690.8 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.2 A/g and 306 mAh/g at 10 A/g. This carefully synthesized T-MS/C anode exhibits highly promising features for Na-storage, making it an excellent contender for the next generation of high-performance SIBs.",

Developing electrode materials with high volumetric and gravimetric capacity that could be operated at a high rate is the most challenging problem. In this work, a general multi-interface strategy toward densified carbon materials with enhanced comprehensive electrochemical performance for Li/Na-ion batteries is proposed. The mixture of graphene oxide and sucrose solution is sprayed into a water/oil system and furtherly carbonized to get graphene/hard carbon spheres (GHSs). In this material, abundant ingenious internal interfaces between the crystalline graphene and the carbon matrix are created inside the hard carbon spheres. The constructed interfaces can not only work as a pathway for the escape of volatile gas generated during sucrose pyrolysis to prevent the formation of abundant pores, which leads high packing density of 0.910 g cm-3 and low surface area of 13.3 m2  g-1 , but can also provide a conductive \"highway\" for ions and electrons. When used as the anode material for both LIBs and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the GHS shows the high gravimetric/volumetric reversible capacities, high-rate performance, and low temperature properties simultaneously, implying the great potential application in practical LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Graphite is traditionally used as an anode material but is unsuitable for use in sodium-ion batteries because it has a low specific capacity and poor safety characteristics, it is therefore necessary to develop alternative anode materials. Flexible CoFe2O4 nanoparticle/N-doped carbon nanofiber films were prepared by electrospinning and calcination. The advantages of this process included inexpensive starting materials, easy preparation, and suitability for commercialization. The inherent shortcomings of CoFe2O4, such as poor electronic conductivity and large changes in volume, were mitigated via elemental doping and the formation of composites with high-quality carbon materials. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers with large specific surface areas and superior mechanical properties were used as the supporting skeleton of the material. These nanofibers limited the volume expansion of CoFe2O4 throughout the cycling process and increased the ion diffusion velocity in the material. The optimal integration of nanoscale CoFe2O4 particles, which possess a higher theoretical specific capacity, with a nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber conductive framework featuring a crosslinked three-dimensional structure facilitated the infiltration of the electrolyte into the electrode. This integration reduced the diffusion distance of sodium ions and effectively reduced the volume expansion of the material, as well as damage to the material during the electrochemical reaction. After 200 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, it provided a high sodium storage capacity of 365.7 mA h g−1. The capacity was maintained at 176.3 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 2 A g−1. Exhibits good cycle stability.",

Sodium all-solid-state batteries also offer the potential to eliminate costly materials containing lithium, nickel, and cobalt, making them ideal for emerging grid energy storage applications. However, significant work is required to understand the persisting limitations and long-term cyclability of Na all-solid-state-based batteries. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of careful solid electrolyte selection for use against an alloy anode in Na all-solid-state batteries. Three emerging solid electrolyte material classes were chosen for this study: the chloride Na2.25Y0.25Zr0.75Cl6, sulfide Na3PS4, and borohydride Na2(B10H10)0.5(B12H12)0.5. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were utilized to characterize the evolution of the anode–electrolyte interface upon electrochemical cycling. The obtained results revealed that the interface stability is determined by both the intrinsic electrochemical stability of the solid electrolyte and the passivating properties of the formed interfacial products. With appropriate material selection for stability at the respective anode and cathode interfaces, stable cycling performance can be achieved for Na all-solid-state batteries.",

        "abstract": "Zinc selenide (ZnSe), a metal chalcogenide, is an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high theoretical capacity (371.4 mAhg−1) and numerous redox sites. However, volume expansion and low stability during the charge/discharge processes present challenges. This study aimed to solve these inherent problems and synthesize a high-performance anode material by growing nano sized ZnSe on surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). ZnSe has two crystal structures, namely zinc-blende and wurtzite, and undergoes a transformation from wurtzite to the zinc-blende phase during sodium ion storage. This study conducted X-ray diffraction analysis of the electrode after the galvanostatic charge/discharge test and performed cyclic voltammetry analysis to investigate the transformation process. In addition, real-time monitoring of Nyquist plot and phase transition was performed to investigate the mechanisms of sodium ion storage. The ZnSe-rGO, exhibiting conversion reactions, shows cycle performance of 316.14 mAhg−1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1 after 1000 cycles. The evaluation of anode materials and analysis of their storage mechanism can facilitate sodium-ion batteries research.",

        "abstract": "MXenes are promising insertion‐type two‐dimensional (2D) anode materials for rechargeable sodium (Na) ions batteries owing to unique layered structure, tunable interlayer spacing, and abundant surface functional groups. However, MXenes suffer from inevitably self‐stacking and narrow interlayer spacing, leading to the limited utilization of layered structure and sluggish ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, the LAG molecules as intercalation spacers were intercalated into the interlayer of Ti2C by hydrogen‐bond interaction and electrostatic interaction to prepare the intercalated Ti2C by LAG molecules (named as LAG‐Ti2C). The LAG‐Ti2C not only avoids self‐stacking and broadens interlayer spacing to maximumly utilize the layered structure, but also buffers the volume expansion via the pillar effect of intercalated LAG molecules. Such LAG‐Ti2C could remarkably enhance the cycling stability and rate capability of Na+ ions storage. A decent specific capacity of 113.5 mAh g‐1 and high capacity retention of ~98.7% at 0.1 A g‐1 after 1000 cycles can be presented. In addition, the LAG‐Ti2C//AC sodium ions capacitor (SIC) delivers a high energy density of 27.56 Wh kg‐1 at power density of 3937.1 W kg‐1. The work promotes the further development of layered MXenes and optimizes electrochemical performance of Na+ ions storage via the strategy of intercalating spacers.",

        "abstract": "Sluggish ion diffusion of large sodium ions is one of the main drawbacks challenging the development of metal selenides‐based anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). A spin‐state regulating strategy is first proposed in this work to lift the p‐band center (ɛp) of Se for a fast Na+ transfer kinetic in (Co,Cu)Se2. By utilizing the electron transfer from Cu to Co, the π‐symmetry t2g of Co is fully occupied to decrease the spin polarization. The resultant electron repulsion between Co and Se weakens Co–Se bond to lift the ɛp of Se. The enhanced sodium adsorption energy effectively accelerates the ion transfer at the active material–electrolyte interface. As a result, the (Co,Cu)Se2/NC electrode exhibits an superior sodium storage performance with a capacity of 445 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, 312 mAh g−1 at 50 A g−1, and 363 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 10.0 A g−1.

Nevertheless, it is still a significant challenge to realize superior electrode materials with high capacity and good cyclability. To address these problems, herein, a rational microstructure of the SnS2-carbon composite has been designed for superior performance, which consists of MWNTs as a carbon matrix, the SnS2 nanosheet (NS) as an active material, the outer carbon coating as a protection layer, as well as the interior void space for volume accommodation. As an anode material for SIBs, the so-produced MWNT@SnS2 NS@C electrode delivered a high initial capacity of 910 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and a good retention of 78% after 100 cycles. The sodium storage mechanism of SnS2 was systematically studied through CV, ex situ XPS, and ex situ HRTEM characterization studies, disclosing the reversible conversion and alloying reactions of SnS2 during sodiation/desodiation processes. Moreover, ex situ TEM was further applied to clarify the relationships between the SnS2-C microstructure and sodium storage performance.

In this work, we engineered a composite material in that monodispersed 2 nm Sb2S3 particles are uniformly loaded into a carbon matrix (Sb2S3/CZM), which is obtained by carbonization of a zirconium-based MOF with adsorption of Sb. The obtained composite material has a high specific surface area in favor of mass transfer, and the porous structure can resist many volume changes in the circulation process. Moreover, the ultrafine Sb2S3 particles are well-distributed in the composite material, which increases the utilization of the active substance and is promising for the storage of Na+. Based on its unique structure, the Sb2S3/CZM composite shows a specific capacity of 550 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and an excellent cycling stability of 88.9% retention after 1000 cycles at 3 A g-1.

The graphitic carbon‐coated ZnPS3 electrode exhibits excellent high‐rate capability and long‐term cyclability.

However, Na metal anode undergoes uncontrolled Na dendrite growth, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase layer (SEI) formation during cycling, leading to poor coulombic efficiency, and shorter lifespan. Herein, a series of Na‐ion conductive alloy‐type protective interface (Na‐In, Na‐Bi, Na‐Zn, Na‐Sn) is studied as an artificial SEI layer to address the issues. The hybrid Na‐ion conducting SEI components over the Na‐alloy can facilitate uniform Na deposition by regulating Na‐ion flux with low overpotential. Furthermore, density functional study reveals that the lower surface energy of protective alloys relative to bare Na is the key factor for facilitating facile ion diffusion across the interface. Na metal with interface layer facilitates a highly reversible Na plating/stripping for ≈790 h, higher than pristine Na metal (100 h). The hybrid self‐regulating protective layers exhibit a high mechanical flexibility to promote dendrite free Na plating even at high current density (5 mA cm−2), high capacity (10 mAh cm−2), and good performance with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.

As an anode for SIBs, the nanoporous Bi2Sb6 alloy exhibits an ultralong cycling performance (10 000 cycles) at 1 A/g corresponding to a capacity decay of merely 0.0072% per cycle, due to the porous structure, alloying effect and proper Bi/Sb atomic ratio.

        "abstract": "An ultrafine tin dioxide/N, P-doped porous carbon (SnO2/NPPC) nanocomposite is prepared through in-situ growth of tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles in N, P-doped porous carbon (NPPC). Owing to the in-situ growth method, the size of SnO2 nanoparticles in SnO2/NPPC is quite small and uniform (generally less than 5.0 nm). NPPC provides a support and a conductive carbon skeleton for the SnO2 nanoparticles. The small SnO2 nanoparticles are less likely to aggregate during the discharge–charge process due to the presence of Sn–O–C bonding and nanoconfinement effect of SnO2 nanoparticles in carbon matrix. The N and P doping can provide abundant defects to facilitate the penetration of Li+ or Na+ into the interior of the electrode. In addition, the presence of Sn–N bonding can further improve the electrochemical properties of the electrodes. Thus, as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, SnO2/NPPC possesses an enhanced rate performance, an excellent cycling stability, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency. The structure of the ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles is well maintained in cycled SnO2/NPPC. Meanwhile, SnO2/NPPC also possesses good electrochemical performance as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. The good electrochemical properties for SnO2/NPPC materials can be ascribed to the synergetic effect between small SnO2 nanoparticles and NPPC.",

        "title": "Stabilize Sodium Metal Anode by Integrated Patterning of Laser-Induced Graphene with Regulated Na Deposition Behavior.",
        "abstract": "Metallic sodium is regarded as the most potential anode for sodium-ion batteries due to its high capacity and earth-abundancy. Nevertheless, uncontrolled Na dendrite growth and infinite volume change remain great challenges for developing high-performance sodium metal batteries. This work provides a simple and general approach to stabilize sodium metal anode (SMA) by constructing Sn nanoparticles-anchored laser-induced graphene on copper foil (Sn@LIG@Cu) consisting of Sn@LIG composite, polyimide (PI) columns, and Cu current collector. The Sn-based sodiophilic species effectively reduce the Na nucleation overpotential and regulate the dendrite Na-free deposition. While the flexible PI columns act as binder and buffer the volume variation of Na during cycling. Besides, the unique patterned structure provides continuous and rapid channels for ion transportation, promoting the Na+ transport kinetics. Therefore, the as-fabricated Sn@LIG@Cu electrode exhibits outstanding rate performance to 40 mA cm-2 and excellent cycling stability without dendrite growth, which is confirmed by in-situ optical microscopy observation. Moreover, the practical full cell based on such an anode displays a favorable rate capability of up to 10 C and cycling performance at 5 C for 600 cycles. This work thus demonstrates a facile, highly-efficient, and scalable approach to stabilize SMAs and can be extended to other battery systems.",

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations, combined with density functional theory calculations, demonstrated that the flexible 2D Na2Ti3O7 nanosheets are mechanically more robust than the rigid Na2Ti3O7 nanotube arrays during prolonged battery cycling, explaining the superior durability of the NTO NSs electrode.

The Na+ intercalation process has been analyzed by cyclic voltammetry tests, performed at different scan rates for hundreds of cycles, in combination with impedance spectroscopy measurements to decouple bulk and interfacial resistances of the cells. The Na+ diffusion coefficient in the HC host has been also evaluated via the Randles-Sevcik equation. Battery performance of HC anodes in the ionic liquid electrolytes has been evaluated in galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles at room temperature. The evolution of the SEI (Solid Electrochemical Interface) layer grown on the HC surface has been carried out by Raman spectroscopy. Overall the sodiation process of the HC host is highly reversible and reproducible. In particular, a capacity retention exceeding 98 % of the initial value has been recorded in N1114FSI electrolytes after more than 1500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency above 99 %, largely beyond standard carbonate-based electrolytes. Raman, transport properties and impedance confirms that ILs disclose the formation of SEI layers with superior ability to support the reversible Na+ intercalation with the possible minor contributions from the EMI+ cation.",

Herein, a simple solvent ultrasonic technique and pyrolysis selenation process were used to make a porous N-doped carbon nanosheet-supported FeSe2/CoSe2 electrode. The electrochemical kinetics could be improved, and the stress generated by volume expansion could be efficiently adjusted by exquisitely constructed boundary of the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN electrode. As expected, the FeSe2/CoSe2-CN porous nanosheets exhibited a high Na+ storage capacity of 350 mA h g-1 (10 A g-1, 1000 cycles). Kinetic studies were conducted to explore the Na+ storage mechanism of FeSe2/CoSe2-CN.

As a potential anode material for Na-ion batteries, the as-developed Sb/rGO composite exhibits a reversible Na-storage capacity of ∼550 mAh/g (@ 0.2 A/g) and a fairly high first cycle Coulombic efficiency (CE) of ∼79%, with the good reversibility being attributed to the coarse particle size of Sb and encompassing of rGO sheets inside the Sb particles. Furthermore, despite the coarse particle size, the Sb/rGO-based electrode exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, with negligible capacity fade up to 150 cycles (viz., ∼97% capacity retention), and rate capability, with >86% capacity being obtained upon raising the current density from 0.1 to 2 A/g, resulting in a capacity of ∼490 mAh/g, even at 2 A/g.",

In this study, we report a series of newly synthesized arylamine-based polyimides, TPPA-PIs, with three different bridge functionalizations on the imide rings and isomeric constituents that can work as versatile battery electrodes. As a lithium-ion battery cathode, a maximum energy density of 248 Wh kg-1 with high voltage operation up to 4.0 V can be achieved. As a lithium-ion battery anode, the TPPA-PIs showed a reversible storage capacity of 806 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 current density with good rate capability up to a current density of 2000 mA g-1. Moreover, when applied as sodium-ion battery anodes, TPPA-PIs delivered an optimum specific capacity of up to 218 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at a 50 mA g-1 current density and revealed a long cycling stability up to 1000 cycles under a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. More importantly, these electrochemical performances of TPPA-PIs are among the best compared with other reported polymer-based electrodes. The mechanistic studies show that both bridge functionalization on the imide units and isomerism impact the electrochemical performance by regulating their intrinsic properties such as charge storage behavior, ion diffusivity, and activation energy. We believe that such a detailed study of the structural design to electrochemical performance of these polymeric electrodes will offer insights into materials development and optimization for next-generation multifunctional energy storage devices in a wide range of applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted wide attention because of their prospect on grid-scale electrical regulation and cost-effectiveness of sodium. In this regard, iron oxides (FeOx) are considered as one of the most promising anode candidates due to its high theoretical capacity and low cost. Unfortunately, the utilization of FeOx anodes suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and significant lattice variation, causing insufficient rate performance and fast capacity degradation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In this study, Mn ions are incorporated through interstitial sites into Fe3O4 lattice to form the Mn-incorporated Fe3O4/graphene (M-Fe3O4/G) composites through a facile hydrothermal method. Confirmed by the XRD Rietveld refinement and the first principle calculation, Mn occupation into the body structure can effectively condense the electron density around Fermi lever and thus contributes to the increased electrical conductivity and improved electrochemical properties. Accordingly, the M0.1Fe2.9O4/G composite demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 439.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 over 200 cycles. Even at a high current density of 1 A g-1, the M-Fe3O4/G composites remain stable for over 1200 cycles, delivering a capacity of 210 mAh g-1. Coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3-type cathode, the Mn incorporated Fe3O4/G composites demonstrate a good suitability in full SIBs (161.2 mAh g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles). The regulation of Mn ions in Fe3O4 lattice provides insights on the optimization of metal oxides anode candidates for their application in SIBs.",

Ti3C2Tx efficiently induces Na's initial nucleation and laterally oriented deposition, which effectively avoids the generation of mossy/dendritic Na.

        "abstract": "A novel coordination polymerization-driven hierarchical assembly approach for spatially controlled fabrication of phytic acid-based bio-derivatives was developed. The resultant ferric phytate bio-derived polymer featured hollow nanosphere architecture, ordered meso-channels, high surface area, and large pore volume, as anode material, delivering a remarkable electrochemical performance. Bio-inspired hierarchical self-assembly provides elegant and powerful bottom-up strategies for the creation of complex materials. However, the current self-assembly approaches for natural bio-compounds often result in materials with limited diversity and complexity in architecture as well as microstructure. Here, we develop a novel coordination polymerization-driven hierarchical assembly of micelle strategy, using phytic acid-based natural compounds as an example, for the spatially controlled fabrication of metal coordination bio-derived polymers. The resultant ferric phytate polymer nanospheres feature hollow architecture, ordered meso-channels of ~ 12 nm, high surface area of 401 m^2 g^−1, and large pore volume of 0.53 cm^3 g^−1. As an advanced anode material, this bio-derivative polymer delivers a remarkable reversible capacity of 540 mAh g^−1 at 50 mA g^−1, good rate capability, and cycling stability for sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Transition-metal selenides have been recognized as a class of promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) on account of their high capacity. Nevertheless, the sluggish conversion kinetics and rapid capacity decay caused by insufficient conductivity and volume change restrain their applications. Herein, hollow heterostructured bimetallic selenides embedded in an N-doped carbon nanoframework (H-CoSe2/ZnSe@NC) were prepared via a facile template-engaged method. Benefiting from the rich defect at the phase boundary of the CoSe2/ZnSe heterostructure, pre-reserved cavity, and enhanced structure rigidity, the abovementioned issues are resolved at once, and the accelerated charge transportation kinetics traced by spectroscopy techniques and theoretical calculations certify the interface effect in the capacity release. In addition, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy all confirm the high-reversible electrochemical conversion mechanism in H-CoSe2/ZnSe@NC. Together with a reasonable structural architecture and the highly reversible conversion reaction, H-CoSe2/ZnSe@NC displays a prominent rate capacity (244.8 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1) as well as an ultralong lifespan (10,000 cycles at 10 A g-1), highlighting the significance of structure control in fabricating high-performance anodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon with randomly oriented interlayers is the most promising candidate for the anode of commercial sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, its sluggish sodium storage kinetics and unsatisfactory cycling stability are bottlenecks to its implementation. Herein, a metal‐single atom modification strategy is proposed to construct a Ni‐single atoms modified N, P co‐doped hard carbon (Ni‐NPC) with a Ni content of ≈5.65 wt%. As an anode for SIBs, Ni‐NPC exhibits far superior initial Coulombic efficiency, reversible specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability to N, P co‐doped hard carbon. Combining in situ EIS and ex‐situ XPS,this study reveals that Ni‐single atoms modulate the composition of the solid electrolyte interface layer, thereby improving the cycling stability of Ni‐NPC. Theoretical calculation and kinetics analysis suggest that Ni‐single atoms are the promoters of the diffusion of Na+. Furthermore, with the aid of systematic in situ characterizations, the structural evolution of Ni‐NPC at different sodium storage stages is identified. This work proposes a potential strategy for simultaneously improving the sodium storage kinetics and cycling stability of hard carbon anodes, and elucidates the improvement mechanism of this strategy.",

Ether based electrolytes have surfaced as alternatives to conventional carbonates allowing for enhanced electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries; however, the primary source of the improvement remains poorly understood. Here we show that coupling titanium dioxide and other anode materials with diglyme does enable higher efficiency and reversible capacity than those for the combination involving ester electrolytes. Importantly, the electrolyte dependent performance is revealed to be the result of the different structural evolution induced by a varied sodiation depth. A suit of characterizations show that the energy barrier to charge transfer at the interface between electrolyte and electrode is the factor that dominates the interfacial electrochemical characteristics and therefore the energy storage properties.

        "abstract": "Layered sodium titanates (NTO), one of the most promising anode materials for advanced sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), feature high theoretical capacity and no serious safety concerns. The pristine NTO electrode, however, has unfavorable Na+ transport kinetics, due to the dominant two-dimensional (2D) Na-ion transport channels within the crystal along the low energy barrier octahedron layers, which impedes the practical application of this class of potential materials. Herein, an interesting concept of opening three-dimensional (3D) fast ion transport channels within the intrinsic NTO frameworks is proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance through a combination of oxygen vacancy generation and cation substitution strategies, by which the interlayer spacing of the NTO frameworks is expanded for fast 3D Na-ion transport. It is evidenced that the oxygen-deficient and bismuth-substituted HBNTO (BixNa2-xTi3Oy, 0 < x < 2, 0 < y < 7, HBNTO) exhibits obvious enhancements on the reversible capacity (∼145% enhancement at 20 mAh g-1 compared with NTO), the rate capability (∼200% enhancement at 500 mAh g-1 compared with NTO), and the cycling stability (∼210% enhancement of retention capacity after 150 cycles at 20 mAh g-1 compared with NTO). The molecular dynamic simulations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the enhanced performance of HBNTO is contributed by the multiplied sodium diffusion pathways and the increased ion migration rates with the successful opening of 3D internal ion transport channels. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategies in opening the 3D intercrystal ion transport channels for boosting the electrochemical performance of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The ever-growing application of miniaturized electric devices calls for the manufacturing of energy storage systems with a high areal energy density. Thick electrode design is a promising strategy to acquire high areal energy density by enhancing active mass loading and minimizing inactive components. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor electrode mechanical stability that are accompanied by the increased electrode thickness remain unsolved problems. Herein, for the first time, we propose a novel chemical cross-linking strategy to fabricate GeP thick electrodes with adjustable electrode thicknesses and active mass loadings for high areal capacity sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The chemical cross-linking between carboxylic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and pyrolysis cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) forms a 3D network that encloses GeP nanoparticles, which guarantees fast charge transfer, efficient stress relief, and alleviated volume expansion/shrinkage of the electrode. The hierarchical porous structure generates numerous interconnected channels for unfettered Na+ diffusion, ensuring uncompromised reaction kinetics as the electrode thickness increases. As a result, the ultrathick 1031 μm GeP@C-CNTs-CNFs electrode featuring a mass loading of 18.3 mg cm-2 delivers an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10.58 mAh cm-2 accompanied by superior cycling stability, which outperforms all reported Ge-based electrodes (generally below 1.5 mAh cm-2).

Several material properties such as intensity ratio of the Raman spectrum, lateral size of HC crystallite (La ), and interlayer distance (d002 ) have been discussed as factors affecting anode performance. However, these factors do not reflect the bulk property of the Na+ intercalation reaction directly, since Raman analysis has high surface sensitivity and La and d002 provide only one-dimensional crystalline information. Herein, it was proposed that the crystallite interlayer area (Ai ) defined using La , d002 , and stacking height (Lc ) governs Na+ intercalation behavior of various HCs. It was revealed that various wood-derived HCs exhibited the similar total capacity of approximately 250 mAh g-1 , whereas the Na+ intercalation capacity (Ci ) was proportional to Ai with the correlation coefficient of R2 =0.94. The evaluation factor of Ai was also adaptable to previous reports and strongly correlated with their Ci , indicating that Ai is more widely adaptable than the conventional evaluation methods.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 is widely reported as anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, its ability to operate effectively across a wide temperature range and at high rates continues to pose fundamental challenges, limiting its further development. Herein, a monolayer Fe‐doped MoS2/N,O‐codoped C overlapping structure is designed and employed as an anode for wide‐temperature‐range SIBs. Fe doping imparts MoS2 electrode with zero bandgap characteristics, an increased interlayer spacing, and low sodium‐ion diffusion energy barriers across wide operation temperatures. Impressively, Fe atoms doped into the MoS2 lattice can be reduced to superparamagnetic Fe0 nanocrystals of ≈2 nm during conversion reactions. In situ magnetometry reveals that these Fe0 nanocrystals can be used as electron acceptor in the formation of space charge zones with Na+, thereby triggering strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance that facilitates fast sodium‐ion storage over a wide temperature range. Consequently, the designed MoS2 electrode demonstrates exceptional fast‐charging capability in half/full cells operating at −40–60 °C. This study provides novel perspectives on the utilization of heteroatom doping strategies in conversion‐type electrode material design and proves the effectiveness of spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect on enhancing sodium‐ion storage over a wide temperature range.",

Herein, we report a high-temperature solution method to prepare Ni3S4 nanorods with uniform sizes. These colloidal nanorods readily self-assemble side by side and form microsized superstructures, which unfortunately negates the nanoscale feature of individual nanorods. To this end, we further introduce two-dimensional graphene nanosheets as the spacer to interrupt nanorod self-assembly. Resultant composite presents a marked advantage toward electrochemical storage of Na+ ions. We demonstrate that in half-cells it exhibits large reversible specific capacity in excess of 600 mAh/g, high rate capability with >300 mAh/g retained at 4 A/g, and great cycle life at different current rates.

        "abstract": "Biomass holds significant potential for large-scale synthesis of hard carbon (HC), and HC is seen as the most promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, designing a HC anode with a rich pore structure, moderate graphitization and synthesis through a simple process using a cost-effective precursor to advance SIBs has long been a formidable challenge. This is primarily because high temperatures necessary for pore regulation invariably lead to excessive graphitization. Herein, innovative guidelines for designing such HC structures are reported by leveraging the inherent potassium in biomass to optimize the pore structure and alleviate graphitization through a novel carbothermal shock (CTS) method. During CTS, potassium-related compounds are effectively released and counteract the tendency of the carbon layers to graphitize by competing for thermal adsorption, thus forming pore channels while mitigating graphitization. The resulting HC anode exhibits an outstanding sodium storage capacity of 357.1 mA h g−1 and a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.7% at 50 mA g−1. This work provides a new insight into balancing the pore structure and the degree of graphitization of HC to keep sufficient space for Na+ diffusion.",

In this study, dandelion-like ZnxCo3-xO4 microspheres assembled with porous needle-shaped nanosticks were synthesized by co-precipitation followed by a post-annealing treatment. The open space between neighboring nanosticks enables easy infiltration of the electrolyte; therefore, each nanostick is surrounded by the electrolyte solution, which ensures proper utilization of the active material during the electrochemical reaction. The dandelion-like ZnxCo3-xO4 hierarchical microspheres exhibit a greatly improved electrochemical performance with a high capacity and good cyclability as anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). A high initial reversible capacity of 612 mA h g-1 (at 35 mA g-1, ∼0.04C) is obtained and a capacity of 349 mA h g-1 is retained after 200 cycles. Meanwhile, the electrode shows a high rate performance with a capacity of 246 mA h g-1 at 2.0C-rate. The conversion of ZnxCo3-xO4 with Na is followed by ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in different sodiation/de-sodiation states during electrochemical cycling. These analyses reveal that Na insertion/extraction is followed by complete reduction/oxidation of both metallic cobalt and zinc. The development of metallic Co and Zn after complete discharge and the formation of Co3O4 and ZnO when the electrode was fully recharged were identified by ex situ TEM analysis. In addition, the ZnxCo3-xO4 anode demonstrates feasible operation in a full cell by pairing with a NaNi2/3Bi1/3O2 cathode, affording a sodium-ion battery with an average working voltage of 2.6 V.",

More importantly, the fabricated sodium-ion CoTe2@NMCNFs//P2-NaNMMT-4 full cell delivers a stable reversible capacity of 445 Wh kg-1anode at 0.2 A g-1 and an excellent rate performance. The facile synthetic approach together with unique nanostructural design, provides a meaningful reference for the rational design of next-generation ultralong cycle-life SIBs anodes.",

        "abstract": "The sodium dual ion battery (Na-DIB) technology is proposed as highly promising alternative over lithium-ion batteries for the stationary electrochemical energy-storage devices. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of anode materials seriously impedes their practical implementation. Herein, a novel Na-DIB based on TiSe2-graphite is reported for the first time. The unprecedentedly high diffusion coefficient of Na-ions (3.21 × 10-11 - 1.20 × 10-9 cm2 s-1) and the very low Na-ion diffusion barrier (0.50 eV) lead to very fast electrode kinetics, alike in conventional surface capacitive storage systems. In-situ investigations reveal that the fast Na-ion diffusion involves four insertion stage compositions. The prototype cell of novel and low-cost TiSe2-graphite Na-DIB shows a reversible capacity of 81.8 mAh g-1 at current density of 100 mA g-1, an excellent stability with 83.52% capacity retention over 200 cycles and excellent rate performance, suggesting its high potential for next-generation large scale high-performance stationary energy storage systems.",

The composite is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal pathway with subsequent annealing and is characterized by defined structure and well-tailored morphology, as is indeed demonstrated by X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy as well as high-resolution microscopy. These optimal characteristics allow the electrode to perform remarkably in sodium cell by achieving a maximum specific capacity as high as 620 mAh g-1 and the still-relevant value of 335 mAh g-1 at an extremely high current (i.e., 5 A g-1). The high storage capacity, the long cycle life, and the impressive rate capability of the composite may be attributed to the synergetic effect between uniform In2S3 nanoparticles and the graphene matrix.

As the precursor, Fe2 O3 /carbon microspheres containing NaCl nanocrystals are obtained using one-pot ultrasonic spray pyrolysis in which inexpensive NaCl and dextrin are used as a porogen and carbon source, respectively, enabling mass production of the composites. During post-treatment, Fe2 O3 nanoparticles in the composites transform into hollow FeSe2 nanospheres via the Kirkendall effect. These rational structures provide numerous conductive channels to facilitate ion/electron transport and enhance the capacitive contribution. Moreover, the synergistic effect between the hollow cavities within FeSe2 and the outstanding mechanical strength of the porous carbon matrix can effectively accommodate the large volume changes during cycling. Correspondingly, the composite microsphere exhibits high discharge capacity of 510 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 with capacity retention of 88% when calculated from the second cycle. Even at a high current density of 5.0 A g-1 , a high discharge capacity of 417 mA h g-1 can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode exhibits extensive potential for high‐power applications, owing to its large sodium ion diffusion channels, low cost, and suitable operating voltage. However, it suffers significant capacity degradation due to the inevitable NaFePO4 impurity. Herein, a synergistic strategy is proposed that integrates high entropy doping with Fe vacancy engineering, which not only preserves the phase purity but also provides additional active sites and further stabilizes its crystal structure. A novel Na4Fe2.61(Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mg)0.05(PO4)2P2O7 cathode has been successfully synthesized by a simple sol‐gel method, which exhibits an ultralong cycle life (over 15000 cycles at 5 A g−1) and outstanding rate capability (61.1 mAh g⁻¹ at 10A g−1). Additionally, a combined solid‐solution and biphasic reaction mechanism in sodium storage process is thoroughly confirmed. Notably, benefiting from the rational design of N/P ratio and well‐matched capacitive contributions, the full cells assembled with hard carbon anodes exhibit superior cycling durability, sustaining over 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g⁻¹ without severe capacity deterioration. Such highly durable full cells with low N/P ratioand common ester‐based electrolytes have never been reported before.

Currently, this type cathode still suffers from stability-capacity trade-off dilemma. Herein, a concept of customized strategy via multiple rock-forming elements trace doping is presented to address the mentioned issue. The customized Mg-Al-Ti trace doped cathode maintains a notable capacity of 140.3 mAh g - 1 with an energy density approaching 500 Wh kg - 1, and shows good cycle stability, retaining 89.0% of its capacity after 50 cycles at 0.1C. Additionally, the full cell, paired with a hard carbon anode, achieves an advanced energy density of 303.3 Wh kg-1. The multiple characterizations reveal the failure mechanism of contrast sample involving severe intragranular cracks coupled with layer to rock salt transformation, which reduces active substance and increases charge transfer resistance. The doped sample with increased sliding energy barrier well suppresses this phenomenon. Impressively, the customized strategy can be extended to Mg-Fe-Ti system.

The high compatibility of Co9S8 and SnS at the interface enables the synthesis of a more complete heterostructure within the material, enhancing the electrochemical reaction process through rational heterostructure design. Additionally, the incorporation of high theoretical capacity SnS improves sodium storage performance. The design of multi-channel carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) effectively addresses challenges such as material volume expansion and metal particle aggregation during cycling by providing large specific surface areas and enabling carbon encapsulation. The resulting pore structure and heterostructure formation, coupled with introduction of more defects, enhance the availability of Na+ active sites for electrochemically reversible processes. As expected, Co9S8/SnS@MCNFs exhibit remarkable initial coulombic efficiency (ICE = 92.6 %) and demonstrate stable long-term cycling performance (222.5 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 400 cycles) for sodium storage, with only a 0.18 % decay rate per cycle.

The confinement effect of nitrogen-doped carbon stabilizes the active mass structure during cycling thanks to the robust chemically and electronically bonded connections between nitrogen-doped carbon and zinc sulfide nanoparticles. Furthermore, the cycling stability of the ZnS@NC anode is boosted by the robust inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in cyclic and linear ether-based electrolytes.

The synthesis of FeS2 in large quantities accompanied by an improved cycling stability, as well as retaining high theoretical capacity, is highly desirable for its commercialization. Herein, we present a scalable and simple strategy to prepare a foam-like FeS2 (F-FeS2) nanostructure by combining solution combustion synthesis and solid-state sulfurization. The obtained F-FeS2 product is highly uniform and built from interconnected FeS2 nanoparticles (∼50 nm). The interconnected feature, small particle sizes and porous structure endow the product with high electrical conductivity, good ion diffusion kinetics, and high inhibition capacity of volume expansion. As a result, high capacity (823 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, very close to the theoretical capacity of FeS2, 894 mA h g-1), good rate capability (581 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) and cyclability (754 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 with 97% retention after 80 cycles) can be achieved. The sodium storage mechanism has been proved to be a combination of intercalation and conversion reactions based on in situ XRD. Furthermore, high pseudocapacitive contribution (i.e. ∼87.5% at 5.0 mV s-1) accounts for the outstanding electrochemical performance of F-FeS2 at high rates.",

Therefore, constructing a carbon framework with rich defects and closed pores is a promising method to achieve large Na+ storage capacity. However, this is difficult to realize because moderate graphitization facilitates the creation of closed pores but causes the elimination of structural defects. In the current work, we find that micropores can effectively hinder the ordered arrangement of carbon layers, thereby raising the graphitization temperature by ≈500 °C. Based on this, with appreciable carbonization temperature, a novel hard carbon incorporating rich defects and well-developed closed pores is developed. This hard carbon displays both large slope and plateau capacities, thus delivering a very high Na+ storage capacity of 365 mAh g−1, significantly exceeding the conventional hard carbon (253 mAh g−1).

However, serious self-stacking of the layered structure and the sluggish sodium diffusion kinetics lead to inferior rate capability and cycling stability. Herein, an organic molecular pillaring strategy is reported to enlarge the interlayer spacing of Ti3C2 through a dehydration condensation reaction between the -COOH groups of 3,3',4,4'-benzene tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) molecules and the -NH2 groups of Ti3C2-NH2, which enables rigid organic BTCA molecules to be chemically pillared into the interlayers of Ti3C2 (Ti3C2-BTCA). The rigid organic BTCA molecules not only play a dual role of pillar and strain effects in Ti3C2 layers, but also expand the interlayer spacing. Therefore, they can significantly enhance the rate capability and cycling stability of Ti3C2. Ti3C2-BTCA exhibits a reversible capacity of 182.3 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 after 2000 cycles and maintains a reversible capacity of 77.9%. Moreover, the sodium diffusion coefficient of Ti3C2-BTCA is 6.6 × 10-7 cm2 s-1. Ti3C2-BTCA shows a relatively low sodium diffusion barrier and a high sodium diffusion coefficient compared with Ti3C2. Interlayer engineering based on the organic molecular pillaring strategy is significant and meaningful for expanding the interlayer spacing of Ti3C2.

        "abstract": "Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3), with rich resources and high electrochemical activity, including in conversion and alloying reactions, has been regarded as an ideal candidate anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, the severe volume expansion, sluggish kinetics, and polyselenide shuttle of the Sb2Se3-based anode lead to serious pulverization at high current density, restricting its industrialization. Herein, a unique structure of Sb2Se3 nanowires uniformly anchored between Ti3C2Tx (MXene) nanosheets was prepared by the electrostatic self-assembly method. The MXene can impede the volume expansion of Sb2Se3 nanowires in the sodiation process. Moreover, the Sb2Se3 nanowires can reduce the restacking of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and enhance electrolyte accessibility. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations confirm the increased reaction kinetics and better sodium storage capability through the composite of Ti3C2Tx with Sb2Se3 and the high adsorption capability of Ti3C2Tx to polyselenides. Therefore, the resultant Sb2Se3/Ti3C2Tx anodes show high rate capability (369.4 mAh/g at 5 A/g) and cycling performance (568.9 and 304.1 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles and at 1.0 A/g after 500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Low cycling stability and poor rate performance are two of the distinctive drawbacks of most electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, inspired by natural flower structures, we take advantage of the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical flower-like stable microstructures formed by two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets to solve these problems. By precise control of the hydrothermal synthesis conditions, a novel three-dimensional (3D) flower-like architecture consisting of 2D Na2Ti3O7 nanosheets (Na-TNSs) has been successfully synthesized. The arbitrarily arranged but closely interlinked thin nanosheets in carnation-shaped 3D Na2Ti3O7 microflowers (Na-TMFs) originate a good network of electrically conductive paths in an electrode. Thus, Na-TMFs can get electrons from all directions and be fully utilized for sodium-ion insertion and extraction reactions, which can improve sodium storage properties with enhanced rate capability and super cycling performance. Furthermore, the large specific surface area provides a high capacity, which can be ascribed to the pseudo-capacitance effect. The wettability of the electrolyte was also improved by the porous and crumpled structure. The remarkably improved cycling performance and rate capability of Na-TMFs make a captivating case for its development as an advanced anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their alloys are vital for the development of sustainable and economical energy storage alternatives due to their large interlayer spacing and hosting ability for alkali-metal ions. Although the Li-ion chemically correlates with the Na-ion and K-ion, research on batteries with TMD anodes for K+ is still in its infancy. This research explores TMDs such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) and TMD alloys such as molybdenum tungsten disulfide (MoWS2) for both sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs). The cyclic stability test analysis indicates that in the initial cycle, the MoS2 NIB demonstrates exceptional performance, with a peak charge capacity of 1056 mAh g–1, while retaining high Coulombic efficiency. However, the WS2 KIB underperforms, with the least charge capacity of 130 mAh g–1 in the first cycle and exceptionally low retention at a current density of 100 mA g–1. The MoWS2 TMD alloy exhibits a moderate charge capacity and cyclic efficiency for both NIBs and KIBs. This comparison study shows that decreasing sizes of alkali-metal ions and constituent elements in TMDs or TMD alloys leads to decreased resistance and slower degradation processes as indicated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy after 10 cycles. Furthermore, the study of probable electrochemical intercalation and removal processes of Na-ions and K-ions demonstrates that large geometrically shaped TMD flakes are more responsive to intercalation for Na-ions than K-ions. These performance comparisons of different TMD materials for NIBs and KIBs may promote the future development of these batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Although sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) offer promising low‐cost alternatives to lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), several challenges need to be overcome for their widespread adoption. A primary concern is the optimization of carbon anodes. Graphite, vital to the commercial viability of LIBs, has a limited capacity for sodium ions. Numerous alternatives to graphite are explored, particularly focusing on disordered carbons, including hard carbon. However, compared with graphite, most of these materials underperform in LIBs. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism between carbon and sodium ions remains ambiguous owing to the structural diversity of disordered carbon. A straightforward mechanical approach is introduced to enhance the sodium ion storage capacity of graphite, supported by comprehensive analytical techniques. Mechanically activated graphite delivers a notable reversible capacity of 290.5 mAh·g−1 at a current density of 10 mA·g−1. Moreover, it maintains a capacity of 157.7 mAh·g−1 even at a current density of 1 A·g−1, benefiting from the defect‐rich structure achieved by mechanical activation. Soft X‐ray analysis revealed that this defect‐rich carbon employs a sodium‐ion storage mechanism distinct from that of hard carbon. This leads to an unexpected reversible reaction on the solid electrolyte surface. These insights pave the way for innovative design approaches for carbon electrodes in SIB anodes.",

However, the limited capacity and low tap density of currently reported anode materials restrict the further improvement of Na‐DIBs. Herein, a micro–nano structure with vertically aligned WSe2 nanoflakes anchored tightly on a micron‐sized carbon sphere (WSe2/CS) is successfully constructed via combining the molecular coupling and self‐assembly strategy. Within this hierarchical structure, the WSe2 nanoflakes can shorten the diffusion path for Na+ ions and alleviate structural deformation during the charge/discharge process; meanwhile, the micron‐sized carbon core provides conductive support and helps improve the total tap density of the anode electrode. As a result, this micron‐sized WSe2/CS displays a high specific capacity of ≈252.8 mAh g−1 and good cycling performance with ≈92% capacity retention after 1200 cycles. Moreover, by pairing this WSe2/CS anode with environmental friendly graphite as cathode, a proof‐of‐concept Na‐DIB shows 85.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, which is among the best performances of previously reported Na‐DIBs.",

By virtue of these superiorities, CoP1-x@MEC binder-free anode delivers superb SIBs performance including a high areal capacity (2.47 mAh cm-2@0.2 mA cm-2), high rate capability (0.443 mAh cm-2@6 mA cm-2), and long cycling stability (300 cycles without decay), thus holding great promise for inexpensive binder-free anode-based SIBs for practical applications.",

However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is hindered by the limited electrochemical performance of electrode materials, especially at the anode side. Here, we identify alkaline earth metal vanadates as promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries. The prepared calcium vanadate nanowires possess intrinsically high electronic conductivity (> 100 S cm^−1), small volume change (< 10%), and a self-preserving effect, which results in a superior cycling and rate performance and an applicable reversible capacity (> 300 mAh g^−1), with an average voltage of ∼1.0 V. The specific sodium-storage mechanism, beyond the conventional intercalation or conversion reaction, is demonstrated through in situ and ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations.

However, their practical application is limited by drastic volume expansion during cycling and low-intrinsic electronic conductivity. In this work, we report a FeS2/Fe7S8-rGO composite synthesized via a facile solvothermal method as an LIB/SIB anode. The FeS2/Fe7S8-rGO anode exhibits an excellent Li-storage capacity of 514 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 after 3000 cycles and a Na-storage capacity of 650 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 250 cycles, respectively. The rGO matrix is deemed responsible for providing good electron conduction and alleviating volume expansion during cycling. The electrokinetic analysis confirms a large portion of intercalational pseudocapacitance as a major contribution to the superior rate performance. In situ X-ray diffraction further reveals details of a combined intercalational and conversional Li-ion storage mechanisms in this Fe-sulfide-based anode.

In this work, a SnSe nanosheet array (SnSe NS) on a carbon cloth is prepared using a vacuum thermal evaporation method.

Furthermore, the electrochemical behaviors of the SnSe NS electrode are determined via pseudocapacitance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, indicating a faster kinetic process of the SnSe NS electrode compared to that of the SnSe BP. Operando X-ray diffraction measurements prove that the SnSe NS exhibits better phase reversibility than the SnSe BP. After the cycles, the SnSe NS electrode still maintains its particular structure.

        "title": "Vapor-phase derived ultra-fine Bismuth nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotube networks as anodes for sodium and potassium ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) is a promising material as the anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to its characteristics such as reasonable price and high theoretical volumetric capacity (3800 mAh cm−3). Nevertheless, considerable drawbacks have hindered the practical applications of Bi, including its relatively low electrical conductivity and inevitable volumetric change during the alloying/dealloying processes. To solve these problems, we proposed a novel design:Bi nanoparticles were synthesized via a single-step low-pressure vapor-phase reaction and embedded onto the surfaces of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). After being vaporized at 650℃ and 10-5 Pa, Bi nanoparticles less than 10 nm were uniformly distributed in the three-dimensional (3D) MWCNT networks to form a Bi/MWNTs composite. In this unique design, the nanostructured Bi can reduce the risk of structural rupture during cycling, and the structure of the MWCMT network is beneficial in shortening the electron/ion transport path. In addition, MWCNTs can improve the overall conductivity of the Bi/MWCNTs composite and prevent particle aggregation, thus improving the cycling stability and rate performance. As an anode material for SIB, the Bi/MWCNTs composite has demonstrated excellent fast charging performance with a reversible capacity of 254 mAh/g at 20 A/g. A capacity of 221mAhg−1 after cycling at 10 A/g for 8000 cycles has also been achieved for SIB. As an anode material for PIB, the Bi/MWCNTs composite has delivered excellent rate performances with a reversible capacity of 251 mAh/g at 20 A/g. A specific capacity of 270mAhg−1 after cycling at 1Ag−1 for 5000 cycles has also been achieved for PIB.",

        "title": "Bismuth nanoparticles embedded in carbon fibers as flexible and free-standing anodes for efficient sodium ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Metallic bismuth is a promising anode electrode material for sodium ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the formation of Na3Bi during the reaction process brings about significant volume changes and structural collapse of the electrode, resulting in the destruction of structures and a decrease in the cycling stability of sodium ion batteries. In this study, bismuth nanoparticles embedded in carbon fibers (Bi/CF) through a facile approach of electrospinning and calcination. Bi nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 20 nm were homogeneously dispersed in the carbon fibers, as confirmed by relevant morphological and structural features. The carbon fiber substrate can serve as a flexible and free-standing electrode, forming a conductive network to accelerate electron transport and ion diffusion. In light of this, Bi/CF anodes exhibit a high reversible capacity (376.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and long-term cycle stability (only attenuates 0.12% in each cycle after 2000 times). This work provides a convenient and effective strategy for the synthesis of flexible and free-standing anodes for high-performance sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The low-cost and scalable sodium ion (Na-ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium-ion batteries. To compensate the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high-voltage anode-free configuration composing a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high-voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high-voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode-free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg-1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250 cycles) for 4.0 V-class anode-free cells and a substantially reduced cost in a sustainable way.",

        "abstract": "This investigation focuses on nominally La‐doped Na0.67MnO2, exploring its structural, electrochemical, and battery characteristics for Na‐ion batteries. X‐ray diffraction analysis reveals formation of composite materials containing three distinct phases: P2‐Na0.67MnO2, NaMn8O16, and LaMnO3. The bond structures of the powders undergo scrutiny through Fourier‐transform infrared and Raman analyses, revealing dependencies on the NaO, MnO, and LaO structures. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy‐dispersive X‐ray dot mapping analyses show that the La ions are unevenly dispersed within the samples, exhibiting a valence state of 3+. Half‐cell tests unveil similarities in redox peaks between the cyclic voltammetry analysis of La‐doped samples and P2‐type Na0.67MnO2, with a reduction in peak intensities as La content increases. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy model analysis indicates direct influences of La content on the half‐cell's resistive elements values. The synergistic effect of composite material with multiple phases yields promising battery performances for both half and full cells. The highest initial capacity value of 208.7 mAh g−1, with a 57% capacity fade, among others, is observed, and it diminishes with increasing La content. Full cells are constructed using an electrochemically presodiated hard carbon anode, yielding a promising capacity value of 184.5 mAh g−1 for sodium‐ion battery studies.",

        "abstract": "The low electronic conductivity and the sluggish sodium-ion diffusion in the compact crystal structure of Ti-based anodes seriously restrict their development in sodium-ion batteries. In this study, a new hollandite KxTiO2 with large (2 × 2) tunnels is synthesized by a facile carbothermal reduction method, and its sodium storage performance is investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses illustrate the formation mechanism of the hollandite KxTiO2 upon the carbothermal reduction process. Compared to the traditional layered or small (1 × 1) tunnel-type Ti-based materials, the hollandite KxTiO2 with large (2 × 2) tunnels may accommodate more sodium ions and facilitate the Na+ diffusion in the structure; thus, it is expected to get a large capacity and realize high rate capability. The synthesized KxTiO2 with large (2 × 2) tunnels shows a stable reversible capacity of 131 mAh g-1 (nearly 3 times of (1 × 1) tunnel-structured Na2Ti6O13) and superior cycling stability with no obvious capacity decay even after 1000 cycles, which is significantly better than the traditional layered Na2Ti3O7 (only 40% of capacity retention in 20 cycles). Moreover, the carbothermal process can naturally introduce oxygen vacancy and low-valent titanium as well as the surface carbon coating layer to the structure, which would greatly enhance the electronic conductivity of KxTiO2 and thus endow this material high rate capability. With a good rate capability and long cyclability, this hollandite KxTiO2 can serve as a new promising anode material for room-temperature long-life sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems, and the carbothermal reduction method is believed to be an effective and facile way to develop novel Ti-based anodes with simultaneous carbon coating and Ti(III) self-doping.",

        "title": "Altering the Alkaline Metal Ions in Lepidocrocite-Type Layered Titanate for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "The relatively large ionic radius of the Na ion is one of the primary reasons for the slow diffusion of Na ions compared to that of Li ions in de/intercalation processes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Interlayer expansion of intercalation hosts is one of the effective techniques for facilitating Na-ion diffusion. For most ionic layered compounds, interlayer expansion relies on intercalation of guest ions. It is important to investigate the role of these ions for material development of SIBs. In this study, alkali-metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+) with different sizes were intercalated into lepidocrocite-type layered titanate by a simple ion-exchange technique to achieve interlayer modulation and those were then evaluated as anode materials for SIBs. By controlling the intercalated alkaline ion species, basal spacings of layered titanates (LTs) in the range of 0.68 to 0.85 nm were obtained. Interestingly, the largest interlayer spacing induced by the large size of Cs did not yield the best performance, while the Na intercalated layered titanate (Na-ILT) demonstrated a superior performance with a specific capacity of 153 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. We found that the phenomena can be explained by the high alkaline metal ion concentration and the efficient utilization of the active sites in Na-ILT. The detailed analysis indicates that large intercalating ions like Cs can hamper sodium-ion diffusion although the interlayer spacing is large. Our work suggests that adopting an appropriate interlayer ion species is key to developing highly efficient layered electrode materials for SIBs.",

Here, a comprehensive regulation on the interfacial/bulk electrochemistry of hard carbons through atomic Zn doping is reported, which demonstrates a record‐high reversible capacity (546 mAh g−1), decent ICE (84%), remarkable rate capability (140 mAh g−1 @ 50 A g−1), and excellent LT capacity (443 mAh g−1 @ −40 °C), outperforming the state‐of‐the‐art literature. This work reveals that the Zn doping can generally induce a local electric field to enable fast bulk Na+ transportation, and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase, which elaborates the underlying origin of the boosted electrochemical performance. Importantly, distinguished from room temperature, the intrinsic Na+ migration/desolvation ability of the electrolyte is disclosed to be the crucial rate‐determining factors for the SIB performance at LT.

To overcome these issues, pyridine-regulated Sb@InSbS_3 ultrafine nanoplates loaded on reduced graphene oxides (Sb@InSbS_3@rGO) were designed and synthesized.

Next, partial In^3+ was exchanged with Sb^3+, and Sb@InSbS_3@rGO was obtained by using the subsequent annealing method. The unique structure of Sb@InSbS_3@rGO effectively shortened the transfer path of sodium ions and electrons and provided a high pseudocapacitance. As the anode in sodium-ion batteries, the Sb@InSbS_3@rGO electrode demonstrated a significantly higher reversible capacity, better stability (445 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1 A·g^−1 after 200 cycles and 212 mAh·g^−1 at 2 A·g^−1 after 1200 cycles), and superior rate (210 mAh·g^−1 at 6.4 A·g^−1) than the electrode without pyridine (355 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1 A·g^−1 after 55 cycles and 109 mAh·g^−1 at 2 A·g^−1 after 770 cycles). Furthermore, full cells were assembled by using the Sb@InSbS_3@rGO as anode and Na_3V_2(PO_4)_3 as cathode, which demonstrated good cycling and rate performances and exhibited promising application prospects. These results indicate that adjusting the microstructure of electrode materials through coordination balance is A·good strategy for obtaining high-capacity, high-rate, and long-cycle sodium storage performances.

        "abstract": "Solid-state sodium batteries (SSSBs) based on solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are prominent in future lithium-free energy storage systems owing to their intrinsic safety, high energy density, and cost-effectiveness. However, the commercial implementation of SSSBs is still limited by the large interface impedance and sodium dendrites caused by the insufficient anode-SSE interface contact. Herein, an ultra-stable composite sodium anode (CSA) with built-in well-dispersed ion-conductive NaxTiO2 is specifically constructed to stabilize the anode interface of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) electrolyte. The uniformly dispersed ion-conductive phase NaxTiO2 in the CSA can not only enhance the chemical and physical contact of the CSA with NZSP but also improve the inherent ion diffusing ability of the bulk sodium to compensate for the sodium depletion during stripping. Benefiting from these advantages, the CSA|NZSP|CSA cell exhibits an ultra-low interfacial impedance of 3.7 Ω cm2, a high critical current density (CCD) of 1.3 mA cm−2, and a stable plating/stripping performance of over 8000 h at 0.1 mA cm−2. The constructed full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode shows excellent cycling performance of 74.5% capacity retention for 800 cycles at 1 C. This work presents a pioneering composite anode design to achieve a compatible anode|SSE interface for facilitating the evolution of SSSBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal selenides have emerged as promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, they suffer from volume expansion, polyselenide dissolution, and sluggish kinetics, which lead to inadequate conversion reaction toward sodium and poor reversibility during the desodiation process. Therefore, the transition-metal selenides are far from long cycling stability, outstanding rate performance, and high initial Coulombic efficiency, which are the major challenges for practical application in SIBs. Here, an efficient anode material including an FeSe2 core and N-doped carbon shell with inner void space as well as high conductivity is developed for outstanding rate performance and long cycle life SIBs. In the ingeniously designed FeSe2@NC microrods, the N-doped carbon shell can facilitate mass transport/electron transfer, protect the FeSe2 core from the electrolyte, and accommodate volume variation of FeSe2 with the help of the inner void of the core. Thus, the FeSe2@NC microrods can maintain strong structural integrity upon long cycling and ensure a good reversible conversion reaction of FeSe2 during the discharge/charge process. As a result, the as-prepared FeSe2@NC microrods exhibit excellent sodium storage performance and ultrahigh stability, achieving an excellent rate capability (411 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1) and a long-term cycle performance (401.3 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries operating at room temperature have emerged as a generation of energy storage devices to replace lithium-ion batteries; however, they are limited by a lack of anode materials with both an adequate lifespan and excellent rate capability. To address this issue, we developed Nb2CTx MXene-framework MoS2 nanosheets coated with carbon (Nb2CTx@MoS2@C) and constructed a robust three-dimensional cross-linked structure. In such a design, highly conductive Nb2CTx MXene nanosheets prevent the restacking of MoS2 sheets and provide efficient channels for charge transfer and diffusion. Additionally, the hierarchical carbon coating has a certain level of volume elasticity and excellent electrical conductivity to guarantee the intercalation of sodium ions, facilitating both fast kinetics and long-term stability. As a result, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 530 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles and very long cycling stability with a capacity of 403 mA h g-1 and only 0.01% degradation per cycle for 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, this anode has an outstanding capacity retention rate of approximately 88.4% from 0.1 to 1 A g-1 in regard to rate performance. Most importantly, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode can realize a quick charge and discharge at current densities of 20 or even 40 A g-1 with capacities of 340 and 260 mAh g-1, respectively, which will increase the number of practical applications for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "As the preferred anode material for sodium-ion batteries, hard carbon (HC) confronts significant obstacles in providing a long and dominant low-voltage plateau to boost the output energy density of full batteries. The critical challenge lies in precisely enhancing the local graphitization degree to minimize Na+ ad-/chemisorption, while effectively controlling the growth of internal closed nanopores to maximize Na+ filling. Unfortunately, traditional high-temperature preparation methods struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously. Herein, a transient sintering-involved kinetically-controlled synthesis strategy is proposed that enables the creation of metastable HCs with precisely tunable carbon phases and low discharge/charge voltage plateaus. By optimizing the temperature and width of thermal pulses, the high-throughput screened HCs are characterized by short-range ordered graphitic micro-domains that possess accurate crystallite width and height, as well as appropriately-sized closed nanopores. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low-voltage plateaus below 0.1 V, with the best sample exhibiting a high plateau capacity of up to 325 mAh g-1. The energy density of the HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery can therefore be increased by 20.7%. Machine learning study explicitly unveils the \"carbon phase evolution-electrochemistry\" relationship. This work promises disruptive changes to the synthesis, optimization, and commercialization of HC anodes for high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries.",

Conversely, an anomalous potential plateau negative migration phenomenon was observed in Cu xS anode of sodium-ion battery. In this study, the background mechanism was clarified from the switch of intercalation-conversion reactions and structure evolution. The dynamic cooperation between intercalation and conversion reactions may root the potential plateau negative migration during cycling. In the initial stage, the intercalation-type reaction with Na3Cu4S4 and Na4Cu2S3 products at 2.13 and 1.92 V would dominate the early migration process of potential plateaus. In the second stage, the conversion-type reaction dominated by Na2S and metallic copper formed at 1.85 and 1.53 V in the later period. The aforementioned results would provide new perspective on the electrochemical behavior of transition-metal sulfide anode and provide a clue for reducing voltage polarization.",

It is demonstrated that the phonon spectrum confirms the dynamic stability and the adsorption energy identifies a strong interaction between Na atoms and the substrate material. The electronic bands indicative of inherent metallicity contribute to the enhancement of electronic conductivity after Na adsorption. The multilayer adsorption of Na provides a theoretical capacity of 361.7 mAh/g, which is comparable to that of other representative two-dimensional anode materials.

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) has attracted great attention as a potential candidate for anode materials of high-energy density sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity, appropriate working voltage, and natural abundance. However, the low electrical conductance and huge volumetric variation during the sodiation-desodiation process, causing poor rate performance and cyclability, have limited the practical application of RP in NIBs. Herein, we report a rational strategy to resolve these issues by encapsulating nanoscaled RP into conductive and networked carbon nanocages (denoted as RP@CNCs) using a combination of a phosphorus-amine based method and evacuation-filling process. The large interior cavities volume of CNCs and controllable solution-based method enable the ultrahigh RP loading amount (85.3 wt %) in the RP@CNC composite. Benefiting from the synergic effects of the interior cavities and conductive network, which afford high structure stability and rapid electron transport, the RP@CNC composite presents a high systematic capacity of 1363 mA h g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, favorable high-rate capability, and splendid long-cycling performance with capacity retention over 80% after 1300 cycles at 5000 mA g-1.

The comprehensive Na+ storage properties of H-CuO MNCs@rGO obviously exceeded those of hollow CuO cubes (H-CuO MNCs) and bulk CuO anodes. Such enhanced Na+ storage performances of H-CuO MNCs@rGO can be attributed to its reasonable hollow and hierarchical micro-nano structures, which provide abundant redox active sites, shorten Na+ migration pathway, buffer volume expansion, and improve electronic/ionic conductivity during sodiation/desodiation process.

Constructing anode-free batteries is effective to achieve high energy density, yet remains highly challenging to obtain high power density simultaneously. To overcome this dilemma, dual-ion storage strategy is introduced to anode-free battery. As a proof of concept, an anode-free sodium dual-ion battery (AFSDIB) with combined high energy and power densities is successfully fabricated. Plasma-treated current collector (Al/N-C) exhibits a sodiophilic N-doped carbon surface, enabling highly reversible Na plating/stripping at high current densities. Meanwhile, the sluggish desolvation process is intrinsically eliminated at the polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathodic side owing to the solvation-free anion storage chemistry. Consequently, the assembled Al/N-C||PTPAn AFSDIB exhibits a remarkable energy density over 380 Wh kg−1 (at 375 W kg−1) and power density above 1800 W kg−1 (at 302 Wh kg−1) based on active materials and consumed electrolyte, which is superior to the reported state-of-the-art anode-free and dual-ion sodium batteries.

        "abstract": "Nanosized TiO2 is now actively developed as a low-cost and potentially high capacity anode material of Na-ion batteries, but its poor capacity utilization and insufficient cyclability remains an obstacle for battery applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we synthesized electrospun TiO2/C nanofibers, where anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with a diameter of ∼12 nm were densely embedded in the conductive carbon fibers, thus preventing them from aggregating and attacking by electrolyte. Due to its abundant active surfaces of well-dispersed TiO2 nanocrytals and high electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix, the TiO2/C anode shows a high redox capacity of ∼302.4 mA h g(-1) and a high-rate capability of 164.9 mAh g(-1) at a very high current of 2000 mA g(-1). More significantly, this TiO2/C anode can be cycled with nearly 100% capacity retention over 1000 cycles, showing a sufficiently long cycle life for battery applications. The nanofibrous architecture of the TiO2/C composite and its superior electrochemical performance may provide new insights for development of better host materials for practical Na-ion batteries.",

However, its practical application has been impeded by its intrinsic low electronic conductivity and large volume variations during sodiation/desodiation process. Here, we design a composite to confine nanosized red phosphorus into the hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) walls by a vaporization-condensation strategy. The mass loading of P in the HPC/P composite is optimized to deliver a reversible specific capacity of 2,202 mAh/gp based on the mass of red P (836 mAh/gcomposite based on the total composite mass), a high capacity retention over 77% after 100 cycles, and excellent rate performance of 929 mAh/gp at 2 C. The hierarchical porous carbon serves as the conductive networks, downsize the red phosphorus to nanoscale, and provide free space to accommodate the large volume expansions. The suppressed mechanical failure of the red phosphorus also enhances the stability of solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which is confirmed by the microscopy and impedance spectroscopy after the cycling tests. Our studies provide a feasible approach for potentially viable high-capacity NIB anode.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has recently attracted lots of interest due to its extraordinary theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g-1 in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it is challenging to solve the stability in the preparation process, while enhancing its low conductivity and solving the structural degradation caused by the enormous volume expansion (>490%) during cycling have become the targeted pursuits. Here, we creatively introduced the magnetic stimuli source to solve both of the preparation and the volume swelling force issues. In the precedence of magnetic field, the increased pressure in the sample room drives the homogeneous red P particles to finely deposit on the surface of Fe3O4/C. The chain-like Fe3O4/C/red P was successfully prepared assisted by the magnetic field. Simultaneously, considering that the speeded up movements for both electrons and sodium ions depended on Lorentz force, the electrochemical performance of such anode material is optimized by tuning the arrays in collector. It is noted that the nanostructure is elastically rearranged for the resistance of volume swelling force. Compared with the single Fe3O4/C/red P particles, for the magnetic fabricated Fe3O4/C/P chain structure, the electrostatic potential for reconstructing the chain-like Fe3O4/C/P is the largest. Such configured chain-like anode material exhibits an extraordinary cyclic performance and superior rate capability (692 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1). The magnetic stimuli source bridges both the preparation optimization and the electrochemical performance enhancements for the red P based anode materials.",

It exhibits a high capacity of 742 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles at 0.2C, and superior rate performance with 449 mA h g-1 at 2C after 500 cycles. Moreover, the sodium storage mechanism is confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and ex situ X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was adopted to analyze the reaction dynamics.

Tin-antimony oxide is gaining research interest as a sodium-ion battery anode material owing to its ideal theoretical specific capacity, environment friendly, and low cost. However, because of the inner nature of poor electrical conductivity of oxides and slow ionic diffusion kinetic, the electrochemical performance of tin-antimony oxides (SSO) differs significantly from the theoretical value of merit. In this paper, we demonstrated N-doping porous carbon fibers encapsulated Sn/Sb@Sb_2SnO_5 composite (Sn/Sb@Sb_2SnO_5@PCFs-N) material. Through the use of a simple electrostatic spinning technique, the Sn and Sb nanocrystalline were in situ generated around the SSOs in a specific way, and the N-doping in the fabricated porous carbon fibers can modulate the charge transport in the fabricated composite. The unique structure can successfully increase the electrical conductivity and the specific capacity of the fabricated composite. Using as anode for Na^+ ions storage, the fabricated composite delivers high specific capacity and good cycling stability and rate capability, showing a high capacity of 450 mAhg^−1 at 50 mAg^−1 current density even after 100 cycles. The better rate capability can be sustained even when the current raised up to 500 mA g^−1. This current work can offer a perspective on the effect of phases modified and doping on the functionality of materials for the next-generation high-specific energy sodium-ion battery.",

However, their potential and electrochemical mechanisms in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have not been fully studied. Herein, a composite material comprising vacancy-defects ternary topological insulator Bi2Se2Te encapsulated in mesoporous carbon spheres (Bi2Se2Te@C) is designed. Bi2Se2Te with ample vacancy-defects has a wide interlayer spacing to enable frequent insertion/extraction of Na+ and boost reaction kinetics within the electrode. Meanwhile, the Bi2Se2Te@C with optimized yolk-shell structure can buffer the volume variation without breaking the outer protective carbon shell, ensuring structural stability and integrity. As expected, the Bi2Se2Te@C electrode delivers high reversible capacity and excellent rate capability in half SIB cells. Various electrochemical analyses and theoretical calculations manifest that Bi2Se2Te@C anode confirms the synergistic effect of ternary chalcogenide systems and suitable void space yolk-shell structure. Consequently, the full cells of SIB and SIHC coupled with Bi2Se2Te@C anode exhibit good performance and high energy/power density, indicating its widespread practical applications. This design is expected to offer a reliable strategy for further exploring advanced topological insulators in Na+-based storage systems.",

Although the electrochemical performance can be improved by introducing functional groups, the selective introduction of single functional groups into biomass carbon remains difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a wood-derived carbon with selectively introduced C=O groups by combining tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) with wood cellulose pulps. The integration of TMOS introduces abundant C=O groups into the carbon during polycondensation and pyrolysis process. The C=O groups play a dominant role in anode surface-controlled processes, and this leads to improvements in pseudo-capacity and fast electrode process kinetics. Besides, the introduction of C=O groups generates oxygen functional active sites that promote Na+ adsorption, and creates a sufficiently large graphite interlayer distance. The as-obtained carbon shows a high capacity of 330 mAh g-1 at 40 mA g-1 and excellent cycling stability. Moreover, our strategy is simple and uses wood cellulose pulps as precursors. It therefore enables low-cost and large-scale synthesis of carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

The nanoholes provide a high density of cross-plane diffusion channels for sodium ions, serving as ionic diffusion shortcuts between different graphene layers to accelerate ion transport across the entire electrode. The unique architecture endows FeCo2Se4/HG with superior rate capability (411.2 mA h g-1 at 20 A g-1) and a specific capacity of 432.4 mA h g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 after 2000 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 92.4%.

        "abstract": "Previously, α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals are recognized as anode materials owing to their high capacity and multiple properties. Now, this work provides high-voltage α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics cathodes fabricated by the solvothermal and calcination processes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Then, their structure and electrical conductivity were investigated by the first-principles calculations. Also, the SIB with the α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics cathode exhibits a high initial charge-specific capacity of 692.5 mA h g–1 from 2.0 to 4.5 V at a current density of 25 mA g–1. After 800 cycles, the discharge capacity is still 201.8 mA h g–1, well exceeding the one associated with the present-state high-voltage SIB. Furthermore, the effect of the porous structure of the α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics on sodium ion transport and cyclability is investigated. This reveals that α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics will be a remarkably promising low-cost and pollution-free high-voltage cathode candidate for high-voltage SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Organic electrode materials are promising to be applied in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost and easily modified molecular structures. Nevertheless, low conductivity and high solubility in electrolytes still limit the development of organic electrodes. In this work, a carboxylate small molecule (BDTTS) based on tetrathiafulvalene is developed as anode material for SIBs. BDTTS has a large rigid π-conjugated planar structure, which may reduce solubility in the electrolyte, meanwhile facilitating charge transporting. Experimental results and theoretical calculations both support that apart from the four carbonyl groups, the sulfur atoms on tetrathiafulvalene also provide additional active sites during the discharge/charge process. Therefore, the additional active sites can well compensate for the capacity loss caused by the large molecular weight. The as-synthesized BDTTS electrode renders an excellent capacity of 230 mAh g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1 and an excellent long-life performance of 128 mAh g-1 at 2C after 500 cycles. This work enriches the study on organic electrodes for high-performance SIBs and paves the way for further development and utilization of organic electrodes.",

In this work, carbon coated TiO_2 (CC-TiO_2) nanoparticles have been synthesized by using TiO_2 and sucrose as soluble source of carbon. The carbon coating on TiO_2 particles was formed after heat treatment in inert atmosphere. CC-TiO_2 particles exhibited reversible capacity of 116 mAh g^− 1 at 0.1 C after 50 cycles, and high capacity retention of 77% after 100 cycles in a sodium-ion battery cell. The impressive electrochemical performance of the TiO_2 particles is due to several factors: the small size of the crystallites, the continuous electronic network created by the close contact of individual carbon-coated TiO_2 particles, and the efficient penetration of the mesopores by the electrolyte.",

However, combining carbon materials with micronanoparticles of metal chalcogenide always involve complicated processes, such as polymer coating, carbonization, and sulfidation/selenization. To address this issue, herein, we reported a series of carbon-coated FexSey@CN (FexSey = FeSe2, Fe3Se4, Fe7Se8) composites prepared via the thermodynamic transformation of a crystalline organic hybrid iron selenide [Fe(phen)2](Se4) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline). By pyrolyzing the bulk crystals of [Fe(phen)2](Se4) at different temperatures, FexSey microrods were formed in situ, where the nitrogen-doped carbon layers were coated on the surface of the microrods. Moreover, all the as-prepared FexSey@CN composites exhibited excellent sodium-ion storage capabilities as anode materials in SIBs. This work proves that crystalline organic hybrid metal chalcogenides can be used as a novel material system for the in situ formation of carbon-coated metal chalcogenide composites, which could have great potential in the application of electrochemical energy storage.",

The floral foam-derived hard carbon presents a notable electrochemical performance, by maintaining a specific discharge capacity of 88.8% after 1000 cycles and good rate performance. Such favorable electrochemical performances might be ascribed to the hard carbon structure with a larger interlayer spacing and enough defects, which is significant for reversible Na+ ion intercalation and deintercalation.",

        "abstract": "Recently, anode materials with synergistic sodium storage mechanisms of conversion combined with alloying reactions for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have received widespread attention due to their high theoretical capacities. In this work, through reacting with an appropriate concentration of Sb3+ ions and a simple carbonization process, hollow ZnSe/Sb2Se3 microspheres encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (ZnSe/Sb2Se3@NC) are progressively synthesized based on a cation-exchange reaction, using polydopamine-coated ZnSe (ZnSe@PDA) microspheres as the precursor. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between the unique structure and composition characteristics, when serving as an anode material for SIBs, they result in higher sodium diffusion coefficients (8.7 × 10-13-3.98 × 10-9 cm2 s-1) and ultrafast pseudocapacitive sodium storage capability. Compared with ZnSe@NC and Sb2Se3@NCs exhibit, ZnSe/Sb2Se3@NC exhibits more stable capacity (438 mA h g-1 at a current of 0.5 A g-1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (316 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1). Our work provides a convenient method to construct high performance anodes with tunable composition and structure for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Crystal transformation of metal compound cathodes during charge/discharge processes in alkali metal‐ion batteries usually generates profound impact on structural stability and electrochemical performance, while the theme in anode materials, which always occurs and completes during the first redox cycle, is rarely explored probably due to the fast transformation dynamics. Herein, for the first time, a unique crystal transformation behavior with slow dynamics in anode of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is reported, which further promotes electrochemical performance. Specifically, irreversible γ → β crystal transformation of In2Se3 is observed, induced by the persistent size degradation of In2Se3 particles during repeated sodiation/desodiation, supported by a series of ex situ characterizations, such as HRTEM, XRD, and XPS of γ‐In2Se3/reduced graphene oxide (γ‐In2Se3@rGO) nanocomposite. The hybrid electrode shows ultrahigh long‐term cycling stability (378 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 1000 cycles) and excellent rate capability (272 mA h g−1 at 20.0 A g−1). Full battery with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode also manifests superior performance, promising β‐In2Se3 dominated electrode materials in high‐power and long‐life SIBs. The first‐principle calculations suggest the crystal transformation enhances electric conductivity of β‐In2Se3 and facilitates its accessibility to sodium. In combination with the synergistic effect between rGO matrix, substantially enhanced electrochemical performance is realized.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon has garnered significant attention due to its high capacity, low cost and abundant resources. However, the application of biomass hard carbon is limited by the low initial coulombic efficiency and rate capability. Based on these issues, natural fortune paulownia wood with numerous pores has been used as the precursor to investigate the effects on initial coulombic efficiency and rate capability at different heating temperatures. As the heating temperature increased from 1000 °C to 1400 °C, the graphitization degree of the prepared hard carbon gradually increased, and the defect concentration gradually decreased, resulting in an increase in ICE from 76.8 % to 85.9 %, and a significant increase in the proportion of platform capacity from 49 % to 69 %. The prepared HC-1400 exhibits a reversible capacity of 313 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, and can still achieve a capacity retention rate of 92 % after 500 cycles at 1 C (charge) and 5 C (discharge). Meanwhile, due to the excellent inheritance of the 3D connected porous structure of paulownia xylem, the prepared hard carbon even exhibits an excellent capacity of 209 mAh g−1 at 10 C. In addition, the assembled HC-1400||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery also demonstrated a high energy density of 204.4 Wh kg−1 at 0.5 C, and still exhibited 116.6 Wh kg−1 even at a high rate of 10 C.

The submicron spherical structure, with its limited surface area and scarce oxygen-containing moieties, effectively curtails the irreversible sodium-ion loss in solid-electrolyte interphase film formation, resulting in heightened ICE. The abundant nitrogen doping can expand carbon-layer spacing as well as improve the electron/ion-transport dynamics, guaranteeing a high sodium storage capacity and a strong rate capability.

        "abstract": "In order to become commercially viable, sodium-ion batteries need to deliver long cycle life with good capacity and energy density while still ensuring safety. Electrolyte plays a key role forming solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers at low potential, which affects the thermal stability and cycle life of the anode materials under consideration. In this study, an ether-based non-flammable electrolyte, 1 M NaBF4 in tetraglyme, is tested for sodium storage using a non-carbonaceous anode material Na2Ti3O7/C, and the results are compared with those obtained with the popularly used carbonate-based electrolyte, 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (v/v = 1:1). The Na2Ti3O7/C versus Na cells using 1 M NaBF4 in tetraglyme show a much higher first cycle Coulombic efficiency (73%) than those using 1 M NaClO4 in EC/PC (33%). Thermal stability studies using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) conclusively show that Na2Ti3O7/C electrodes cycled with 1 M NaBF4 in tetraglyme are more thermally stable than the one cycled with 1 M NaClO4 in EC/PC. Further investigations on the formation of SEI layers were performed using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and DSC studies. These studies unambiguously demonstrate that the SEI formed on Na2Ti3O7/C using 1 M NaBF4 in tetraglyme is not only less resistive but also more stable than the SEI formed using 1 M NaClO4 in EC/PC.",

Nevertheless, volume expansion, a common flaw for conversion-alloy type materials during the sodiation and desodiation processes, is bad for the structure of materials and thus obstructs the application of antimony sulfide in energy storage. A common approach to solve this problem is by introducing carbon or other matrices as buffer material. However, the common preparation of Sb2S3 could result in environmental pollution and excessive energy consumption in most cases. To incorporate green chemistry, natural stibnite ore (Sb2S3) after modification via carbon sheets was applied as a first-hand material in SIBs through a facile and efficient strategy. The unique composites exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance with a higher reversible capacity, a better rate capability, as well as an excellent cycling stability compared to that of the natural stibnite ore. In short, the study is expected to offer a new approach to improve Sb2S3 composites as an anode in SIBs and a reference for the development of natural ore as a first-hand material in energy storage.",

The explanation of the storage mechanism of heteroatom-doped HC is to increase the active site or widen the layer spacing while ignoring the effect of local bending structure induced by it. Meanwhile, the storage mechanism by the localized bending structure also lacks in-depth study. Herein, a locally curved configuration and an amorphous structure are designed by introducing different heteroatoms, respectively, and the mechanism of the two types of structures on the Li+/Na+ ions storage is explored. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the adsorption energy of Li+/Na+ ions is optimal at the appropriate curvature of 27.72 m-1. Serving as anode for lithium/sodium ion batteries in ester electrolytes, the optimized HCs demonstrate satisfied specific capacity and high-rate capability, respectively. Furthermore, the charging capacity below 1.0 V of HC with suitable curvature microstructure reaches 84.8% and 90.1% of the total charge capacity, confirming that the curvature defects can better control the delithiation/desodiation process, and provide a higher energy density.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from large electrode volume change and sluggish redox kinetics for the relatively large ionic radius of sodium ions, raising a significant challenge to improve their long‐term cyclability and rate capacity. Here, it is proposed to apply 2D amorphous iron selenide sulfide nanosheets (a‐FeSeS NSs) as an anode material for SIBs and demonstrate that they exhibit remarkable rate capability of 528.7 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and long‐life cycle (10 000 cycles) performance (300.4 mAh g−1). This performance is much more superior to that of the previously reported Fe‐based anode materials, which is attributed to their amorphous structure that alleviates volume expansion of electrode, 2D nature that facilitates electrons/ions transfer, and the S/Se double anions that offer more reaction sites and stabilize the amorphous structure. Such a 2D amorphous strategy provides a fertile platform for structural engineering of other electrode materials, making a more secure energy prospect closer to a reality.",

        "abstract": "Increasing the electrochemical performance of electrode materials in sodium ion batteries (NIBs) remains a major challenge. Here, a combined experimental and theoretical investigation on the modification induced by Sb2S3 embedded in a heteroatom-doped 3D carbon matrix (CM) for efficient anodes in NIBs is presented. The structural and chemical characterization demonstrates the successful doping of 3D CM with S and Sb atoms. When evaluated as anode materials for NIBs, the heteroatom-doped nanocomposites delivered a better cycling stability and superior rate capability than those of undoped Sb2S3/CM anodes. First principle calculations were used at the Density Functional Theory level to systematically study the Sb2S3/CM and Sb2S3/heteroatom doped-CM composites, as NIBs anodes. Doping the carbon substrate by heteroatoms improved the adsorption of Sb2S3 on the matrix and allowed for ionic/covalent attraction with the Sb2S3 nanoparticle, respectively. Such results could be used to model the stabilty of the composite architectures observed in the experiment, for superior cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is the most commonly used anode material in sodium-ion batteries. However, the solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer formed in carbonate ester-based electrolytes has an imperceptible dissolution tendency and a sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, resulting in unsatisfactory performance of the HC anode. Given that electrode/electrolyte interface property is highly dependent on the configuration of Helmholtz plane, we filtrate proper solvents by PFBE (PF6- anion binding energy) and CAE (carbon absorption energy) and disclose the function of chosen TFEP to reconstruct the Helmholtz plane and regulate the SEI film on HC anode. Benefiting from the preferential adsorption tendency on HC surface and strong anion-dragging interaction of TFEP, a robust and thin anion-derived F-rich SEI film is established, which greatly enhances the mechanical stability and the Na+ ion diffusion kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The rationally designed TFEP-based electrolyte endows Na||HC half-cell and 2.8 Ah HC||Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 pouch cell with excellent rate capability, long cycle life, high safety and low-temperature adaptability. It is believed that this insightful recognition of tuning interface properties will pave a new avenue on the design of compatible electrolyte for low-cost, long-life, and high-safe sodium-ion batteries.",

Hard carbon anodes, sourced from lignocellulosic biomasses, exhibit considerable promise due to their widespread availability, economical viability, and environmentally friendly attributes with zero carbon-dioxide emissions. Given the intricate compositions and composite nature of lignocellulosic materials, it becomes imperative to prioritize factors crucial for the fabrication of hard carbon anodes that exhibit enhanced sodium-ion storage capabilities.

        "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between structure regulation and electrochemical performance is key to developing efficient and sustainable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) materials. Herein, seven Cobalt-M-based (M=V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) Prussian blue analogues (CoM-PBAs) are designed as anodes for SIBs via a universal low-energy co-precipitation approach with the strategic inclusion of 3d transition metals. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulation and experimental validation reveal that a moderate p-band center of cyanide linkages (-CN-) is more favorable for Na+ intercalation and diffusion, while the d-band center of metal cations is linearly related to electrode stability. Among seven CoM-based PBAs, CoV-PBAs possess the best sodium-ion adsorption/diffusion kinetics and overall cycling performance, including high specific capacity (565 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g), cycling stability (over 15000 cycles with 97.7% capacity retention), and superior rate capability (174.7 mAh/g at 30 A/g). In-situ/ex-situ techniques further demonstrate that the π-electron regulation by V introduction enhances the reversibility and kinetics of redox reactions. Moreover, the study identified the \"p-band center\" and \"d-band center\" may serve as key descriptors for quantifying the capability and stability of other-type bimetal Co-based anodes (oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) with similar theoretical capacity, offering a potentially transformative approach for selecting practical SIB electrode materials.",

Moreover, the anode structure’s stability was examined via the open-source Large-scale atomic/molecular massively Parallel Simulator code. Our results indicated that the migration of SIBs toward the anode material is significantly greater than other ions during charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, SIBs systems can be competitive with PIBs and LIBs systems. In addition, the average values of the potential energies for the anode materials/ions complexes are about ~ − 713.65, ~  − 2030.41, and ~ − 912.36 kcal mol^−1 in systems LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs, respectively.

In the strategy, the SnS nanosheet arrays confined into the integrated carbon matrix containing porous carbon fibers and graphene‐like carbon film, perform a greatly improved electrochemical performance. In situ TEM experiments reveal that the vertical graphene‐like carbon film can not only protect the SnS nanosheet from destruction well and enhance the conductivity, but also transforms SnS nanosheet into ultrafine nanoparticles to promote the electrochemical kinetics. Systematic electrochemical investigations exhibit that the CCF@SnS@G electrode delivers a stable reversible capacity of 529 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1 for LIBs and 541.4 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 for SIBs, suggesting its good potential for anode electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received increasing attention because of their appealing cell voltages and cost-effective features. However, the atom aggregation and electrode volume variation inevitably deteriorate the sodium storage kinetics. Here a new strategy is proposed to boost the lifetime of SIB by synthesizing sea urchin-like FeSe2 /nitrogen-doped carbon (FeSe2 /NC) composites. The robust FeN coordination hinders the Fe atom aggregation and accommodates the volume expansion, while the unique biomorphic morphology and high conductivity of FeSe2 /NC enhance the intercalation/deintercalation kinetics and shorten the ion/electron diffusion length. As expected, FeSe2 /NC electrodes deliver excellent half (387.6 mAh g-1 at 20.0 A g-1 after 56 000 cycles) and full (203.5 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 after 1200 cycles) cell performances. Impressively, an ultralong lifetime of SIB composed of FeSe2 /Fe3 Se4 /NC anode is uncovered with the cycle number exceeding 65 000. The sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density function theory calculations and in situ characterizations. This work hereby provides a new paradigm for enhancing the lifetime of SIB by constructing a unique coordination environment between active material and framework.",

The target mixtures were synthesised in 30 min with disodium naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate (Na-NDC) as a common constituent in all. Both components in all mixtures were shown to participate in the charge storage and had a considerable effect on the performance characteristics, such as specific capacity and working voltage, in half and full cell formats.

        "abstract": "While conventional oxides have a high theoretical specific capacity, they also suffer from severe volume expansion during cycling, which seriously affects the stability of the structure. Hence, high‐entropy oxide nanoparticles (Cr0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2Co0.2)3O4, CFMNC) were synthesized and uniformly dispersed on reduced graphene oxide(rGO) carriers using a solvothermal method‐assisted heat treatment as a novel sodium‐ion batteries anode material. The introduction of rGO does not change the crystal structure of CFMNC material, while loading CFMNC into the sheet structure of rGO forms a highly conductive structure, which promotes electron/ion transfer. The high specific surface area is conducive to the full infiltration of the electrode material with the electrolyte, and improve the electrode activity. The random distribution of individual metal ions in CFMNC makes itself have a strong entropy‐driven structural stabilization effect to achieve the cycling stability: 149.1 mAh g−1 can be maintained at 100 mA g−1 over 200 cycles with capacity decay rate of 0.05 % cycle−1. CFMNC/rGO also have excellent rate capability (76.1 mAh g−1at 3000mAg−1, and returned to 153.6 mAh g−1at 200 mA g−1 with almost 100 % capacity retention).

        "abstract": "Hydrazine-reduced graphite oxide and graphene oxide were synthesized to compare their performances as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Reduced graphite oxide inherits the layer structure of graphite, with an average spacing between neighboring layers (d-spacing) of 0.374 nm; this exceeds the d-spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). The larger d-spacing provides wider channels for transporting lithium ions and sodium ions in the material. We showed that reduced graphite oxide as an anode in lithium-ion batteries can reach a specific capacity of 917 mA h g-1, which is about three times of 372 mA h g-1, the value expected for the LiC6 structures on the electrode. This increase is consistent with the wider d-spacing, which enhances lithium intercalation and de-intercalation on the electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries with reduced graphite oxide anodes show a noticeable improvement compared to those with reduced graphene oxide anodes. This improvement indicates that reduced graphite oxide, with larger interlayer spacing, has fewer defects and is thus more stable. In summary, we found that reduced graphite oxide may be a more favorable form of graphene for the fabrication of electrodes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries and other energy storage devices.",

Engineering heterostructure is an attractive solution for rapid Na+ transfer, and introducing carbonaceous materials also facilitates enhanced conductivity and structural stability. Herein, CoSe/MoSe2 heterostructure combined with homogeneous carbon composites are rational designed. The kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations verified that heterointerface engineering induced build‐in electric field effect can amplifies the Na+ diffusion kinetics, while carbon contributes to enhanced electrical conductivity and structural stability. Expectedly, the CoSe/MoSe2‐C exhibits high capacity and extremely ultra‐long lifespan (320.9 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1 over 10,000 cycles with an average decay of only 0.01781 mAh g−1 per cycle).

For the commercial success of this technology, significant progress should be made in developing robust anode (negative electrode) materials with high capacity and long cycle life. Sn-P compounds are considered promising anode materials that have considerable potential to meet the required performance of SIBs, and they have been typically prepared by high-energy mechanical milling. Here, we report Sn-P-based anodes synthesised through solvothermal transformation of Sn metal and their electrochemical Na storage properties. The temperature and time period used for solvothermal treatment play a crucial role in determining the phase, microstructure, and composition of the Sn-P compound and thus its electrochemical performance. The Sn-P compound prepared under an optimised solvothermal condition shows excellent electrochemical performance as an SIB anode, as evidenced by a high reversible capacity of ~560 mAh g^−1 at a current density of 100 mA g^−1 and cycling stability for 100 cycles.

Herein, a core‐shell structure of bismuth (Bi) nanospheres coated with carbon (Bi@C) is constructed by utilizing a novel Bi‐based complex (1,4,5,8‐naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as the ligand) as the precursor, which provides an effective template to fabricate Bi‐based anodes. At −40°C, the Bi@C anode achieves a high capacity, which is equivalent to 96% of that at 25°C, benefitting from the core‐shell nanostructured engineering and Na+‐ether‐solvent cointercalation process. The special Na+‐diglyme cointercalation behavior may effectively reduce the activation energy and accelerate the Na+ diffusion kinetics, enabling the excellent low‐temperature performance of the Bi@C electrode. As expected, the fabricated Na3V2(PO4)3//Bi@C full‐cell delivers impressive rechargeability in the ether‐based electrolyte at −40°C. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical tests also reveal the fast reaction kinetic mechanism at LT, thanks to a much lower diffusion energy barrier (167 meV) and a lower reaction activation energy (32.2 kJ mol−1) of Bi@C anode in comparison with that of bulk Bi.

In this study, we investigated the roles of functional groups in rGO-based heterogeneous bilayers using first-principles density functional theory calculations. The thermodynamic affinities to Na atoms, kinetic diffusion, and working potential behaviors of the Na atoms in various models, such as MoS2/graphene (Gr), MoS2/Gr–O, MoS2/Gr–OH, and MoS2/Gr–COOH, were accurately evaluated. It is clearly demonstrated that the noncovalent bonding nature is a predominant descriptor of Na affinity rather than the charge distribution around the intercalated Na atom. The activation barriers for Na atomic diffusion in the MoS2/Gr, MoS2/Gr–O, MoS2/Gr–OH, and MoS2/Gr–COOH models were estimated to be 0.24, 0.27, 0.35, and 0.31 eV, respectively. This indicated that the functional groups slightly delayed the Na motion. Notably, the obtained results demonstrated that the –COOH group not only enhanced the affinity towards Na intercalation but also induced a low working voltage at approximately 1 V. Therefore, the carboxyl functional group exhibits high material stability, making rGO a promising candidate for SIB anode materials.",

        "abstract": "Compared with the scarce resources of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries have been attracting research attentions as an ideal carrier for large-scale energy storage systems due to their abundant raw material resources. Organic materials are gaining importance as SIB anodes due to their advantages of simple preparation method, recyclability, and multi-electron reactions. In this work, disodium terephthalate/multi-walled carbon nanotube (Na2TP/MWCNT) organic composite was prepared as SIB anode material by an anti-solvent method. Experimental results indicated that the optimum sodium storage can be achieved with 10 wt% MWCNT dosage, where reversible capacities reached 229.9 and 93.2 mA h/g at current densities 0.1 and 2C, respectively. The capacity remained 124.9 mA h/g after 50 cycles at 1C current density, which suggested that the composite could act as a candidate for sodium ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "Research on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has recently been revitalized due to the unique features of much lower costs and comparable energy/power density to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which holds great potential for grid-level energy storage systems. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are considered as promising anode candidates for SIBs with high theoretical capacity, while their intrinsic low electrical conductivity and large volume expansion upon Na+ intercalation raise the challenging issues of poor cycle stability and inferior rate performance. Herein, the designed formation of hybrid nanoboxes composed of carbon-protected CoSe2 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon hollow skeletons (denoted as CoSe2 @C∩NC) via a template-assisted refluxing process followed by conventional selenization treatment is reported, which exhibits tremendously enhanced electrochemical performance when applied as the anode for SIBs. Specifically, it can deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 324 mAh g-1 at current density of 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles and exhibit outstanding high rate cycling stability at the rate of 5 A g-1 over 2000 cycles. This work provides a rational strategy for the design of advanced hybrid nanostructures as anode candidates for SIBs, which could push forward the development of high energy and low cost energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is the most promising anode for the commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs); however, a general mechanism for sodium storage in HC remains unclear, obstructing the development of highly efficient anodes for NIBs. To elucidate the mechanism of sodium storage in the pores, operando synchrotron small‐angle X‐ray scattering, wide‐angle X‐ray scattering, X‐ray absorption near edge structure, Raman spectroscopy, and galvanostatic measurements are combined. The multimodal approach provides mechanistic insights into the sodium pore‐filling process for different HC microstructures including the pore sizes that are preferentially filled, the extent to which different pore sizes are filled, and how the defect concentration influences pore filling. It is observed that sodium in the larger pores has an increased pseudo‐metallic sodium character consistent with larger sodium clusters. Furthermore, it is shown that the HCs prepared at higher pyrolysis temperatures have a larger capacity from sodium stored in the pores and that sodium intercalation between graphene layers occurs simultaneously with the pore filling in the plateau region. Opportunities are outlined to improve the performance of HC anodes by fully utilizing the pores for sodium storage, helping to pave the way for the commercialization of sodium ion batteries.",

To eliminate the contact resistance of the film, we provide a new strategy to fuse the fiber junctions by introducing MoO2 in the fibers, which replaces the C–C interface by a more active C–MoO2–C interface at the fiber junction to promote mass transfer. MoO2 reacts with C matrix to generate Mo2C and form self-fused junctions during the carbonization process. Due to much lower charge transfer and sodium diffusion resistance, the C–Mo2C fiber film with self-fused junctions shows much better cyclability with capacity retention of 90% after 2000 cycles at a constant current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, the Mo2C particles provide many electrochemically active sites, leading to additional improvement in sodium storage. The C–Mo2C fiber film has a capacity of 134 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a high capacity of 99 mA h g−1 even at 5 A g−1.",

Here, we report Sb2S5 nanoparticles (∼5 nm) uniformly encapsulated in three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene foam, which were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal coassembly strategy, as a high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The as-prepared composite can be directly used as electrodes without adding a binder or current collector, exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity (845 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), ultralong cycling life (91.6% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 A g-1), and exceptional rate capability (525 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1). This is attributed to fast Na+ ion diffusion from the ultrasmall nanoparticles and excellent electric transport between the active material and 3D porous graphene, which also provide an effective strategy for anchoring the nanoparticles. Experimental results show that the Sb2S5 undergoes a reversible reaction of Sb2S5 + 16Na ↔ 5Na2S + 2Na3Sb during sodiation/desodiation. Moreover, a full cell with Na3(VO0.5)2(PO4)2F2/C cathode and the as-prepared composite anode was assembled, displaying high output voltage (∼2.2 V) with a stable capacity of 828 mA h g-1 for anode material (with 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), showing the potential for practical application.",

The main scientific challenge for their practical application is to develop suitable anodes with long-term cycling stability and high rate capacity.

Electrochemical examination demonstrates that carbonization temperature is a key factor that affects Na+-ion-storage performance, owing to the consequent differences in surface area, pore volume, and degree of crystallinity. The sample obtained at 600 °C delivers the best sodium-storage performance, including long-term cycling stability (15 000 cycles) and high rate capacity (126 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1). Pseudocapacitive behavior in the Na+-ion-storage process has been confirmed and studied via cyclic voltammetry. Full cells based on the porous carbon anode and Na3V2(PO4)3-C cathode also deliver good cycling stability (400 cycles). Porous carbon, combining the merits of high energy density and extraordinary pseudocapacitive behavior after cycling stability, can be a promising replacement for battery/supercapacitors hybrid and suggest a design strategy for new energy-storage materials.",

As tested for lithium-ion batteries, NaMnFe(MoO4)3-ketjen black composite demonstrated a high reversible capacity of 800 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles due to its high valence construction of polymetallic elements. While investigated for sodium-ion batteries, the as-prepared composite electrode delivered 215 mA h g−1at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. Notably, after 800 cycles of continuous cycling, the reversible sodium storage was 155 mA h g−1 and 134 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.5 A g−1 and 1 A g−1, respectively. In terms of long life results, the NaMnFe(MoO4)3-ketjen black composite is more suitable for sodium-ion batteries than lithium-ion batteries. Because of the advantages of low cost, simple synthesis steps and mass production, NaMnFe(MoO4)3-ketjen black composite has tremendous potential for application in alkali metal secondary batteries, especially sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have attracted wide interest as a class of ideal cathodes for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries due to their low cost, high theoretical capacity, and facile synthesis. Herein, a series of highly crystalline Fe-based PBAs (FeHCF) cubes, where HCF stands for the hexacyanoferrate, is synthesized via a one-step pyrophosphate-assisted co-precipitation method. By applying this proposed facile crystallization-controlled method to slow down the crystallization process and suppress the defect content of the crystal framework of the PBAs, the as-prepared materials demonstrate high crystallization and a sodium-rich induced rhombohedral phase. As a result, the as prepared FeHCF can deliver a high specific capacity of up to 152.0 mA h g-1 (achieving ≈90% of its theoretical value) and an excellent rate capability with a high-capacity retention ratio of 88% at 10 C, which makes it one of the most competitive candidates among the cathodes reported regarding both capacity and rate performance. A highly reversible three-phase-transition sodium-ion storage mechanism has been revealed via multiple in situ techniques. Furthermore, the full cells fabricated with as-prepared cathode and commercial hard carbon anode exhibit excellent compatibility which shows great prospects for application in the large-scale energy storage systems.",

        "title": "Inhibiting dissolution strategy achieving high-performance sodium titanium phosphate hybrid anode in seawater-based dual-ion battery.",
        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) show great promise as candidates for large-scale energy storage. However, the potential of ASIB is impeded by the limited availability of suitable anode types and the occurrence of dissolution side reactions linked to hydrogen evolution. In this study, we addressed these challenges by developing a Bi-coating modified anode based on a sodium titanium phosphate (NTP)-carbon fibers (CFs) hybrid electrode (NTP-CFs/Bi). The Bi-coating effectively mitigates the localized enrichment of hydroxyl anion (OH–) near the NTP surface, thus addressing the dissolution issue. Notably, the Bi-coating not only restricts the local abundance of OH– to inhibit dissolution but also ensures a higher capacity compared with other NTP-based anodes. Consequently, the NTP-CFs/Bi anode demonstrates an impressive specific capacity of 216.8 mAh/g at 0.2 mV/s and maintains a 90.7 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 6.3 A/g. This achievement sets a new capacity record among NTP-based anodes for sodium storage. Furthermore, when paired with a cathode composed of hydroxy nickel oxide directly grown on Ni foam, we assembled a seawater-based cell exhibiting high energy and power densities, surpassing the most recently reported ASIBs. This groundbreaking work lays the foundation for a potential method to develop long-life NTP-based anodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐metal batteries are the most promising low‐cost and high‐energy‐density new energy storage technology. However, the sodium‐metal anode has poor reversibility, which can be optimized by constructing the robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, a concept of dual‐weak‐interaction electrolyte (DWIE) is demonstrated, its double‐layer solvation structure is composed of weakly solvated tetrahydrofuran as the inner layer, and dipole interaction are introduced in the outer layer by dibutyl ether. This double‐layer solvation structure dominated by contact ion pairs and aggregates can promote to deriving of inorganic‐rich SEI film, resulting in smooth and dendrite‐free sodium‐metal deposition. By adjusting the molecular configuration of dibutyl ether to diisobutyl ether, the dipole interaction is further enhanced, resulting in stronger weakly solvating effect. Thus, the Na||Cu cells using the optimized DWIE achieved a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.22%, surpassing most electrolyte design strategies. Meanwhile, at 5C, the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)||Na cell achieves stable cycling exceeding 3000 cycles. Even under rigorous conditions of ≈8.8 mg cm−2 NVP loading and 50 µm thickness Na, the full cell can achieve a long cycling lifespan of 217 cycles. The pioneering concept paves the way for crafting readily achievable, cost‐effective, and eco‐friendly electrolytes tailored for SMBs, and offers potential applications in other battery systems.",

        "title": "Bulk bismuth anodes for wide-temperature sodium-ion batteries enabled by electrolyte chemistry modulation.",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered reliable supplies for next-generation energy devices. However, there is a limited understanding of strategies to prevent the performance deterioration of SIBs under extreme temperature conditions. This study aimed to address this challenge by developing modified electrolyte chemistry to achieve stable wide-temperature SIBs. Weakly Na+-solvating solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) was used to promote the kinetics of Na+ de-solvation. Moreover, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) was introduced as a co-solvent because of the high solubility for Na salts and the coupling reaction mechanism with the Bi electrode. The formulated electrolyte not only endows an anion-dominated NaF-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, but also reduces the energy required for the Na+ across the SEI layer (from 291.2 to 89.6 meV). Consequently, Na||Bi half batteries achieve stable cycles at 400 mA g−1 at −20, 20 and 60 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, the extreme operating temperature of the batteries can be extended to −40 and 80 °C, which exceeds those of most current lithium/sodium-based batteries. Furthermore, full batteries employing Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode material exhibit stable operation over a wide temperature range of −20 to 60 °C. This electrolyte design strategy presented in this study shows significant promise for enabling wide-temperature SIBs with improved performance.",

        "abstract": "A key issue in the development of sustainable Na-ion batteries (NIBs) is the stability of the electrolyte solution and its ability to form effective passivation layers on both cathode and anode. In this regard, the use of fluorine-based additives is considered a promising direction for improving electrode performance. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and trans-difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) were demonstrated as additives or cosolvents that form effective passivating surface films in Li-ion batteries. Their effect is evaluated for the first time with cathodes in NIBs. By application of systematic electrochemical and postmortem investigations, the role of fluorinated additives in the good performance of Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) cathodes was deciphered. Despite the significant improvement in the performance of Li-ion cells enabled by the use of FEC and FEC + DFEC, the highest stability for NIBs was observed when only FEC was used as an additive. Mechanistic insights and analytical characterizations were carried out to shed light on the inferior effect of FEC + DFEC in NIBs, in contrast to its positive effect on the stability of Li-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 as a typical layered transition metal dichalcogenide (LTMD) has attracted considerable attention to work as sodium host materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from low semiconducting behavior and high Na+ diffusion barriers. Herein, intercalation of N‐doped amorphous carbon (NAC) into each interlayer of the tiny MoS2 nanosheets embedded on rGO conductive network is achieved, resulting in formation of rGO@MoS2/NAC hierarchy with interoverlapped MoS2/NAC superlattices for high‐performance SIBs. Attributed to intercalation of NAC, the resulting MoS2/NAC superlattices with wide MoS2 interlayer of 1.02 nm facilitates rapid Na+ insertion/extraction and accelerates reaction kinetics. Theoretical calculations uncover that the MoS2/NAC superlattices are beneficial for enhanced electron transport, decreased Na+ diffusion barrier and improved Na+ adsorption energy. The rGO@MoS2/NAC anode presents significantly improved high‐rate capabilities of 228, 207, and 166 mAh g−1 at 20, 30, and 50 A g−1, respectively, compared with two control samples of pristine MoS2 and MoS2/NAC counterparts. Excellent long‐term cyclability over 10 000 cycles with extremely low capacity decay is demonstrated at high current densities of 20 and 50 A g−1. Sodium‐ion full cells based on the rGO@MoS2/NAC anode are also demonstrated, yielding decent cycling stability of 200 cycles at 5C.

The exploration results show that the micro-flower mesocrystalline M−Sb2O4 consists of oriented nanowires with (110) crystal faces showing large surface area and high porosity. This structure can increase the contact area between electrode and electrolyte, provide fast Na+ transfer channels, and shorten the charge transport path, exhibiting excellent alloying reaction kinetics. The excellent reaction kinetics improves rate performance with a capacity of 432 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1. Furthermore, it exhibits a high power density of 1700 W kg−1 in the full cell. Compared to the other reported various structured Sb-based anodes, M−Sb2O4 exhibits a great performance advantage.

        "abstract": "Pseudocapacitance has been confirmed to significantly improve the rate capability and cycling durability of electrode materials. However, rational design and controllable synthesis of intercalation pseudocapacitive materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) still retain greatly challenging. Herein, a core-shell TiO2-based anode composed of S, Co and N doped amorphous TiO2/C framework cores and ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheet shells (SCN-TC@UT) was synthesized using Ti-based metal-organic frameworks (Ti-MOFs) as self-sacrificing templates coupled with a solvothermal sulfidation process. Thanks to heteroatom doping, integration of carbon species and 2D nanosheet coating, the kinetic properties of SCN-TC@UT has been significantly improved. As a consequence, the anode achieves ultrahigh capacitive contributions up to 90.9% and 96.3% of the total capacity at the scan rates of 5 and 10 mV s-1, and delivers unprecedented capacities of 211, 201, and 100 mA h g-1 at 1, 5, and 30 C for over 800, 2000, and 18000 cycles. Even at an ultrahigh rate of 50 C, the anode can still deliver a capacity of 108 mA h g-1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries and capacitors are considered as low-cost energy storage devices, compared to Li-ion counterparts. However, most anodes for sodium-ion devices show sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability caused by the large radius (1.02 Å) of Na+. One candidate anode is MoS2, a 2D atomic layered material with a large interlayer spacing of 6.2 Å, that can take up and release Na+via two working principles: a two-electron intercalation process and a four-electron conversion reaction. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize a MoS2-amorphous carbon (MoS2-AC) nanocomposite and further study the effect of the two working principles on the structure, interphase, and charge storage properties of MoS2-AC. The two-electron intercalation reaction enables the MoS2-AC electrode to have a higher rate capability and superior stability than that via the four-electron Na+ conversion reaction. This favorable Na+ charge storage performance of MoS2-AC via the two-electron intercalation process is attributed to its pseudocapacitive behavior, a stable solid electrolyte interphase and robust stability of the structure, which enables us to fabricate a sodium-ion capacitor that can deliver high energy density at a high rate. This work underscores the potential importance of realizing fast Na+ charge storage via an intercalation process as a strategy for the fabrication of high-performance sodium-ion capacitors and batteries.",

We further studied the sodium storage mechanism by different methods, especially the Na+ diffusivity coefficient ( DNa+) calculated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, which was more accurate. Interestingly, the trend of DNa+ coincides with cyclic voltammetry curves. Carbonized PP exhibited excellent electrochemical properties because of its three-dimensional structure and larger layer spacing (∼0.41 nm), which reduces the resistance of sodium ions to intercalation and deintercalation.",

        "abstract": "As the most promising anodic candidate for alkali ion batteries, red phosphorus (P) still faces big challenges, such as the poor rate and cycling performance which is caused by the insulative nature and the large volume change throughout alloy/de-alloy process. To ameliorate above issues, the traditional way is confining P into the carbon host. However, investigations on maximizing P utilization are inadequate, in other works, how to achieve entire confinement with high loading amount is still a problem. Additionally, the application of P in potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) is in its infant stage, and the corresponding potassiation product is controversial. Herein, a nitrogen-doped stripped-graphene CNT (N-SGCNT) as carbon framework is prepared to exclusively confine ultrafine P to construct P@N-SGCNT composites. Benefitted from the in-situ cross-linked structure, N-SGCNT loaded with 41.2wt.% P (P2@N-SGCNT) shows outstanding Na+/K+ storage performances. For instance, P2@N-SGCNT exhibits high reversible capacities of 2480 mAh g1 for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and 762 mAh g1 for PIBs, excellent rate capabilities of 1770 mAh g1 for SIBs and 354 mAh g1 for PIBs at 2.0 A g1, and long cycling stability (a capacity of 1936 mAh g1 after 2000 cycles for SIBs and 319 mAh g1 after 1000 cycles for PIBs). Furthermore, due to this exclusively confined P structure, the K+ storage mechanism with the end product of K4P3 has been identified by experimental and theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "Despite the high theoretical energy densities of tin as the anode of the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), its electrochemical performance has been plagued by the inadequate initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and poor cycle life. While it is generally believed that mechanical degradation, namely pulverization and subsequent loss of electrical contact, is the underlying cause, here we show gassing is an essential problem in sodium-ion batteries with Sn anode. Since the gas generation appears at a certain voltage, reducing the voltage through metallurgically pre-alloying Sn with Na could be a solution, with an added benefit of compensating for \"live\" Na loss in future cycles. When the metallurgically alloyed foil was used as the anode in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPFs)//alloy full cells, the ICE is significantly improved from 24.68% to 75%, and from the 2nd cycle to the 100th cycle, the average Coulombic efficiency can maintain up to 99.44%. The full cell can run for 100 cycles, with acceptable capacity decay to 81.4mAh/g(NVPF) from the initial 112.5mAh/g(NVPF).",

        "abstract": "Carbon-layer-coated porous Ni-doped CoSe2 (Ni-CoSe2 /C) nanospheres have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a new selenization strategy. The porous structure of Ni-CoSe2 /C is formed by the aggregation of many small particles (20-40 nm), which are not tightly packed together, but are interspersed with gaps. Moreover, the surfaces of these small particles are covered with a thin carbon layer. Ni-CoSe2 /C delivers superior rate performance (314.0 mA h g-1 at 20 A g-1 ), ultra-long cycle life (316.1 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 8000 cycles), and excellent full-cell performance (208.3 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 70 cycles) when used as an anode material for half/full sodium-ion batteries. The Na storage mechanism and kinetics have been confirmed by ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis, assessment of capacitance performance, and a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). GITT shows that Na+ diffusion in the electrode material is a dynamic change process, which is associated with a phase transition during charge and discharge.

        "abstract": "The present work elucidates facile one-pot synthesis from biomass forestry waste (Norway spruce bark) and its chemical activation yielding high specific surface area (SBET) biochars as efficient lithium- and sodium-ion storage anodes. The chemically activated biochar using ZnCl2 (Biochar-1) produced a highly mesoporous carbon containing 96.1% mesopores in its structure as compared to only 56.1% mesoporosity from KOH-activated biochars (Biochar-2). The latter exhibited a lower degree of graphitization with disordered and defective carbon structures, while the former presented more formation of ordered graphite sheets in its structure as analyzed from Raman spectra. In addition, both biochars presented a high degree of functionalities on their surfaces but Biochar-1 presented a pyridinic-nitrogen group, which helps improve its electrochemical response. When tested electrochemically, Biochar-1 showed an excellent rate capability and the longest capacity retentions of 370 mA h g–1 at 100 mA g–1 (100 cycles), 332.4 mA h g–1 at 500 mA g–1 (1000 cycles), and 319 mA h g–1 at 1000 mA g–1 after 5000 cycles, rendering as an alternative biomass anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, as a negative electrode in sodium-ion batteries, Biochar-1 delivered discharge capacities of 147.7 mA h g–1 at 50 mA g–1 (140 cycles) and 126 mA h g–1 at 100 mA g–1 after 440 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6)/carbonate solution is considered as the benchmark electrolyte for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, this NaPF6 electrolyte undergoes hydrolysis and produces acidic compounds, which deteriorate the electrolyte quality, corrode electrodes, jeopardize electrode interphases, and eventually degrade battery performance. Herein, we introduce tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphate (TMSP) as a multifunctional additive to the carbonate electrolyte. We found that 10% TMSP could effectively remove H2O molecules and inhibit NaPF6 hydrolysis, thus improving the electrolyte stability against moisture during the long‐term storage. Furthermore, the unique structure of TMSP promotes the formation of thinner, more uniform, and inorganic‐rich interphases on the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode and hard carbon (HC) anode. Consequently, the NVP cathode, HC anode, and full cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance. This work suggests that tailoring the electrolyte formulation can provide multiple benefits for boosting SIB performances, such as stabilizing the electrolyte and regulating the electrolyte/electrode interphase, thereby promoting long‐term cycling in sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Researchers are paying more attention to sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their abundant supply of sodium resources and affordable price. TiO2 offers excellent safety and a long lifespan as an anode material for SIBs. However, the process kinetics is slow due to its limited Na+ storage efficiency, weak conductivity, and irreversible Na+ capture. In order to address these issues, this review uses a mix of the template approach and the double-hydrolysis method to manage the structure and diffusion of TiO2-based anode materials by synthesizing FeTiO3/TiO2 heterostructured double-shell microspheres (FTO). Through the built-in electric field effect caused by their heterostructures, FTO materials improve reaction kinetics, boost electronic conductivity, and lower the diffusion energy barrier of Na+. Their distinctive double-shell structure can increase electrolyte infiltration, shorten the diffusion distance between ions and electrons, and accommodate volume expansion during cycling. Furthermore, the irreversible capture of Na+ and the unfavorable interactions between the surface active site and electrolyte can be successfully inhibited by FTO heterostructures. FTO has an exceptionally high capacity (reaching 362.7 mA h g-1 after 60 cycles at 20 mA g-1) and excellent cycle stability (with a decay rate of 0.0061% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1).

In this work, the electrochemical performance and mechanical property of Sb2O3 nanobelts during sodiation/desodiation are revealed by constructing nanoscale solid‐state SIBs in a high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the Sb2O3 nanobelt exhibits an ultrahigh sodiation speed of ≈13.5 nm s−1 and experiences a three‐step sodiation reaction including the intercalation reaction to form NaxSb2O3, the conversion reaction to form Sb, and the alloying reaction to form NaSb. The alloying reaction is found to be reversible, while the conversion reaction is partially reversible. The Sb2O3 nanobelt shows anisotropic expansion and the orientation of the Sb2O3 nanobelt has great influence on the expansion ratio. It is found that the existence of a {010} plane with large d‐spacing in the nanobelt leads to a surprisingly small expansion ratio (≈5%). The morphology of the Sb2O3 nanobelt is well maintained during multiple electrochemical cycles. In situ bending experiments suggest that the sodiated Sb2O3 nanobelts show improved toughness and flexibility compared to pristine Sb2O3 nanobelts.

        "abstract": "The inferior tolerance with reversible accommodation of large‐sized Na+ ion in electrode materials has plagued the adaptability of sodium‐ion chemistry. The sluggish diffusion kinetics of Na+ also baffles the desirability. Herein, a carbon fiber supported binder‐free electrode consisting of bismuth and carbon composite is designed. Well‐confined bismuth nanodots are synthesized by replacing cobalt in the metal–organic frameworks (MOF)–derived, nitrogen‐doped carbon arrays, which are demonstrated with remarkable reversibility during sodiation and desodiation. Cobalt species in the pristine MOF catalyze the graphitization around organic components in calcination, generating a highly conductive network in which the bismuth is to be embedded. The uniformly dispersed bismuth nanodots provide plenty boundaries and abundant active sites in the carbon arrays, where fast sodium storage kinetics are realized to contribute extra capacity and excellent rate performance.",

        "abstract": "Constructing a homogenous and inorganic‐rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) can efficiently improve the overall sodium‐storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, the thick and heterogenous SEI derived from conventional ester electrolytes fails to meet the above requirements. Herein, an innovative interfacial catalysis mechanism is proposed to design a favorable SEI in ester electrolytes by reconstructing the surface functionality of HC, of which abundant CO (carbonyl) bonds are accurately and homogenously implanted. The CO (carbonyl) bonds act as active centers that controllably catalyze the preferential reduction of salts and directionally guide SEI growth to form a homogenous, layered, and inorganic‐rich SEI. Therefore, excessive solvent decomposition is suppressed, and the interfacial Na+ transfer and structural stability of SEI on HC anodes are greatly promoted, contributing to a comprehensive enhancement in sodium‐storage performance. The optimal anodes exhibit an outstanding reversible capacity (379.6 mAh g−1), an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (93.2%), a largely improved rate capability, and an extremely stable cycling performance with a capacity decay rate of 0.0018% for 10 000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This work provides novel insights into smart regulation of interface chemistry to realize high‐performance HC anodes for sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Pristine and boron-doped anatase TiO2 were prepared via a facile sol-gel method and the hydrothermal method for application as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The sol-gel method leads to agglomerated TiO2, whereas the hydrothermal method is conducive to the formation of highly crystalline and discrete nanoparticles. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties were studied. The crystal size of TiO2 with boron doping is smaller than that of the nondoped crystals, which indicates that the addition of boron can inhibit the crystal growth. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the reversible capacity of the B-doped TiO2 is higher than that for the pristine sample. B-doping also effectively enhances the rate performance. The capacity of the B-doped TiO2 could reach 150 mAh/g at the high current rate of 2C and the capacity decay is only about 8 mAh/g over 400 cycles. The remarkable performance could be attributed to the lattice expansion resulting from B doping and the shortened Li(+) diffusion distance due to the nanosize. These results indicate that B-doped TiO2 can be a good candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The design and construction of flexible electrodes that can function at high rates and high areal capacities are essential regarding the practical application of flexible sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and other energy storage devices, which remains significantly challenging by far. Herein, a flexible and 3D porous graphene nanosheet/SnS2 (3D-GNS/SnS2 ) film is reported as a high-performance SIB electrode. In this hybrid film, the GNS/SnS2 microblocks serve as pillars to assemble into a 3D porous and interconnected framework, enabling fast electron/ion transport; while the GNS bridges the GNS/SnS2 microblocks into a flexible framework to provide satisfactorily mechanical strength and long-range conductivity. Moreover, the SnS2 nanocrystals, which chemically bond with GNS, provide sufficient active sites for Na storage and ensure the cycling stability. Consequently, this flexible 3D-GNS/SnS2 film exhibits excellent Na-storage performances, especially in terms of high areal capacity (2.45 mAh cm-2 ) and high rates with superior stability (385 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 over 1000 cycles with ≈100% retention). A flexible SIB full cell using this anode exhibits high and stable performance under various bending situations. Thus, this work provide a feasible route to prepare flexible electrodes with high practical viability for not only SIBs but also other energy storage devices.",

However, the large volume change and the migratory and aggregation behavior of metal atoms will cause severe capacity decay during the charge/discharge process. Herein, a robust and conductive TiS_2 framework is integrated with a high-capacity SbS layer to construct a single phase (SbS)_1.15TiS_2 superlattice for both high-capacity and fast Na^+ storage. The metallic TiS_2 sublayer with high electron activity acts as a robust and conductive skeleton to buffer the volume expansion caused by conversion and alloying reaction between Na^+ and SbS sublayer. Hence, high capacity and high rate capability can be synergistically realized in a single phase (SbS)_1.15TiS_2 superlattice. The novel (SbS)_1.15TiS_2 anode has a high charge capacity of 618 mAh g^−1 at 0.2 C and superior rate performance and cycling stability (205 mAh g^−1 at 35 C after 2,000 cycles). Furthermore, in situ and ex situ characterizations are applied to get an insight into the multi-step reaction mechanism. The integrity of robust Na-Ti-S skeleton during (dis)charge process can be confirmed. This superlattice construction idea to integrate the Na^+-active unit and electron-active unit would provide a new avenue for exploring high-performance anode materials for advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Metallic antimony (Sb) is an attractive anode material for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) because of its high theoretical capacity (660 mAh g-1), but suffers from poor cycling performance caused by the huge volume expansion and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we report a high-performing microsized Sb anode for both LIBs and SIBs by coupling with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) containing electrolytes. The optimum amount of FEC (10 vol.%) renders a stable LiF/NaF-rich SEI on Sb electrodes that can suppress the continuous electrolytes decomposition and accommodate the volume variation. The microsized Sb electrode gradually evolves into an integrity assembled by nanoparticles in FEC-containing electrolytes during cycling, which is totally different from that in the FEC-free counterpart. As a result, the microsized Sb electrodes exhibit a reversible capacity of 540 mAh g-1 with 85.3% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 for LIBs and 605 mAh g-1 with 95.4% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 200 mA g-1 for SIBs. More impressively, the prototype full Li-based (i.e., Sb/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell) and Na-based (i.e., Sb/Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cell) batteries also achieve good cycling durability. This facile strategy of electrolyte formulation to boost the cycling performance of microsized Sb anodes will provide a new avenue for developing stable alloying-type materials for both LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "SnSe2 with high theoretical capacity has been identified as an emerging anode candidate for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the rate performance and cycling performance of this material in practical applications are still limited by unavoidable volume expansion and low conductivity. In this work, we designed and synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon-coated SnSe2/C-N composites using 2-aminoterephthalic acid (C8H7NO4) as a nitrogen-containing compound for modification by hydrothermal and vacuum calcination methods to achieve efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of the electronic structure. The carbon skeleton inherited from the Sn-MOF precursor can effectively improve the electronic conduction properties of SnSe2. N-doping in the Sn-MOF can increase the positive and negative electrostatic potential energy regions on the molecular surface to further improve the electrical conductivity, and effectively reduce the binding energy with Li+/Na+ which was determined by Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In addition, the N-doped carbon skeleton also introduces a larger space for Li+/Na+ intercalation and enhances the mechanical properties. In particular, the post-synthetically modified MOF-derived SnSe2/C-N materials exhibit excellent cyclability, with a reversible capacity of 695 mA h g-1 for LIBs and 259 mA h g-1 for SIBs after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1.",

During the first discharge process, the anode undergoes area expansion. It then splits into multiple parts during the first-charge process. Upon cycling, the separated parts reconnect and form a single piece with a porous and robust coral structure owing to the self-healing nature of the anode. A full cell with a Sn foil anode and Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode shows a stable cycle life of 100 mAh g-1 for 300 cycles. Thus, the cracking or pulverization of the Sn anode is not the principal origin of poor cycling properties.

However, realizing high‐power‐density alkali‐ion batteries is challenging especially at low temperatures, as undesirable alkali metal plating tends to occur more easily on the anode surface due to the increased electrochemical impedance and polarization. Herein, a low‐temperature, high‐power‐density rechargeable Na3V2(PO4)3 ||hard carbon (HC) sodium‐ion full battery without Na plating is realized by electrolyte regulation. The designed high‐solvation‐entropy electrolyte enables a high ionic conductivity of 13.87 mS cm−1 at −40 °C.

Consequently, the assembled sodium‐ion full battery demonstrates a record‐high power density of 1132.31 W kg−1 (with an energy density of 61.94 Wh kg−1) at −40 °C and 13372.56 W kg−1 (132.83 Wh kg−1) at 25 °C (based on total mass of the active materials on anode and cathode).

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are the ultimate choice for high‐energy density sodium‐based batteries. However, their practicality is still constrained by the uncontrolled side reactions and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) between the electrolyte and Na‐metal anode. Herein, a hetero‐salt additive (Lithium difluorophosphate, LiDFP) strategy is proposed to optimize the solvation structure of pseudo gel‐polymer electrolyte (pGPE) and construct robust SEI on Na metal anode, thereby enhancing Na+ deposition/stripping kinetics. Detailed characterization reveals that Li+ with lower binding energy to solvent molecules can steal solvent molecules from Na+ coordination environment, and then push anions to further coordinate with Na+. The formed anion‐enriched solvation structure can assist to restrain side reactions and form a robust inorganics‐dominated SEI on Na metal anode. Consequently, such optimization effectively realizes outstanding electrochemical performance of the cells under wide operation temperature (−20 to 70 °C) and prolongs cycling life (1900 h) of Na plating/stripping. Furthermore, paired with commercial NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode and hard carbon (HC) anode, the pouch cell using pGPE+0.5%LiDFP delivers a high‐capacity retention of 87.5% at 45 °C after 250 cycles.

        "abstract": "The photochemistry and sodium storage process have been generally considered as two separated approaches without strong connection. Here, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was applied to sodium-ion batteries to improve the electrochemical performance of MoS2-based composites. C@MoS2@CN nanospheres consist of double protective structures, including inner hollow carbon spheres with a thin wall (C) and outer N-doping carbon nanosheets (CNs) derived from polydopamine. The special nanostructure possesses the virtues such as wide-interlayer spacing, flexible feature with great structure integrity, and rich active sites, which endow the fast electron transfer and shorten the ion diffusion pathways. Under the excitation of UV-light, intense electrons and holes are accumulated within MoS2-based composites. The excited electrons can promote the preinsertion of Na+. More importantly, dense electrons promote the electrolyte to decompose and hence form a stable solid electrolyte interphase in advance. After UV-light irradiation treatment in the electrolyte, the initial Coulombic efficiency of C@MoS2@CN electrodes increased from 48.2 to 79.6%, and benefiting from the fine nanostructure, the C@MoS2@CN electrode with UV irradiation treatment delivered a great rate performance 116  mAh g-1 in 20 s and  super cycling stability that 87.6% capacity was retained after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1. When employed as anode for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors, it delivered a maximum power density of 6.84 kW kg-1 (with 114.07  Wh kg-1 energy density) and a maximum energy density of 244.15 Wh g-1 (with 152.59 W kg-1 power density). This work sheds new viewpoints into the applications of photochemistry in the development of energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "To address the sluggish reaction kinetics commonly associated with the transition metal chalcogenide anodes in their interaction with alkali metal ions, introducing heterostructures into these materials is proposed as a novel approach. Herein, we introduce a fabrication method for yolk-shell structured microsphere comprising heteroatom-doped cobalt sulfoselenide nanocrystals using a recycled solution. The prepared material demonstrates a composition of sulfur-doped cobalt selenide, forming hetero-anion metal compounds. A detailed study of the reaction mechanism in cobalt sulfoselenide reveals the formation of Na2S/Na2Se heterointerfaces during the conversion reaction, which facilitate a rapid diffusion of Na-ions. Furthermore, heteroatom doping in the cobalt sulfoselenide nanocrystals, induced by cobalt recycling process, leads to the lattice expansion, further enhancing the Na-ion diffusion kinetics. Additionally, through an infiltration of pitch solution and a simple heat-treatment, pitch-derived carbon is coated on the cobalt sulfoselenide nanocrystals. This carbon layer can effectively accommodate the volumetric stress during repeated cycling, enhancing the stability. Consequently, carbon-coated heteroatom-doped cobalt sulfoselenide yolk-shell microsphere anode exhibits stable cycling stability (560 mA h g−1 for 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1) as well as great rate capability (140 mA h g−1 at 15 A g−1) for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).",

Here, we present a hydrated eutectic electrolyte featuring a water-locked effect, which is exceptional in that the O-H bond of water is essentially strengthened via weak hydrogen bonding (relative to the original H2O-H2O hydrogen bonds) to low-donor-number anions and ligands. Even without interphase protection, both the anodic and cathodic water electrodecomposition reactions are delayed, extending the aqueous potential window to 3.4 V. Combined with the alleviated electrode dissolution, Na2MnFe(CN)6||NaTi2(PO4)3 batteries deliver a high energy density of ∼80 W h kg-1 at 0.5 C and undergo over 1000 cycles with a 74.5% capacity retention and a 99.4% Coulombic efficiency at 4.2 C.

Ultimately, the individual capacity loadings allow for suitable balancing of the anode to cathode capacity in the full‐cell. This approach seems rather unproblematic for lithium‐ion batteries. For sodium‐ion batteries, however, we show that the high reactivity of sodium metal strongly influences hard carbon‐based electrode measurements within sodium‐ion half‐cells. As hard carbon is considered state‐of‐the‐art anode material, the presented results have high impact on the development of sodium ion batteries. Specifically, we show that the type of electrolyte, as well as cell‐ and measurement‐setup are key factors for reliable sodium half‐cell measurements of hard carbon. The investigated hard carbon electrodes have a high active material loading of 7.2 mg/cm² (with 93% active material content) resulting in an areal capacity of 2.4 mAh/cm², which represent application‐relevant conditions.",

As a verification, the half-cells using the designed electrolyte operate stably over a temperature range of -25 to 75 °C, accompanied by a capacity retention rate exceeding 70% even after 1700 cycles at 60 °C. More importantly, the full cells assembled with Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode and hard carbon anode also have excellent cycling stability, exceeding 500 and 1000 cycles at -25 to 50 °C and superb temperature adaptability during all-weather dynamic testing with continuous temperature change.

        "abstract": "Biomass-based hard carbon has the advantages of a balanced cost and electrochemical performance, making it the most promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, due to the structural limitations of biomass (such as macropores and impurities), it still faces the problems of low specific capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, an integrated strategy of biomass liquefaction and oxidation treatment is proposed to fabricate hard carbon with low ash content and sp2-rich closed pores. Specifically, liquefaction treatment can break through the inherent constraints of biomass, while oxidation treatment with O-targeted effect can directionally convert C─C/C─O bonds into C═O/O═C─O bonds, which would promote the formation of closed pores and the rearrangement into sp2-carbon within the graphene layer. Moreover, it is well demonstrated that the hard carbon interface rich in sp2 hybridization can induce the generation of an inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interface, contributing to fast ion migration and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, the optimized hard carbon with maximum closed pore volume and sp2/sp3 ratio can exhibit a high capacity of 347.3 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 with the ICE of 90.5%, and a capacity of 110.4 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 after 10 000 cycles.",

In this work, we report a systematic first-principles study of intrinsic point defects and defect complexes in sodium titanate Na2Ti3O7, a low-voltage anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Within the density functional theory framework, we calculate the defect formation energies with a set of atomic chemical potentials, which define the synthesis conditions for the stable Na2Ti3O7 compound. Given the atomic chemical potential landscape and defect formation energies, we find that Na interstitials (Nai+), Na antisites (NaTi3-), and Na vacancies (VNa-) are dominant defects depending on the synthesis conditions. Furthermore, our calculations reveal that O vacancies (VO) and Ti antisites (TiNa) lower the electrode potential compared with the perfect system, whereas Ti vacancies (VTi) and NaTi increase the voltage. Finally, we evaluate the activation barriers for vacancy-mediated Na diffusion in the defective systems, finding that the intrinsic point defects improve the Na ion conduction. Our results provide a profound understanding of defect formation and influences on electrode performance, paving a way to designing high-performance anode materials.",

Therefore, in this paper, SnSe is loaded on the surface of CNF by a simple liquid-phase reaction, in order to combine the advantages of both and improve their shortcomings to prepare a SIBs anode material with good electrochemical properties. The prepared tin selenide composite carbon nanofiber (CNF-SnSe) can be used directly in the self-supporting anode of SIBs. As expected, the CNF-SnSe electrode combined the advantages of CNF and SnSe electrode to show high electrochemical properties. When the current density is 0.1 A g^−1, the initial discharge specific capacity can reach 644.9 mA h g^−1, and the reversible specific capacity is 355.7 mA h g^−1 after 200 cycles.

The BiSbS3@NC core-shell nanorods are thus promising high performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of anode materials with high theoretical capacity and cycling stability is very important for the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, SnSe/NC hollow nanospheres with different crystal orientations were prepared by regulating the high-temperature selenization of the PDA@SnO2 precursor for lithium/sodium storage. In SnSe/NC hollow nanospheres, the physical buffering and chemical bonding of the nitrogen carbon matrix and SnSe nanoparticles could inhibit volume expansion and polyselenide loss, thus maintaining long-term structural stability. More importantly, electrochemical tests and DFT calculations show that the diffusion energy barrier of Li+/Na+ is significantly reduced at the SnSe (400) rather than the usual (111) facet, which is conducive to the uniformity of ion insertion into SnSe, thus effectively enhancing the reaction kinetics and reversibility of lithium/sodium storage. Therefore, SnSe/NC hollow nanospheres with rich SnSe (400) and good dispersion formed at 550 °C delivered the best reversible specific capacity and rate performance. After a long period of 900 cycles, the capacity retention of lithium/sodium ion batteries is close to 84.88% and 77.05%, respectively. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design of metal selenides for advanced LIBs/SIBs.",

        "abstract": "SnS2 has been widely studied as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) based on the high theoretical capacity and layered structure. Unfortunately, rapid capacity decay associated with volume variation during cycling limits practical application. Herein, SnS2 /Co3 S4 hollow nanocubes anchored on S-doped graphene are synthesized for the first time via coprecipitation and hydrothermal methods. When applied as the anode for SIBs, the sample delivers a distinguished charge specific capacity of 1141.8 mAh g-1 and there is no significant capacity decay (0.1 A g-1 for 50 cycles). When the rate is increased to 0.5 A g-1 , it presents 845.7 mAh g-1 after cycling 100 times. Furthermore, the composite also exhibits an ultrafast sodium storage capability where 392.9 mAh g-1 can be obtained at 10 A g-1 and the charging time is less than 3 min. The outstanding electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the enhancement of conductivity for the addition of S-doped graphene and the existence of p-n junctions in the SnS2 /Co3 S4 heterostructure. Moreover, the presence of mesopores between nanosheets can alleviate volume expansion during cycling as well as being beneficial for the migration of Na+ .",

However, the intrinsic relationship between the closed pores/surface groups and sodium storage performance has been unclear, leading to difficulties in targeted regulation. In this study, renewable tannin extracts were used as raw materials to prepare HC anodes with abundant tunable closed pores and carbonyl groups through a pyrolytic modulation strategy. Combining ex situ characterizations reveals that closed pores and carbonyl groups are regulated by the pyrolytic process. Further, it is demonstrated that the plateau region is mainly contributed by the closed pores; highly stable fluorine-rich solid electrolyte interphase compositions are produced through carbonyl-induced interfacial catalysis. The optimized HC anode displays good cycling stability, exhibiting a high reversible capacity (360.96 mAh g-1) at 30 mA g-1 and capacity retention of up to 94% after 500 cycles at 1 A g-1. Moreover, the full battery assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3/C demonstrates a stable cycling performance.

        "title": "Addressing the Low Solubility of a Solid Electrolyte Interphase Stabilizer in an Electrolyte by Composite Battery Anode Design.",
        "abstract": "Metallic sodium (Na) has been regarded as one of the most attractive anodes for Na-based rechargeable batteries due to its high specific capacity, low working potential, and high natural abundance. However, several important issues hinder the practical application of the metallic Na anode, including its high reactivity with electrolytes, uncontrolled dendrite growth, and poor processability. Metal nitrates are common electrolyte additives used to stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Na anodes, though they typically suffer from poor solubility in electrolyte solvents. To address these issues, a Na/NaNO3 composite foil electrode was fabricated through a mechanical kneading approach, which featured uniform embedment of NaNO3 in a metallic Na matrix. During the battery cycling, NaNO3 was reduced by metallic Na sustainably, which addressed the issue of low solubility of an SEI stabilizer. Due to the supplemental effect of NaNO3, a stable SEI with NaNxOy and Na3N species was produced, which allowed fast ion transport. As a result, stable electrochemical performance for 600 h was achieved for Na/NaNO3||Na/NaNO3 symmetric cells at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 and an areal capacity of 0.5 mAh cm-2. A Na/NaNO3||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cell with active metallic Na of ∼5 mAh cm-2 at the anode showed stable cycling for 180 cycles. In contrast, a Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cell only displayed less than 80 cycles under the same conditions. Moreover, the processability of the Na/NaNO3 composite foil was also significantly improved due to the introduction of NaNO3, in contrast to the soft and sticky pure metallic Na. Mechanical kneading of soft alkali metals and their corresponding nitrates provides a new strategy for the utilization of anode stabilizers (besides direct addition into electrolytes) to improve their electrochemical performance.",

This yields storage capacities above 150 mAh/g, cycling performance with negligible capacity fade over 8000 cycles, and ∼100 mAh/g capacities maintained at currents of 30 A/g (∼12 s charge). Raman spectroscopy elucidates the ordered, but nondestructive cointercalation mechanism that differs from desolvated ion intercalation processes.

        "abstract": "Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de-solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3 M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic-dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17% (baseline) to 79% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB) and 83% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB and 1.0 wt % TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is the material of choice for sodium ion battery anodes. Capacities comparable to those of lithium/graphite can be reached, but the understanding of the underlying sodium storage mechanisms remains fragmentary. A two-step process is commonly observed, where sodium first adsorbs to polar sites of the carbon (\"sloping region\") and subsequently fills small voids in the material (\"plateau region\"). To study the impact of nitrogen functionalities and pore geometry on sodium storage, a systematic series of nitrogen-doped hard carbons is synthesized. The nitrogen content is found to contribute to sloping capacity by binding sodium ions at edges and defects, whereas higher plateau capacities are found for materials with less nitrogen content and more extensive graphene layers, suggesting the formation of 2D sodium structures stabilized by graphene-like pore walls. In fact, up to 84% of the plateau capacity is measured at potentials less than 0 V versus metallic Na, that is, quasimetallic sodium can be stabilized in such structure motifs. Finally, gas physisorption measurements are related to charge-discharge data to identify the energy storage relevant pore architectures. Interestingly, these are pores inaccessible to probe gases and electrolytes, suggesting a new view on such \"closed pores\" required for efficient sodium storage.",

Among the various metal oxides, SnO2 has a high theoretical specific capacity for sodium-ion battery. However, the enormous volume expansion and low electrical conductivity of SnO2 hinder its capability to reach the predicted theoretical value. Although different nanostructured designs of electrode materials like SnO2 nanocomposites have been studied, the effects of other cell components like electrolyte and binder on the specific capacity and cyclic stability are yet to be understood. In the present study, we have investigated the synergistic effect of electrolyte and binder on the performance enhancement of SnO2 supported on the intertwined network structure of reduced graphene oxide partially open multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrid as anode in sodium-ion battery. Our result shows that sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate as the electrolyte solvent offers a high specific capacity of 688 mAh g–1 and a satisfactory cyclic stability for 500 cycles. This is about 56% enhancement in specific capacity compared to the use of poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder and propylene carbonate as the electrolyte solvent.

Manufacturing rational structure is a crucial factor to achieve high-efficiency sodium storage for SIBs. In this study , nano Sn2S3 embedded in nitrogenous-carbon compounds (nano-Sn2S3 /C) is designed for SIB anode materials via a facile three-step strategy-precipitation, heat treatment and vulcanization with no templating agent. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that Sn2S3 displays a low Na+ diffusion energy barrier and the Sn-S bonds can be rebuilt during the sodiation/de-sodiation process. Notably, the electrochemical measurements coupled with ex-situ x-ray diffraction and ex-situ TEM are proposed to reveal the underlying Na+ storage mechanisms. Sn2S3 acts as a high-capacity composition, while the porous nitrogenous-carbon matrix serves as a rigid-conductive frame to accommodate the volume expansion and prevents the aggregation of nano Sn2S3 . The rationally generated architectures benefit greatly in rate capacity and structural stability. As expected, the as-prepared nano Sn2S3 /C exhibits remarkable rate capabilities with a specific of 603 and 160 mAh g-1 under typical conditions at 0.2 and 4 A g-1 , respectively.

Here, a dually protected, highly compressible, and freestanding anode is presented for sodium‐ion batteries, where 3D carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge is decorated with homogeneously dispersed CoSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) which are protected under carbon overcoat (CNT/CoSe2/C). The 3D CNT sponge delivers enough space for high mass loading while providing high mechanical strength and faster conduction pathway among the NPs. The outer amorphous carbon overcoat controls the formation of solid electrolyte interphase film by avoiding direct contact of CoSe2 with electrolyte, accommodates large volume changes, and ultimately enhances the overall conductivity of cell and assists in transmitting electron to an external circuit. Moreover, the hybrid can be densified up to 11‐fold without affecting its microstructure that results in ultrahigh areal mass loading of 17.4 mg cm−2 and an areal capacity of 7.03 mAh cm−2 along with a high gravimetric capacity of 531 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1.

To solve these issues, chemical, thermal, and electrochemical procedures are traditionally employed to reduce GO nanosheets. However, these strategies are still unscalable, consume high amounts of energy, and are expensive for practical application. Here, for the first time, we describe the superior Na storage of unreduced GO by a simple and scalable alkali-metal-ion (Li(+) , Na(+) , K(+) )-functionalized process. The various alkali metals ions, connecting with the oxygen on GO, have played different effects on morphology, porosity, degree of disorder, and electrical conductivity, which are crucial for Na-storage capabilities. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that sodium-ion-functionalized GO (GNa) has shown outstanding Na-storage performance in terms of excellent rate capability and long-term cycle life (110 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1 A g(-1) ) owing to its high BET area, appropriate mesopore, high degree of disorder, and improved electrical conductivity. Theoretical calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to further study the Na-storage capabilities of functionalized GO. These calculations have indicated that the Na-O bond has the lowest binding energy, which is beneficial to insertion/extraction of the sodium ion, hence the GNa has shown the best Na-storage properties among all comparatives functionalized by other alkali metal ions.",

        "abstract": "Water‐in‐salt (WiS) electrolytes provide a new pathway to widen the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes. However, their formulation strongly depends on the solubility of the chosen salts, imposing a stringent restriction on the number of possible WiS systems. This issue becomes more severe for aqueous Na‐ion batteries (ANIBs) owing to the relatively lower solubility of sodium salts compared to its alkaline cousins (Li, K, and Cs). A new class of the inert‐cation‐assisted WiS (IC‐WiS) electrolytes containing the tetraethylammonium (TEA+) inert cation is reported. The Na IC‐WiS electrolyte at a superhigh concentration of 31 mol kg–1 exhibits a wide electrochemical window of 3.3 V, suppresses transition metal dissolution from the cathode, and ensures singular intercalation of Na into both cathode and anode electrodes during cycling, which is often problematic in mixed alkali cation systems such as K–Na and Li–Na. Owing to these unique advantages of the IC‐WiS electrolyte, the NaTiOPO4 anode and Prussian blue analog Na1.88Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.97·1.35H2O cathode can be coupled to construct a full ANIB, delivering an average voltage of 1.74 V and a high energy density of 71 Wh kg−1 with a capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at 0.25C and of 76% over 800 cycles at 1C.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials have great potential for applications in energy, biology, and environment due to their excellent chemical and physical properties. Their preparation by carbonization methods encounters limitations and the carbon loss during pyrolysis in the form of gaseous molecules results in low yield of carbon materials. Herein a low-energy (600 °C) and high-yield (82 wt.%) carbonization strategy is developed using liquid gallium-assisted pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) affording the N-doped carbon nanotube (CNT) non-hollow frameworks encapsulating Co nanoparticles. The liquid gallium layer offers protection against air, promotes heat transfer, and limits the escape of small carbonaceous gaseous molecules, which greatly improve the yields of the pyrolysis reaction. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O-containing groups gives a non-hollow framework composed of N/O-enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF-15, 15 denotes the 15 mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and ultra-stable cyclability (stable operation at 10 A g-1 and 50 °C for 20 000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low-cost CNTs and other MOFs-derived carbon materials in high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).",

        "abstract": "Developing rechargeable batteries with high power delivery at low temperatures (LT) below 0 °C is significant for cold-climate applications. Initial anode-free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) promise high LT performances because of the low de-solvation energy and smaller Stokes radius of Na+, nondiffusion-limited plating/stripping electrochemistry, and maximized energy density. However, the severe reduction in electrolyte ionic conductivity and formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder their practical applications at LT. In this study, a 2-methyltetrahydrofuran-based dilute electrolyte is designed to concurrently achieve an anion-coordinated solvation structure and impressive ionic conductivity of 3.58 mS cm-1 at -40 °C. The dominant aggregate solvates enable the formation of highly efficient and LT-resistant Na+ hopping channels in the electrolyte. Moreover, the methyl-regulated electronic structure in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic-organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility, composition homogeneity, and mechanical robustness. As such, a record-high Coulombic efficiency beyond 99.9% is achieved even at -40 °C. The as-constructed AFSMBs sustain 300 cycles with 80% capacity maintained, and a 0.5-Ah level pouch cell delivers 85% capacity over 180 cycles at -25 °C. This study affords new insights into electrolyte formulation for fast ionic conduction and superior Na reversibility at ultralow temperatures.",

The synthesized CNT have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nm, and they combine with hard carbon (HC) to serve as SIB anode material. The synthesized CNT has the following roles: increasing the electrical conductivity of anode material, improving charge-discharge cycle stability, and enhancing sodium ion storage. We integrate these CNT into hard carbon by varying CNT contents, denoted as HC_xCNT(M), where x represents the weight of the CNT. So, the HC_5CNT(M) anode works better in half-cell SIBs, being able to handle different charging rates and reaching a maximum specific capacity of 256.7 mAh g−1 at a 0.2C-rate. This material also displayed remarkable stability, maintaining a specific capacity of 99.48 mAh g−1 at 1C-rate and the capacitive retention remained at 99.1 % after 800 cycles. The CO2-converted CNT can improve electrical conductivity, specific capacity, and cycle stability, according to electrochemical analysis results.

        "abstract": "Closed pores play a crucial role in improving the low-voltage (<0.1 V) plateau capacity of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the lack of simple and effective closed-pore construction strategies, as well as the unclear closed-pore formation mechanism, has severely hindered the development of high plateau capacity hard carbon anodes. Herein, we present an effective closed-pore construction strategy by one-step pyrolysis of zinc gluconate (ZG) and elucidate the corresponding mechanism of closed-pore formation. The closed-pore formation mechanism during the pyrolysis of ZG mainly involves (i) the precipitation of ZnO nanoparticles and the ZnO etching on carbon under 1100 °C to generate open pores of 0.45-4 nm and (ii) the development of graphitic domains and the shrinkage of the partial open pores at 1100-1500 °C to convert the open pores to closed pores. Benefiting from the considerable closed-pore content and suitable microstructure, the optimized hard carbon achieves an ultrahigh reversible specific capacity of 481.5 mA h g-1 and an extraordinary plateau capacity of 389 mA h g-1 for use as the anode of SIBs. Additionally, some in situ and ex situ characterizations demonstrate that the high-voltage slope capacity and the low-voltage plateau capacity stem from the adsorption of Na+ at the defect sites and Na-cluster formation in closed pores, respectively.",

However, sluggish kinetics and low capacity of traditional anode materials inhibit their practical applications. Herein, a novel design featuring a layer‐expanded MoS2 is presented that dual‐reinforced by hollow N, P‐codoped carbon as the inner supporter and surface groups abundant MXene as the outer supporter, resulting in a cross‐linked robust composite (NPC@MoS2/MXene). The hollow N, P‐codoped carbon effectively prevents agglomeration of MoS2 layers and facilitates shorter distances between the electrolyte and electrode. The conductive MXene outer surface envelops the NPC@MoS2 units inside, creating interconnected channels that enable efficient charge transfer and diffusion, ensuring rapid kinetics and enhanced electrode utilization. It exhibits a high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g−1, remarkable cycling stability, and exceptional rate capability with 54% capacity retention when the current density increases from 100 to 5000 mA g−1 toward SIBs. The kinetic mechanism studies reveal that the NPC@MoS2/MXene demonstrates a pseudocapacitance dominated hybrid sodiation/desodiation process. Coupled with active carbon (AC), the NPC@MoS2/MXene//AC SICs achieve both high energy density of 136 Wh kg−1 at 254 W kg−1 and high‐power density of 5940 W kg−1 at 27 Wh g−1, maintaining excellent stability.",

The density functional theory calculations revealed the mechanism and significance of Na/K-storage for the core-shelled Sb@Sb2 O3 heterostructure, which validated that the coupling between the high-conductivity of Sb and the stability of Sb2 O3 can relieve the shortcomings of the individual building blocks, thereby enhancing the Na/K-storage capacity.

Sodium compensation additives can effectively address the irreversible sodium loss but suffer from high decomposition voltage induced by low electrochemical activity.

The well-organized CNT/MnO2 composite with high catalytic activity, good electronic conductivity, and abundant reaction sites enables sodium compensation additives to decompose at significantly reduced voltages (from 4.40 to 3.90 V vs Na+/Na for sodium oxalate, 3.88 V for sodium carbonate, and even 3.80 V for sodium citrate). As a result, sodium oxalate as the optimal additive achieves a specific capacity of 394 mAh g-1, almost reaching its theoretical capacity in the first charge, increasing the energy density of the Na-ion full cell from 111 to 158 Wh kg-1 with improved cycle stability and rate capability.

However, 2D porous materials have remained quite rare due to the difficulty of creating pores in 2D nanostructures. Here, we have synthesized a novel type of single-layered 2D mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets with very uniform size and thickness as well as ordered mesostructure from an unprecedented hydrothermal-induced solvent-confined assembly approach. The F127/TiO2 spherical monomicelles are first formed and redispersed in ethanol and glycerol, followed by a hydrothermal treatment to assemble these subunits into single-layered 2D mesostructure owing to the confinement effect of highly adhered glycerol solvent. The obtained 2D mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets have a relative mean size at around 500 × 500 nm and can be randomly stacked into a bulk. The TiO2 nanosheets possess only one layer of ordered mesopores with a pore size of 4.0 nm, a very high surface area of 210 m2 g-1 and a uniform thickness of 5.5 nm. The thickness can be further manipulated from 5.5 to 27.6 nm via simply tuning precursor concentration or solvent ratio. Due to the well-defined 2D morphology and large mesoporosity as well as crystalline anatase mesopore walls, these uniform TiO2 nanosheets are capable of providing large accessible voids for sodium ion adsorption and intercalation as well as preventing volume expansion. As expected, these mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets have exhibited an excellent reversible capacity of 220 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 as sodium-ion battery anodes, and they can retain at 199 mAh g-1 after numerous cycles at different current densities. The capacity is retained at 44 mAh g-1 even at a large current density of 10 A g-1 after 10 000 cycles, demonstrating a remarkable performance for energy storage.",

However, its large volumetric changes, interfacial instability, and sluggish sodiation kinetics limit its practical applications. Herein, a hierarchical yolk–shell nanohybrid composed of an Sn yolk and a Carbon/Silicon oxycarbide (C/SiOC) bilayer shell is prepared via the simple pyrolysis of a silicone oil dispersion containing an Sn precursor. The multifunctional bilayer helps boost sodiation kinetics by providing conductive pathways, enhancing the reversible capacity through surface capacitive reactions, and stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface. Abundant void interspaces inside the yolk–shell structure accommodate large volume changes of the Sn yolk. The Sn@C/SiOC nanohybrid demonstrates high specific capacity (≈500 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1), remarkable rate performance up to 10 A g−1, and ultrastable cyclability (91.1% retention after 1500 cycles at 5 A g−1).

        "abstract": "Graphene‐based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene‐based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore‐forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in‐plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene‐based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene‐based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.",

Compared with the traditional “hard template” technique for the synthesis of porous carbon, the “soft template” method offers a more efficient synthesis process and simplified template removal.

We have successfully synthesized N/S double-doped porous spherical carbon materials (DF-N/S) through a self-assembly process driven by hydrogen bonding and solvent evaporation. As an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), DF-N/S demonstrates superior electrochemical performance, achieving a specific capacity of 327.04 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.05 Ag-1 in ether-based electrolytes. The remarkable sodium storage efficiency of DF-N/S has been thoroughly examined through kinetic analyses and ex-situ characterization methods. This study aims to provide a sustainable and widely adaptable method for the soft template production of doped carbon, while also shedding light on the intricacies of energy storage mechanisms in both ether/ester-based electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "The volume expansion of CoFe2 O4 anode poses a significant challenge in the commercial application of lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, metal-organic-frameworks (MOF) offer superior construction of heterostructures with refined interfacial interactions and lower ion diffusion barriers in Li/Na storage. In this study, the CoFe2 O4 @carbon nanofibers derived from MOF are produced through electrospinning, in situ growth followed by calcination, which are then confined within an MXene-confined MOF-derived porous CoFe2 O4 @carbon composite architecture under alkali treatment. The CoFe2 O4 nanofibers anchor on the alkalized MXene that is decorated with the NaOH solution to form a multi-pleated structure. The sandwich-like structure of the composite effectively alleviates the volume expansion and shortens the Li/Na-ion diffusion path, which displays high capacity and outstanding rate performance as anode materials for LIBs/SIBs. As a consequence, the obtained CoFe2 O4 @carbon@alkalized MXene composite anode shows satisfied rate performance at current density of 10 A g-1 for LIBs (318 mAh·g-1 ) and 5 A g-1 for SIBs (149 mAh g-1 ). The excellent cycling performance is further demonstrated at a high current density, where it maintains a discharge capacity of 807 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 400 cycles for LIBs and 130 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 even after 1000 cycles for SIBs.",

Herein, waste denim fabrics were used as raw material to prepare denim-based hard carbon (DHC) via a one-step carbonization method, and its sodium storage performance as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries was investigated. The effects of carbonization temperature on the microstructure and electrochemical sodium storage performance of DHC were investigated using X-ray diffraction, N_2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge methods. The results demonstrate that DHC derived at a carbonization temperature of 1300 °C with an optimal graphitic microcrystal size, pore structure and surface defect, exhibits the best electrochemical performance. At a current density of 50 mAh·g^−1, it has a reversible specific capacity of 317.1 mAh·g^−1 and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.76%. After 1000 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA·g^−1, the capacity retention rate is 84.5%.

Subtraction of the PDF of crystalline NaxSb phases from the total PDF, an approach constrained by chemical phase information gained from 23Na ssNMR in reference to relevant model compounds, identifies two previously uncharacterized intermediate species formed electrochemically; a-Na3–xSb (x ≈ 0.4–0.5), a structure locally similar to crystalline Na3Sb (c-Na3Sb) but with significant numbers of sodium vacancies and a limited correlation length, and a-Na1.7Sb, a highly amorphous structure featuring some Sb–Sb bonding. The first sodiation breaks down the crystalline antimony to form first a-Na3–xSb and, finally, crystalline Na3Sb. Desodiation results in the formation of an electrode formed of a composite of crystalline and amorphous antimony networks. We link the different reactivity of these networks to a series of sequential sodiation reactions manifesting as a cascade of processes observed in the electrochemical profile of subsequent cycles. The amorphous network reacts at higher voltages reforming a-Na1.7Sb, then a-Na3–xSb, whereas lower potentials are required for the sodiation of crystalline antimony, which reacts to form a-Na3–xSb without the formation of a-Na1.7Sb. a-Na3–xSb is converted to crystalline Na3Sb at the end of the second discharge. We find no evidence of formation of NaSb. Variable temperature 23Na NMR experiments reveal significant sodium mobility within c-Na3Sb; this is a possible contributing factor to the excellent rate performance of Sb anodes.",

        "abstract": "In this work, graphene oxide is used as a substrate for the nucleation and growth of Ni(OH)(OCH3) during solvothermal synthesis. As a result, 2D Ni(OH)(OCH3) nanosheets are vertically anchored on 2D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets, forming a Ni(OH)(OCH3)@rGO composite. Afterward, a NiS2@rGO hybrid is created by sulfurizing the Ni(OH)(OCH3)@rGO intermediate, which presents the same morphology as the intermediate but a porous structure of NiS2 nanosheets. The characteristic 2D porous structure of NiS2 nanosheets offers abundant active sites for charge storage, accelerates ion/electron transport, and buffers volume expansion. Meanwhile, rGO nanosheets can suppress the shuttle of polysulfides while also enhancing electrical conductivity. These factors in conjunction with the thin and robust ether-derived SEI are favorable to mechanical stability and rapid sodiation kinetics in the NiS2@rGO electrode in the ether-based electrolyte, thereby endowing it with exceptional rate capability (324 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) and a long lifespan (378 mA h g-1 over 1800 cycles at 1 A g-1). However, in the ester-based electrolyte, NiS2@rGO shows poor rate capability and cyclability. The kinetic analysis unveils the mechanism underlying the different electrochemical behavior in NiS2@rGO in the two electrolytes. More importantly, the NiS2@rGO electrode outperforms most NiS2-based materials reported in terms of rate and cycling performance owing to its unique hierarchical structure, making it a viable contender for anode materials in sodium-ion batteries. We also propose a novel M(OH)(OCH3)@rGO intermediate for the fabrication of transition-metal oxides/sulfides@rGO composites for energy storage and catalysis.",

However, the unfavorable growth of Na‐metal deposition and severe interfacial reactions have prevented their large‐scale applications. Here, a vacuum filtration strategy, through amyloid‐fibril‐modified glass‐fiber separators, is proposed to address these issues. The modified symmetric cell can be cycled for 1800 h, surpassing the performance of previously reported Na‐based electrodes under an ester‐based electrolyte. Moreover, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a sodiophilic amyloid‐fibril‐modified separator exhibits a capacity retention of 87.13% even after 1000 cycles. Both the experimental and the theoretical results show that the sodiophilic amyloid fibril homogenizes the electric field and Na‐ion concentration, fundamentally inhibiting dendrite formation. Simultaneously, the glutamine amino acids in the amyloid fibril have the highest adsorption energy for Na, resulting in the formation of a stable Na3N‐ and NaNxOy‐rich solid‐electrolyte‐interface film on the anode during cycling. This work provides not only a possible pathway to solve the dendrite problem in metal batteries using environmentally friendly biomacromolecular materials, but also a new direction for expanding biomaterial applications.",

To overcome these issues, we propose a rational design: Bi@C nanospheres with the unique petaloid core-shell structure are synthesized in one step for the first time and then combined with different contents of graphene (GR) nanosheets to form the composites Bi@C@GR. The Bi@C nanospheres with a core-shell structure are beneficial to shortening the transmission path of electrons/ions and reducing the risk from structural rupture of the particles during cycling. In addition, the combination of Bi@C nanospheres and porous GR could greatly improve the conductivity and prevent the aggregation of particles, which is conducive to better cycling stability and rate performance. Consequently, Bi@C@GR-2 presents a superior reversible capacity for sodium storage (300 mAh g-1 over 80 cycles) and potassium storage (200 mAh g-1 over 70 cycles) at 0.1 A g-1. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are carried out to analyze and reflect the kinetic reaction mechanism and the phase change of the Bi@C@GR-2 electrode during the charge/discharge processes.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable solid-state sodium-ion batteries (SSSBs) hold great promise for safer and more energy-dense energy storage. However, the poor electrochemical stability between current sulfide-based solid electrolytes and high-voltage oxide cathodes has limited their long-term cycling performance and practicality. Here, we report the discovery of the ion conductor Na_3-xY_1-xZr_xCl_6 (NYZC) that is both electrochemically stable (up to 3.8 V vs. Na/Na^+) and chemically compatible with oxide cathodes. Its high ionic conductivity of 6.6 × 10^−5 S cm^−1 at ambient temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than oxide coatings, is attributed to abundant Na vacancies and cooperative MCl_6 rotation, resulting in an extremely low interfacial impedance. A SSSB comprising a NaCrO_2 + NYZC composite cathode, Na_3PS_4 electrolyte, and Na-Sn anode exhibits an exceptional first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 97.1% at room temperature and can cycle over 1000 cycles with 89.3% capacity retention at 40 °C. These findings highlight the immense potential of halides for SSSB applications. Rechargeable solid-state sodium-ion batteries hold great promise for safer and more energy-dense energy storage.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to take the place of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices due to the cost advantages they offer. However, due to the larger ion radius, the reaction kinetics of Na+ in anode materials is sluggish. SnS2 is an attractive anode material for SIBs due to its large interlayer spacing and alloying reactions with high capacity. Calcination is usually employed to improve the crystallinity of SnS2, which could affect the Na+ reaction kinetics, especially the pseudocapacitive storage. However, excessively high temperature could damage the well-designed nanostructure of SnS2. In this work, we uniformly grow SnS2 nanosheets on a Zn-, N-, and S-doped carbon skeleton (SnS2@ZnNS). To explore the optimal calcination temperature, SnS2@ZnNS is calcined at three typical temperatures (300, 350, and 400 °C), and the electrochemical performance and Na+ storage kinetics are investigated specifically. The results show that the sample calcined at 350 °C exhibited the best rate capacity and cycle performance, and the reaction kinetics analysis shows that the same sample exhibited a stronger pseudocapacitive response than the other two samples. This improved Na+ storage capability can be attributed to the enhanced crystallinity and the intact nanostructure.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have great potential as electrochemical energy storage systems; however, their commercial viability is limited by the lack of anode materials with fast charge/discharge rates and long lifetimes. These challenges were addressed by developing a multi-interface design strategy using FCSe (FeSe2/CoSe2) nanoparticles on V4C3Tx MXene nanosheets as conductive substrates. The heterogeneous interface created between the two materials provided high-speed transport of sodium ions, suppressed the chalking-off of nanoparticles, and improved the cycling stability. Additionally, the Fe-Co bonds generated at the interface effectively relieved mechanical stress, further enhancing the electrode durability. The C@FCSe@V4C3 electrode exhibited high-speed charging and discharging characteristics, and maintained a high specific capacity of 260.5 mAh g-1 even after 15,000 cycles at 10 A g-1, with a capacity retention rate of 50.2% at an ultrahigh current density of 20 A g-1. Furthermore, the composite displayed a good cycling capability in the fast discharge and slow charge mode. This demonstrates its promising commercial potential.

However, the purposeful design of advanced battery-type anodes has become an urgent need to remedy the dynamics mismatch with the capacitive cathode. Herein, we propose a simple but efficient bottom-up approach to build three-dimensional Mo2C/C hybrid architectures in situ as anodes for SICs. By finely regulating the ratio of carbon and molybdenum sources, the optimized Mo2C/C, where even thinner subunit assembled Mo2C nanodisk (∼47.1 nm in thickness) arrays are immobilized on carbon nanosheet substrate via the synchronous embedded growth, rapid electron and ion diffusion/transport expressways, abundant active sites and robust structural stability were achieved for efficient sodium storage. Benefiting from the synergistic contributions of the components, the optimum Mo2C/C anode displays an outstanding rate and long-cycle properties as a competitive anode. Moreover, the constructed Mo2C/C-based SICs exhibited an energy density of ∼16.7 W h kg-1 at 10 kW h kg-1, along with ∼22.5% capacitance degradation over 4000 cycles at 1 A g-1.

MoS2/CoS2-RGO displays a unique 2D structure which provides large specific surface area for pseudocapacitive charge storage, polyvalent ion reaction for ultrahigh capacity, and a heterostructure to high Na-ion diffusion rate.

The composition and distinctive structure facilitate the rapid diffusion of Na+ and improve the charge transfer at the heterogeneous interface, providing sufficient space for volume expansion and improving anode materials' structural stability.

Irrespective of this advantage, the electrochemical performance of NaMnPO4 is still far from what is desired. Herein we provide the first report on the storage performance of NaMnPO4 having a structure modified by Mg2+ substitution. The Mg-substituted phospho-olivines are prepared on the basis of ionic exchange reactions involving the participation of Mg-substituted KMnPO4·H2O dittmarites as structural template. Furthermore, the phosphate particles were covered with a thin layer (up to 5 nm) of activated carbon through ball-milling. The storage performance of phospho-olivines is analyzed in sodium and lithium half-ion cells, as well as in full-ion cells versus bio-mass derived activated carbon and spinel Li4Ti5O12 as anodes. The compatibility of phospho-olivines with electrolytes is assessed by utilization of several types of lithium and sodium carbonate-based solutions. In sodium half-cell, the Mg-substituted phosphate displays a multi-phase mechanism of Na+ intercalation in case when NaTFSI-based electrolyte is used. In lithium half-cell, the high specific capacity and rate capability is achieved for phospho-olivine cycled in LiPF6-based electrolyte. This is a consequence of the occurrence of dual Li+,Na+ intercalation, which encompass nano-sized domains.

        "abstract": "Anode materials with excellent properties have become the key to develop sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) that combine the advantages of both batteries and capacitors. Amorphous modulation is an effective strategy to realize high energy/power density in SIHCs.

The amorphous clusters with asymmetric Nb-O3 /N1 configurations have abundant charge density and low diffusion energy barriers, which effectively modulate the charge transport paths and improve the reaction kinetics. The clusters are also enriched with unsaturated vacancy defects and isotropic ion-transport channels, and their atomic disordering exhibits high structural stress buffering, which are strong impetuses for realizing bulk-phase-indifferent ion storage and enhancing the storage properties of the composite. Based on these features, Nb-O/N@C achieves notably improved sodium-ion storage properties (reversible capacity of 240.1 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1 after 8000 cycles), and has great potential for SIHCs (230 Wh Kg-1 at 4001.5 W Kg-1 ).

        "abstract": "Nanoengineering of metal anode materials shows great potential for energy storage with high capacity. Zero-dimensional nanoparticles are conducive to acquire remarkable electrochemical properties in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their enlarged surface active sites. However, it is still difficult to fulfill the requirements of practical applications in batteries owing to the deficiency of efficient and scalable preparation approaches of high-performance metal electrode materials. Herein, an electrochemical cathodic corrosion method is proposed for the tunable preparation of nanostructured antimony (Sb) by the introduction of a surfactant, which can efficiently avoid the agglomeration of Sb atom clusters generated from the Zintl compound and further stacking into bulk during the electrochemical process. Subsequently, graphene as the support and conductive matrix is uniformly interspersed by generating Sb nanoparticles (Sb/Gr). Moreover, the reversible crystalline-phase evolution of Sb ⇋ NaSb ⇋Na3Sb for Sb/Gr was studied by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). Benefiting from the interconnection of the conductive network, Sb/Gr anodes deliver a high capacity of 635.34 mAh g-1, a retained capacity of 507.2 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at 0.1 C (1 C = 660 mAh g-1), and excellent rate performance with the capacities of 473.41 and 405.09 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 C, respectively. The superior cycle stability with a capacity of 346.26 mAh g-1 is achieved after 500 cycles at 2 C. This electrochemical approach offers a new route toward developing metal anodes with designed nanostructures for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal anode, featuring high capacity, low voltage and earth abundance, is desirable for building advanced sodium-metal batteries. However, Na-ion deposition typically leads to morphological instability and notorious chemical reactivity between sodium and common electrolytes still limit its practical application. In this study, a porous BN nanofibers modified sodium metal (BN/Na) electrode is introduced for enhancing Na-ion deposition dynamics and stability. As a result, symmetrical BN/Na cells enable an impressive rate capability and markedly enhanced cycling durability over 600 h at 10 mA cm-2 . Density functional theory simulations demonstrate BN could effectively improve Na-ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics simultaneously. Finite element simulation clearly reveals the intrinsic smoothing effect of BN upon multiple Na-ion plating/stripping cycles. Coupled with a Na3 V2 O2 (PO4 )2 F/Ti3 C2 X cathode, sodium metal full cells offer an ultrastable capacity of 125/63 mA h g-1 (≈420/240 Wh kg-1 ) at 0.05/5 C rate over 500 cycles.

The large surface area and doping of nitrogen can facilitate the transfer of both Na+ ions and electrons.

Impressively, FeCN2@NC as an SIB anode exhibits excellent rate performance with highly reversible rate capacities of 466 and 303 mA h g-1 at 0.2 and 10.0 A g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the FeCN2@NC anode shows a high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 86% due to a low surface area. Electrochemical tests and density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate that the metastable character enables the low intercalation/conversion reaction energy for FeCN2 and further greatly promotes the fast pseudocapacitive storage mechanism for FeCN2@NC. This work provides evidence that FeCN2 is a new type of metastability induced pseudocapacitive material with high initial coulombic efficiency.",

        "abstract": "As a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage systems, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are experiencing a rapid development. Organic conjugated carboxylic acid anodes not only have tailorable electrochemical properties but also are easily accessible. However, the low stability and electrical conductivity hamper their practical applications. In this study, disodium terephthalate (Na2 TP), the most favorable organic conjugated carboxylic acid anode material for SIBs, was proposed to integrate with graphene oxide (GO) by an anti-solvent precipitation process, which ensures the uniform and tight coating of GO on the Na2 TP surface. GO is electrochemically reduced during the first several cycles of the electrochemical measurement, which buffers the volume change and improves the electrical conductivity of Na2 TP, resulting in a better cyclic and rate performance. The incorporation of only 5 wt % GO onto Na2 TP leads to a reversible capability of 235 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.1 C, which is the best among the state of the art organic anodes for SIBs.

Herein, PCHC‐10 with abundant and suitable‐sized closed pore size (0.45 nm) and nano‐scaled soft carbon coating layer has been accurately designed by chemical crosslink reaction between the pre‐oxidized phenolic resin and a small addition of pitch to form ester‐based bond.

Furthermore, the detailed electrochemical storage behaviors and theoretical calculations revealed that the HC owning closed pore‐size of 0.45 nm has the strongest Na+ storage abilities in low‐voltage platforms.

Herein, polypyrrole-encapsulated VSe2 nanoplates (VSe2@PPy) were prepared by the selenization of VOOH hollow nanospheres and subsequent in situ polymerization and coating by pyrrole. Benefiting from the inherent metallicity of VSe2, the improvement in the conductivity and the structural protection provided by the PPy layer, the VSe2@PPy nanoplates exhibited enhanced sodium/potassium-storage performances, delivering a superior rate capability with a capacity of 260.0 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 in SIBs and 148.6 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 in PIBs, as well as revealing an ultrastability in cycling of 324.6 mA h g-1 after 2800 cycles at 4 A g-1 in SIBs. Moreover, the insertion and conversion mechanisms of VSe2@PPy in SIBs with intermediates of Na0.6VSe2, NaVSe2, and VSe were elucidated by in situ/ex situ X-ray diffraction combined with ex situ transmission electron microscopy observation and in situ potentio-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy during the sodiation and desodiation processes. Density functional theory calculations show that the strong coupling between VSe2 and PPy not only causes it to have a stronger total density of states and a built-in electric field, leading to an increased electrical conductivity, but also effectively decreases the ion diffusion barrier.",

Herein, a 3D Ag@C natrophilic substrate prepared by a facile thermal evaporation deposition method, which can be employed as a much safer \"anode-free\" SMA, is reported. Initially, there is no bulk sodium on the Ag@C substrate in the assembled SIBs. Upon charging, sodium will be uniformly deposited onto the Ag@C substrate and afterwards functions as a real SMA, thus inheriting the intrinsic merits of SMA and enhancing safety simultaneously. While cycling, the as-synthesized substrate demonstrates superior sodium plating/stripping cycling stability at 1, 2 and 3 mA cm-2 with a capacity of 2 mAh cm-2 . Theoretical simulations reveal that Na ions prefer to bind with Ag and form a Na-Ag network, thus clearly revealing uniform sodium deposition on the Ag@C substrate. More importantly, a full battery based on Ag@C and Prussian white with impressive Coulomb efficiency (CE), high rate capability (from 0.1 C to 5 C) and long-term cycling life is illustrated for the first time, thus making Ag@C feasible for the establishment of \"anode-free\" SIBs with reduced cost, high gravimetric/volumetric energy density and enhanced safety.",

The structurally advantageous FeS@C NSRs arises from heating Fe foam in the presence of a sulphur-containing resin, which supplies both the sulphur and carbon for the reaction. FeS@C NSRs maintains a high capacity of 582.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 for 120 cycles and a high rate capability of 270 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 for 2500 cycles. The impressive cycling performance results from fast electron and ion transfer with low structural strain on the bulk material. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy and XRD also reveal evidence that FeS@C NSRs cycles via a fully reversible conversion reaction pathway facilitated by the C–S–Fe bond. The efficient synthesis method could also be explored to produce other carbon coated transition metal sulphides for electrochemical applications.",

In this study, we have successfully fabricated a novel structure of vertical MoS_2 nanosheets on graphene, with ZnS nanoparticles serving as bonding points (MoS_2/ZnS/G), through a facile hydrothermal method. During the synthesis process, Zn^2+ not only acts as a landing site for the vertical growth of MoS_2 nanosheets but also triggers the formation of a defect-rich structure in the final samples. This unique architecture of MoS_2/ZnS/G effectively combines the advantages of a vertically aligned geometry and a defect-rich structure for energy storage. The resulting structure displays shortened transport paths for electrons/ions, enhanced conductivity, improved structural integrity, and an increased number of active sites for promising electrochemical performance. As expected, when used as anode for sodium-ion batteries, the as-synthesized MoS_2/ZnS/G exhibits excellent rate capability (high capacity of 298 mAh·g^−1 at 5 A·g^−1) and good cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.056% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 A·g^−1). According to the kinetic investigations, the electrochemical process of the MoS_2/ZnS/G sample is primarily governed by a pseudocapacitive behavior, which enhances the charge/discharge kinetics and allows the MoS_2/ZnS/G structure to remain intact during cycling.

However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) of P/C composites limit their widespread applications.\n                  In this study, we develop an effective presodiation method to compensate for the irreversible sodium loss of the S-doped P/C (P/C@S) anode and yield a thin, uniform, and NaF-rich SEI layer on the presodiated P/C@S (pNa-P/C@S) anode during cycling. Consequently, the pNa-P/C@S anode exhibits a remarkable ICE of 98.7% as well as superior cycling performance and rate capability in the half cell. When pNa-P/C@S anode is coupled with conventional Na3V2(PO4)2F3, Na3V2(PO4)3, and NaCu0.12Ni0.23Fe0.33Mn0.33 cathodes, all the full cells demonstrate desirable ICEs (>98%), high energy densities, and excellent cycling performance. The proposed method has been extended to another anode (SnO2) to demonstrate its applicability in fabricating anodes with a high ICE and stable NaF-rich SEI layer.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge for sodium/potassium ion storage is to find the suitable host materials to accommodate the larger-sized Na+/K+ and conquer the sluggish chemical kinetics. Herein, by selenation of polyoxometalate in electrospinning fiber, a novel MoO2/MoSe2 heterostructure embedded in one-dimensional (1D) N,P-doped carbon nanofiber (MoO2/MoSe2@NPC) is rationally constructed to show distinct enhancement of rate performance and cycle life for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The 1D skeleton of MoO2/MoSe2@NPC decreases the diffusion pathway of Na+/K+, and the doping of N/P heteroatoms in carbon fiber creates abundant active sites and provides good reachability for Na+/K+ transportation. MoSe2 nanosheets grow in the bulk phase of MoO2 via in situ local phase transformation to achieve effective and firm heterointerfaces. Especially, the exposure extent of heterointerfaces can be controlled by treatment temperature during the preparation process, and the optimized heterointerfaces result in an ideal synergic effect between MoO2 and MoSe2. DFT calculations confirm that the internal electric field in the heterogeneous interface guides the electron transfer from MoO2 to MoSe2, combined with strong adsorption capacity toward sodium/potassium, facilitating ion/electron transfer kinetics. It is confirmed that the MoO2/MoSe2@NPC anode for SIBs delivers 382 mA h g-1 under 0.1 A g-1 upon 200 cycles; meanwhile, a reversible capacity of 266 mA h g-1 is maintained even under 2 A g-1 after 2000 cycles. For PIBs, it can reach up to 216 mA h g-1 in the 200th cycle and still retain 125 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles under 1 A g-1. This study opens up a new interface manipulation strategy for the design of anode materials to boost fast Na+/K+ storage kinetics.",

However, it is still challenging to obtain anode materials with high stability, multiple active sites, and high conductivity. In this paper, an advanced metal–organic framework (MOF)‐based anode material (Co‐HITP), which integrates multiple advantages into one, is successfully synthesized through a sodiation‐stimulated in situ reconstruction. The Co‐HITP possesses a stable single‐crystal structure, expanded spacing layers, abundant sites, and good conductivity, and exhibits superior properties with ultra‐long cycling stability (ultralow decay rate ≈0.001% per cycle after 15 000 cycles at 8 A g−1), high reversible capacity (450.1 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), and excellent rate performance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal that the anode remains a stable structure after long cycling, attributed to the single‐crystal structure with d‐π hybridization and π–π interaction, and the minimum structural unit stores 6Na+ ions of C═N sites and 8Na+ ions of aromatic rings. This discovery is significant for developing advanced anode materials with integrated advantages for SIBs.",

The performance of the soft carbon-modified hard carbon synthesized with the pecan shells-to-asphalt mass ratio of 10:1 surpasses that of the pure biomass hard carbon pyrolyzed at the same temperature. It delivers an initial charge capacity of 291.9 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 74.95 %, and maintains a reversible capacity of 257 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1.

Herein, fullerene C60 is intercalated covalently into the interlayer of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets by using a low‐temperature hydrothermal reaction between a water‐soluble C60 derivative and hydrophilic MXene nanosheets, resulting in enlarged interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets from 12.8 to 14.1 Å and consequently retarded self‐restacking. Moreover, the strong electron extraction ability of C60 facilitates electron transfer from MXene to C60, enabling faster charge transport during Na+ transportation. The as‐prepared C60@MXene hybrid is applied as a novel anode of SIBs, exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance and super‐long cycling stability. C60@MXene‐based SIB delivers a specific capacity of 226.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 300 cycles, which surpasses that obtained from the pristine MXene anode, and retains 94.5% capacity at 1 A g−1 after 10 000 cycles.

Ex-situ X-ray diffraction and ex-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy tests are conducted to investigate the underlying Na-storage mechanism of In2P3S9.

However, it remains a critical challenge to improve the electrical and ionic conductivity for better performance. Topological insulator (TI), a topological quantum material that has attracted worldwide attention, hosts unusual metallic surface states and consequent high carrier mobility. Nevertheless, its potential in promising high-rate charging capability has not been fully realized and explored. Herein, a novel Bi2 Se3 -ZnSe heterostructure as excellent fast charging material for Na+ storage is reported. Ultrathin Bi2 Se3 nanoplates with rich TI metallic surfaces are introduced as an electronic platform inside the material, which greatly reduces the charge transfer resistance and improves the overall electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the abundant crystalline interfaces between these two selenides promote Na+ migration and provide additional active sites as well. As expected, the composite delivers the excellent high-rate performance of 360.5 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1 and maintains its electrochemical stability of 318.4 mAh g-1 after 3000 long cycles, which is the record high for all reported selenide-based anodes.

        "abstract": "The electronic properties, adsorption energies and energy barrier of sodium ion diffusion in B-doped graphyne (BGY) are studied by density functional theory (DFT) method. If some carbon atoms in pristine graphyne (GY) are substituted by boron atoms (one substitution per unit cell in this work), BGY is obtained, and the band structure and density of state (DOS) plots indicate a transition from a semiconductive state for GY to a metallic state for BGY. The calculated adsorption energy shows an improvement in the trigonal-like pore (T site) and hexagonal ring (H site) adsorption of BGY compared to the corresponding analog sites in GY. The comparison of projected density of state (PDOS) plots before and after adsorption reveals charge transfer from sodium to nanosheets. Therefore, the interaction between adsorbed sodium atom and BGY/GY has ionic character and not covalent. This phenomenon is important for the reversible sodium adsorption in secondary batteries. Moreover, PDOS plots show that the electron transfer from sodium atom to host structure in BGY is more than in GY, which is in agreement with adsorption energies. According to diffusion energy barrier calculations, boron atoms in BGY structure provide low energy paths for sodium ions diffusion. We estimate a theoretical capacity of 751 mA h g-1 for the maximum sodium adsorption on BGY (without cluster formation). Therefore, BGY is a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs).",

Peculiarly, introducing a carbon shell not only acts as an important protective layer to form a rigid construction and accommodate the volume changes, but also improves the electronic conductivity to optimize the stable cycle performance and the excellent rate property. The architecture composed of ZnS inner core and a complex Sb2S3/C shell not only facilitates the facile electrolyte infiltration to reduce the Na-ion diffusion length to improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics, but also prevents the structure pulverization caused by Na-ion insertion/extraction.

In this work, bamboo-derived hard carbon was prepared via two carbonization temperatures at 700 and 1000 °C for an hour and employed as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIB). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform (FT)-Raman spectroscopic results indicated the disordered structure with d -spacing ( d _002) around 0.36–0.37 nm, which is a benefit for sodium ion insertion/desertion. Herein, the composition between carbon-nanotube (CNT) and bamboo-derived hard carbon (BB) was synthesized by a ball mill with various contents of CNT (1 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt%). At the optimal CNT content of 5 wt%, the sample exhibited excellent performance and outstanding stability. As the anode, the half-cell SIB using BB(700)w@5%CNT (with a carbonization temperature of 700 °C and CNT loading of 5 wt%) delivered a high initial specific capacity of 268.9 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1C and capacity retention of 78.6% after 500 cycles at 1.0C. The full cell SIB fabrication BB(700)w@5%CNT in combination with Na_3V_2(PO4)_3 as the cathode demonstrated a high specific capacity of 127.6 mAh·g^−1 at 0.2C with its capacitive retention remaining of 78% at 1.0C after 1000 cycles. The attained storage performance indicates that hard carbon-CNT composite anode material enhanced the conductive path of electron transport and provided long-term cycling stability. The good electrochemical performance as well as the low cost and environment-friendliness of the bamboo-derived hard carbon proves its suitability for future sodium-ion batteries.

Here, the bottleneck problem is resolved by designing carbon encapsulation on gallium–indium liquid metal nanoparticles (EGaIn@C LMNPs).

Morphological and phase changes of EGaIn@C LMNPs during the electrochemical reaction process are revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy measurements in real‐time. The origin for the excellent performance is uncovered, that is the EGaIn@C core–shell structure effectively suppresses the non‐uniform volume expansion of LMNPs from ≈160% to 127%, improves the electrical conductivity of the LMNPs, and exhibits superior electrochemical kinetics and a self‐healing phenomenon.

Both in‐situ and ex‐situ characterizations provide strong evidence for the evolution mechanism of the phases and stable solid‐electrolyte interface (SEI) on the vacancy‐CoS2/FeS2@C surface. The density functional theory calculations show that constructing heterojunction with reasonable concentration of vacancies can significantly increase the anode electronic conductivity. Notably, the assembled vacancy‐CoS2/FeS2@C//Na3V2(PO4)3/C full‐cell shows a capacity of 226.2 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at 2.0 A g−1, confirming this material's practicability.",

        "abstract": "An innovative approach to electrolyte engineering in carbonate electrolytes is introduced by incorporating high donor number dual anion additives into the conventional electrolyte system (1 M NaPF6 EC:PC). The active engagement of anions in the primary solvation shell effectively hinders the reduction of solvent molecules by reducing the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of Na+‐solvent‐anion complex as compared to the LUMO of pure solvents or Na+‐solvent complex. The participation of anions leads to the formation of a thinner and an inorganic‐rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the hard carbon anode enhancing Initial Coulombic Efficiency and significantly improving its kinetics. Moreover, the system with dual anion additives exhibits oxidative stability up to 4.5 V, effectively mitigating the undesired side reactions at high voltage operation of the layered sodium nickel manganese oxide cathode. The addition of dual anion additives proves instrumental in suppressing structural degradation and transition metal dissolution during the long cycling performance of the layered oxide cathode in a sodium‐ion full cell. The synergistic effects of this dual anion additive added electrolyte on both the anode and the cathode ultimately ensured prolonged cycling of the sodium‐ion full cell. The electrolyte engineering approach outlined in this study opens the door to advancing next‐generation high‐voltage sodium batteries.",

Electrochemical results indicated that the MoS2@GDY anode displays a considerable discharge capacity of up to 328 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1. A capacity retention of 93% even at testing current back to 200 mA g-1 suggests superior rate characteristics. An outstanding stable cyclic performance of 217 mAh g-1 is obtained at a high testing density.

        "abstract": "Anode‐free sodium batteries (AFSBs) are a desirable choice for high‐energy‐density and low‐cost battery systems. However, the rapid capacity decline resulting from irreversible sodium plating and stripping remains a big challenge for AFSBs. Herein, a copper‐dominated Cu2Sb composite coating employing a co‐sputtering strategy is designed to improve the sodophilicity of copper foils. The Cu2Sb coating can construct a durably sodophilic and stable interface by suppressing the alloying transition of the sodophilic phase and alleviating the volumetric deformation of the coating. This stable alloy interface can greatly enhance sodium nucleation and improve ion transport at the interface by forming homogeneous NaF‐rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Ultimately, the AFSB assembled using this unique substrate with a highly loaded Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode (≈10 mg cm−2) can cycle 600 cycles deliver a discharge capacity of 75.4 mAh g−1 with a capacity retention of 74.2%, which is much higher than those of the untreated one or antimony coating one (<30% after 200 cycles). This co‐sputtering strategy provides new insights into the design of sodophilic coatings with sodium‐alloying ability and can be extended to the optimization of zinc‐metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large‐scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high‐rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite‐type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+‐diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as‐synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well‐matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full‐cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of ≈10 kW kg−1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23 kW kg−1, an energy density of 58 Wh kg−1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high‐power SIB for large‐scale applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with high theoretical capacity is viewed as a promising anode for sodium‐ion batteries but suffers from inferior rate capability owing to the polaron‐induced slow charge transfer. Herein, a polaron collapse strategy induced by electron‐rich insertions is proposed to effectively solve the above issue. Specifically, 1D [MoS] chains are inserted into MoS2 to break the symmetry states of 2D layers and induce small‐polaron collapse to gain fast charge transfer so that the as‐obtained thermodynamically stable Mo2S3 shows metallic behavior with 107 times larger electrical conductivity than that of MoS2. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Mo2S3 owns highly delocalized anions, which substantially reduce the interactions of Na−S to efficiently accelerate Na+ diffusion, endowing Mo2S3 lower energy barrier (0.38 vs 0.65 eV of MoS2). The novel Mo2S3 anode exhibits a high capacity of 510 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and a superior high‐rate stability of 217 mAh g−1 at 40 C over 15 000 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the in‐depth reversible redox chemistry in Mo2S3. The proposed polaron collapse strategy for intrinsically facilitating charge transfer can be conducive to electrode design for fast‐charging batteries.",

        "abstract": "Coal-derived hard carbons (CHCs) have considerable potential as sodium storage materials because of their abundant resources and structural diversity. Nevertheless, the smaller layer spacing and ordered carbon microstructure of CHCs bring about low charge/discharge rates and poor cycle life of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), rendering it challenging to support large-scale energy storage applications. Herein, the preoxidation strategy is employed to achieve multiscale structure optimization of CHCs and improve its sodium storage capacity. The oxygen content in preoxidized coal reached 15.2%, contributing to increasing the cross-linked structure of the coal materials. Particularly, insertion of Na+ is facilitated by large layer spacing of 0.394 nm, as well as the closed pores (0.162 cm3 g-1) improving the diffusion of Na+. Consequently, the rate performance of the as-optimized anode (OCHC3) is superior to that of directly carbonized. Specifically, OCHC3 exhibits a commendable rate performance (201 mAh g-1) and achieves outstanding cycling stability (96.2%) over 500 cycles. Furthermore, galvanostatic intermittent titration reveals the \"adsorption-insertion-filling\" of OCHC3. This study enlightens the rational design of high-performance HC anodes for SIBs and beyond.",

The commercial graphite anode is demonstrated unsuitable as an anode material for SIBs due to the larger radius of Na+ ions, whereas the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential as anodes for SIBs because of their high achievable capacity. The sluggish kinetics, large volume expansion, and aggregation of those materials however results in severe decay of the electrochemical performance. In this work, a flower-like MoSe2 /C composite is synthesized with ethylenediamine and cassava starch (denoted as MoSe2 /Ccas ) and designed based on these principles: 1) expand the d-spacing of (0 0 2) planes of MoSe2 to enhance the kinetics for the intercalation-deintercalation of Na+ ions and 2) embed MoSe2 into the carbon matrix to enhance the conductivity and restrict the volume expansion and aggregation of MoSe2 . As a result, MoSe2 /Ccas exhibits superior cycle performance and rate capability for sodium storage. It shows durable long-life cycle capability with a reversible capacity of 360 mAh g-1 after 350 cycles at 0.5 Ag-1 .

In addition, N–FeSe2 provides excellent diffusion coefficient and high initial Coulomb efficiency (78.9 %), which is attributed to its special hierarchical porous structure and intrinsic pseudocapacitance characteristics. DFT calculations indicate that an increase in vacancy concentration enhances the conductivity of the material, thereby improving its dynamic performance.

        "abstract": "The carbonaceous anodes in sodium ion batteries suffer from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and poor cyclability due to rampant solid electrolyte interface (SEI) growth. The concept of the weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) has been popularized for SEI regulation on the anode by adjusting the cation solvation structure. Nevertheless, the effects on the solvation sheath from the electrode/electrolyte interface are ignored in most WSE applications. In this work, we extend the WSE from the bulk electrolyte to the electrolyte/carbon interface. By recycling asphalt wastes into sp2 C enriched few-layer carbon on hard carbon, a weakly solvating interface is fabricated with lower adsorption energy to electrolyte solvent molecules than a pristine anode (-0.89 vs -1.08 eV for Na/diglyme). Accordingly, more anionic groups are attracted into the solvent-weakened solvation sheath during sodiation (2.30 vs 1.96 coordination number for PF6-). The anion-mediated contact ion pairs facilitate a thin, inorganic-rich SEI layer with a homogeneous distribution, which confers a high ICE of 97.9% and a high capacity of 335.6 mA h g-1 at 1 C (89.5% retention, 1000 cycles). The full battery also manifests an energy density of 209 W h kg-1. This interfacial design is applicable in both ether- and ester-based electrolytes, which is promising in cost-effective modification for carbonaceous electrodes.",

Herein, a series of edge-nitrogen enriched porous carbon nanosheets (ENPCNs) are synthesized by annealing g-C3 N4 and glucose in a sealed graphite crucible at different temperatures (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C). Surprisingly, under the closed thermal treatment condition, the ENPCNs-T possess a high N-doping level (>12.62 at%) and different carbon interlayer distance ranging from 0.429 to 0.487 nm. By correlating the carbon interlayer distance with the N configurations of ENPCNs-T materials, a reasonable perception of the important influence of pyrrolic N on the increase of carbon interlayer distance is proposed. When applied as anode materials for SIBs, the ENPCNs-800 exhibits a remarkable capacity (294.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 ), excellent rate performance (132.8 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ), and outstanding cycle life (180.6 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 104.7%). Meanwhile, the characterizations of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate that the edge-nitrogen doping and enlarged carbon interlayer distance improve the capacity and fast charging performance of ENPCNs-800.

In this work, we develop a facile one-step gas-phase synthesis method to synthesize hierarchical integrated VP-iron phosphide-carbon (VP@FeP@C) composites with VP particles uniformly-distributed in a conductive matrix. FeP is preferentially formed from gas-phase ferrocene, which acts as nucleation catalyst to promote the growth of VP nanoparticles, then carbon coating is formed from the pyrolysis of hydrocarbon groups. Both VP and FeP contribute capacity while the throughout-distributed carbon combined with the converted Fe during sodiation builds a fast electron transport network, which not only facilitates the electrode reaction kinetics but also homogenizes the electrode current density, improving the cycling performance of VP@FeP@C electrode. When serves as anode for SIBs, the optimized VP@FeP@C electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 1082.8 mAh g−1 and maintains at 949.5 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 90 %. This facile and effective structural design provides a new way to improve the electrochemical performance of VP-based anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN) with well-ordered porous structures is a promising anode material for secondary ion batteries owing to their unique physico- and electrochemical properties. However, the practical application of these MCN in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is still limited due to their confined interlayer distance, which results in a restricted accommodation of Na ions inside the lattice. Here we report on the synthesis of highly ordered sulfur-doped MCN (S-MCN) through a hard template approach by employing dithiooxamide (DTO) as a single molecular precursor containing carbon, nitrogen and sulfur elements. The interlayer distance of carbon nitride is significantly expanded upon the introduction of larger S ions on MCN lattice, which enables high capability of Na ion accommodation. We also demonstrate through first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculation that the present S-MCN are highly optimized not only for chemical structure but also for uptaking abundant Na ions with a high adsorption energy. The specific discharge capacity of SIBs appears to be remarkably enhanced for S-MCN (304.2 mAh g-1) compared to the non-porous S-CN (167.9 mAh g-1) and g-C3N4 (5.4 mAh g-1), highlighting the pivotal roles of highly ordered mesoporous structure and S-doping in enhancing the electrochemical functionality of carbon nitride as an anode material for SIBs.",

Via one-step oriented attachment growth, a facile synthesis of Co9 Se8 nanosheets anchored on rGO matrix nanocomposites is demonstrated. As effective anode materials of SIBs, Co9 Se8 /rGO nanocomposites can deliver a highly reversible capacity of 406 mA h g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1 with long cycle stability. It can also deliver a high specific capacity of 295 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1 indicating its high rate capability. Furthermore, ex situ transmission electron microscopy observations provide insight into the reaction path of nontopotactic conversion in the hybrid anode, revealing the highly reversible conversion directly between the hybrid Co9 Se8 /rGO and Co nanoparticles/Na2 Se matrix during the sodiation/desodiation process. In addition, it is experimentally demonstrated that rGO plays significant roles in both controllable growth and electrochemical conversion processes, which can not only modulate the morphology of the product but also tune the sodium storage performance. The investigation on hybrid Co9 Se8 /rGO nanosheets as SIBs anode may shed light on designing new metal chalcogenide materials for high energy storage system.",

        "abstract": "P2‐type layered transition metal oxides are potential cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), but they commonly suffer from severe capacity degradation owing to multiple phase transitions and Na+/vacancy ordering during the extraction/insertion process. An anionic/cationic co‐doping strategy at high sodium contents is proposed to effectively achieve high‐rate and long‐term stability of P2‐Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. The resulting Na0.75Mg0.1Ni0.23Mn0.67O1.95F0.05 (NMNMOF) cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 116 mAh g−1 at 75 mA g−1 and maintains an initial capacity of 73% at 1500 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles. The Mg/F anionic/cationic co‐doping strategy impacts the local environment of the surrounding transition metal and oxygen, regulates the electron distribution, and modifies the initial diffusion state of Na sites, enhancing the diffusion ability of Na+. Moreover, the phase transition of P2‐O2 is well suppressed and the decrease in Mn3+ content greatly alleviates the Jahn–Teller effect to enhance structural stability. The full‐cell devices with NMNMOF cathode and hard carbon anode demonstrate a high capacity of 80 mAh g−1 at 10 C and an excellent cycle life of over 500 cycles for applications. The anionic/cationic co‐doping strategy will inspire the rational design of P2‐type layered oxides and provide a new perspective for advanced SIBs.",

Herein, a novel honeycomb-structured biochar with high specific area (labelled as HS X-C) was constructed through a simple and scalable method, using Xanthium sibiricum fruits as starting material with the assistance of NaCl template. The HS X-C shows a long-range-disordered but short-range-ordered microstructure. As an anode for Na-ion batteries, it exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of about 86.5%, a rate capability of 161 mAh g^−1 at 4.0 A g^−1 and a cyclability of 3000 cycles at 2.0 A g^−1. Moreover, the Na-ion full cell matched with the NVP/rGO cathode exhibits an average operating voltage of about 3.3 V and a high energy density of about 180 Wh kg^−1_(total). Kinetic studies indicate that the reaction rate of this anode is jointly controlled by diffusion and pseudocapacitance. This work not only greatly improves the sodium storage performance of the biochar from Xanthium sibiricum fruits, but also demonstrates the importance of the adopted synthesis techniques for the electrochemical performance of biochar.",

Density functional theory calculations analyze the migration pathways and energy barriers, further confirming the superior reaction kinetics of HE-Na3.45TMP. Accordingly, the HE-Na3.45TMP exhibits outstanding wide temperature applicability and can operate stably in the temperature range of -50-60 °C, accompanied by a capacity retention of 92.8% after 400 cycles at -40 °C and a capacity of 73.7 mAh g-1 even at -50 °C.

The electrochemical tests show that the (Ni0.7Co0.3)S2/3DGA electrode exhibits a capacitance of 2165 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, 2055 F g-1 at 2 A g-1, and 1478 F g-1 at 10 A g-1; preserves 78.5% capacitance retention upon 1000 cycles for pseudocapacitors; and in particular, possesses a relatively high charge capacity of 388.7 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g-1 as anode nanomaterials for sodium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the electrochemical performances are readily tuned by varying the cationic type of the tunable LDH precursors to prepare different solid-solution sulfides, such as (Ni0.7Fe0.3)S2/3DGA and (Co0.7Fe0.3)S2/3DGA.

Synergistic effects between NaCMC and NaPAA led to the formation of an effective protective film on the electrode. This coating layer not only increased the charge-discharge Coulombic efficiency, suppressing the accumulation of solid-electrolyte interphases, but also kept the SnO2 nanoparticles in the CMK-8 matrix, preventing the agglomeration and removal of oxide upon cycling. The adhesion strength and stability towards the electrolyte of the binders were evaluated.

Combining Sb with carbonaceous materials has been considered as an effective way to resolve the serious volume expansion issues. Sb/C composites mainly consist of two types, that is, Sb confined inside a carbon matrix and Sb deposited on the surface of a carbon matrix, and both have shown superior sodium storage performance. However, which structure is more beneficial for achieving high electrochemical performance is still unclear. In this work, peapod-like Sb@C and corn-like C@Sb nanotubes are synthesized via a nanoconfined galvanic replacement reaction and used as model materials for sodium storage to explore the above issue. When evaluated as anode materials for SIBs, the peapod-like Sb@C shows a higher rate capability and a significantly better long-term cycling stability than those of the corn-like C@Sb. Electrochemical analysis reveals that the peapod-like Sb@C exhibits faster Na+ and electron transport kinetics and higher proportions of surface capacitive contributions. These results demonstrate the structural superiority of the nanoconfined structure and provide valuable information for the rational design and construction of Sb-based anode materials for high-performance electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have promising applications in large-scale energy storage systems. Iron-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as potential cathodes owing to their rigid open framework, low-cost, and simple synthesis. However, it is still a challenge to increase the sodium content in the structure of PBAs and thus suppress the generation of defects in the structure. Herein, a series of isostructural PBAs samples are synthesized and the isostructural evolution of PBAs from cubic to monoclinic after modifying the conditions is witnessed. Accompanied by, the increased sodium content and crystallinity are discovered in PBAs structure. The as-obtained sodium iron hexacyanoferrate (Na1.75 Fe[Fe(CN)6 ]0.9743 ·2.76H2 O) exhibits high charge capacity of 150 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (17 mA g-1 ) and excellent rate performance (74 mAh g-1 at 50 C (8500 mA g-1 )). Moreover, their highly reversible Na+ ions intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism is verified by in situ Raman and Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) techniques. More importantly, the Na1.75 Fe[Fe(CN)6 ]0.9743 ·2.76H2 O sample can be directly assembled in a full cell with hard carbon (HC) anode and shows excellent electrochemical performances. Finally, the relationship between PBAs structure and electrochemical performance is summarized and prospected.",

        "abstract": "Antimony（Sb） has high theoretical specific capacity and moderate reaction potential, but poor cycling stability and rate performance caused by large volume expansion and sluggish reaction kinetics limit its development in alkali‐ion batteries. The construction of carbon/Sb composites can solve this problem, but the traditional single carbon composite and poor Sb/carbon interface have limited promotion. Here, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, a strategy of hierarchical double carbon composite is proposed to enhance the performance of Sb anode, and systematically reveal the lithium/sodium ions (Li+/Na+) storage mechanism of Sb in complex composite system. Sb nanoparticles (Sb NPs) are encapsulated in carbon sphere matrix with strong interfacial chemical bond to form the first level composite material, and then the highly conductive and mechanically strong graphene is used as a three‐dimensional skeleton network to connect the first level composite to form the second level composite material. The hierarchical double carbon/Sb composite exhibits excellent rate (228 mAh g−1 @ 20 A g−1) and long cycling performance (373.7 mAh g−1 @ 2 A g−1 after 2200 cycles, capacity retention of 93.1%). This work may expand structural design and interface regulation of Sb/C composites and providing theoretical guidance for metal anodes development.",

This study presents a novel approach to synthesize N-doped hard carbons via co-hydrothermal treatment of vine shoots and pig manure and subsequent thermal annealing of the resulting hydrochar. This method enhances the development of micro- and ultra-microporosity in the synthesized hard carbons, with nitrogen, and to a lesser extent phosphorus and sulfur, introduced as doping elements. Furthermore, the incorporation of hydrochloric acid during the hydrothermal step promotes biomass hydrolysis, leading to increased mesoporosity and the formation of microsphere clusters. In the realm of electrochemical performance, an investigation into various ester- and ether-based electrolytes has revealed NaPF6 in diglyme as the best formulation, thanks to its thinner and more stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Using this electrolyte, the best-performing electrode showed an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 73 %, with reversible capacities of 239, 180, 86, and 57 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively.

        "abstract": "Hard carbons are significant in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). However, the structural defects of hard carbons lead to poor rate performance and cycling stability, which need further improvement. The waste cooking oil was used as the precursor to synthesize 3D carbon nanosheets (NWCOC) with amino nitrogen functional groups, multi-layered pores, and expanded interlayer spacing. The excellent electrochemical properties of NWCOC were investigated and it was demonstrated that NWCOC can significantly improve the adsorption of Na+/K+ on hard carbons, substantially enhancing the embedding/de-embedding of Na+/K+, reducing the diffusion distance of ions and electrons, and improving their adaptability to volume changes. In situ XRD and Raman characterization reveal that the Na storage mechanism of NWCOC is mainly based on adsorption/intercalation-filling. Combined with density functional theory, it is shown that the porous structures doped with nitrogen have a greater propensity for ion adsorption, resulting in increased ion capture and storage. As expected, NWCOC650 exhibits high capacities of 489.4 and 388.3 mAh/g in SIBs and PIBs. NWCOC650 displays superior performance in the Na3V2(PO4)3/NWCOC650 full cell, achieving a capacity of 107.84 mAh/g.

Herein, a synergistic strategy of crystal-facet modulation and fluorinated interfacial engineering is proposed to achieve high capacity, superior rate capability, and long cycle stability in Na0.67Li0.24Mn0.76O2. The synthesized single-crystal Na0.67Li0.24Mn0.76O2 (NLMO{010}) featuring increased {010} active facet exposure exhibits faster anionic redox kinetics and delivers a high capacity (272.4 mAh g-1 at 10 mA g-1) with superior energy density (713.9 Wh kg-1) and rate performance (116.4 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1). Moreover, by incorporating N-Fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFBS) as electrolyte additive, the NLMO{010} cathode retains 84.6% capacity after 400 cycles at 500 mA g-1 with alleviated voltage fade (0.27 mV per cycle). Combined in situ analysis and theoretical calculations unveil dual functionality of NFBS, which results in thin yet durable fluorinated interfaces on the NLMO{010} cathode and hard carbon anode and scavenges highly reactive oxygen species. The results indicate the importance of fast-ion-transfer facet engineering and fluorinated electrolyte formulation to enhance oxygen redox-active cathode materials for high-energy-density SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Single‐layered MoS2 is a promising anode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) due to its high capacity and isotropic ion transport paths. However, the low intrinsic conductivity and easy‐agglomerated feature hamper its applications. Here, a charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy that Co2+ replaces Mo4+ in the doping form to endow MoS2 layers with negative charges, thus inducing electrostatic repulsion, together with the insertion of gaseous groups, to drive interlayer expansion which once breaks the confinement of interlayer van der Waals force, single‐layered MoS2 is obtained and uniformly dispersed into carbon matrix arising from the transformation of carbonaceous gaseous groups under high vapor pressure, is proposed. Co atom doping helps enhance the intrinsic conductivity of single‐layered MoS2. Carbon matrix effectively prevents agglomeration of single‐layered MoS2. The doped Co atoms can be fully transformed into ultrasmall Co nanoparticles during conversion reaction, which enables strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance and thus significantly boosts ion transport and storage. Consequently, the prepared material delivers superb Li/Na/K‐ion storage performances, which are best in the reported MoS2‐based anodes. The proposed charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy provides a novel perspective for preparing single‐layered MoS2, which shows huge potential for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is the most ideal commercial anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The current research has made significant advances in the structural design of HC. However, the overall performance of SIBs is also contingent upon the properties of the anode interfacial layer. Therefore, it is essential to consider both the intrinsic structure and the development of the interfacial layer during the cycling of the hard carbon anode. Herein, we successfully synthesized chitosan-derived HC for high-rate and high-capacity SIBs through leveraging the regulatory effect of Zn on the carbon layer structure during the carbonization process, as well as the inducement of a stable SEI by residual Zn during battery cycling. Benefiting from the expanded interlayer spacing, the micropores formed by partial Zn evaporation at high temperatures and the high pyridinic-N content induced by the Zn-doped, it provides more channels for sodium-ion diffusion, lowering the diffusion barrier and offers a large specific capacity. Meanwhile, we confirmed that the Zn-doped adjusts the composition and structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), improved transfer kinetics. As a result, the optimized HC exhibits high specific capacity (390 mAh g−1) and excellent rate performance (162 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1). This work provides a new perspectives on the modification of HC anodes to enhance sodium storage performance and further understanding for the regulation of HC by the Zn-doped.",

Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations demonstrate F-doped NTPs' own outstanding electrochemical properties, which is due to the enhanced intrinsic ionic/electronic conductivity. The results show that anion doping is an efficient way to make high-performance NTP anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard Carbon have become the most promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries, but the poor rate performance and cycle life remain key issues. In this work, N-doped hard carbon with abundant defects and expanded interlayer spacing is constructed by using carboxymethyl cellulose sodium as precursor with the assistance of graphitic carbon nitride. The formation of N-doped nanosheet structure is realized by the CN• or CC• radicals generated through the conversion of nitrile intermediates in the pyrolysis process. This greatly enhances the rate capability (192.8 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 ) and ultra-long cycle stability (233.3 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 ). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis in combination with comprehensive electrochemical characterizations, reveal that the interlayer insertion coordinated quasi-metallic sodium storage in the low potential plateau region and adsorption storage in the high potential sloping region. The first-principles density functional theory calculations further demonstrate strong coordination effect on nitrogen defect sites to capture sodium, especially with pyrrolic N, uncovering the formation mechanism of quasi-metallic bond in the sodium storage. This work provides new insights into the sodium storage mechanism of high-performance carbonaceous materials, and offers new opportunities for better design of hard carbon anode.",

Herein, reduced graphene oxide-wrapped FeS_2 (FeS_2/rGO) composite was fabricated to achieve excellent electrochemical performance via a facile two-step method. The introduction of rGO effectively improved the conductivity, BET surface area, and structural stability of the FeS_2 active material, thus endowing it with high specific capacity, good rate capability, as well as excellent cycling stability. Electrochemical measurements show that the FeS_2/rGO composite had a high initial discharge capacity of 1263.2 mAh g^−1 at 100 mA g^−1 and a high discharge capacity of 344 mAh g^−1 at 10 A g^−1, demonstrating superior rate performance.

To address these issues, we report a unique 3D porous self-standing foam electrode built from core-shelled Sb@In2O3 nanostructures via a continuous electrodepositing strategy coupled with surface chemical passivation. Such a hierarchical structure possesses a robust framework with rich voids and a dense protection layer (In2O3), which allow Sb nanoparticles to well accommodate their mechanical strain for efficiently avoiding electrode cracks and pulverization with stable electrode/electrolyte interphase upon sodiation/de-sodiation processes.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be ideal alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in the future due to their abundant and low-cost resource advantages. A key challenge in SIBs is the development of anodes capable of insertion/extraction of sodium ions (Na+) with large radii. Here, hollow bowl-shaped porous carbon materials are uniformly modified with vertically grown graphene (denoted as HBC/VGSs) demonstrating a large specific surface area and three-dimensional structure, which are employed as a viable high-performance anode for SIBs. HBC/VGSs anodes are highly effective at storing sodium because of their structural features. As a result, the HBC/VGSs electrodes provide a high reversible capacity of 409 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, as well as outstanding rate capability (301.6 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). Moreover, it also shows extraordinary cycling stability (230.3 mAh g−1 after 2500 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1) that is significantly better than the pristine hollow bowl-shaped porous carbon (HBC). Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) were used to analyze the pseudocapacitance and sodium storage kinetics. It was found that high electrical conductivity and large surface area can improve Na+ adsorption and diffusion, enhance the electronic conductivity, and deliver superior capacity and rate. The results, taken as a whole, provide new insight into the creation of long-lasting carbon anodes that deliver optimal performance in SIBs.",

CuFe2S3 exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with a capacity retention of 422 mA h g-1 for more than 1000 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 A g-1 (0.85 C). The complex reaction mechanism of the first cycle was investigated via PXRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. At the early stages of Na uptake, CuFe2S3 is converted to form crystalline CuFeS2 and nanocrystalline NaFe1.5S2 simultaneously. By increasing the Na content, Cu+ is reduced to nanocrystalline Cu, followed by the reduction of Fe2+ to amorphous Fe0 while reflections of nanocrystalline Na2S appear. During charging up to -5 Na/f.u., the intermediate NaFe1.5S2 appears again, which transforms in the last step of charging to a new unknown phase. This unknown phase together with NaFe1.5S2 plays a key role in the mechanism for the following cycles, evidenced by the PXRD investigation of the second cycle. Even after 400 cycles, the occurrence of nanocrystalline phases made it possible to gain insights into the alteration of the mechanism, which shows that CuxS phases play an important role in the region of constant specific capacity.",

In this work, we present the preparation of molybdenum dioxide/molybdenum disulfide@nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (MoO2/MoS2@NC) via air-thermal activation.

Moreover, in SIBs, the reversible specific capacity remaining is 246 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 600 mA g−1, which is indicative of a minimal capacity decrease of 0.4 mAh/g per cycle. Furthermore, comprehensive investigations were conducted on full cells comprising LIBs (MoO2/MoS2@NC-15//LiFePO4) and SIBs (MoO2/MoS2@NC-15//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2), demonstrating their high specific capacities and excellent cycling performance.

However, the regulation and design of advanced sodium storage structures are limited by their diverse and complex microstructures. Herein, diammonium phosphate (DAP) as a cross-linking agent for corn starch and modification of the physicochemical properties of the starch surface can effectively promote the regulation and balance between the pore structure and interlayer spacing of the constructed HC. The electrochemical performance of modified HC generally outperformed that of unmodified HC samples. Specifically, the optimized HC-10 achieved an improved reversible capacity (344.16 mAh g-1 at 0.03 A g-1), optimal rate capability (134.73 mAh g-1 at 0.3 A g-1), and enduring cycle life (capacity retention of 98.5% after 500 cycles at 0.3 A g-1). The superior performance of HC-10 originated from the optimal modification operation of DAP for corn starch, resulting in a balance between the formation of disordered phases and pore structures. On the one hand, the DAP facilitates the growth of the carbon layers during pyrolysis and affects the microinterlayer structure of HC, while it also accelerates the decomposition of the precursor as a catalyst and releases gas phase products, which further modulate the defects and pore structures of HC.

However, they suffer from the detrimental P2 → O2 phase transition induced by the O2−−O2− electrostatic repulsion upon high‐voltage charge, which leads to rapid capacity fade. Herein, we construct a P2‐type Ni–Mn‐based layered oxide cathode with a core‐shell structure (labeled as NM–Mg–CS). The P2‐Na0.67[Ni0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NM) core is enclosed by the robust P2‐Na0.67[Ni0.21Mn0.71Mg0.08]O2 (NM–Mg) shell. The NM–Mg–CS exhibits the phase‐transition‐free character with mitigated volume change because the confinement effect of shell is conductive to inhibit the irreversible phase transition of the core material. As a result, it drives a high capacity retention of 81% after 1000 cycles at 5 C with an initial capacity of 78 mA h/g. And the full cell with the NM–Mg–CS cathode and hard carbon anode delivers stable capacities over 250 cycles. The successful construction of the core‐shell structure in P2‐type layered oxides sheds light on the development of high‐capacity and long‐life cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "A great concern exists about the lifetime, cost, low-temperature performance, and safety of Li-ion batteries. Na-ion batteries (NIB) are an alternative to the Li-ion batteries due to the wide availability of sodium, its low cost, and nontoxicity. Here, we examined the Na and Na^+ adsorption on nanosheets of carbon (graphene), AlN, BN, and SiC to explore their potential use as an anode in NIBs. The interaction of atomic Na was found to play the main role in producing different nanosheet cell voltages. Unlike the graphene and SiC nanosheets, the lone pairs on the surface of the AlN and BN nanosheets hinder the Na adsorption and significantly increase the cell voltage. The order of magnitude of the nanosheet cell voltage as an anode in NIBs is as follows: AlN (1.49 V) > BN (1.46 V) > > C (0.69 V) > SiC (0.61 V). The AlN and BN nanosheets may be appropriate compounds for NIBs and their cell voltages are comparable with carbon nanotubes.",

        "abstract": "As a competitive anode material for sodium-ion batteries, a commercially available red phosphorus, featured with a high theoretical capacity (2596 mAh g-1) and a suitable operative voltage plateau (0.1~0.6 V), has confronted with a severe structural instability and a rapid capacity degradation upon the large volumetric change. In particular, the fundamental determining factors for phosphorus anode materials are yet poorly understood, and their interfacial stability against the ambient air has not been explored and clarified. Herein, a high-performance phosphorus/carbon anode material has simply been fabricated through ball-milling the carbon black and red phosphorus, delivering a high reversible capacity of 1070 mAh g-1 at 400 mA g-1 after 200 cycles and a superior rate capability of 479 mAh g-1 at 3200 mA g-1. More importantly, we firstly reveal the significance of inhibiting phosphorus/carbon electrode materials from exposing to air, even for a short period, on achieving a good electrochemical performance, which would sharply decrease the reversible capacities. With the assistance of synchrotron-based X-ray techniques, the formation and accumulation of insulating phosphate compounds can be spectroscopically identified, leading to the decay of electrochemical performance. At the same time, these passivation layers on the surface of electrode were found to occur via a self-oxidation process in ambient air. To maintain the electrochemical advantages of phosphorus anodes, it is necessary to inhibit their contact to air through a rational coating or an optimal storage condition. Additionally, the employment of a FEC (fluorinated ethylene carbonate) additive facilitates the decomposition of electrolyte and favors the formation of a robust solid electrolyte interphase layer, which may suppress the side reactions between the active Na-P compounds and electrolyte. These findings could enlighten the surface protection and interfacial stability of phosphorus anodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",

However, their significant volume expansion and slow ion migration rate result in poor cycling stability and suboptimal rate performance. To address these issues, the present work utilized multivalent iron ions to construct fast pathways similar to superionic conductors (Fe-SSC) and introduced corresponding selenium vacancies to enhance its performance. Based on first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the addition of iron ions and the presence of selenium vacancies reduced the material's work function and adsorption energy, lowered migration barriers, and enhances the migration rate of Li+ and Na+. In Li-ion half batteries, this composite material exhibites reversible capacity of 1048.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and 483.6 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Layered Na2FePO4F (NFPF) cathode material has received widespread attention due to its green nontoxicity, abundant raw materials, and low cost. However, its poor inherent electronic conductivity and sluggish sodium ion transportation seriously impede its capacity delivery and cycling stability. In this work, NFPF by Ti doping and conformal carbon layer coating via solid-state reaction is modified. The results of experimental study and density functional theory calculations reveal that Ti doping enhances intrinsic conductivity, accelerates Na-ion transport, and generates more Na-ion storage sites, and pyrolytic carbon from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) uniformly coated on the NFPF surface improves the surface/interface conductivity and suppresses the side reactions. Under the combined effect of Ti doping and carbon coating, the optimized NFPF (marked as 5T-NF@C) exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, with a high capacity of 108.4 mAh g-1 at 0.2C, a considerable capacity of 80.0 mAh g-1 even at high current density of 10C, and a high capacity retention rate of 81.8% after 2000 cycles at 10C. When assembled into a full cell with a hard carbon anode, 5T-NF@C also show good applicability. This work indicates that co-modification of Ti doping and carbon coating makes NFPF achieve high rate and long cycle performance for sodium-ion batteries.",

Such structure can not only facilitate charge transfer, but also ensure the structural stability of SnSe2@C electrode. In addition, carbon shell also helped to the dispersion of SnSe2 nanoparticles, thus offering more redox active sites for Na+ storage.

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) emerge as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), heralding a new era of energy storage solutions. Despite their potential, the mechanisms underlying their performance enhancement and susceptibility to failure in ether‐based electrolytes remain elusive. This study delves into these aspects, employing CoS2 electrodes as a case in point to elucidate the phenomena. The investigation reveals that CoS2 undergoes a unique irreversible and progressive solid–liquid–solid phase transition from its native state to sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), and ultimately to a Cu1.8S/Co composite, accompanied by a gradual morphological transformation from microspheres to a stable 3D porous architecture. This reconstructed 3D porous structure is pivotal for its exceptional Na+ diffusion kinetics and resilience to cycling‐induced stress, being the main reason for ultrastable cycling and ultrahigh rate capability. Nonetheless, the CoS2 electrode suffers from an inevitable cycle life termination due to the microshort‐circuit induced by Na metal corrosion and separator degradation. Through a comparative analysis of various TMCs, a predictive framework linking electrode longevity is established to electrode potential and Gibbs free energy. Finally, the cell failure issue is significantly mitigated at a material level (graphene encapsulation) and cell level (polypropylene membrane incorporation) by alleviating the NaPSs shuttling and microshort‐circuit.",

        "abstract": "The plateau-type sodium titanate with suitable sodiation potential is a promising anode candidate for high safe and high energy density of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the poor initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and cyclic instability of sodium titanate are attributed to the unstable interfacial structure along with the decomposition of electrolytes, resulting in the continuous formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. To address this issue, a chemical grafting method is developed to fabricate a highly stable interface layer of inert Al2O3 on the sodium titanate anode, rendering the high ICE and excellent cycling stability. Based on theoretical calculations, NaPF6 are more likely adsorption on the Al2O3 surface and produce sodium fluoride. The formation of a thin and dense SEI film with rich sodium fluoride achieves the low interfacial resistances and charge-transfer resistances. Benefitting from our design, the obtained sodium titanate exhibits a high ICE from 67.7% to 79.4% and an enhanced reversible capacity from 151 mAh g-1 to 181 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, along with an increase in capacity retention from 56.5% to 80.6% after 500 cycles.

However, the design and fabrication of high-performance ferric vanadate-based SIB anode materials with unique composite nanostructures are still challenging. Herein, a facile self-template method is reported to synthesize 1D nanostructured Fe3C@N-doped C/FeVO4 (Fe3C@NC/FeVO4) anode materials by the combination of morphology regulation with hybrid composite construction, for the first time. To this end, a 1D Fe, N-doped carbon nanotube (FeNC) is used as a template, followed by etching and re-growth to obtain the 1D Fe3C@N-doped C/FeVO4 nanostructure. The introduction of Fe3C can improve its electronic conductivity and enhance capacitive behavior. Additionally, the 1D nanostructure can effectively shorten the ions transport path and alleviate volume expansion during the charge-discharge processes. With these advantages, the SIBs using such anodes show a remarkable rate performance with a capacity of 325.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, 150.6 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1, and excellent cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 139.6 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1500 cycles.

Nanoplatelets of Co3O4 can be easily mixed with carbon nanotubes to create nanocomposite anodes, which can be used for Li-ion and Na-ion battery anodes without any additional binder or conductive additive.

        "abstract": "Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries are extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes is demonstrated; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4−) and metal sulfides yields non‐conductive and unstable solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile, corrosively turns metal sulfides into less‐active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. It is shown that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides’ cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The abundance of sodium resources has recently motivated the investigation of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) as an alternative to commercial lithium ion batteries. However, the low power and low capacity of conventional sodium anodes hinder their practical realization. Although most research has concentrated on the development of high-capacity sodium anodes, anodes with a combination of high power and high capacity have not been widely realized. Herein, we present a simple microwave irradiation technique for obtaining few-layered, ultrathin two-dimensional SnS2 over graphene sheets in a few minutes. SnS2 possesses a large number of active surface sites and exhibits high-capacity, rapid sodium ion storage kinetics induced by quick, nondestructive pseudocapacitance. Enhanced sodium ion storage at a high current density (12 A g-1), accompanied by high reversibility and high stability, was demonstrated. Additionally, a rationally designed sodium ion full cell coupled with SnS2//Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibited exceptional performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency (99%), high capacity, high stability, and a retention of ∼53% of the initial capacity even after the current density was increased by a factor of 140. In addition, a high specific energy of ∼140 Wh kg-1 and an ultrahigh specific power of ∼8.3 kW kg-1 (based on the mass of both the anode and cathode) were observed. Because of its outstanding performance and rapid synthesis, few-layered SnS2 could be a promising candidate for practical realization of high-power SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐based dual ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered significant attention as novel energy storage devices offering the advantages of high‐voltage and low‐cost. Nonetheless, conventional electrolytes exhibit low resistance to oxidation and poor compatibility with electrode materials, resulting in rapid battery failure. In this study, for the first time, a chlorination design of electrolytes for SDIB, is proposed. Using ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as a representative, chlorine (Cl)‐substituted EMC not only demonstrates increased oxidative stability ascribed to the electron‐withdrawing characteristics of chlorine atom, electrolyte compatibility with both the cathode and anode is also greatly improved by forming Cl‐containing interface layers. Consequently, a discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g−1 within a voltage range of 3.0–5.0 V is achieved for Na||graphite SDIB that employs a high graphite cathode mass loading of 5.0 mg cm−2, along with almost no capacity decay after 900 cycles. Notably, the Na||graphite SDIB can be revived for an additional 900 cycles through the replacement of a fresh Na anode. As the mass loading of graphite cathode increased to 10 mg cm−2, Na||graphite SDIB is still capable of sustaining over 700 times with ≈100% capacity retention. These results mark the best outcome among reported SDIBs. This study corroborates the effectiveness of chlorination design in developing high‐voltage electrolytes and attaining enduring cycle stability of Na‐based energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials have been extensively investigated as promising negative electrode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries. However, most common carbon materials always suffer from limitations in regards to high reversible capacity and long-term cycling stability because of their low theoretical specific capacities and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we report a facile MOF-derived strategy for the synthesis of nitrogen/oxygen co-doped porous carbon polyhedra (NOPCP) with abundant channel-connected cavities with their inner surface decorated with a large number of N and O atoms, which can provide a large number of active sites (defects and edge doping sites) for the sorption of Li+/Na+. These cavities can also be considered as \"ponds\" where the electrolyte is stored, which shortens the diffusion distance of ions during the discharge/charge process. When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, NOPCP-600 delivers a high reversible capacity of 1663 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 120 cycles and superior cycling stability with a capacity of 667 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1. For SIBs, NOPCP-600 delivers a high reversible capacity of 313 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and an excellent long-term cycling stability of 228 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 2000 cycles.",

The NCNFs-IWNC features favorable properties, including a conductive 1D interconnected porous structure, a large specific surface area, expanded interlayer graphite-like spacing, enriched N-doped defects and active sites, toward rapid access and transport of electrolyte and electron/sodium ions. Systematic electrochemical studies indicate that the NCNFs-IWNC exhibits an impressively high rate capability, delivering a capacity of 148 mA h g-1 at current density of as high as 10 A g-1 , and has an attractively stable performance over 5000 cycles. The practical application of the as-designed NCNFs-IWNC for a full SIBs cell is further verified by coupling the NCNFs-IWNC anode with a FeFe(CN)6 cathode, which displays a desirable cycle performance, maintaining acapacity of 97 mA h g-1 over 100 cycles.",

Nevertheless, iron sulfides generally exhibit unsatisfied electrochemical performance induced by sluggish electron/ion transfer and severe pulverization upon the sodiation/desodiation process. Herein, we constructed a yolk-shell FeS@NC nanosphere with an N-doped carbon shell and FeS particle core via a simple hydrothermal method, followed by in-situ polymerization and vulcanization. The FeS particles intimately coupled with N-doped carbon can accelerate the electron transfer, avoid severe volume expansion, and maintain structural stability upon repeated sodiation/desodiation process. Furthermore, the small particle size of FeS can shorten ion-diffusion distance and facilitate ion transportation. Therefore, the FeS@NC nanosphere shows excellent cycling performance and superior rate capability that it can deliver a high capacity of 520.1 mAh g−1 over 800 cycles at 2.0 A g−1 and a remarkable capacity of 625.9 mAh g−1 at 10.0 A g−1.",

By engineering the morphology and crystallinity of nanochanneled niobium oxides (NCNOs), the kinetic behavior and charge storage mechanism of Nb2O5 electrodes were investigated. Amorphous and crystalline NCNO samples were made by modulating anodization conditions (20–40 V and 140–180 °C) to synthesize nanostructures of varying pore sizes and wall thicknesses with identical chemical composition. The electrochemical energy storage properties of the NCNOs were studied, with the amorphous samples showing better overall rate performance than the crystalline samples. The enhanced rate performance of the amorphous samples is attributed to the higher capacitive contributions and Na-ion diffusivity analyzed from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). It was found that the amorphous samples with smaller wall thicknesses facilitated improved kinetics. Among samples with similar pore size and wall thickness, the difference in their power performance stems from the crystallinity effect, which plays a more significant role in the resulting kinetics of the materials for Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "SnSe2 has attracted great attention due to its unique 2D-layered structure, which makes it capable of sodium ion storage and higher theoretical capacities compared to traditional anode materials like hard carbon for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, SnSe2-based materials will cause structural damage due to volume expansion during ion storage, leading to poor cycle stability and rate capacity. In this work, Co-doped SnSe2 (Co-SnSe2) with preferred crystal orientation was fabricated by a one-step solvothermal method. It has been found that after doping Co, the lower (001) crystal plane located at 14.4° replaced the higher (101) plane at 30.7° as the dominant crystal plane in Co-SnSe2, which significantly promoted ion diffusion and enhanced the pseudocapacitance behavior. Therefore, this Co-SnSe2 anode achieves a high capacity of 504 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1, and a high-rate cycle stability, delivering a reversible capacity of 302 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 1800 cycles with a retained capacity rate of 94%. Moreover, the Na3V2(PO4)3||Co-SnSe2 full cell exhibits a stable cycle performance of over 300 cycles at 1 A g-1, demonstrating great promise for practical applications.

Despite intensive efforts in traditional calcination methods, synthesizing high‐quality nanomaterials while maintaining ultrafine and homogeneous nanostructure under high temperature remains a key challenge. Herein, a one‐step small molecule‐assisted thermal radiation (MTR) method that fabricates ultrafine Sb nanoparticles with uniform dispersion across heteroatom‐doped carbon supports (Super‐Sb) is reported. This MTR method features the nonequilibrium synthetic conditions induced by ultrafast heating/cooling rate. Additionally, in situ, high‐temperature synchrotron X‐ray diffraction (SXRD) characterization of the MTR synthetic process demonstrates that the formation and stabilization of ultrasmall Sb nanoparticles can be ascribed to the simultaneous thermolysis of small‐molecule additives into defect‐rich carbon nanosheets. The as‐obtained Super‐Sb nanocomposite exhibits superior sodium‐ion storage performance in terms of ultralong cycling stability of 15 000 cycles at 20.0 A g−1 and ultrahigh rate capability of 152.8 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1.

Herein, we present a computational design that explores the potential of graphullerene, a two-dimensional framework with interconnected fullerene moieties, for the reversible storage of Na-ions. A unique aspect of this design is the electron injection capacity into the graphullerene anode, reaching 15 electrons per fullerene moiety, which is the highest limit to date. This advancement enables large-scale Na-ion storage up to the stoichiometry of NaC2, exhibiting specific capacity of 551 mAhg-1 and averaged open circuit voltage of 0.18 V vs Na/Na+. In addition, the multilayered arrangement of stored Na-ions enhances the Na-ion diffusivity on the graphullerene surface, leading to rapid insertion and extraction kinetics. Thus, raising the electron injection limit offers a promising strategy to transform carbon-based anodes into suitable candidates for reversible Na-ion storage, without relying on artificial defect introduction or doping.",

However, commercialization of SIBs has been hampered by their fading efficiency due to the sodium consumed in the formation of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) when using hard carbon (HC) anodes. Herein, Na2C3O5 sodium salt is introduced as a highly efficient, cost-effective, and safe cathode sodiation additive. This sustainable sodium salt has an oxidation potential of ∼4.0 V vs Na+/Na°, so it could be practically implemented into SIBs. Moreover, for the first time, we have also revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that in addition to the compensating Na+ ions spent in the SEI layer, the high specific capacity and capacity retention observed from electrochemical measurements are due to the formation of a thinner and more stable cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the P2-Na2/3Mn0.8Fe0.1Ti0.1O2 while using such a cathode sodiation additive. Half-cell studies with P2-Na2/3Mn0.8Fe0.1Ti0.1O2 cathodes show a 27% increase in the specific capacity (164 mAh gP2-1) with cathode sodiation additives. Full-cell studies with the HC anode show a 4 times increase in the specific capacity of P2-Na2/3Mn0.8Fe0.1Ti0.1O2.

The high porosity (1599 m2/g), rich functional groups (O = 8.10%, N = 0.95%), and well-connected nanoporous network resulting from sonochemical activation, remarkably increased specific capacity, surface wettability, and electrode stability, consequently improved electrochemical performance. Benefiting from its suitable microstructure, PHC-1 possesses superior specific capacity (330 mAh/g at 20 mA/g), good capacity retention (89.5%), and excellent structural stability over 500 sodiation/desodiation cycles at high current density (1000 mA/g). Apart from modus operandi comparison, the two activation methods also provide mechanistic insights as the low-voltage plateau region and graphitic layers decrease simultaneously. This work suggests a scalable and economical approach for synthesizing large-scale activated porous carbons that are used in various applications, be it energy storage, water purification, or gas storage, to name a few.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal, benefiting from its high theoretical capacity and natural abundance, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium‐metal batteries (SMBs). Unfortunately, the uncontrollable sodium dendrites formation caused from the sluggish ion‐transport kinetics and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interlayer induces a low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Constructing an artificial SEI interlayer with high ionic conductivity, stability, and mechanical toughness is an effective strategy for Na‐metal anode, yet it still presents major challenge for high current density and long cycling life. Herein, an artificial SEI interlayer composed of Na–Sn alloy, Sn, and Na2Te (denoted as NST) is designed via in‐situ conversion/alloying reaction of tin telluride (SnTe) with Na. Such artificial interlayer possesses rapid Na+‐transport kinetics and high Young's modulus (5.3 GPa), benefitting to even Na plating/stripping and suppressing Na dendrite growth. Owing to these merits, the symmetrical Na/NST cell presents an ultralong cycle life span over 1390 h with a small voltage hysteresis at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2. And the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)||Na/NST full cell exhibits a prolonged life of 1000 cycles with a high‐capacity retention of 88% at 5C. Herein, a promising strategy is provided to construct a high‐performance artificial interlayer for SMBs.",

        "abstract": "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C‒S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 Å for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g‒1. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Sn-based materials have been popularly researched as anodes for energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and unsatisfied cycling stability caused by poor conductivity and dramatic volume expansion are still pivotal barriers for the development of Sn-based materials as anodes. In this work, the binary-metal Mn2SnO4 nanoparticles and Sn encapsulated in N-doped carbon (Sn@Mn2SnO4-NC) were fabricated by multistep reactions and employed as the anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The coexistence of binary metals (Sn and Mn) can improve intrinsic conductivity. Simultaneously, hollow architecture along with carbon relieves internal stress and prevents structural collapse. A Sn@Mn2SnO4-NC anode delivers an appealing capacity of 1039.5 mAh g-1 for 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and 823.8 mAh g-1 for 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 in LIBs. When evaluated as an anode in SIBs, the Sn@Mn2SnO4-NC anode tolerates up to 7000 cycles at 2000 mA g-1 and maintains a capacity of 185.8 mAh g-1. Quantified kinetic investigations demonstrate the high contribution of pseudocapacitive effects during the cycle process. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations further verify that introduction of the second metal (Mn) improves the conductivity of the material, which is favorable for charge transport. This work is expected to provide a feasible preparation strategy for binary-metal materials to enhance the performance of lithium- and sodium-ion batteries.",

Among varying sodium storage anode materials for SIBs, nonstoichiometric Cu2-xSe exhibits significant promise. This material stands out due to its ultrahigh electrical conductivity and theoretical sodium storage capacity. However, the practical implementation of Cu2-xSe-based anodes in SIBs is significantly impeded by their sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and severe pulverization during the repeated charge–discharge cycles. In the current research, we introduce a novel and straightforward methodology for the synthesis of a heterostructured SIBs anode material (Cu2-xSe@Ti3C2Tx), by coupling Cu2-xSe nanoparticles with two-dimensional (2D) layered MXene (Ti3C2Tx). The 2D layered Ti3C2Tx can provide abundant fast Na+ transport pathways, which effectively promote the ion transport kinetics in the composite anode. Moreover, the pulverization of Cu2-xSe can be effectively mitigated due to the interlamellar spatial confinement of the 2D layered MXene matrix. Consequently, the electrochemical performances of the Cu2-xSe-based anode are significantly improved. Concretely, the Cu2-xSe@Ti3C2Tx anodes demonstrate remarkable rate performance (248mAh g−1 at 10.0 A/g), along with commendable cycling stability, exhibiting a capacity retention of 92 % at 5.0 A/g after 750 cycles. A comprehensive assessment of the Cu2-xSe@Ti3C2Tx anode has been conducted by assembling a full SIB alongside a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode. This comprehensive study underscores the significant potential of Cu2-xSe-based composite materials, positioning it as a promising candidate for future advancements in SIB technology.",

Therefore, it is crucial to develop stable anode materials with high specific capacity. SnO_2 was coated with Zn/Co-zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) by using the solvothermal method to obtain SnO_2@Zn/Co-ZIFs. Then, Sn@Zn/Co-NPC (N-doped porous carbon) was obtained through heat treatment in an inert atmosphere. In this material, Sn provides a higher capacity, while Zn/Co-NPC not only can provide part of the capacity and increase the conductivity of the material, but also helps alleviate the volume expansion of Sn during the charge and discharge process. Therefore, the effect of the amount of Sn on the electrochemical properties of the materials was investigated by varying the addition of SnO_2. The results show that the 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material retains a discharge specific capacity of 334.90 mAh g^−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g^−1 current density. After 200 cycles at 500 mA g^−1 current density, 50Sn@Zn/Co-NPC electrode material still has 275.80 mAh g^−1 discharge specific capacity.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), as the next-generation high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices, have attracted widespread attention due to their cost-effectiveness and wide geographical distribution of sodium. As a crucial component of the structure of SIBs, the anode material plays a crucial role in determining its electrochemical performance. Significantly, metal phosphide exhibits remarkable application prospects as an anode material for SIBs because of its low redox potential and high theoretical capacity. However, due to volume expansion limitations and other factors, the rate and cycling performance of metal phosphides have gradually declined. To address these challenges, various viable solutions have been explored. In this paper, the recent research progress of metal phosphide materials for SIBs is systematically reviewed, including the synthesis strategy of metal phosphide, the storage mechanism of sodium ions, and the application of metal phosphide in electrochemical aspects. In addition, future challenges and opportunities based on current developments are presented.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides (TMS) have gained significant attention as potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and abundance in nature. Nevertheless, their practical use has been impeded by challenges such as large volume changes, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE). To address these issues and achieve both long-term cycling stability and high ICE simultaneously, we present a novel approach involving surface engineering, termed as the “dual-polar confinement” strategy, combined with interface engineering to enhance the electrochemical performance of TMS. In this approach, CoS crystals are meticulously coated with polar TiO2 and embedded within a polar S-doped carbon matrix, forming a composite electrode denoted as CoS/TiO2-SC. Significantly, an ether-based electrolyte with chemical stability and optimized solvation properties synergistically interacts with the Co–S–C bonds to create a stable, ultra-thin SEI. This concerted effect results in a notably high ICE, reaching approximately 96%. Advanced characterization and theoretical simulations confirm that the uniform surface modification effectively facilitates sodium ion transport kinetics, restrains electrode pulverization, and concurrently enhances interaction with the ether-based electrolyte to establish a robust SEI. Consequently, the CoS/TiO2-SC electrode exhibits high reversible capacity, superior rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "The fast-charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I-PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)-ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li-ion desolvation process to realize high-performance fast-charging Li-ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I-PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI-rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self-induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6- not only promote the Li-ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast-charging conditions. Consequently, the I-PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5 mA h g-1 (39% of capacity at 0.5 A g-1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000 cycles at 20 A g-1. The I-PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast-charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000 cycles at extremely high rates of 5 C and 10 C (1 C = 180 mA g-1).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer promising advantages over lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to sodium's abundance and lower cost. However, challenges like thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers and the larger radius of sodium (1.02 Å vs. 0.76 Å for lithium) make graphite, the most common LIB anode, unsuitable for SIBs. To realize the maximum potential of carbon anode for SIBs, one of the main strategies is to fabricate carbon materials with tailored microstructures and to enhance redox reactivity by incorporating catalytic metals. In this work, the Fe-Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in worm-like graphitic carbon (Fe-Fe3C@GC) were synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition. This hybrid structure promotes the catalytic activity to achieve additional capacities through the reversible SEI layer formation, in detail, by the reversible interconversion of ester and ether derivatives as well as conductivity enhancement. Furthermore, in situ formed Fe2O3 from Fe(0) contributed extra capacity. The Fe-Fe3C@GC showed a large reversible discharge capacity of 376.2 mAh g-1 with a fading rate of 0.013% per cycle after 1000 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are in the spotlight as viable alternatives to lithium-ion batteries in stationary storage and power grid applications. Among possible anode materials, Sb is one of the interesting candidates due to a combination of battery-type potential plateaus in the charge-discharge profiles, high capacity (theoretical capacity of 660 mAh g-1), and demonstrated good cyclic stability. The influence of Sb particle size (particularly at the nanoscale range) and the composition of Sb-carbon composites on the electrode performance, stability, and charge storage mechanism is systematically evaluated here for the first time. A range of Sb-carbon nanocomposites with varied Sb particle size (between 50 and ∼1 nm) are studied. The control of the particle size is achieved via varying the carbon and Sb weight ratio in the precursors. The shape of charge-discharge profiles, hysteresis, and the difference in cyclic stabilities and rate performance are analyzed. The nanocomposite with the smallest particle size (∼1 nm) and the largest carbon content provides the most stable cyclic behavior and a better rate capability but suffers from an increased hysteresis between charge and discharge curves. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that the storage mechanism in the Sb-carbon nanocomposites containing Sb nanoparticles is different from the electrodes with bulkier, micron-sized Sb particles, and the electrochemical reaction proceeds through a number of crystalline intermediates.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) still suffer from poor initial coulombic efficiency and an ambiguous Na+ storage mechanism. Here, we proposed a novel phosphorus-doped torreya shell-derived hard carbon (P-TSHC) as an anode for SIBs via a feasible two-step carbonization technique. Effects of P contents in hard carbon on porous structure, plane d-spacing, and electrochemical properties were investigated. In particular, P-TSHC15 exhibits the most excellent electrochemical performance with a superior rate capability up to 8 A g−1 and an ultra-low capacity decay rate of 0.075 % per cycle within 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1\n                     . This should be mainly attributed to P-doping, which expands the interlayer spacing for better Na+ accommodation in mesoporous filling mechanism, generates more defects and specific surface areas, and provides transport channels for Na+, thereby increasing the low-voltage plateau capacity. This work will provide a route for further property optimization of biomass hard carbon for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Both sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) are considered as promising candidates in grid‐level energy storage devices. Unfortunately, the larger ionic radii of K+ and Na+ induce poor diffusion kinetics and cycling stability of carbon anode materials. Pore structure regulation is an ideal strategy to promote the diffusion kinetics and cyclic stability of carbon materials by facilitating electrolyte infiltration, increasing the transport channels, and alleviating the volume change. However, traditional pore‐forming agent‐assisted methods considerably increase the difficulty of synthesis and limit practical applications of porous carbon materials. Herein, porous carbon materials (Ca‐PC/Na‐PC/K‐PC) with different pore structures have been prepared with gluconates as the precursors, and the amorphous structure, abundant micropores, and oxygen‐doping active sites endow the Ca‐PC anode with excellent potassium and sodium storage performance. For PIBs, the capacitive contribution ratio of Ca‐PC is 82% at 5.0 mV s−1 due to the introduction of micropores and high oxygen‐doping content, while a high reversible capacity of 121.4 mAh g−1 can be reached at 5 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. For SIBs, stable sodium storage capacity of 101.4 mAh g−1 can be achieved at 2 A g−1 after 8000 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.65% for per cycle. This work may provide an avenue for the application of porous carbon materials in the energy storage field.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum sulfide has been widely investigated as a prospective anode material for Li+/Na+ storage because of its unique layered structure and high theoretical capacity.

Herein, a high-temperature mixing method is implemented in the hydrothermal process to synthesize the hybrid structure of MoS2/V2O3@carbon-graphene (MoS2/V2O3@C-rGO). The MoS2/V2O3@C-rGO composites exhibit superior Li+/Na+ storage performance due to the construction of the interface between the MoS2 and V2O3 components and the introduction of carbon materials, delivering a prominent reversible capacity of 564 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 600 cycles for lithium-ion batteries and 376.3 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 450 cycles for sodium-ion batteries. Theoretical calculations confirm that the construction of the interface between the MoS2 and V2O3 components can accelerate the reaction kinetics and enhance the charge-ionic transport of molybdenum sulfide. The results illustrate that interfacial engineering may be an effective guide to obtain high-performance electrode materials for Li+/Na+ storage.",

SnS2 flakes in a size range of 50–100 nm are uniformly grown on the graphene sheet, the CS covalent bonding demonstrates a tight connection between the active SnS2 particles and the graphene skeleton, which is conductive to convenient charge transfer during the electrochemical process. Owing to the significantly improved sodium ions transport kinetics and fast electronic conductive network, the PEG-SnS2/rGO composite presents a high capacitance contribution of 90.69% at a scan rate of 0.6 mV s−1.

The co-incorporation of transition-metal (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, etc.) and carbon components can synergistically buffer the volume change of the Sb component; however, these Sb-M-C ternary anodes often suffer from uneven distribution of Sb, M, and C components. Herein, we propose a general nanostructured gel-enabled methodology to synthesize homogeneous Sb-M-C ternary anodes for fully realizing the synergestic effects from M/C dual matrices. A cyano-bridged Sb(III)-Ni(II) coordination polymer gel (Sb-Ni cyanogel) has been synthesized and directly reduced to an Sb-Ni alloy framework (Sb-Ni framework). Moreover, graphene oxide (GO) can be in situ immobilized within the cyanogel framework, and after reduction, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is uniformly distributed within the alloy framework, yielding a homogeneous rGO@Sb-Ni ternary framework. The rGO@Sb-Ni framework with optimal rGO content manifests a high reversible capacity of ∼468 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and stable cycle life at 5 A g-1 (∼210 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are generally considered as promising cheap alternatives of lithium-ion batteries for stationary renewable energy storage and have received increasing attention in recent years. The exploration of anode materials with efficient electron transportation is essential for improving the performance of SIBs. Inspired by the signal transfer mode of a neuron, we designed a composite by stringing MoS2 nanoflower (soma) with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (axons). High-resolution TEM observation reveals a lattice matching growth mechanism of MoS2 nanosheets on the interface of MWCNTs and the lattice expansion of the (002) plane of MoS2. The lattice matching among the MoS2 nanosheet and MWCNT could facilitate electron transfer and structure maintenance upon cycling. The expanded distance of the (002) plane of MoS2 would also promote the sodium-ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of the composite. Benefiting from the structural features, when used as an anode material for SIBs, the composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capabilities. A stable capacity of 527.7 mAh g-1 can be achieved after 110 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. The neuron-inspired design proposed is a promising and efficient strategy for the development of electrode materials for SIBs with high mass transport kinetics and structural stability.",

        "abstract": "Layered graphene and molybdenum disulfide have outstanding sodium ion storage properties that make them suitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the easy and large-scale preparation of graphene and molybdenum disulfide composites with structural stability and excellent performance face enormous challenges. In this study, a self-supporting network-structured MoS2/heteroatom-doped graphene (MoS2/NSGs-G) composite is prepared by a simple and exercisable electrochemical exfoliation followed by a hydrothermal route. In the composite, layered MoS2 nanosheets and heteroatom-doped graphene nanosheets are intertwined with each other into self-supporting network architecture, which could hold back the aggregation of MoS2 and graphene effectively. Moreover, the composite possesses enlarged interlayer spacing of graphene and MoS2, which could contribute to an increase in the reaction sites and ion transport of the composite. Owing to these advantageous structural characteristics and the heteroatomic co-doping of nitrogen and sulfur, MoS2/NSGs-G demonstrates greatly reversible sodium storage capacity. The measurements revealed that the reversible cycle capacity was 443.9 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, and the rate capacity was 491.5, 490.5, 453.9, 418.1, 383.8, 333.1, and 294.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the MoS2/NSGs-G sample displayed lower resistance, dominant pseudocapacitive contribution, and faster sodium ion interface kinetics characteristic. Therefore, this study provides an operable strategy to obtain high-performance anode materials, and MoS2/NSGs-G with favorable structure and excellent cycle stability has great application potential for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Exploring electrolytes of high safety is essential to pave the practical route of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) towards their important application on large-scale energy storage and power supplies. In this regard, ionogel electrolytes (IEs) have been highlighted for the sake of high ionic conductivity, prominent electrochemical and thermal stability, and more crucially the interfacial wettability. However, present studies are lack of understanding on the interaction of IEs that determines the ion desolvation and migration. In this article, IEs consisting of SBA-15 hosts, ionic liquid, sodium salt and poly vinylidenefluoride - hexafluoro propylene (PVDF-HFP) have been proposed by mechanical ball-milling and roller pressing. The component ratio has been optimized based on the balance of ionic conductivity and self-supporting capacity of IEs. The optimal IEs showed a sufficiently high ionic conductivity of 2.48×10-3 S cm-1 (at 30 °C), wide electrochemical window (up to 4.8 V vs. Na+/Na) and high Na+ transference number (0.37). Due to the presence of SBA-15 and ionic liquid, the IEs exhibited much improved thermal-resistance than that of the conventional organic liquid electrolytes (OLEs). Furthermore, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) revealed the hydrogen bonding interaction between silanols and the dissolved salts, not only anchoring anions for immobilization, but also promoting the dissociation of sodium salts. After matched with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode and metallic Na anode, the SIBs presented specific discharge capacity up to 110.7 mA h g-1 initially at room temperature with 92 % capacity retention after 300 cycles. The improved safety and electrochemical performance provided insights on rationally regulating IEs and their interactions with the prospect of strengthening their practical performance of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Designing excellent anode materials to enhance the sluggish interfacial kinetics of Na+ is a key challenge in improving the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an ultra‐thin fast‐ionic conductor NaB5C coating TiB2 nanoflowers with vertically aligned nanosheet arrays to form yolk–shell TiB2@NaB5C (TBNBC) nanospheres as an anode material for SIBs. The unique structure creates direct and short ion/electron transfer pathways and reserves enough space to prevent the uneven electrochemical reactions from TiB2 nanosheets aggregation and stacking, thus ensuring the long‐term cycling stability of SIBs. Additionally, the NaB5C coating with fast‐ionic conductor functional interphase provides rapid Na+ transport channels and effectively reduces the Na+ de‐solvation barrier, accelerating Na+ reaction kinetics. Furthermore, a homogeneous and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film including inorganic boron species and fluorine‐rich inner layer is constructed on the TBNBC electrode to delocalize stress and induce a uniform Na+ flux, further promoting fast Na+ interphase reaction kinetics. Consequently, the optimized composites achieve ultrastable cycling performances of 173 mAh g−1 over 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. More importantly, they also exhibit an outstanding capacity of 182.2 mAh g−1 at −20 °C.

Herein, bimetallic organic framework derived FeIn2S4@N/S‐C microrods with Fe vacancies is presented for fast, durable, and reversible sodium storage. The presence of Fe vacancies significantly modulates the d‐band center of Fe and decreases the strength of the Fe─S bond for facilitating the sodiation reaction kinetics jointly. Moreover, a thin and stable solid electrolyte interface film with inorganic‐rich components is formed by Fe vacancies induction.

However, higher first-cycle efficiency and cycling stability are needed to realize the full commercial potential of HC. Herein, the battery metrics and the Na+ storage mechanism of hard carbon in ether and carbonate electrolytes are explored using ex-situ microscopic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical techniques. The commercial HC shows an excellent first-cycle efficiency of 79 % and capacity retention of 91 % after 1000 cycles at 1C in ether electrolytes, outperforming the carbonate counterpart. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS-depth profiling) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) reveal the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer structure and morphology in both electrolyte systems. A correlation between the storage mechanism and the SEI layer kinetics indicates that the intercalation mechanisms are dominant in ether, and a pore-filling mechanism is dominant in carbonate-ester systems for Na+ storage at low potentials, leading to better high-rate performance and cycle stability in ether-based electrolyte. A full cell demonstrates the high-rate performance of ether electrolytes for SIBs, delivering a high energy density of 265 Wh kg−1 at an average operating potential of ∼3.36 V in ether electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides are a research hotspot in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, slow kinetics and rapid capacity decay due to volume changes during cycling limit their commercial applications. Heterostructures have the ability to accelerate charge transport and are widely used in energy storage devices due to their abundant active sites and lattice interfaces. A rational design of heterojunction electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance is essential for SIBs. Herein, a novel anode material heterostructured FeSe2/MoSe2 (FMSe) nanoflower for SIBs was successfully prepared through a facile co-precipitation and hydrothermal route. The as-prepared FMSe heterojunction exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including a high invertible capacity (493.7 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles at 0.2 A g-1), long-term cycling stability (352.2 mA h g-1 even after 4200 cycles at 5.0 A g-1) and competitive rate capability (361.2 mA h g-1 at 20 A g-1). By matching with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, it can even exhibit ideal cycling stability (123.5 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 200 cycles). Furthermore, the sodium storage mechanism of the FMSe electrodes was systematically determined by ex situ electrochemical techniques. Theoretical calculation also reveals that the heterostructure on the FMSe interface enhances charge transport and promotes reaction kinetics.",

However, its storage mechanism is still controversial. In this paper, a solvent co-intercalation mechanism into hard carbon is proposed and is proved by in situ XRD and ex situ TEM XPS results successfully. Thanks to the co-intercalation of solvent, the platform capacity of hard carbon maintains well at very high current densities. It can even exhibit 245 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 , which is the best rate performance obtained for hard carbon anode as far as it is known. The full battery assembled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 has a high energy density of 157 Wh kg-1 at 3800 W kg-1 (relative to the electrode).

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIB) offer many potential applications in large-scale power grids since they are inexpensive, safe, and environmentally friendly. Natrium superionic conductors (NASICON), especially carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), have attracted much attention due to the full use of their high ion migration speed. However, the poor cycle lifespan and capacity retention of NVP hinder its application in ASIB. Herein, a novel bimetal-doped Na3V1.3Fe0.5W0.2(PO4)3 (NV1.3Fe0.5W0.2P) cathode was designed and synthesized to achieve outstanding cycling stability (95% of initial capacity at 50th cycle). The electrochemical behavior and charge storage mechanism of NV1.3Fe0.5W0.2P are systematically investigated by various in-situ and ex-situ characterizations. The Fe and W codoping could stabilize the NASICON framework to suppress the attack of proton on the Na site in the aqueous electrolyte, thus resulting in excellent cycling stability. DFT calculations show that the vanadium is protected by bimetals. Moreover, an ASIB fabricated by NV1.3Fe0.5W0.2P cathode and Na1Ti2(PO4)3 anode delivers 64 mAh g-1 at room temperature, 95% capacity retention after 50 cycles (1 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 as sodium-ion-battery anode has attracted increased attention because of its low volume change and good safety. However, low capacity and poor rate performance caused by low electrical conductivity and slow ion diffusion greatly impede its practical applications. Here, a bi-solvent enhanced pressure strategy that induces defects (oxygen vacancies) into TiO2 via N doping and reduces its size by using mutual-solvent ethanol and dopant dimethylformamide as pressure-increased reagent of tetrabutyl orthotitanate tetramer is proposed to fabricate N-doped TiO2 /C nanocomposites. The induced defects can increase ion storage sites, improve electrical conductivity, and decrease bandgap and ion diffuse energy barrier of TiO2 . The size reduction increases contact interfaces between TiO2 and C and shortens ion diffuse distance, thus increasing extra ion storage sites and boosting ion diffusion rate of TiO2 . The N-doped TiO2 possesses highly stable crystal structure with a slightly increase of 0.86% in crystal lattice spacing and 3.2% in particle size after fully sodiation. Consequently, as a sodium-ion battery anode, the nanocomposite delivers high capacity and superior rate capability along with ultralong cycling life. This work proposes a novel pressure-induced synthesis strategy that provides unique guidance for designing TiO2 -based anode materials with high capacity and excellent fast-charging capability.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbons are perceived as promising anode materials in sodium-ion batteries, while their practical implementation is largely impeded by the insufficient initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Hard carbons with self-supporting architecture are intriguing to enhance ICE owing to the omission of binder and conductive agent; whereas elaborate architecture and microstructure design are still required to further raise the ICE to the level of commercial graphite in lithium-ion batteries, especially under high areal capacity. Herein, we propose a graphite-assisted pressurization strategy during carbonization to achieve remarkable ICE and high areal capacity in resulting self-supporting cellulose tissue derived hard carbon anode. The intimate contact of graphite plate enables suitable local ordering of pseudo-graphitic nanodomains with low intrinsic defects, responsible for enhanced ICE. While the pressure-reinforced dense yet self-interwoven fibrous networks render high areal capacity. Consequently, the as-prepared self-supporting hard carbon anode displays remarkable ICE to 95% and areal capacity of 2.4 mAh cm−2, far exceeding the reported value of less than 0.8 mAh cm−2. Meanwhile, the rate and durability are not scarified under such superior ICE due to the well-manipulated pseudo-graphitic nanodomains and porous fibrous networks. The practicality is further demonstrated in coin-type and pouch-type full cells delivering high capacity and long-term stability. Our finding offers an impetus for the development of high ICE and areal capacity for sodium-ion battery anode.",

The optimum graphitization degree to accommodate sodium ions, while providing high conductivity, as well as the influence of particle size distribution or pore sizes on the performance of carbon anodes, is one of the most discussed topics in this field. While a lot of studies have been published discussing these questions, the convoluted nature of these parameters, originating from material synthesis constraints, usually prevents their independent optimization. Based on Mesoporous N‐doped Carbon Nanospheres (MPNC) as model carbon material systems, the graphitization temperaturefor spherical particles with a monomodal particle size distribution (≈280 nm) and a narrow pore size distribution (≈30 nm) is optimized for faradaic sodium ion storage (plateau capacity) and electrodes with a very high power density of 2680 W kg−1 at 1000 mA g−1 and a remarkable capacity retention over 2000 cycles of 86 %, only losing 0.04 % of its specific capacity per cycle, are demonstrated.",

Hence, Na3V2O2(PO4)2F/graphene aerogels (NVPF/GAs) with a three-dimensional continuous porous network are firstly prepared by co-assembly and freeze-drying. The three-dimensional porous network helps obtain a high NVPF content of 81 wt.%, relieve the volume change for improving the cyclability, and enhance the wettability of the electrode with the electrolyte for accelerating the diffusion dynamics of sodium ions and electrons. As a directly used freestanding cathode without the use of any binder/collector, an optimized freestanding NVPF/GA electrode exhibits excellent cycling and rate performances than those of traditional coating electrodes. The average capacities at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 C are 135.4, 128.0, 125.1, 121.9 and 115.1 mA h g-1, respectively. Especially, it maintains a capacity retention of 100% after 1000 cycles at an ultrahigh current of 40 C.

        "abstract": "The enormous demand for Lithium urges researchers to look for alternatives. Sodium can play a critical role in a plethora of rechargeable batteries as they are more abundant, economical, have better safety characteristics, and have similar power delivery possibilities. In this work, we established the intercalation of the sodium ions in between selectively functionalized graphene oxide (GO) layers for a Na-ion battery with enhanced performance. GO was functionalized by reacting with N-Boc-ethylenediamine (EnBoc) which resulted in the formation of amino alcohol moieties offering three coordination sites for sodium ions. This synthetic approach led to the formation of Na-GO-EnBoc material by increasing the interlayer d-spacing from 9.7 Å to 13.17 Å (2θ = 6.7 deg.) which facilitated more Na+ ions to intercalate efficiently in between GO nanosheets. The insertion of sodium ions on the surface of intercalated GO-EnBoc nanosheets was performed by the precursor sodium perchlorate in ethylene carbonate. The resultant Na-GO-EnBoc material was characterized by using solid state MAS NMR, XPS, XRD, IR, Raman, and microscopy. The analysis suggested different types of Na+ ions on the interlayer gallery which was also substantiated by DFT calculations. The coin cell fabricated with Na intercalated GO-EnBoc-based anode exhibited a consistent reversible capacity of 170 mAhg−1 at 25 mAg−1 rate, suggesting the promise of Na-GO-EnBoc for building future rechargeable batteries.",

However, the low intrinsic electronic conductivity limits its further development. The use of interface coatings can effectively mitigate this problem, and carbon coatings are a good choice. In our work, Sn-MOF containing S was calcined in an inert atmosphere to achieve synchronous carbonization and vulcanization, and the homogeneous slate-like nitrogen-doped carbon /SnS (N-C/SnS) composites were synthesized in-situ. The slate-like structure makes the anodes solid for long durability.

The as-prepared HCNFs as sodium storage anode materials exhibit a high reversible charge capacity of 326 mA h g-1 at 20 mA g-1, high rate capability (85 mA h g-1 at 1.6 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (a capacity retention of 70% even after 5000 cycles at 1.6 A g-1). Such a high performance of HCNFs can be ascribed to the special hollow structure characteristics; they possess a well fabricated electronic transport path and can shorten the ion diffusion distance. Therefore, the HCNFs can be regarded as promising anode materials for advanced sodium ion batteries (SIBs).",

Transition metal dissolution into the electrolyte occurs along with continuous phase transformation and accelerates deterioration of the crystal structure, followed by migration and finally deposition on the anode to form a vicious circle. Surface engineering techniques are employed to modify the interface between active materials and the electrolyte by coating them with a thin layer of AlPO4 ion conductor. This stable thin layer can stabilize the surface crystal structure of the cathode material by avoiding element dissolution. Meanwhile, it can protect the anode from increased resistance by suppressing the dissolution-migration-deposition process. This technique is a promising method to improve the lifetime for the future commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-based dual-ion batteries have shown great promise for large-scale energy storage applications due to their wide operating voltages, environmental friendliness, abundant sodium resources, and low cost, which are widely investigated by researchers. However, the development of high-performance anode materials is a key requirement for the realization of such electrochemical energy storage systems at the practical application level. Carbonaceous anode materials based on intercalation/deintercalation mechanisms typically exhibit low discharge capacities, while metal-based materials based on conversion or alloying reactions show unsatisfactory stability in performance. On the contrary, organic materials display high theoretical capacities due to their flexible molecular structure designability and stable cyclic performance with fast reaction kinetics based on the unique enolization reaction. Herein, we report an organic polymer anode material of polyimide (PNTO), combined with a high-concentration electrolyte; the sodium-based dual-ion battery system constructed exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance. The full battery shows an ultra-high specific discharge capacity of 293.2 mAh g-1 and can be cycled stably for 3200/5600/4100 cycles at ultra-high rates of 60/120/150 C without degradation. Furthermore, the dual-ion battery system demonstrates an extremely low self-discharge rate of 0.03% h-1 and superior fast-charging-slow-discharging performance. It is one of the best performances reported up to now for a dual-ion full battery based on an organic polymer anode. This novel battery system design strategy will facilitate the advancement of high-performance organic-based dual-ion batteries and is expected to be a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage applications.",

However, the application of metal selenides is hindered by the huge volume variation, which causes electrode structure devastation and the consequent degrading cycling stability and rate capability. To overcome the aforementioned obstacles, herein, SnSe2 /FeSe2 nanocubes capsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (SFS@NC) are fabricated via a facile co-precipitation method, followed by poly-dopamine wrapping and one-step selenization/carbonization procedure. The most remarkable feature of SFS@NC is the ultra-stability under high current density while delivering a large capacity. The synergistic effect of dual selenide components and core-shell architecture mitigates the volume effect, alleviates the agglomeration of nanoparticles, and further improves the electric conductivity. The as-prepared SFS@NC nanocubes present a high capacity of 408.1 mAh g-1 after 1200 cycles at 6 A g-1 , corresponding to an 85.3% retention, and can achieve a capacity of 345.0 mAh g-1 at an extremely high current density of 20 A g-1 .

Herein, a multiscale design from anode material to electrode structure is proposed to obtain a gadolinium‐ion‐doped and carbon‐coated NTP composite electrode (NTP‐Gd‐C), in which gadolinium ion doping, oxygen vacancy, optimized structure, N‐doped carbon coating, and bridging on the three‐dimensional network are simultaneously achieved. In the whole electrode, the excellent hierarchical electronic/ionic conductivity and structural stability are simultaneously improved via the synergistic optimization of NTP‐Gd‐C. As a result, excellent electrochemical performances of NTP‐Gd‐C electrode with a high areal/volumetric capacity of 1.0 mAh cm−2/142.8 mAh cm−3, high rate capability (58.3 mAh g−1 at 200 C), long cycle life (ultralow capacity fading of 0.004% per cycle under 10,000 cycles), and wide‐temperature electrochemical performances (97.0 mAh g−1 at 2 C under −20°C) are achieved. Moreover, the NTP‐Gd‐C//Na3V2(PO4)3/C full cell also delivers an excellent rate capacity of 42.0 mAh g−1 at 200 C and long‐term high‐capacity retention of 66.2% after 4000 cycles at 20 C.",

        "abstract": "Because of the low cost and abundant nature of the sodium element, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting extensive attention, and a variety of SIB cathode materials have been discovered. However, the lack of high-performance anode materials is a major challenge of SIBs. Herein, we have synthesized ultrasmall TiO2-nanoparticle-coated reduced graphene oxide (TiO2@RGO) composites by using a one-pot hydrolysis method, which are then investigated as anode materials for SIBs. The morphology of TiO2@RGO has been characterized using transmission electron microscopy, indicating that the TiO2 nanospheres uniformly grow on the surface of the RGO nanosheet. As-prepared TiO2@RGO composites exhibited a promising electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability and rate capability, especially the initial cycle Coulombic efficiency of 60.7%, which is higher than that in previous reports. The kinetics of the electrode reaction has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The results indicate that the sodium-ion intercalation/extraction behavior is not controlled by the semiinfinite diffusion process, which gives rise to an outstanding rate performance. In addition, the electrochemical performance of TiO2@RGO composites in full cells, coupled with carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 as the positive material, has been investigated. The discharge specific capacity was up to 117.2 mAh g-1, and it remained at 84.6 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles under a current density of 2 A g-1, which shows excellent cycling stability.",

However, to compensate for the sluggish reaction kinetics and higher intrinsic potential of Na+ compared to Li+, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable electrode materials must be explored for practical applications. Herein, 2D ternary tin thiophosphate (SnP2S6) nanosheets (∼10 nm thickness) grown on graphene (denoted as SPS/G hybrid) are demonstrated as intriguing anodes for SIBs. The asymmetric-layered structure and ternary composition enable the SPS/G hybrid with a high reversible capacity (1230 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1), superior rate capability (200 mAh g-1 at 15 A g-1), and an exceptional capacity retention of 76% after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1. More importantly, a prototype sodium-ion full cell constructed by pairing with the Na3V2O2(PO4)3F cathode affords a high capacity of 470 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1 (on the basis of anode weight) and good cyclic capacity of 360 mAh g-1 at 150 mA g-1.

We developed a defect-rich porous carbon framework (DRPCF) built with N/O-co-doped mesoporous nanosheets and containing many defects using porous g-C3N4 (PCN) and dopamine (DA) as raw materials. We prepared samples with PCN/DA mass ratios of 1/1, 2/1 and 3/1 and found that the one with a mass ratio of 2/1 and a carbonization temperature of 700 °C in an Ar atmosphere (DRPCF-2/1-700), had a large specific surface area with an enormous pore volume and a large number of N/O heteroatom active defect sites. Because of this, it had the best pseudocapacitive sodium and potassium ion storage performance. A half battery of Na//DRPCF-2/1-700 maintained a capacity of 328.2 mAh g−1 after being cycled at 1 A g−1 for 900 cycles, and a half battery of K//DRPC-2/1-700 maintained a capacity of 321.5 mAh g−1 after being cycled at 1 A g−1 for 1 200 cycles. The rate capability and cycling stability achieved by DRPCF-2/1-700 outperforms most reported carbon materials. Finally, ex-situ Raman spectroscopy analysis result confirms that the filling and removing of K+ and Na+ from the electrochemically active defects are responsible for the high capacity, superior rate and cycling performance of the DRPCF-2/1-700 sample.",

Herein, Au nanoparticle@hollow amorphous carbon tube yolk/shell arrays (Au/HCT‐CC) is rationally designed on carbon cloth as a dynamic host. In situ transmission electron microscopy observations reveal a regulated dendrite‐free Na metal plating/stripping within the Au/HCT‐CC host. The self‐confinement of Na metal deposition in the hollow carbon can further stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interface and homogenize Na ion flux, as evidenced by rigorous experimental and theoretical characterizations, thus successfully accommodating the hurdles to Na metal anodes.

The high CE of 99.54% is preserved even under harsh cycling conditions of 10 mA cm−2 and 20 mAh cm−2 for 250 cycles.

Nonetheless, a prevalent challenge with TMSs lies in their significant volume expansion and sluggish kinetics, impeding their capacity for rapid and enduring Na+ storage. Herein, a Cu1.96 S@NC nanodisc material enriched with copper vacancies is synthesised via a hydrothermal and annealing procedure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the incorporation of copper vacancies significantly boosts electrical conductivity by reducing the energy barrier for ion diffusion, thereby promoting efficient electron/ion transport. Moreover, the presence of copper vacancies creates ample active sites for the integration of sodium ions, streamlines charge transfer, boosts electronic conductivity, and, ultimately, significantly enhances the overall performance of SIBs. This novel anode material, Cu1.96 S@NC, demonstrates a reversible capacity of 339 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at a rate of 5 A g-1 . In addition, it maintains a noteworthy reversible capacity of 314 mAh g-1 with an exceptional capacity retention of 96% even after 2000 cycles at 20 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Embedding the functional nanostructures into a lightweight nanocarbon framework is very promising for developing high performance advanced electrodes for rechargeable batteries. Here, to realize workable capacity, core-shell (FeSe2 /C) nanostructures are embedded into carbon nanotube (CNT) framework via a facile wet-chemistry approach accompanied by thermally induced selenization. The CNT framework offers 3D continuous routes for electronic/ionic transfer, while macropores provide adequate space for high mass loading of FeSe2 /C. However, the carbon shell not only creates a solid electronic link among CNTs and FeSe2 but also improves the diffusivity of sodium ions into FeSe2 , as well as acts as a buffer cushion to accommodate the volume variations. These unique structural features of CNT/FeSe2 /C make it an excellent host for sodium storage with a capacity retention of 546 mAh g-1 even after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 . Moreover, areal and volumetric capacities of 5.06 mAh cm-2 and 158 mAh cm-3 are also achieved at high mass loading 16.9 mg cm-2 , respectively. The high performance of multi-benefited engineered structure makes it a potential candidate for secondary ion batteries, while its easy synthesis makes it extendable to further complex structures with other morphologies (such as nanorods, nanowires, etc.) to meet the high energy demands.",

        "abstract": "The research on sodium-ion batteries (SIDs) has aroused intensive attention. In this work, the Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (MTP) composite material with NASICON structure has been studied as an anode material in SIDs. The sol–gel method is used to synthesize the Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with a conductive network that can be constructed by using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and phenolic resin as the amorphous source of carbon coating. The CNT network is used not only to improve the outcome of electrolyte penetration and reduce the internal resistance to diffusion but also to create a fast path for electron transport, thereby elevating the level of electronic conductivity. The phenolic resin is generated on the surface of MTP which extends its cycle life. The carbon-coated Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with 0.10 g CNTs (MTP–CNT10) displays optimal performance as an anode material in SIDs, and shows a discharge capacity of 298.8 mA h g−1, 258.3 mA h g−1 and 254.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, 0.5C and 1C, respectively. Besides, the capacity retention rate reaches 92% after 300 cycles at 10C. This study contributes an effective solution to improving the electrochemical performance of electrode materials through the introduction of carbon coating and highly conductive materials.",

Herein, a cost-effective approach is proposed to prepare a coal-derived HC anode with simple pre-oxidation followed by a post-carbonization process which effectively expands the d _002 layer spacing, generates closed pores and increases defect sites. Through these modifications, the resulting HC anode attains a delicate equilibrium between plateau capacity and sloping capacity, showcasing a remarkable reversible capacity of 306.3 mAh·g^−1 at 0.03 A·g^−1. Furthermore, the produced HC exhibits fast reaction kinetics and exceptional rate performance, achieving a capacity of 289 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1 A·g^−1, equivalent to ~ 94.5% of that at 0.03 A·g^−1. When implemented in a full cell configuration, the impressive electrochemical performance is evident, with a notable energy density of 410.6 Wh·kg^−1 (based on cathode mass).

        "abstract": "Profiting from the huge natural abundance and high theoretical capacity, manganese sulfides (MnS) have triggered abundant interest and attention, which are expected as highly prospective anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, their wide utilizations are seriously impeded by the drawbacks of low electric conductivity, extensive volumetric changes, and sluggish insertion/extraction kinetics, which often result in a rapid deterioration of the capacity and cyclic lifespan for SIBs. Herein, MnS nanocubes confined in N, S co-doped carbon (NSC) matrix are manufactured through a simple hydrothermal with the following sulfurization method. The incorporation of carbon improves the electric conductivity to accelerate electron transport and guards the structural integrality of MnS in the long-term cycling process via the confinement effect. The in situ formed sulfur-bridged bonds (C-S-Mn) provide an intimate affinity between the MnS nanocubes and NSC matrix, which effectively prevents the aggregation and mitigates the volumetric variation of MnS nanocubes in the sodiation/desodiation reactions. Moreover, the hierarchically porous structures in MnS@NSC offer rapid diffusion pathways for Na+ ions that effectively enhance the diffusion kinetics. Benefiting from the admirable synergistic effects between the hierarchically porous MnS nanocubes and conductive NSC framework, the MnS@NSC anode delivers satisfied sodium storage properties.",

Through optimizing the pyrolysis temperatures, the FHC obtained at 1300 °C possesses a key balance between the interlayer spacing and surface area, which can maintain the substantial active sites as well as reduce the irreversible sodium storage. Accordingly, it can deliver a reversible capacity of 324.6 mAh g-1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 80%, superb rate property of 107.2 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1, and long operating stability over 1000 cycles.

The Ni−Ge NPAs are prepared by facile electrodeposition and sputtering method, which eliminates the need for any binder or conductive additive when used as a Na‐ion battery anode. The electrodes display stable cycling performance and enhanced rate capabilities in contrast with planar Ge electrodes, which can be owing to the rational design of the architectured electrodes and firm bonding between current collector and active material (i. e. Ni and Ge, respectively). To validate improvement of nanostructures on electrochemical performance, sodium insertion behavior of crystalline Ge derived from Mg2Ge precursor has been investigated, in which limited but effective enhancement of sodium storage properties are realized by introducing porous nanostructure in crystalline Ge. These results show that elaborately designed configuration of Ge electrodes may be a promising anode for Na‐ion battery applications.",

However, uneven premature sodium deposition and dendrite formation during cycling pose a serious safety threat, significantly limiting the application of SIBs. Achieving reversible and dendrite-free sodium metal deposition and dissolution on the anode surface is key to developing anode-less sodium batteries, the next generation of SIBs with energy densities comparable to those of LIBs. In anode-less systems, sodium ions not only intercalate into the anode's structure but also deposit on its surface, thereby multiplying the specific capacity. Here, we evaluate state-of-the-art hard carbon (HC) used in traditional SIBs as a potential anode material for anode-less sodium batteries. We present comprehensive research on sodium-ion/metal storage, depending on the type of carbon anode material, particle size and morphology of hard carbons, and the electrolyte and additives used. Half-cells with microspherical HC and a fluoroethylene carbonate-based electrolyte operated for over 3000 h, yielding an average discharge capacity of 550 mAh g−1, nearly twice that of HC in classic SIBs.

        "abstract": "To improve the cycle life of sodium‐ion batteries, it is essential to understand the microscopic processes that lead to cell degradation. The mismatched response time of anode and cathode has profound but poorly understood impact on cycle life. In this research, we combine electrochemical and materials characterization combined with electrochemical modeling to investigate the root cause of degradation in sodium‐ion full cells made from Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) cathodes and hard carbon (HC) anode. Our results pinpoint to the slow diffusion of Na in HC as the main cause of diffusional polarization that leads to cathode experiencing high local potentials and ultimately to active material loss over cycling. We demonstrate that by reducing the anode particle size, the diffusional timescales in anode can be matched with that of cathode to improve both extractable capacity as well as cycle life. These observations shed light on non‐intuitive and intricate ways in which cathode and anode can interact with each other to cause degradation in Na‐ion batteries and how microscopic understanding of these cause and effects can help design long lasting batteries.",

Going beyond the allotropes reported so far we propose a new 3D carbon monolith, Hex-C57, by using 5–7 nanoribbons observed in the experiment as the building block. Hex-C57 is found to be dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, and electronically metallic. An analysis based on the tight-binding model reveals that the metallicity originates from the p\n                     z-orbitals of the sp\n                     2-hybridized carbon atoms, forming the conducting channels along the axial direction.

Calculations of the electrochemical properties show that Hex-C57 possesses a high reversible gravimetric capacity (334.69 mAhg−1) and volumetric capacity (314.61 mAhcm−3), a small volume change (1.45%), very low diffusion barriers (0.046–0.070 eV), and a low average open-circuit voltage (0.18 V). This work not only expands the 3D porous carbon family with different nanoribbons as the building blocks, but also demonstrates the functionality of unconventional 5–7 carbon rings-assembled materials.",

        "abstract": "Low softening-point pitch (LP) is regarded as a promising precursor for hard carbon anodes in sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high yield. However, the sodium storage performance of LP-derived carbon materials is always undesirable owing to the high degree of graphitization. Herein, a self-coated hard carbon (HC@SC) material with relative disordered structure was developed from LP precursor using synergistic deep pre-oxidation and self-coating strategies. The oxygen-crosslinked structure endowed in the deep pre-oxidation process effectively hinders carbon layer growth during the subsequent pyrolysis, promoting the formation of disordered hard carbon structure with larger interlayer spacing. Additionally, the soft carbon self-coating layer is introduced onto the hard carbon surface to improve its electrical conductivity and then enhance the sodium diffusion. Consequently, the HC@SC anode delivers an initial charge capacity of 311.9 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and a rate capability of 109.7 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1, and preserves a high-capacity retention of 90.0 % after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the NNMO//HC@SC full cell exhibits desirable cycling stability and rate performance.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has been actively investigated as a high-capacity and low-cost anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, its sodium-storage mechanism has remained controversial, which imposes great difficulties in the design and construction of better microstructured HC materials. To obtain a deeper understanding of the Na-storage mechanism, we comparatively investigated electrochemical behaviors of HC and graphite for Na- and Li-storage reactions. The experimental results reveal that the Na-storage reaction on HC at a low-potential plateau proceeds in a manner similar to the Li+-insertion reaction on graphite but very differently from the Li+-storage process on HC, suggesting that the Na-storage mechanism of HC at a low-voltage plateau operates through the Na+ intercalation into the graphitic layers for the formation of sodium-graphite intercalation compounds (Na-GICs) and is consistent with the \"adsorption-intercalation\" mechanism. Our work might provide new insight for designing better HC materials of high-energy density SIBs.",

First-principles calculations indicate that hydrogen-transfer-mediated orbital conversion from antibonding π* to bonding σ stabilize two added electrons, and reactive intermediate with unpaired electron is suppressed by localization of σ-bonds and steric hindrance.

        "abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomass-derived pyrolysis hard carbon (LCB-HC) shows promising commercial potential as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). LCB compromises multiple biopolymer carbon sources, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which influence the formation and microstructure of pyrolysis HC. However, the poor plateau kinetics of LCB-HC is one of the main obstacles that severely limits its energy density with high power density, which could be attributed to the narrow interlayer distance and the lack of abundant closed pores for the intercalation/filling of Na+. Herein, we proposed a bottom-up approach to tailoring the microstructure of LCB-HC by regulating the components of the LCB precursor at the molecular level using bioenzymes secreted by lignocellulolytic bacteria. This mild and efficient enzymatic hydrolysis pathway partially depolymerized the biopolymers of basswood specifically, thereby enabling the construction of a small curved-graphite domain architecture with increased closed pores and an enlarged interlayer distance of LCB-HC, benefiting the low-voltage plateau Na+ storage with accelerated kinetics. As a result, the basswood-derived HC delivers a reversible capacity of 366.4 mAh g-1 and performed remarkable plateau capacity retainability with a high proportion of 74.3% even with increased current density to 1000 mA g-1. Such a microbial-chemistry-assisted approach provided insights into tailoring the microstructure of LCB-HC to construct high-performance SIB anode materials.",

Nevertheless, water in FeHCF is likely to take up Na+ sites leading to the reductions in capacity and rate capability. Herein, an ion‐exchange method is proposed to synthesize low‐water potassium‐sodium mixed iron hexacyanoferrate (KNaFeHCF). The ion‐exchange method can preserve the lattice structure with low vacancies and K+ with larger ionic radii can reduce the water content in FeHCF and improve Na+ reaction kinetics.

The sample exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, with a discharge capacity of 130.33 at 0.1 and 99.49 mAh g−1 at 30 C. With a full‐cell configuration with a hard carbon anode, the discharge capacity reaches 115.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C.

However, graphite or other anode materials are not satisfactory because the large radius of Na+ hinders their embedding and removal in the charge and discharge processes. Recently, a biphenylene network (BPN), a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has been synthesized. In this paper, we reveal the potential possibility of BPN as a Na storage material. The theoretical results indicate the advantages of BPN as a sodium battery anode. The maximum specific capacity (413 mA h g-1) is larger than that of the graphite-Li system (372 mA h g-1). With low Na+ diffusion barrier (<0.6 eV) and small volume expansion in the charging process (∼26%), BPN presents superiority to the graphite-Na system. Our findings show new insights into Na storage in BPN and provide guidance for the use of a BPN anode in sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Addressing the slow electrochemical kinetics and electrode pulverization of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is needed to continuously develop advanced anode materials. Molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) is considered promising for SIBs anodes due to its wider interlayer distance, faster electronic conductivity, and weaker interlayer force. However, the nanoparticle aggregation and layered structure collapse caused by bond breakage weaken its inherent advantages for excellent sodium storage performance. Herein, hierarchically nanostructured regulation and surface coating of MoTe2 based SIB anodes are simultaneously achieved by employing Mo-PDA as precursors through a concise and effective method containing chelation, preoxidation and tellurization. The microstructure and morphology of MoTe2/C composites can be facilely regulated by controlling the chelation time and tellurization temperature. The as-synthesized MoTe2/C-6h-600 electrode exhibits encouraging Na+ storage performance, which delivers discharge capacitances of 290.7 mAh g−1 (0.1 A g−1) and 161.1 mAh g−1 (1.0 A g−1) after hundreds and thousands cycles, respevtively.

Besides the high working plateau at 2.1 V, another one is observed at approximately 0.4 V for the first time due to further reduction of Ti(3+) to Ti(2+). Remarkably, the anode exhibits superior rate capability, whose capacity and corresponding capacity retention reach 56 mAh g(-1) and 68%, respectively, over 10000 cycles under the high current density of 20 C rate (4 A g(-1)).

The experimental data and theoretical calculation demonstrate that steric-hindrance effect from the aromatic ring side group can increase backbone rigidity and the internal free volumes in the polymer precursor, which can prevent the over graphitization and facilitate the formation of closed pores during the carbonization process. As a result, the as-prepared HC anode exhibits a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity of 340.3 mAh/g at 0.1 C, improved rate performance (210.7 mAh/g at 5 C) as well as boosted cycling stability (86.4% over 1000 cycles at 2C). This work provides a new insight into the formation mechanisms of closed pores via steric hindrance engineering, which can shed light on the development of high-performance polymer-derived HC anode for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Recycling of waste coal-based filter materials into carbon anode materials for potassium and sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Recycling waste resources into electrode materials for energy storage is crucial for achieving sustainable societal advancements. In industrial production, anthracite can be employed as a filter material following the annealing process, which effectively reduces the ash content and facilitates the growth of nanographite-like domains within the material. In this work, waste coal-based filter materials are recycled into carbon anode materials for potassium and sodium-ion batteries through a simple pickling process. Mixed acid treatment is used to remove the impurities in the waste filter material without damaging the nanographite-like domain. The nanographite-like domains offer active sites for K+ insertion, while the stacked structure of these domains generates a large number of closed pores for Na+ pore filling. Additionally, the numerous grain boundaries facilitate rapid ion diffusion. When the waste filter material derived carbon is used as anode material for PIBs, it can display a reversible potassium storage capacity of 258.8 mAh/g at 0.05 A/g. For SIBs, it exhibits the reversible capacity of 247.2 mAh/g with an obvious platform at low voltage at 0.02 A/g. A sodium-ion full battery is assembled with WFC-1800 and Na3V2(PO4)3 as electrodes, exhibiting an energy density of 179.08 Wh/kg. These findings provide a new approach to tackle the challenge of coal-based waste utilization and promote progress in the field of large-scale storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Pitch-derived hard carbon materials are considered one of the most promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost and high carbon yields. However, they are largely limited by inferior specific capacity and rate capability, resulting from the easy graphitization of the pitch precursor during high-temperature carbonization. Herein, a simple bromination modification coupled with a pyrolysis strategy was proposed to fabricate pitch-derived hard carbon anodes (BHC-x), aiming to engineer their microstructure and optimize the electrochemical performance of SIBs. The detailed experimental investigations demonstrated that the brominated pitch precursor obtained via hydrothermal treatment underwent cross-linking polycondensation in the presence of bromine species at 350 °C, thereby forming hard carbon with a unique disordered and closed structure during the high-temperature pyrolysis process. As a result, the optimized BHC-1500, with rich defect sites and a suitable interlayer spacing of 0.358 nm, exhibited a high reversible capacity of 250.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 79.8%. It still maintained 150.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1, outperforming unbrominated counterparts (152.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1).

        "abstract": "The plateau capacity in hard carbon plays a decisive role in enhancing the energy density of sodium-ion batteries. However, a comprehensive study on the influence of the subtle differences in molecular structures of polymer precursors on the evolution process and structure of the derived hard carbon remains insufficient. In this study, bisphenol A and bisphenol F epoxy resins with similar carbon chain structures but only substituents difference (–CH3 replacement of −H), were selected to explore the impact of the subtle distinction of molecular structure of precursor on the corresponding hard carbon microstructure and sodium storage properties. Theoretical calculations and pre-carbonization results show that methyl substituent with greater steric hindrance significantly affects the molecular aggregation state of the polymer network. This unique structure weakens the rearrangement of carbon chains and the loss of CO. Consequently, the accumulation and growth of graphitic carbon are inhibited during carbonization, and promote the formation of more closed pores. The prepared YHC-1200 exhibits a higher plateau capacity of 194.5mAh g−1 compared to FHC-1200 (165.1 mAh g−1), and provides a reversible capacity of 327.9mAh g−1 at 0.1C along with excellent rate performance.

This work presents an easier approach to improving low-temperature performance by incorporating nanodiamonds (NDs) into hard carbon anodes derived from cattail grass. The modified anode shows a larger specific surface area, offering more active sites for Na+. After 90 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, the reversible capacity of the modified anode reaches 365.1 mA h g-1 at room temperature and remains 245.1 mA h g-1 at -40 °C. Even under a high current density of 1.0 A g-1, it delivered 108.2 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 90%. The improved low-temperature performance is attributed to the introduced NDs in SIBs, which in crease the number of the reversible active sites, reduce charge transfer resistance, lower activation energy, and effectively inhibit the formation of Na dendrites.

It's worth noting that low price and high carbon production helps coal extraordinary promise as hard carbon precursor. However, low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and practical Na+ storage specific capacity barrier their application owing to lots of defects. Herein, a grafting method is proposed to decrease defects, introducing glucose with simple one step carbonization process. Utilizing the reaction between glucose and coal reduces the defects, which generates a high ICE with less irreversible sodium ion consumption. Meanwhile the expanded carbon layer spaces enable the fast sodium ions transfer, leading to an optimized sodium storage performance. The grafted glucose obviously decreases the defects during the carbonization process and contributes extra sodium storage capacity. The optimal CG0.1 exhibits higher reversible capacity of 293 mAh∙g−1 and ICE of 84 % than pristine coal pyrolytic carbon (250 mAh∙g−1 and 79 %).

Its large interlayer spacing permits fast sodium-ion transport, making it a viable candidate for sodium-ion capacitors (SICs). In this work, we designed and synthesized oriented SnS nanosheets confined in graphene in the presence of poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) by electrostatic self-assembly during hydrothermal growth. SnS nanosheets growing along (l00) and (0l0) directions are suppressed due to the confinement by graphene, which exhibit smaller thickness and particle size. Those nanostructure expose abundant open edges due to the presence of Sn4+-O, which offers rich active sites and Na+ easy transport pathways. Vacancies formed at those edges along with S and N co-dopants in graphitic structure synergistically promoted Na+ surface adsorption/desorption. Such nanocomposites with SnS nanosheets confined by N, S co-doped graphene demonstrated significantly enhanced pseudocapacitance.

        "abstract": "Phenolic resin (PF) is considered a promising precursor of hard carbon (HC) for advanced-performance anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its facile designability and high residual carbon yield. However, understanding how the structure of PF precursors influences sodium storage in their derived HC remains a significant challenge. Herein, the microstructure of HC is controlled by the degree of cross-linking of resorcinol-benzaldehyde (RB) resin. We reveal that robust molecular cross-linking in RB resin induced by hydrothermal treatment promotes closed-pore formation in the derived HC. The mechanism is devised for the decomposition of a highly cross-linked RB three-dimensional network into randomly stacked short-range graphitic microcrystals during high-temperature carbonization, contributing to the abundant closed pores in the derived HC. In addition, the high cross-linking degree of RB resin endows its derived HC with a small-sized spherical morphology and large interlayer spacing, which improves the rate performance of HC. Consequently, the optimized hydrothermal treatment HC anode shows a higher specific capacity of 372.7 mAh g-1 and better rate performance than the HC anode without hydrothermal treatment (276.0 mAh g-1). This strategy can provide feasible molecular cross-linking engineering for the development of closed pores in PF-based HC toward enhanced sodium storage.",

Post-cycling analysis confirms unchanged morphology, highlighting the structural stability and robustness of WS2. DFT calculations show that the electronic bandgap in both WS2 and WO3 increases when going from the bulk to monolayers.

        "abstract": "Alloy-type materials are attractive for anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and overall performance. However, the accumulation of stress/strain during repeated cycling results in electrode pulverization, leading to rapid capacity decay and eventual disintegration, thus hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a 3D coral-like Sb-Cu alloy nanoarray with gradient distribution of both elements. The array features a Sb-rich bottom and a Cu-rich top with increasing Sb and decreasing Cu concentrations from top to bottom. The former is the active component that provides the high capacity, whereas the latter serves as an inert additive that acts against volume variation. The gradual transition in composition within the electrode introduces a ladder-type volume expansion effect, facilitating a smooth distribution and effective release of stress, thereby ensuring the wanted mechanical stability and structural integrity. The as-developed nanoarray affords a high reversible capacity (460 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C), stable cycling (89% retention over 120 cycles at 1.0 C), and superior rate capability (354 mAh g-1 at 10 C). The concentration dual-gradient strategy paves a new pathway of designing alloy-type materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Anode-free rechargeable sodium batteries represent one of the ultimate choices for the 'beyond-lithium' electrochemical storage technology with high energy. Operated based on the sole use of active Na ions from the cathode, the anode-free battery is usually reported with quite a limited cycle life due to unstable electrolyte chemistry that hinders efficient Na plating/stripping at the anode and high-voltage operation of the layered oxide cathode. A rational design of the electrolyte toward improving its compatibility with the electrodes is key to realize the battery. Here, we show that by refining the volume ratio of two conventional linear ether solvents, a binary electrolyte forms a cation solvation structure that facilitates flat, dendrite-free, planar growth of Na metal on the anode current collector and that is adaptive to high-voltage Na (de)intercalation of P2-/O3-type layered oxide cathodes and oxidative decomposition of the Na2C2O4 supplement. Inorganic fluorides, such as NaF, show a major influence on the electroplating pattern of Na metal and effective passivation of plated metal at the anode-electrolyte interface. Anode-free batteries based on the refined electrolyte have demonstrated high coulombic efficiency, long cycle life, and the ability to claim a cell-level specific energy of >300 Wh/kg.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal anodes (SMAs), featuring high theoretical specific capacity and low redox potential, offer a feasible approach toward next‐generation high‐dense energy storage technology. However, the growth of Na dendrite and the sluggish kinetics of ion transport remain severe challenges for the practical use of SMAs. Herein, a hollow mesoporous carbon nanosheet anchored with sub‐10 nm SnO2 nanoparticles (SnO2@HMCNS) is synthesized as an anode host to addresses the above issues. The sodiophilic SnO2 nanoseeds serve as nucleation sites to guide homogeneous Na deposition. Meanwhile, the open mesoporous channels not only promote the ion transport but also effectively stabilize the sodiophilic seeds and further reduce the nucleation overpotential, facilitating long‐term dendrite‐free Na deposition. Benefitting from these synergistic effects, the SnO2@HMCNS electrode enables a durable cycling of ≈1800 h for a high area capacity of 2 mAh cm−2 at 4 mA cm−2, and a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. Moreover, the SnO2@HMCNS||NVP full cells delivers superior electrochemical performance. Especially, the anode‐free sodium metal batteries achieved ≈80% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. This work provides valuable insight into the interplay between sodiophilic seeds and porous skeletons, which is beneficial to constructing stable high‐efficiency SMAs.",

Owing to unique structure of triazine stabilized in the covalent polymeric networks during the pyrolysis process, the derived mesoporous carbon nanospheres possess an ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 15.6 wt%) even after pyrolysis at 800 °C, which is the highest nitrogen content among mesoporous carbon nanospheres.

        "abstract": "Hydrogen evolution reactions that cause the alkalization of aqueous electrolytes generally frustrate the structural stability and cycling performance of NaTi2(PO4)3/C anode material for rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs). Herein, a novel highly concentrated electrolyte with a large hydrogen-evolution overpotential and hydroxide-capture ability is rationally established by incorporating a bifunctional Mg(Ac)2 additive into a concentrated NaAc aqueous solution. The highly concentrated electrolyte salts (4m NaAc+3m Mg(Ac)2) favor regulation on hydrogen-bonding configurations and kinetically shift the hydrogen evolution potential to a lower value of -1.37 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The Mg(Ac)2 additive plays particular roles in spontaneously capturing hydroxide ions generated during hydrogen evolution reactions on anode surfaces and simultaneously forming a protective Mg(OH)2-like interphase. As a result, the unique electrolyte significantly improves the structural stability and cycling performance of NaTi2(PO4)3/C anode (94.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA·g-1). The effect of salt concentration on hydrogen bonding configurations of aqueous electrolytes is investigated with Raman spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. The interphase is identified by coupling EDS mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. This work provides a new strategy for improving the cycling stability of aqueous sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Various electrode materials are considered for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and one important prerequisite for developments of SIBs is a detailed understanding about charge storage mechanisms. Herein, we present a rigorous study about Na storage properties of ultra-small Fe3S4 nanoparticles, synthesized applying a solvothermal route, which exhibit a very good electrochemical performance as anode material for SIBs. A closer look into electrochemical reaction pathways on the nanoscale, utilizing synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption techniques, reveals a complicated conversion mechanism. Initially, separation of Fe3S4 into nanocrystalline intermediates occurs accompanied by reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ cations. Discharge to 0.1 V leads to formation of strongly disordered Fe0 finely dispersed in a nanosized Na2S matrix. The resulting volume expansion leads to a worse long-term stability in the voltage range 3.0-0.1 V. Adjusting the lower cut-off potential to 0.5 V, crystallization of Na2S is prevented and a completely amorphous intermediate stage is formed. Thus, the smaller voltage window is favorable for long-term stability, yielding highly reversible capacity retention, e.g., 486 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles applying 0.5 A g-1 and superior coulombic efficiencies >99.9%. During charge to 3.0 V, Fe3S4 with smaller domains are reversibly generated in the 1st cycle, but further cycling results in loss of structural long-range order, whereas the local environment resembles that of Fe3S4 in subsequent charged states. Electrokinetic analyses reveal high capacitive contributions to the charge storage, indicating shortened diffusion lengths and thus, redox reactions occur predominantly at surfaces of nanosized conversion products.",

Repeated volume changes along the sodiation/desodiation cycles encourage capacity fading by triggering pulverization accompanying electrolyte decomposition. Additionally, the low cation transference number of sodium ions is another hindrance for application in SIBs. In this work, a binder was designed for the antimony in SIB cells to ensure bifunctionality and improve (1) the mechanical toughness to suppress the serious volume change and (2) the transference number of sodium ions. A crosslinked composite of poly(acrylic acid) and cyanoethyl pullulan (pullulan-CN) was presented as the binder. The polysaccharide backbone of pullulan-CN was responsible for the mechanical toughness, while the cyanoethyl groups of pullulan-CN improved the lithium cation transfer. The antimony-based SIB cells using the composite binder showed improved cycle life with enhanced kinetics. The capacity was maintained at 76% of the initial value at the 200th cycle of 1C discharge following 1C charge, while the capacity at 20C was 61% of the capacity at 0.2C, implying that the composite binder significantly improved the sodiation/desodiation reversibility of antimony.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention owing to their intriguing physicochemical properties and wide-ranging potential applications arising from their distinctive layered structure and nanoscale size effects. However, synthesizing sub-100 nm ultra-small Bi2Te3 nanocrystals remains a formidable challenge. To date, there has been little investigation on the performance of these ultra-small Bi2Te3 nanocrystals in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). This study presents a general strategy for synthesizing ultra-small Bi2Te3 nanocrystals on reduced graphene oxide (Bi2Te3/rGO) through a nanoconfinement approach. First-principles calculations and electrochemical kinetic studies confirm that the ultra-small Bi2Te3/rGO composite material can effectively mitigate volumetric expansion, preserve electrode integrity, and enhance electron transfer, Na-ion adsorption, and diffusion capacity. As a result, the Bi2Te3/rGO electrode demonstrates a remarkable initial specific capacity of 521 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, showcasing outstanding rate behaviour and long-lasting cycle life exceeding 800 cycles at 1 A g-1 while preserving exceptional rate properties. The function of the battery is indicated by ex situ TEM and XPS findings, which propose a conventional dual mechanism involving conversion and alloying. This work paves the way for rapid advancements in Bi2Te3-based SIB anodes while contributing to our understanding of sodium ion storage mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Sulfur (S) doping is an effective method for constructing high-performance carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, traditional designs of S-doped carbon often exhibit low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate capability, and impoverished cycle performance, limiting their practical applications. This study proposes an innovative design strategy to fabricate S-doped carbon using sulfonated sugar molecules as precursors via high-energy ball milling. The results show that the high-energy ball milling can immobilize S for sulfonated sugar molecules by modulating the chemical state of S atoms, thereby creating a S-rich carbon framework with a doping level of 15.5 wt %. In addition, the S atoms are present mainly in the form of C-S bonds, facilitating a stable electrochemical reaction; meanwhile, S atoms expand the spacing between carbon layers and contribute sufficient capacitance-type Na-storage sites. Consequently, the S-doped carbon exhibits a large capacity (>600 mAh g-1), a high ICE (>90%), superior cycling stability (490 mAh g-1 after 1100 cycles at 5 A g-1), and outstanding rate performance (420 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 50 A g-1). Such excellent Na-storage properties of S-doped carbon have rarely been reported in the literatures before.",

        "abstract": "Electrodes with higher Na + storage capability and cycling stability are vital to improve the energy density and rate capability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a coral-like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional carbon framework ( FeP@NC ). Due to the highly continuous N-doped carbon framework and a spring-buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra-stable cycling performance at 10 A g -1 with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the FeP nanoparticles go through a refining-recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na + storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This paper holds a new feasibility insight mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.",

        "abstract": "In this work, an Si/SiO2 -ordered-mesoporous carbon (Si/SiO2 -OMC) nanocomposite was initially fabricated through a magnesiothermic reduction strategy by using a two-dimensional bicontinuous mesochannel of SiO2 -OMC as a precursor, combined with an NaOH etching process, in which crystal Si/amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles were encapsulated into the OMC matrix. Not only can such unique porous crystal Si/amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in the OMC matrix mitigate the volume change of active materials during the cycling process, but they can also improve electrical conductivity of Si/SiO2 and facilitate the Li+ /Na+ diffusion. When applied as an anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the Si/SiO2 -OMC composite displayed superior reversible capacity (958 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles) and good cycling life (retaining a capacity of 459 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles). For sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the composite maintained a high capacity of 423 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.05 A g-1 and an extremely stable reversible capacity of 190 mA h g-1 was retained even after 500 cycles at 1 A g-1 . This performance is one of the best long-term cycling properties of Si-based SIB anode materials. The Si/SiO2 -OMC composites exhibited great potential as an alternative material for both lithium- and sodium-ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "The development of extremely fast-charging sodium-ion batteries is significantly impeded by the lack of appropriate electrode materials. Bismuth (Bi) is emerging as a potential fast-charging anode, while it still faces three major challenges: complex synthesis, mismatch of electrolytes and unclear evolution mechanisms under the fast-charging operation conditions. Here, we report an ultrafast Joule heating method in just 30 s to produce ultrafine Bi nanoparticles embedded in three-dimensional carbon frameworks (Bi@3D-CFs). Through physicochemical characterization and theoretical calculations, we propose that electrochemical kinetics dominates the fast-charging performance. We further reveal the temporal and spatial evolution of Bi@3D-CFs anode using the focused ion beam technique, in-depth X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Bi@3D-CFs in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)-based electrolyte exhibit excellent sodium storage performance (349 mAh g−1 after 12,000 cycles at 5 A g−1 and 311 mAh g−1 at 100 A g−1 with ∼11 s to fully (dis)charge), attributed to the unique 3D porous structure formed during cycling, alongside the gradient organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interphase. When paired with Na3V2(PO4)3@C, the full cells demonstrate remarkable electrochemical performance.

        "abstract": "Sodium metal anodes combine low redox potential (−2.71 V versus SHE) and high theoretical capacity (1165 mAh g−1), becoming a promising anode material for sodium‐ion batteries. Due to the infinite volume change, unstable SEI films, and Na dendrite growth, it is arduous to achieve a long lifespan. Herein, an oxygen‐doped carbon foam (OCF) derived from starch is reported. Heteroatom doping can significantly reduce the nucleation resistance of sodium metal; combined with its rich pore structure and large specific surface area, OCF provides abundant nucleation sites to effectively guide the nucleation and subsequent growth of sodium metal, and the nature of this foam can accommodate the deposited sodium. Furthermore, a more uniform, robust, and stable SEI layer is observed on the surface of OCF electrode, so it can maintain ultra‐high reversibility and excellent integrity for a long time without dendritic growth. As a result, when the current density is 10 mA cm−2, the electrode can maintain stable 2000 cycles and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.83%. Na@OCF||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell also has extremely high capacity retention of about 97.53% over 150 cycles.

In this study, we synthesize Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 anodes using a double-pulse electrodeposition method. This binder-free alloy anode, comprising five high-capacity elements, significantly enhances specific capacity and improves cycling stability, while also demonstrating excellent sodium storage capability.

In addition, the anode delivers 290.3 mAh∙g−1 even at a current density of 3200 mA∙g−1. The outstanding electrochemical performance can be attributed to improved electronic transfer efficiency due to the introduction of Cu into Cu68.6Sb23.0Sn3.2Zn0.3P4.9 alloy via reverse potential, as well as the porous structure that facilitates electrolyte penetration and sodium ion transport.

        "abstract": "Metal selenides (MSes) have great potential as candidate anode materials in high‐specific‐energy sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) but are plagued by rapid capacity degradation and slow kinetics. Here, it is reveal that the Bi2Se3 anode discharge process involves multiple‐types of sodium polyselenides (Na‐pSex) which suffer from terrible dissolution and shuttling properties. Based on these observations, a nanoflower‐like composite of dual carbon‐confined Bi2Se3−x crystallites is designed via facile defect chemistry. The robust dual N‐doped carbon layer suppresses the precipitation and aggregation of Bi2Se3, significantly alleviating the dissolution and shuttle effect of Na‐pSex. Theoretical calculations indicate that the pyridine/pyrrole nitrogen sites exhibit strong van der Waals resistance and chemisorption properties against Na2Se4 and Na2Se2. Furthermore, the abundant Se vacancies improve the inherent conductivity of Bi2Se3, reduce the diffusion barrier of Na+, and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Consequently, the resulting Bi2Se3−x@DNC electrode exhibits extraordinary durability (over 2000 cycles at 10.0 A g−1) and high‐rate capability (354.4 mAh g−1 at 75.0 A g−1), propelling the battery performance to new heights.

Nevertheless, their slow reaction kinetics and poor structural stability restrict the practical application of the materials. In this study, the dual-carbon-confined Se-CoS2@NC@C hollow nanocubes with anion doping are synthesized using ZIF-67 as the substrate by resorcin-formaldehyde (RF) encapsulation and subsequent carbonization and sulfurization/selenization. RF- and ZIF-67-derived dual-carbon skeleton hollow structures with a robust carbon skeleton and abundant internal space minimize cyclic stress, mitigate volume changes and maintain the structural integrity of the material. More importantly, Se doping increases the lattice spacing of CoS2, weakens the strength of Co-S bonds, and modulates the electronic structure around Co atoms, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy of the material. As a result, the hollow nanocubes of Se-CoS2@NC@C demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance as the anode for SIBs, delivering a high reversible capacity of 549.4 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles and a superb rate performance (541.1 mAh g-1 at 0.2  A  g-1, and 393.3 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1).

        "abstract": "MoS2 has attracted tremendous attention as an anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) owing to its high specific capacity and layered graphite-like structure. Herein, MoS2 is converted to a ternary MoS2- xSe x alloy through the selenizing process in order to boost the electrochemical performance for Na-ion batteries. Conversion of MoS2 to MoS2- xSe x expands interlayer spacing, improves electronic conductivity, and creates more defects. The expanded interlayer spacing decreases Na+ diffusion resistance and facilitates Na+ fast transfer. The integrated graphene as a conductive network offers effective pathway for electron migration and maintains structural stability of electrodes during cycles. The ternary MoS1.2Se0.8/graphene (MoS1.2Se0.8/G) electrode demonstrates an extremely high reversible capacity of 509 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 (capacity retention of 109%) as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. Even at 2 A g-1 and after 700 cycles, the MoS1.2Se0.8/G electrode also displays a relatively high reversible capacity of 178 mA h g-1. Full cells assembled with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathodes and MoS1.2Se0.8/G anodes reveal high charge/discharge capacities. This work demonstrates that the ternary MoS2- xSe x alloy could be a potential anode material for Na-ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Layered SnS2 is considered as a promising anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries yet suffers from low initial coulombic efficiency, limited specific capacity and rate capability. Herein, we report a cobalt metal cation doping strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of a SnS2 nanosheet array anode through a facile hydrothermal method. Benefitting from this special structure and heteroatom-doping effect, this anode material displays a high initial coulombic efficiency of 57.4%, a superior discharge specific capacity as high as 1288 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles and outstanding long-term cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 800.4 mA h g-1 even at 2 A g-1. These excellent performances could be ascribed to the Co-doping effect that can increase the interlayer spacing, produce rich defects, regulate the electronic environment and improve conductivity. Besides, a carbon cloth substrate can maintain the integrity of the electrode material framework and buffer its volume variation, thus boosting intrinsic dynamic properties and enhancing sodium storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-vanadium fluorophosphate (Na3 V2 O2 x (PO4 )2 F3-2 x , NVPF, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is considered to be a promising Na-storage cathode material due to its high operation potentials (3.6-4 V) and minor volume variation (1.8%) during Na+ -intercalation. Research about NVPF is mainly focused on powder-type samples, while its ordered array architecture is rarely reported. In this work, large-area and uniform Na3 (VO)2 (PO4 )2 F cuboid arrays are vertically grown on carbon nanofiber (CNF) substrates for the first time. Owing to faster electron/ion transport and larger electrolyte-electrode contact area, the as-prepared NVPF array electrode exhibits much improved Na-storage properties compared to its powder counterpart. Importantly, a quasi-solid-state sodium-ion hybrid capacitor (SIHC) is constructed based on the NVPF array as an intercalative battery cathode and porous CNF as a capacitive supercapacitor anode together with the P(VDF-HFP)-based polymer electrolyte. This novel hybrid system delivers an attractive energy density of ≈227 W h kg-1 (based on total mass of two electrodes), and still remains as high as 107 Wh kg-1 at a high specific power of 4936 W kg-1 , which pushes the energy output of sodium hybrid capacitors toward a new limit. In addition, the growth mechanism of NVPF arrays is investigated in detail.",

        "abstract": "Na/In/C composite anode tailored with natrophilic NaIn and Na_2In phases was constructed via a facile molten metal immersion method. Long-term Na ion plating/stripping stability in the common ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte was achieved with Na/In/C anode. Na ion deposition reversibility of Na/In/C anode was analyzed by in situ microscope, ab initial molecular dynamics and finite element simulations. In conventional ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte, sodium metal reacts spontaneously and deleteriously with solvent molecules. This significantly limits the practical feasibility of high-voltage sodium metal batteries based on Na metal chemistry. Herein, we present a sodium metal alloy strategy via introducing NaIn and Na_2In phases in a Na/In/C composite, aiming at boosting Na ion deposition stability in the common EC/PC electrolyte. Symmetric cells with Na/In/C electrodes achieve an impressive long-term cycling capability at 1 mA cm^−2 (> 870 h) and 5 mA cm^−2 (> 560 h), respectively, with a capacity of 1 mAh cm^−2. In situ optical microscopy clearly unravels a stable Na ion dynamic deposition process on the Na/In/C composite electrode surface, attributing to a dendrite-free and smooth morphology. Furthermore, theoretical simulations reveal intrinsic mechanism for the reversible Na ion deposition behavior with the composite Na/In/C electrode. Upon pairing with a high-voltage NaVPOF cathode, Na/In/C anode illustrates a better suitability in SMBs. This work promises an alternative alloying strategy for enhancing Na metal interfacial stability in the common EC/PC electrolyte for their future applications.",

Because it is rich in aromatic monomers that are highly cross-linked by ether and condensed bonds, the lignin material carbonized at 1300 °C (C-1300) in this study has small graphitic domains with well-developed graphene layers, a large interlayer spacing (0.403 nm), and a high micropore surface area (207.5 m2 g-1). When tested as an anode in an NIB, C-1300 exhibited an initial Coulombic efficiency of 68% and a high reversible capacity of 297 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 after 50 cycles. The high capacity of 199 mA h g-1 at less than 0.1 V with a flat voltage profile and an extremely low charge-discharge voltage hysteresis (<0.03 V) make C-1300 a promising energy-dense electrode material. In addition, C-1300 exhibited an excellent high-rate performance of 116 mA h g-1 at 2.5 A g-1 and showed stable cycling retention (0.2% capacity decay per cycle after 500 cycles). By comparing the properties of the lignin-derived carbon with oak sawdust-derived and sugar-derived carbons and a low-temperature carbonized sample (900 °C), the reasons for the excellent performance of C-1300 were determined to result from facilitated Na+-ion transport to the graphitic layer and the microporous regions that penetrate through the less defective and enlarged interlayer spacings.",

It was found that the as-prepared NiCoSe_2@C nanomaterial exhibits stable structure, outstanding cycling stability, and high pseudocapacitive contribution. Specifically, the specific charging capacity is 370.6 mAh g^−1 (0.1 A g^−1, 100 cycles) and 304.8 mAh g^−1 (2 A g^−1, 600 cycles) as anode when used for SIBs. Comparing with the pure NiCoSe_2 nanomaterial, the construction of carbon layer can mitigate the effect of volume expansion and reduce the generation of adverse materials, thus enhancing the cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxides are investigated as electrochemically active anodes for several years due to the merits of high specific capacity, low cost, abundant resources and controllable synthesis. But the poor cycle performances have hindered their further wide application. Herein, porous La-doped FeOOH nanorods have been synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method, which could be transformed into porous La-doped Fe2O3 (Fe2O3-La) via a simple heating process. Compared with the undoped Fe2O3, the Fe2O3-La showed larger surface area, higher specific capacities and more stable cycle performances for lithium/sodium ion batteries. In addition, as an advanced sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries, the Fe2O3-La also displayed much more excellent cycle and rate performances than the undoped Fe2O3. The superior electrochemical performances of the Fe2O3-La may could be attributed to the doping of La, which could induce more porous morphology and offer more reactive sites. The positive effects of La-doping for electrochemical performances of porous Fe2O3 nanorods provide novel insights for further applications of rare earth metal doping.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbons derived from coal precursors have shown bright industrial prospect as the low cost anode materials of sodium-ion batteries. However, it is of extreme necessity yet challenge to regulate carbon microstructure toward superior sodium energy storage. In this study, we propose a powerful chemical reconfiguration tactic to steer hard carbons toward high-capacity and fast sodium storage. The functional species on the edge/plane terminals of bituminous coal are finely reconfigured by nitri-oxidation treatment for effectively inhibiting the reordering of carbon layers under high temperature, thereby creating rich ultramicropores/closed pores and expanded interlayer spacing. These structural merits enable the hard carbon to garner an enhanced capacity of 356 mAh g-1 along with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.1% and long lifespan. More impressively, the sodium storage kinetics is substantially sped up with a large capacity of 215 mAh g-1 retained at a high-rate of 2 A g-1. This work will afford a fresh methodology for precursor modulation to accelerate the real-world practice of hard carbons toward advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

However, the practical applications of Na-DIBs are still hindered by the issues, such as low capacity and poor Coulombic efficiency, which is highly correlated with the compatibility between electrode and electrolyte but rarely investigated. Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into the electrolyte to regulate cation/anion solvation structure and the stability of cathode/anode-electrolyte interphase of Na-DIBs. The FEC modulates the environment of PF6- solvation sheath and facilitates the interaction of PF6- on graphite. In addition, the NaF-rich interphase caused by the preferential decomposition of FEC effectively inhibits side reactions and pulverization of anodes with the electrolyte. Consequently, Sb||graphite full cells in FEC-containing electrolyte achieve an improved capacity, cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency. This work elucidates the underlying mechanism of bifunctional FEC and provides an alternative strategy of building high-performance dual ion batteries.",

Tuning the surface structure of building blocks has been considered to be a new effective strategy to promote the electrochemical performance of 3D self-assembled nanoarchitectures. Herein, VS4 microspheres assembled from the nano-units with different crystallinities are synthesized via a facile template-free hydrothermal method. The results show that the electrochemical performance of VS4 microspheres as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) largely depends on their crystallinity, and a VS4 electrode with the lowest crystallinity delivers a high reversible capacity of 412 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 230 cycles and that of 345 and 293 mA h g-1 even at 1.0 and 2.0 A g-1, respectively. The insertion mechanism is revealed within the selected voltage window of 0.50-3.00 V. Further analysis suggests that decreasing the crystallinity of the nano-units can dramatically enhance the pseudocapacitive behavior of VS4 microspheres, which takes the main responsibility for the improvement of sodium storage properties.

        "abstract": "Quasi‐layered sodium titanates have been extensively studied as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their quasi‐zero‐strain intercalative storage chemistry and high theoretical capacity. However, their sluggish sodiation kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interface lead to rapid capacity decay at low temperatures. Herein, the local electronic structure and interlayer spacing of Na2Ti2O5 are finely regulated by heteroelement Sn‐doping, oxygen rich vacancies, and carbon‐confined structure (Sn‐HNTO@C) to improve low‐temperature performance. Theoretical calculations and Sn doping concentration control confirm that appropriate concentrations of heteroelement Sn‐doping and vacancy defects can redistribute charge density, enhance Na+ adsorption, reduce Na+ diffusion energy barriers, and endow Sn‐HNTO@C anode with stable capacity. In addition, optimizing electrolyte systems at low temperatures allows Sn‐HNTO@C to exhibit a Na+‐solvent co‐intercalation storage mechanism in ether‐based electrolytes, avoiding high desolvent energy barriers and reducing charge transfer activation energy. Furthermore, the thin, stable solid electrolyte interface rich in organic components promotes the low‐temperature interfacial Na+ kinetics. Consequently, Sn‐HNTO@C anode delivers high capacity over 500 cycles (177 mAh g−1) and Sn‐HNTO@C//Na3(VPO4)2F3 full cell presents 91 mAh g−1 over 200 cycles (−15 °C).

However, most symmetric SIBs suffer from suppressed energy density. Here, a superior congeneric Na4V2(PO4)3 anode is synthesized via electrochemical preintercalation, and a high energy density symmetric SIB (Na3V2(PO4)3 as a cathode and Na4V2(PO4)3 as an anode) based on the deepened redox couple of V4+/V2+ is built for the first time. When measured in half cell, both electrodes show stabilized electrochemical performance (over 3000 cycles). The symmetric SIBs exhibit an output voltage of 3.0 V and a cell-level energy density of 138 W h kg-1. Furthermore, the sodium storage mechanism under the expanded measurement range of 0.01-3.9 V is disclosed through an in situ X-ray diffraction technique.",

        "title": "Promoting Ge Alloying Reaction via Heterostructure Engineering for High Efficient and Ultra‐Stable Sodium‐Ion Storage",
        "abstract": "Germanium (Ge)‐based materials have been considered as potential anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries owing to their high theoretical specific capacity. However, the poor conductivity and Na+ diffusivity of Ge‐based materials result in retardant ion/electron transportation and insufficient sodium storage efficiency, leading to sluggish reaction kinetics. To intrinsically maximize the sodium storage capability of Ge, the nitrogen doped carbon‐coated Cu3Ge/Ge heterostructure material (Cu3Ge/Ge@N‐C) is developed for enhanced sodium storage. The pod‐like structure of Cu3Ge/Ge@N‐C exposes numerous active surface to shorten ion transportation pathway while the uniform encapsulation of carbon shell improves the electron transportation, leading to enhanced reaction kinetics. Theoretical calculation reveals that Cu3Ge/Ge heterostructure can offer decent electron conduction and lower the Na+ diffusion barrier, which further promotes Ge alloying reaction and improves its sodium storage capability close to its theoretical value. In addition, the uniform encapsulation of nitrogen‐doped carbon on Cu3Ge/Ge heterostructure material efficiently alleviates its volume expansion and prevents its decomposition, further ensuring its structural integrity upon cycling. Attributed to these unique superiorities, the as‐prepared Cu3Ge/Ge@N‐C electrode demonstrates admirable discharge capacity, outstanding rate capability and prolonged cycle lifespan (178 mAh g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 after 4000 cycles).",

        "abstract": "Biomass‐derived hard carbon, despite being promising for anode material of sodium‐ion batteries, usually suﬀer from low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate capacity, and limited cycling stability caused by complex surface defects and low intrinsic conductivity. Herein, phosphorus‐doped porous hard carbon (HC@PC‐P) were synthesized by the thermal polymerization of soy lecithin on the surfaces of hard carbon derived from olive kernels. The incorporation of heteroatom phosphorus in the porous hard carbon framework expands the carbon lattice spacing, optimizes the graphitization degree, and increases electrical conductivity, guaranteeing ensuring rapid electron and ion transfer. These coupling effects enable HC@PC‐P anode to achieve a high reversible capacity of 350 mAh g‐1 at 0.1 A g‐1, an impressive initial coulombic efficiency of 89.6%, and remarkable long‐term cycling stability at 1 A g‐1 over 1000 cycles with negligible capacity fade. The mechanisms behind sodium storage and enhanced electrochemical performance were elucidated by ex‐situ Raman spectroscopy and kinetic analysis. Additionally, the assembled HC@PC‐P//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell demonstrated a high energy density of 257.9 Wh kg‐1.

Herein, MnS nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanowires/reduced graphene oxide (MnS@CNWs/rGO) composite paper were synthesized via a simple yet scalable strategy with Mn based coordination nanowires and graphene oxide as precursors. The combination of multi-dimensional subunits offers not only a robust structure but also abundant pathways for fast electron/ion diffusion. When directly used as a free-standing electrode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), the ultra-flexible paper anode exhibits excellent mechanical and electrochemical performance, benefitting from the synergistic effects between nano-dimensional MnS encapsulated in CNWs and conductive rGO nanosheets. Remarkably, a high reversible gravimetric/volumetric capacity of ∼560 mA h g-1/∼362.3 mA h cm-3 is obtained using the self-supported flexible electrode at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, which is almost 92.4% of the theoretical capacity of MnS. More competitively, the flexible MnS@CNWs/rGO anode exhibits an unprecedented long cycle life with a high reversible capacity of ∼150 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 10, 000 cycles.

        "abstract": "While development of a sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathode has been approached by various routes, research on compatible anodes for advanced SIB systems has not been sufficiently addressed. The anode materials based on titanium oxide typically show low electrical performances in SIB systems primarily due to their low electrical/ionic conductivity. Thus, in this work, layered titanium oxides were hybridized with covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), which exhibited excellent electrical conductivity, to be used as anodes in SIBs. Moreover, to enlarge the accessible areas for sodium ions, the morphology of the hybrid was formulated in the form of a hollow sphere (HS), leading to the highly enhanced ionic conductivity. This synthesis method was based on the expectation of synergetic effects since titanium oxide provides direct electrostatic sodiation sites that shield organic components and CON supports high electrical and ionic conductivity with polarizable sodiation sites. Therefore, the hybrid shows enhanced and stable electrochemical performances as an anode for up to 2600 charge/discharge cycles compared to the HS without CONs. Furthermore, the best reversible capacities obtained from the hybrid were 426.2 and 108.5 mAh/g at current densities of 100 and 6000 mA/g, which are noteworthy results for the TiO2-based material.",

        "abstract": "The development of high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is crucial to meeting the growing demand for low-cost, sustainable energy storage alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, achieving stable cycling performance in SIBs is challenging, particularly with tin (Sn) foil anodes, which suffer from issues like sodium trapping and structural degradation due to significant volume changes during sodiation and desodiation. In this study, we investigate the electrochemo-mechanical behavior of Sn foil anodes, focusing on the mechanisms of sodium trapping and structural evolution that impair battery performance. We demonstrate that sodiation forms a porous coral-like structure in Sn, which, while increasing surface area, also contributes to severe volume expansion, crack formation, and diffusive sodium trapping. We further explore zinc (Zn)-doped Sn foils, revealing that Zn-rich phases create additional fast sodium diffusion channels, significantly reducing sodium retention and enhancing the anode’s structural integrity. Based on these insights, we propose several improvement strategies, including electrolyte additives, optimized electrode architecture, microstructural defect engineering, and artificial solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) coatings, all aimed at enhancing cycle stability and performance. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of Sn-based anodes and offers practical pathways for advancing SIBs technology.",

Herein, a CO2‐etching strategy is applied to generate abundant closed pores in starch‐derived hard carbon that effectively enhances Na+ plateau storage. During CO2 etching, open pores are first formed on the carbon matrix, which are in situ reorganized to closed pores through high‐temperature carbonization. This CO2‐assisted pore‐regulation strategy increases the diameter and the capacity of closed pores in HC, and simultaneously maintains the microsphere morphology (10–30 µm in diameter). The optimal HC anode exhibits a Na‐storage capacity of 487.6 mAh g−1 with a high initial Coulomb efficiency of 90.56%. A record‐high plateau capacity of 351 mAh g−1 is achieved, owing to the abundant closed micropores generated by CO2‐etching. Comprehensive in situ and ex situ tests unravel that the high Na+ storage performance originates from the pore‐filling mechanism in the closed micropores.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) represent an attractive alternative to Li-ion batteries due to sodium-abundant sources, lower cost, and better safety characteristics. However, the limited sodium-ion intercalation into graphite anodes has motivated researchers to search for new anode materials of NIBs. Herein, we demonstrate that laser-irradiated fly ash carbon (FAC), which is a waste by-product of the oil-burning process, can be a promising carbon anode of NIBs. The laser irradiation approach yields three synergistic benefits: (1) introducing carbonyl and carboxylic functional groups that increase adsorption capacity, (2) structurally transforming amorphous carbon into graphitic nanoplatelets to boost dynamic intercalation, and (3) enabling an additive and binder-free electrode to increase gravimetric energy density. The laser-irradiated fly ash carbon (LFAC) anode exhibits an excellent specific charge capacity of 356 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g, which is significantly higher than that of the FAC anode (119 mAh/g). At the end of the cycling measurement, the LFAC anode delivers a capacity of 250 mAh/g, which is three times higher than the untreated FAC anode (80 mAh/g).",

        "abstract": "Combining the advantage of metal, metal sulfide, and carbon, mesoporous hollow core-shell Sb/ZnS@C hybrid heterostructures composed of Sb/ZnS inner core and carbon outer shell are rationally designed based on a robust template of ZnS nanosphere, as anodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). A partial cation exchange reaction based on the solubility difference between Sb2 S3 and ZnS can transform mesoporous ZnS to Sb2 S3 /ZnS heterostructure. To get a stable structure, a thin contiguous resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) layer is introduced on the surface of Sb2 S3 /ZnS heterostructure. The effectively protective carbon layer from RF can be designed as the reducing agent to convert Sb2 S3 to metallic Sb to obtain core-shell Sb/ZnS@C hybrid heterostructures. Simultaneously, the carbon outer shell is beneficial to the charge transfer kinetics, and can maintain the structure stability during the repeated sodiation/desodiation process. Owing to its unique stable architecture and synergistic effects between the components, the core-shell porous Sb/ZnS@C hybrid heterostructure SIB anode shows a high reversible capacity, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability by turning the optimized voltage range. This novel strategy to prepare carbon-layer-protected metal/metal sulfide core-shell heterostructure can be further extended to design other novel nanostructured systems for high-performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "The high theoretical capacities and excellent redox activities motivate transitional metal sulfides (TMSs) to serve as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries. However, TMSs would experience low electronic conductivity as well as notorious polysulfides dissolution and shuttle effect during charge/discharge processes, which leads to unsatisfactory rate capability and cycling stability. Herein, TMSs‐based anode materials with NiS2 nanoparticles tightly anchoring on nitrogen‐doped graphene (NiS2/NG) via the Ni–N covalent bond have been developed through an electrostatic self‐assembly approach between exfoliated positively charged layered double hydroxide and negatively charged graphene oxide nanosheets, followed by a sulfidation process. The strong coupling between conductive and active components enables NiS2/NG to possess good structural integrity, high ion/electron conductivity, and strong polysulfides adsorption capability, ensuring fast reaction kinetics and energetically stable performance. In consequence, the NiS2/NG delivers a high capacity of 664 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, good rate performance of 545 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability with a retained capacity of 589.9 mAh g−1 after 1200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, among the best results of reported TMSs‐based anodes. The study provides an effective strategy to design heterostructured materials with strong coupling interaction for high‐efficient‐stable sodium storage.",

The abundant porous structure of the material ensures long-term cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of over 150 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 1 A g−1.

MoS2 generally presents a sheet-like structure based on its (002) lattice plane; however, such a structure tends to result in agglomeration and stacking of the sheets that cannot accommodate volume expansion, resulting in poor cyclability. Herein, grain-like MoS2 particulates (G-MoS2 ) are synthesized by sulfiding MoO3 in highly concentrated sulfur vapor, which results in epitaxial growth of MoS2 in (002), (100), and (110) lattice planes, with the product consisting of MoS2 particulates of about 300 nm coated with few-layered MoS2 nanosheets. The unique G-MoS2 architecture ensures good dispersion and sufficient distance to accommodate volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation, which effectively prevents stacking of MoS2 , maintaining structural stability. When employed as the working electrode for SIB, G-MoS2 delivers a high reversible capacity of 324 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 , retaining 312 mAh g-1 over 300 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.8 %. Even when G-MoS2 is cycled at a high current density (2.0 A g-1 ), the retained capacity is 175 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles. Comparison with literature reveals that these capacities are among the more promising reversible values reported for pure MoS2 .",

Herein, centrifugally spun binder-free N, S-doped germanium@ porous carbon nanofiber (N, S-doped Ge@ PCNFs) anodes first were synthesized using a fast, safe, and scalable centrifugal spinning followed by heat treatment and N, S doping. The morphology and structure of the resultant N, S-doped Ge@ PCNFs were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray mapping, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, while electrochemical performance of N, S-doped Ge@ PCNFs was studied using galvanostatic charge–discharge tests. The results demonstrate that a nanostructured Ge homogeneously distributed on tubular structured porous carbon nanofibers. Moreover, N, S doping via thiourea treatment is beneficial for lithium- and sodium-ion kinetics. While interconnected PCNFs buffered volume change and provided fast diffusion channels for Li ions and Na ions, N, S-doped PCNFs further improved electronic conductivity and thus led to higher reversible capacity with better cycling performance.

Based on the crystal structural analysis, the Mg doping can retain the P2 structure up to 4.3 V, thus restraining the detrimental phase transformation of P2–O2 during the Na-ion intercalation/deintercalation process. Therefore, the obtained Mg-doped P2-type cathode exhibits a reversible specific capacity of 109 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1C between 2.0 and 4.3 V and a retention rate of 81.5% after 200 cycles at 1C. In addition, the full cell consisting of Mg-doped P2-type cathode and hard carbon anode shows a capacity retention rate of 85.6% after 100 cycles. This study provides new insight into the development of durable cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Graphical abstract ",

        "abstract": "The development of graphitic carbon materials as anodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is greatly restricted by their inherent low specific capacity. Herein, nitrogen and sulfur co-doped 3D graphene frameworks (NSGFs) were successfully synthesized via a simple and facile one-step hydrothermal method and exhibited high Na storage capacity in ether-based electrolytes. A systematic comparison was made between NSGFs, undoped graphene frameworks (GFs) and nitrogen-doped graphene frameworks (NGFs). It is demonstrated that the high specific capacity of NSGFs can be attributed to the free diffusion of Na ions within the graphene layer and reversible reaction between -C-Sx-C- covalent chains and Na ions thanks to the large interplanar distance and the dominant -C-Sx-C- covalent chains in NSGFs. NSGF anodes, therefore, exhibit a high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) (92.8%) and a remarkable specific capacity of 834.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. Kinetic analysis verified that the synergetic effect of N/S co-doping not only largely enhanced the Na ion diffusion rate but also reduced the electrochemical impedance of NSGFs. Postmortem techniques, such as SEM, ex situ XPS, HTEM and ex situ Raman spectroscopy, all demonstrated the extremely physicochemically stable structure of the 3D graphene matrix and ultrathin inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films formed on the surface of NSGFs. Yet it is worth noting that the Na storage performance and mechanism are exclusive to ether-based electrolytes and would be inhibited in their carbonate ester-based counterparts. In addition, the corrosion of copper foils under the synergetic effect of S atoms and ether-based electrolytes was reported for the first time. Interestingly, by-products derived from this corrosion could provide additional Na storage capacity. This work sheds light on the mechanism of improving the electrochemical performance of carbon-based anodes by heteroatom doping in SIBs and provides a new insight for designing high-performance anodes of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metallic tin has been considered as one of the most promising anode materials both for lithium (LIBs) and sodium ion battery (NIBs) because of a high theoretical capacity and an appropriate low discharge potential. However, Sn anodes suffer from a rapid capacity fading during cycling due to pulverization induced by severe volume changes. Here we innovatively synthesized pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@carbon nanofibers (TiO2-Sn@CNFs) via electrospinning and atomic layer deposition to suppress pulverization-induced capacity decay. In pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@CNFs paper, nano-Sn is uniformly dispersed in carbon nanofibers, which not only act as a buffer material to prevent pulverization, but also serve as a conductive matrix. In addition, TiO2 pipe as the protection shell outside of Sn@carbon nanofibers can restrain the volume variation to prevent Sn from aggregation and pulverization during cycling, thus increasing the Coulombic efficiency. The pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@CNFs show excellent electrochemical performance as anodes for both LIBs and NIBs. It exhibits a high and stable capacity of 643 mA h/g at 200 mA/g after 1100 cycles in LIBs and 413 mA h/g at 100 mA/g after 400 cycles in NIBs. These results would shed light on the practical application of Sn-based materials as a high capacity electrode with good cycling stability for next-generation LIBs and NIBs.",

However, their practical applications are severely impeded by large volume expansion, unstable solid-electrolyte interfaces (SEI), and sluggish reaction kinetics during cycling. Herein, a surface engineering of tin nanorods via N-doped carbon layers (Sn@NC) and an interface engineering strategy to improve the electrochemical performance in SIBs are reported. In particular, the authors demonstrate that uniform surface modiﬁcation can eﬀectively facilitate electron and sodium transport kinetics, conﬁne alloy pulverization, and simultaneously synergize interactions with the ether-based electrolyte to form a robust organic-inorganic SEI. Moreover, it is discovered that the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte with strong stability and an optimized Na + solvation structure can co-embed the carbon layer to achieve fast reaction kinetics. Consequently, Sn@NC anodes deliver extra-long cycling stability of more than 10 000 cycles. The full cell of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ║ Sn@NC exhibits high energy density (215 Wh kg − 1 ), excellent high-rate capability (reaches 80% capacity in 2 min), and long cycle life over a wide temperature range of − 20 to 50 ° C.",

However, the sodium-ion storage mechanism of hard carbons remains ambiguous due to the unclear relationship between their microstructures and sodium-ion storage performance. This work reports several hard carbons with different pore structures by the carbonization of different lignin precursors, and further studies the relationship between their microstructures and sodium-ion storage performance. Corn cob lignin, pine lignin, and acetylated pine lignin with different molecular structures were selected as the precursors for the preparation of hard carbons. It is found that hard carbon prepared by corn cob lignin has the highest closed pore volume, resulting in the highest plateau capacity. The formation of closed pores is due to the formation of micropores at low pyrolysis temperatures. The micropores then transform into closed pores at high carbonization temperatures. N2 adsorption/desorption, CO2 adsorption/desorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering are used to analyze the pore architectures of the obtained hard carbons, and a method for calculating the closed pore volume is proposed.

The symmetrical SIBs employing Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 (NVP) as both the cathode and anode are considered very promising due to negligible volume changes and longer cycle life. However, the structural changes associated with the electrochemical reactions of symmetrical SIBs employing NVP have not been widely studied. Previous studies on symmetrical SIBs employing NVP are believed to undergo one mole of Na+ storage during the electrochemical reaction. However, in this study, it is shown that there are significant differences during the electrochemical reaction of the symmetrical NVP system. The symmetrical sodium-ion cell undergoes ≈2 moles of Na+ reaction (intercalation and deintercalation) instead of 1 mole of Na+ . A simultaneous formation of Na5 V2 (PO4 )3 phase in the anode and NaV2 (PO4 )3 phase in the cathode is revealed by synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A symmetrical NVP cell can deliver a stable capacity of ≈99 mAh g-1 , (based on the mass of the cathode) by simultaneously utilizing V3+ /V2+ redox in anode and V3+ /V4+ redox in cathode.

        "title": "Rapid Closed Pore Regulation of Biomass‐derived Hard Carbons Based on Flash Joule Heating for Enhanced Sodium Ion Storage",
        "abstract": "Closed pores are essential for enhancing the low‐potential (<0.1 V) plateau capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency of hard carbon (HC) anode materials for energy‐dense sodium‐ion batteries. However, the lack of simple and effective closed‐pore construction strategies has severely hindered their future commercialization. Herein, a rapid closed‐pore regulation strategy for biomass‐derived HCs is proposed through pre‐heat treatment followed by flash Joule heating (FJH). The pre‐heat treatment is critical for transforming vulnerable biomass into high‐carbonizability frameworks that are resistant to over‐graphitization. FJH treatment helps to generate enriched closed pores surrounded by the resulting carbon walls with expanded interlayer spacing as accessible Na+ channels. This strategy shows remarkable universality and applicability for biomass feedstocks, enabling rapid conversion of various carbonization‐vulnerable precursors to high‐yield (e.g. HC600‐J‐1500 compared with HC25‐J‐1500, ≈14‐fold yield increase) and closed‐pore enriched HCs. The optimized sample demonstrates an outstanding reversible capacity of 377 mAh g−1 with a superior initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%, which stands in a record value prepared with FJH and is even competitive via conventional carbonization. Comprehensive tests reveal that the efficient Na storage originates from the pore‐filling mechanism in the closed nanopores. This work suggests a facile and universal closed‐pore regulation approach for the rational design of high‐performance HCs.",

        "title": "Towards enhanced sodium storage of anatase TiO2via a dual-modification approach of Mo doping combined with AlF3 coating.",
        "abstract": "Recent studies on anatase TiO2 have demonstrated its capability of performing as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) even though, due to poor conductivity, realistic applications have not yet been foreseen. In order to try to address this issue, herein, we shall introduce a cost effective and facile route based on the co-precipitation method for the synthesis of Mo-doped anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with AlF3 surface coating. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Mo-doped anatase TiO2 nanoparticles deliver an ∼40% enhanced reversible capacity compared to pristine TiO2 (139.8 vs. 100.7 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C after 50 cycles) due to an improved electronic/ionic conductivity. Furthermore, upon AlF3 coating, the overall system can deliver a much higher reversible capacity of 178.9 mA h g-1 (∼80% increase with respect to pristine TiO2) with good cycling stability and excellent rate capabilities of up to 10 C. The experimental results indicate that the AlF3 surface coating could indeed effectively reduce the solid electrolyte interfacial resistance, enhance the electrochemical reactivity at the surface/interface region, and lower the polarization during cycling. The improved performance achieved using a cost-effective fabrication approach makes the dually modified anatase TiO2 a promising anode material for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal selenides (TMSs) have emerged as prospective anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), owing to their considerable theoretical capacity and intrinsic high electronic conductivity. Whereas, TMSs still suffer from poor rate capability and inferior cycling stability induced by sluggish kinetics and severe volume changes during de/sodiation processes. Herein, a hierarchical composite consisting of a zinc-cobalt bimetallic selenide yolk and nitrogen-doped double carbon shell (denoted as ZnCoSe@NDC) is engineered and fabricated successfully. The architecture of the as-fabricated material improves the Na-ion storage performance via increasing the electron transfer kinetics, accommodating volume expansion, and mitigating the generation of by-products. As expected, the ZnCoSe@NDC electrode delivers superior sodium storage performance with long cycling stability (344.5 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 over 2000 long-term cycles) and high-rate performance (319.2 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1 ). Meanwhile, the NVP@C//ZnCoSe@NDC full SIB cells are constructed successfully, retaining 96.3% of its initial capacity at 0.5A g-1 after 200 loops. The outstanding electrochemical performance and the construction of hybrid SIBs will have far-reaching influences on the development of the various rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are increasingly on demand owning to their prospect as an inexpensive alternative to Li-ion batteries. However, designing electrode materials with satisfactory rate capacity performance requires high electron transport and Na+ conductivity, which is extremely challenging. Herein, we report a hexadecylamine (HDA)-mediated synthesis of NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) electrodes via one-step solvothermal process. The addition of HDA material (1) enables the formation of a carbon coating that improves the electron conductivity and (2) importantly serves as a structure-directing agent reducing the NTP-impurity phases in which the transport of Na+ ions are sluggish. As a result, the synthesized NTP anode delivers superior rate of capacity retention of 77.8% under the 100-fold increase in current densities. Moreover, outstanding specific capacity of 117.9 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and capacity retention of 88.6% after 1500 cycles at 1 C can be obtained. The findings of this work provide new opportunity to design SIBs electrodes with superior electrical and ionic conductivity.",

        "title": "Small but mighty: Empowering sodium/potassium‐ion battery performance with S‐doped SnO2 quantum dots embedded in N, S codoped carbon fiber network",
        "abstract": "SnO2 has been extensively investigated as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) due to its high Na/K storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics, low electronic conductivity, and large volume changes during charge and discharge hinder the practical applications of SnO2‐based electrodes for SIBs and PIBs. Engineering rational structures with fast charge/ion transfer and robust stability is important to overcoming these challenges. Herein, S‐doped SnO2 (S–SnO2) quantum dots (QDs) (≈3 nm) encapsulated in an N, S codoped carbon fiber networks (S–SnO2–CFN) are rationally fabricated using a sequential freeze‐drying, calcination, and S‐doping strategy. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the integration of S–SnO2 QDs with N, S codoped carbon fiber network remarkably decreases the adsorption energies of Na/K atoms in the interlayer of SnO2–CFN, and the S doping can increase the conductivity of SnO2, thereby enhancing the ion transfer kinetics. The synergistic interaction between S–SnO2 QDs and N, S codoped carbon fiber network results in a composite with fast Na+/K+ storage and extraordinary long‐term cyclability. Specifically, the S–SnO2–CFN delivers high rate capacities of 141.0 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1 in SIBs and 102.8 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 in PIBs. Impressively, it delivers ultra‐stable sodium storage up to 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1 and potassium storage up to 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1. This study provides insights into constructing metal oxide‐based carbon fiber network structures for high‐performance electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices.",

        "abstract": "Considerable efforts have been exerted to understand the formation and properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in sodium ion batteries. However, the puzzling existence and role of SEI behind the huge volume changes of the graphite electrodes need to be answered. Herein, the reason of how ether-derived SEI maintains excellent reversibility despite the huge volume changes during cycling is unraveled. Theoretical simulations and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrate the formation mechanism of an SEI between the graphite anode and electrolyte. Furthermore, the high mechanical tolerance of the ether-derived SEI is confirmed in atomic force microscopy. A depth profile of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy points to a multilayer structure of the ether-derived SEI. The outer layer comprises organics (sodium alkoxide), while the inorganics (Na2 CO3 , NaF) in interior region are mixed with some organics. Notably, the presence of organics ensures the adaptability of the SEI to the volume expansion of graphite during cycling, and the concentrated distribution of inorganics improves the Young's modulus (resistance to deformation). Therefore, the graphite anode exhibits high cycle stability (96.6% capacity retention ratio at 1 A g-1 over 860 cycles) and efficiency (≈99.5%).",

        "abstract": "Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) analogues have emerged as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, owing to their cost-effectiveness, high theoretical capacity, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical application is hindered by [Fe(CN)6] defects, negatively impacting capacity and cycle stability. This work reports a hollow layered Fe-PB composite material using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTA) as a chelating and etching agent by the hydrothermal method. Compared to benzoic acid, our approach significantly reduces defects and enhances the yield of Fe-PB. Notably, the hollow layered structure shortens the diffusion path of sodium ions, enhances the activity of low-spin Fe in the Fe-PB lattice, and mitigates volume changes during Na-ion insertion/extraction into/from Fe-PB. As a sodium-ion battery cathode, this hollow layered Fe-PB exhibits an impressive initial capacity of 95.9 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 1 A g-1. Even after 500 cycles, it still maintains a considerable discharge capacity of 73.1 mAh g-1, showing a significantly lower capacity decay rate (0.048%) compared to the control sample (0.089%). Moreover, the full cell with BTA-PB-1.6 as the cathode and HC as the anode provides a considerable energy density of 312.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 291.0 W kg-1. This research not only enhances the Na storage performance of Fe-PB but also increases the yield of products obtained by hydrothermal methods, providing some technical reference for the production of PB materials using the low-yield hydrothermal method.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are applied to cold‐resistant energy storage hindered by phase transitions and sluggish Na+ migration of traditional carbonate‐based electrolytes at low temperatures. The desolvation of Na+ is a crucial step in impeding the transport of Na+, which primarily attributes to the robust solvent coordination of Na+. Herein, a low‐temperature adaptive electrolyte with an ultraweakly coordinated 1,3‐dioxolane (DOL) is designed for constructing anion‐rich solvation structure in a diglyme (G2)‐based electrolyte. The electronegativity of the oxygen atoms of G2 is attenuated by dipole‐dipole interaction between DOL and G2. As the temperature drops, the weakened Na+‒O (G2) interaction leads to increased anionic coordination and less solvent coordination, facilitating the desolvation of Na+. This anionic‐enhanced solvation structure contributes to the formation of stable solid electrolyte interface at the hard carbon (HC) anode, which accelerates Na+ transport and diminishing the voltage polarization at low temperatures. Consequently, the HC anode can retain a high capacity of 203.9 mAh g‒1 (1 C) at ‒50 °C, and the pouch cell composed of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 at ‒30 °C achieves a capacity retention of 92.43% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C.

        "abstract": "SnS2 has been extensive studied as an anode material for sodium storage owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, whereas the unsatisfied initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) caused by the partial irreversible conversion reaction during the charge/discharge process is one of the critical issues that hamper its practical applications. Hence, heterostructured SnS2/Mn2SnS4/carbon nanoboxes (SMS/C NBs) have been developed by a facial wet-chemical method and utilized as the anode material of sodium ion batteries. SMS/C NBs can deliver an initial capacity of 841.2 mAh g-1 with high ICE of 90.8%, excellent rate capability (752.3, 604.7, 570.1, 546.9, 519.7, and 488.7 mAh g-1 at the current rate of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 A g-1, respectively), and long cycling stability (522.5 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles). The existence of SnS2/Mn2SnS4 heterojunctions can effectively stabilize the reaction products Sn and Na2S, greatly prevent the coarsening of nanosized Sn0, and enhance reversible conversion--alloying reaction, which play a key role in improving the ICE and extending the cycling performance. Moreover, the heterostructured SMS coupled with the interacting carbon network provides efficient channels for electrons and Na+ diffusion, resulting in an excellent rate performance.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbons have showed promising application potential as anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but adjusting the texture of hard carbons to manipulate their electrochemical behaviors remains a great challenge. In this work, a Cu-activation strategy is developed to control the defects of hard carbon nanofibers to achieve slope-reigned Na-ion storage behaviors. This method can effectively create defect-rich carbon texture, but not induce a soaring of surface area. With the addition of Cu-activator, carbon nanofibers with increasing defects are synthesized by electrospinning and subsequent annealing. When used as anode for SIBs, reversible capacity of carbon nanofibers is increased with the increasing of defects. Simultaneously, slope capacity gradually increases, while low voltage plateau capacity reduces. Especially, reversible capacity of Cu-activated nanofibers with more defects can be increased to 315 mA h g-1 with almost no plateau capacity compared with 203 mA h g-1 of inactivated nanofibers with plateau capacity of 26%. Noticeably, the initial Coulombic efficiency (70%) of the activated nanofibers is just slightly lower than that (72%) of inactivated one. The Cu-activated nanofibers also demonstrates superb rate-performance and long cycle lifetime. Therefore, this work shows a new pathway for design of defect-rich hard carbons with superior Na-ion storage performance.",

        "title": "Tuning the electronic energy level of covalent organic frameworks for crafting high-rate Na-ion battery anode.",
        "abstract": "Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) possess ordered accessible nano-channels. When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "Researchers have focused on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to low precursor costs and abundant reserves. However, low efficiency of anode materials hinders SIB commercialization, mainly due to large ionic radius and slow kinetics of Na+. Metal selenides such as Sb2Se3 have regarded as promising anode materials of SIBs due to high theoretical capacities. Despite this, the practical application has been limited by the poor rate capability, conductivity, and stability. In this study, one-dimensional Sb2Se3 nanorods and nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) combined with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been developed as an effective anode material of SIBs. The uniform distribution of N-CQDs in the Sb2Se3 coated CNFs (Sb2Se3/CNFs) anode results in the highest reversible capacity of 647.9 mAhg−1 at 0.05 Ag-1. Moreover, the Sb2Se3 and N-CQDs coated CNFs (Sb2Se3@N-CQDs/CNFs) anode presents a good rate performance and retains a high reversible capacity of 444.7 mAhg−1 at a high current density of 0.4 Ag-1. Additionally, the Sb2Se3@N-CQDs/CNFs anode demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 78.8% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to low volume expansion and good conductivity due to carbon coating and addition of N-CQDs. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique is also used to examine Na+ diffusion coefficients.",

Herein, we develop a thermal conductive agent and controlled oxidation method to fabricate potato starch-based carbon microspheres in which natural potato starch is used as a precursor. Impressively, inert carbon nanospheres as thermal conductive agent can promote starch particles heating uniformity, thus preventing fusion during oxidation and significant shortening of the oxidation time. When used as an anode in SIBs, the optimized PC-1400 (carbonization temperature is 1400 °C) exhibits a high capacity of 303.5 mA h g−1 and a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.6% at 0.02 A g−1. Additionally, an assembled full battery (PC-1400//NaNi0.5Mn1.5O4) delivers outstanding rate performance of >77% (10C/0.5C) at 10C, reflecting the remarkable application potential of the as-prepared anode.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are becoming an increasingly important complement to lithium‐ion batteries. However, while extensive knowledge on the preparation of Li‐ion batteries with excellent cycling behavior exists, studies on applicable long‐lasting sodium‐ion batteries are still limited. Therefore, this study focuses on the cycling stability of batteries composed of Na3V2(PO4)3/C based cathodes and hard carbon anodes. It is shown that full‐cells with a decent stability are obtained for ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte and the conducting salt NaPF6. With cathode loadings of 1.2 mAh/cm2, after cell formation discharge capacities up to 92.6 mAh/g are obtained, and capacity retentions >90 % over 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C/0.5 C are observed. It is shown that both, the additive fluoroethylene carbonate and impurities in the electrolyte, negatively affect the overall discharge capacity and cycling stability and should therefore be avoided. Remarkably, the internal resistances of well‐balanced and well‐built cells did not increase over 1500 cycles and 5 months of testing, which is a very promising result regarding the possible lifespan of the cells. The initial loss of active sodium ions in hard carbon remains a major problem, which can only be partially reduced by proper balancing.",

In this study, three biomass wastes (spent coffee grounds, sunflower seed shells and rose stems) were investigated as potential materials for hard carbon preparation combining a two-step method consisting on Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC), to remove the inorganic impurities and increase the carbon content, and a subsequent pyrolysis process. The use of HTC as pretreatment prior to pyrolysis improves the specific capacity in all the materials compared to the ones directly pyrolyzed by more than 100% at high C-rates. The obtained capacity ranging between 210 and 280 mAh g-1 at C/15 is similar to the values reported in literature for biomass-based hard carbons. Overall, HC obtained from sunflower seed shell performs better than that obtained from the other precursors with an Initial Coulombic Efficiency (ICE) of 76% and capacities of 120 mAh g-1 during 1000 cycles at C with a high capacity retention of 86-93%.",

In such a design, even after the decomposition of PSBs during the annealing process, the PSBs successfully provide ample space between the nanosheets, enabling a structure with long-term stability and high ionic conductivity. Importantly, the PSBs are decomposed and simultaneously reacted with oxidized iron-phosphide (Fe-POx) on the surface of the nanosheets to reduce into FeP. As a result, the expanded FeP NSs@rGO results in a high content of FeP (52.3%) and remarkable electrochemical performances when it is used for sodium-ion battery anodes. The expanded FeP NSs@rGO exhibits a high capacity of 916.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, a superior rate capability of 440.9 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1, and a long-term cycling stability of 85.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1.

        "abstract": "NiS1.23 Se0.77 nanosheets closely attached to the internal surface of hollow mesoporous carbon sphere (HMCS) to form a NiS1.23 Se0.77 nanosheets embedded in HMCS (NSSNs@HMCS) composite as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is reported by a facile synthesis route. The anode exhibits a superior reversible capacity (520 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 ), impressive coulombic efficiency (CE) of up to 95.3%, a high rate capacity (353 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 ), excellent capacity retention at high current density (95.6%), and high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) (95.1%). Firstly, the highest ICE for NiS2 /NiSe2 -based anode can be ascribed to ultrathin layered structure of NiS1.23 Se0.77 nanosheet and highly efficient electron transfer between the active material and HMCS. Secondly, the optimized NiS2 /NiSe2 heterostructure at the nanoscale of the inside HMCS is formed after the first discharge/charge cycles, which can provide rich heterojunction interfaces/boundaries of sulfide/selenides to offer faster Na+ pathways, decrease the Na+ diffusion barriers, increase electronic conductivity, and limit the dissolution of polysulfides or polyselenides in the electrolyte. Finally, the hollow structure of the HMCS accommodates the volume expansion, prevents the pulverization and aggregation issues of composite materials, which can also promote outstanding electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "This study examines how current collector support chemistry (sodiophilic intermetallic Na2Te vs. sodiophobic baseline Cu) and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Capacity and current (6 mAh cm-2, 0.5-3 mA cm-2) representative of commercially relevant mass loading in anode-free sodium metal battery (AF-SMBs) are analyzed. Synchrotron X-ray nanotomography and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) are combined with cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) microscopy. Highlighted are major differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation e.g. (110) vs. (100) and (211) with support and deposition rate. Within the SEI, sodium fluoride (NaF) is more prevalent with Te-Cu versus sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with baseline Cu. Due to competitive grain growth the preferred orientation of sodium crystallites depends on film thickness. Mesoscale modelling delineates the role of SEI (ionic conductivity, morphology) on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attention as promising low-cost energy storage devices in future grid-scale energy management applications. Bismuth is a promising anode for SIBs due to its high theoretical capacity (386 mAh g-1 ). Nevertheless, the huge volume variation of Bi anode during (de)sodiation processes can cause the pulverization of Bi particulates and rupture of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), resulting in quick capacity decay. It is demonstrated that rigid carbon framework and robust SEI are two essentials for stable Bi anodes. A lignin-derived carbonlayer wrapped tightly around the bismuth nanospheres provides a stable conductive pathway, while the delicate selection of linear and cyclic ether-based electrolytes enable robust and stable SEI films. These two merits enable the long-term cycling process of the LC-Bi anode. The LC-Bi composite delivers outstanding sodium-ion storage performance with an ultra-long cycle life of 10 000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g-1 and an excellent rate capability of 94% capacity retention at an ultrahigh current density of 100 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "O3‐type cathode material with high theoretical capacity possesses significant potential for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the irreversible phase transition, structural volume change and poor Na+ transmission efficiency, caused by Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+, lead to the inferior cycling lifespan. Herein, the nonequilibrium‐driven local electron spin‐state modulation at Mn site with Sn4+ substitution is proposed to stabilize the NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode. With this, the controlled irreversible phase transition and volume expansion during charge/discharge and fast Na+ transportation channel is achieved. Therefore, the modulated NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode can contribute to improved capacity of 144.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C rate and long‐term cycling over 200 cycles with 80.1% retention by comparison with the counterpart (132.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C) and 54.1% retention. Noted that the elevated Na+ diffusion kinetics corresponding to high‐rate capability is also demonstrated (93.2 mAh g−1 at 10 C rate). Furthermore, the full battery equipped with hard carbon anode shows an energy density of 381.05 Wh kg−1 and the 76.8% retention after 200 cycles. This work highlights the regulation of electron spin‐state from the insight of modification Jahn–Teller effect would shed a new perception on the design for the advanced layered cathode materials and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium-ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost-effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (<130 mAh g-1) and high redox potential (>0.6 V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high-capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs) via co-intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t-GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18 V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7 % over 550 cycles and a high-rate capacity of 588.4 mAh g-1 at 6 C (10 min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259 Wh kg-1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in-situ generated space among t-GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.",

Nevertheless, their practical applications are hindered by finite cycle life and inferior rate performance because of large volume expansion, polyselenide dissolution, and sluggish dynamics. Herein, the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)-coated FeSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in NC nanoboxes (termed FeSe2@NDC NBs) are fabricated through the facile thermal selenization of polydopamine-wrapped Prussian blue precursors. In this composite, the existing nitrogen-doped dual carbon layer improves the intrinsic conductivity and structural integrity, while the unique porous yolk-shell architecture significantly mitigates the volume swelling during the sodium/desodium process. Moreover, the derived Fe-N-C bonds can effectively capture polyselenide, as well as promote Na+ transportation and good reversible conversion reaction. As expected, the FeSe2@NDC NBs deliver remarkable rate performance (374.9 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1) and long-cycling stability (403.3 mA h g-1 over 2000 loops at 5.0 A g-1).

SB has a great balance of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which prevents full graphitization of the pyrolyzed carbon but ensures a sufficiently ordered carbon structure for Na+ transport. Compared with HC derived from waste apples, which are pectin-rich and have less cellulose than SB, SB-derived HC (SB-HC) has fewer defects and a lower oxygen content. SB-HC thus has a higher first-cycle sodiation/desodiation coulombic efficiency and better cycling stability. In addition, SB-HC has a unique flake-like morphology, which can shorten the Na+ diffusion length, and higher electronic conductivity (owing to more sp2 -hybridized carbon), resulting in superior high-rate charge-discharge performance to apple-derived HC. The effects of pyrolysis temperature on the material characteristics and electrochemical properties, evaluated by using chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, are systematically investigated for both kinds of HC.",

The synthesized BOHNs nanosheets feature mixed α- and β-phases and rich surface/edge-active sites. When utilized as anode materials for rechargeable batteries, dual-phase BOHNs deliver an initial discharge capacity as high as 647.6 mAh g-1 and an increased capacity of over 200 mAh g-1 remained after 260 cycles for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and a stable cycling capacity at ~50 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). A novel flexible 2D/1D/2D structure is further developed by implanting 2D BOHNs into conductive 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 2D graphene to form composite (BOHNCG) paper as free-standing anodes for both LIBs and SIBs. The capacity of 2D/1D/2D BOHNCG as a LIB anode reaches 823.5 mAh g-1, corresponding to an enhancement of ~27 %, and maintains at >110 mAh g-1 after 80 cycles as a SIB anode with greatly improved cycling stability. This work verifies the promising potential of 2D BOHNs for practical energy-related devices and enriches the current research on emerging 2D nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Fluorocarbon (CxFy) anode materials were developed for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries through a facile one-step carbonization of a single precursor, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Interconnected carbon network structures were produced with doped fluorine in high-temperature carbonization at 500-800 °C. The fluorocarbon anodes derived from the PVDF precursor showed higher reversible discharge capacities of 735 mAh g-1 and 269 mAh g-1 in lithium- and sodium-ion batteries, respectively, compared to the commercial graphitic carbon. After 100 charge/discharge cycles, the fluorocarbon showed retentions of 91.3% and 97.5% in lithium (at 1C) and sodium (at 200 mA g-1) intercalation systems, respectively. The effects of carbonization temperature on the electrochemical properties of alkali metal ion storage were thoroughly investigated and documented. The specific capacities in lithium- and sodium-ion batteries were dependent on the fluorine content, indicating that the highly electronegative fluorine facilitates the insertion/extraction of lithium and sodium ions in rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na2 Ti3 O7 is considered one of the most promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries due to its superior safety, environmental friendliness, and low manufacturing cost. However, its structural stability and reaction mechanism still have not been fully explored. As the electron beam irradiation introduces a similar impact on the Na2 Ti3 O7 anode as the extraction of Na+ ions during the battery discharge process, the microstructure evolution of the materials is investigated by advanced electron microscopy techniques at the atomic scale. Anisotropic amorphization is successfully observed. Through the integrated differential phase contrast-scanning transmission electron microscopy technique and density functional theory calculation, a phase transition pathway involving a new phase, Na2 Ti24 O49 , is proposed with the reduction of Na atoms. Additionally, it is found that the amorphization is dominated by the surface energy and electron dose rate. These findings will deepen the understanding of structural stability and deintercalation mechanism of the Na2 Ti3 O7 anode, providing new insight into exploring the failure mechanism of electrode materials.",

Herein, we report a special polypyrrole (PPy)-coated MoS2/Bi2S3 (MBS@PPy) heterostructure composite obtained by hydrothermal reaction as an anode material for SIB. As a result, the MBS@PPy composites demonstrate exceptional electrochemical performance in SIB, exhibiting a high capacity of 361.1 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 and showcasing remarkable rate performance. Even under a high current density of 35 A g-1, the specific capacity remains stable at 280 mA h g-1 after 2,000 cycles. Furthermore, a successfully assembled Na3V2(PO4)3//MBS@PPy sodium-ion full cell can achieve an impressive specific capacity of approximately 400 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. In MBS@PPy composites, the polypyridine coating not only improves the interfacial conductivity of nanorods but also effectively inhibits the agglomeration between nanorods due to large volume changes. The MoS2 heterostructure further inhibits the coarsening of the internal structure, improves electron transport and reaction kinetics, and increases the rate capability of the material.

Herein, an innovative in‐situ electrochemically self‐driven strategy is presented to embed phosphorus nanocrystal (≈10 nm) into a Fe‐N‐C‐rich 3D carbon framework (P/Fe‐N‐C). This strategy enables rapid and high‐capacity sodium ion storage. Through a combination of experimental assistance and theoretical calculations, a novel synergistic catalytic mechanism of Fe‐N‐C is reasonably proposed. In detail, the electrochemical formation of Fe‐N‐C catalytic sites facilitates the release of fluorine in ester‐based electrolyte, inducing Na+‐conducting‐enhanced solid‐electrolyte interphase. Furthermore, it also effectively induces the dissociation energy of the P‐P bond and promotes the reaction kinetics of P anode. As a result, the unconventional P/Fe‐N‐C anode demonstrates outstanding rate‐capability (267 mAh g−1 at 100 A g−1) and cycling stability (72%, 10 000 cycles).

In this work, SnS2 with a unique nanowall array (NWA) structure is fabricated by one-step pulsed spray evaporation chemical vapor deposition (PSE-CVD), which could be used directly as binder-free and carbon-free anodes for SIBs. The SnS2 NWA electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 576 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 and enhanced cycling stability. Attractively, an excellent rate capability is demonstrated with ∼370 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1, corresponding to a capacity retention of 64.2% at 500 mA g-1. The superior sodium storage capability of the SnS2 NWA electrode could be attributed to outstanding electrode design and a rational growth process, which favor fast electron and Na-ion transport, as well as provide steady structure for elongated cycling.",

The structure-capacity-potential correlation not only verifies the disputing \"adsorption-intercalation\" mechanisms, i.e., Na+ intercalation into local graphitic domains for the low-voltage plateaus and adsorption in fully disordered carbon for the sloping voltage profiles, but also unveils a new mechanism of Na+ adsorption on defective sites of graphitic carbon in the medium-potential sloping region.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is one of the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its cost-effectiveness and low-voltage plateau capacity. Heteroatom doping is considered as an effective strategy to improve the sodium storage capacity of HC. However, most of the previous heteroatom doping strategies are performed at a relatively low temperature, which could not be utilized to raise the low-voltage plateau capacity. Moreover, extra doping of heteroatoms could create new defects, leading to a low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, we propose a repair strategy based on doping a trace amount of P to achieve a high capacity along with a high ICE. By employing the cross-linked interaction between glucose and phytic acid to achieve the in situ P doped spherical hard carbon, the obtained PHC-0.2 possesses a large interlayer space that facilitates Na+ storage and transportation. In addition, doping a suitable amount of P could repair some defects in carbon layers. When used as an anode material for SIBs, the PHC-0.2 exhibits an enhanced reversible capacity of 343 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 with a high ICE of 92%. Full cells consisting of a PHC-0.2 anode and a Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5[Fe(CN)6] cathode exhibited an average potential of 3.1 V with an initial discharge capacity of 255 mA h g−1 and an ICE of 85%. The full cell displays excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80.3% after 170 cycles. This method is simple and low-cost, which can be extended to other energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional boron synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method is an atomically thin layer of boron with both light weight and metallicity. To investigate the potential of borophene as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries, first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. The calculated results reveal that after introducing vacancy defects, the special puckered structure becomes relatively flat and the metallic nature of the defective borophene is enhanced, while the defects in borophene can weaken sodium adsorption. A single sodium atom is preferentially absorbed on the BV site. The adsorption energies gradually reduce with an increase in sodium concentration due to the increased Na–Na repulsion. The fully sodium storage phase of borophene corresponds to NaB2 with a theoretical specific capacity of 1240 mA h g−1, which is much larger than that of other two-dimensional materials. Most interestingly, sodium ion flows in the furrows of puckered borophene are extremely fast with a low energy barrier of 30 meV. Meanwhile, sodium diffusion on borophene was found to be highly anisotropic, as further verified by the results of the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The sodiated-borophene nanostructure shows enhanced electronic conductivity during the whole sodiation process, which is superior to other anode materials. Borophene is expected to be a promising candidate with high capacity and high rate capability for anode materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

The individual nanosheet features an expanded interlayer distance of 1.02 nm and metallic characteristics, which can provide faster transport of electrons and reduce the diffusion pathway for sodium ions. Furthermore, the effects of anions in the ether-based electrolyte on the cycling performance were also investigated and optimized. As a result, such an anode can demonstrate superior capacitive behavior with excellent rate performance (388.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 307.7 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) and long-term cycling stability (285 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles).",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) is a promising candidate as a high performing anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its large interlayer spacing. However, it suffers from continued capacity fading. This problem could be overcome by hybridizing MoS₂ with nanostructured carbon-based materials but it is quite challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a single step strategy for the preparation of MoS₂ coupled with ordered mesoporous carbon nitride using nanotemplating approach which involves the pyrolysis of phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (PMA), dithiooxamide (DTO) and 5-amino-1H-tetrazole (5-ATTZ) together in the porous channels of 3D mesoporous silica template. The sulfidation to MoS₂, polymerization to carbon nitride (CN) and their hybridization occur simultaneously within a mesoporous silica template during a calcination process. The CN/MoS₂ hybrid prepared by this unique approach is highly pure and exhibits good crystallinity as well as delivers excellent performance for SIBs with the specific capacities of 605 and 431 mAh/g at current densities of 100 and 1000 mA/g respectively for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries are ideal candidates for next-generation grid-level energy storage systems. However, severe obstacles pertain with regard to the usage of metallic Na, including poor processability, dendrite growth, and violent side reactions. Herein, we design a \"carbon in metal\" anode (denoted as CiM) via a facile method by rolling a controllable amount of mesoporous carbon powder into the Na metal. The as-designed composite anode is endowed with dramatically lowered stickiness and increased hardness (3 times higher than that of pure Na metal) and strength along with improved processability, which can be fabricated into foils with varied patterns and limited thickness (down to 100 μm). Besides, nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon, which can increase the sodiophilicity, is applied to fabricate N-doped carbon in the metal anode (denoted as N-CiM), which can effectively facilitate the diffusion of Na+ ions and decrease the depositing overpotential, consequently homogenizing the Na+-ion flow and rendering a dense and flat Na deposition. Therefore, the N-CiM anode offers enhanced cycling stability for 800 h at 1 mAh cm-2 in symmetric cells and 1000 cycles with a high average Coulomb efficiency (CE) (99.8%) in full cells based on the conventional carbonate electrolyte.",

Here, we reinterpreted the essential issue about the potential of the conversion reaction and whether there is an intercalation reaction in a lithium/sodium-ion battery (LIB/SIB) with the FeP anode based on the evolution of the magnetic phase. Especially, the ever-present intercalation process in a large voltage range followed by the conversion reaction with extremely low potential was confirmed in FeP LIB, while it is mainly the conversion reaction for the sodium storage mechanism in FeP SIB. The insufficient conversion reaction profoundly limits the actual capacity to the expectedly respectable value. Accordingly, a graphene oxide modification strategy was proposed to increase the reversible capacity of FeP LIB/SIB by 99% and 132%, respectively. The results facilitate the development of anode materials with a high capacity and low operating potential.",

Even at an ultrafast charging/discharging process within 80 s, the capacity can be maintained at 201 mAh g−1 after 16 000 cycles with only 0.0012% capacity loss per cycle, one of the best high‐rate capacities and cyclabilities for NTO‐based hybrid composites.

However, the electrode interface in the conventional electrolyte is unstable, deteriorating the cycle life of the cells. Introducing functional electrolyte additives can generate stable electrode interfaces. Here, pentafluoro(phenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (FPPN) serves as a functional electrolyte additive to stabilize the interfaces of the layered oxide cathode and the hard carbon anode. The fluorine substituting groups and the π–π conjugated ─PN─ structure decrease the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and increase the highest occupied molecular orbital of FPPN, respectively, realizing the preferential reduction and oxidization of FPPN on the anode and cathode simultaneously, which results in the formation of a uniform, ultrathin, and inorganic‐rich solid electrolyte interlayer and cathode electrolyte interphase. The sodium‐ion pouch cells of 5 Ah capacity rather than coin cells are assembled to evaluate the effect of FPPN. It can retain a high capacity of 4.46 Ah after 1000 cycles, corresponding to a low decay ratio of 0.01% per cycle. The pouch cell also achieves a high energy density of 145 Wh kg−1 and a wide operating temperature of −20–60 °C.

        "abstract": "CuS have received widespread attention for application as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries due to their potent capabilities and eco-friendly properties. However, it is a challenge to achieve a high rate capability and long cycle stability owing to the heterogeneous transfer of sodium ions during charge-discharge, the interior poor electron conductivity and repeated volumetric expansion of copper sulfide. In this study, Sb-doped CuS hollow nanocubes coated with carbon shells (Sb-CuS@C) was designed and constructed as anode nanomaterials in sodium ion batteries. Thanks to the intrinsic good electron conductivity and chemical stability of carbon shells, Sb-CuS@C possesses a higher overall electron transfer as anode material, avoids agglomeration and structural destruction during the cycling. As a result, the synthesized Sb-CuS@C achieved an excellent reversible capacity of 595 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 and a good rate capability of 340 mA h g-1 at a higher 10 A g-1. DFT calculations clarify that the uniformly doped Sb would act as active sodiophilic nucleation sites to help adsorbing Na+ during discharging and leading uniform sodium deposition. This work provides a new insight into the structural and componential modification for common transition-metal sulfides towards application as anode materials in SIB.",

        "abstract": "Structural design and modification are effective approaches to regulate the physicochemical properties of TiO2, which play an important role in achieving advanced materials. Herein, a plasma‐assisted method is reported to synthesize a surface‐defect‐rich and deep‐cation‐site‐rich S doped rutile TiO2 (R‐TiO2–x‐S) as an advanced anode for the Na ion battery. An amorphous shell (≈3 nm) is induced by the Ar/H2 plasma, which brings about the subsequent high S doping concentration (≈4.68 at%) and deep doping depth. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate greatly facilitated ion diffusion, improved electronic conductivity, and an increased mobility rate of holes for R‐TiO2−x‐S, which result in superior rate capability (264.8 and 128.5 mAh g−1 at 50 and 10 000 mA g−1, respectively) and excellent cycling stability (almost 100% retention over 6500 cycles). Such improvements signify that plasma treatment offers an innovative and general approach toward designing advanced battery materials.",

        "abstract": "Preoxidation is an effective strategy to inhibit the graphitization of coals during carbonization. However, the single effect of the traditional preoxidation strategy could barely increase surface-active sites, hindering further enhancement of sodium storage. Herein, a multieffect preoxidation strategy was proposed to suppress structural rearrangement and create abundant surface-active sites. Mg(NO3)2·6H2O helps to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups into bituminous coal at 450 °C, which acted as a cross-linking agent to inhibit the rearrangement of carbon layers and promote structural cross-linking during the subsequent thermal carbonization process. Besides, the residue solid decomposition product MgO would react with carbon to create surface-active sites. The obtained coal-based hard carbon contained more pseudographitic domains and sodium storage active sites. The optimized sample could deliver an excellent capacity of 287.1 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, as well as remarkable cycling stability of capacity retention of 96.1% after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1, and notable capacity retention of 88.9% after 1000 cycles at 300 mA g-1. This work provides an effective and practical strategy to convert low-cost bituminous coal into advanced hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).",

However, the sluggish reaction kinetics is a big obstacle for the development of high-performance sodium storage electrodes.

Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the heterointerface greatly decreases sodium ion diffusion barrier and facilitates charge-transfer kinetics. Our present findings not only provide a deep analysis on the correlation between the structure and performance, but also draw inspiration for rational heterointerface engineering toward the next-generation high-performance energy storage devices. Fe_1− x S/MoS_2 heterostructure with abundant “ion reservoir” interfaces is designed to reduce sodium ion diffusion barrier and facilitate charge-transfer kinetics, thus endowing the electrode with excellent cycling stability and rate capability.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has become one of the prospective anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its application suffers from the low electron conductivity and poor ion diffusion kinetics. In this study, melting & evaporation process of neutral salt was first introduced to produce nitrogen-rich interpenetrated porous HC (NIP-HC) as anode for SIBs. Such protocol allows for the first-demonstrated porous structure for HC materials with desired electronic conductivity and much improved rate performance than that conventional porous structure. As a result, high reversible capacity (358 mAh g-1) and enhanced rate property (239.8 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1) are achieved with improved electrode kinetics and electron conductivity, because of the accelerated charge transfer derived from the unique porosity and nitrogen heteroatom-doping. More interestingly, the increase of surface area of NIP-HC does not lead to a decrease of the initial efficiency. At the same time, a high plateau capacity (172.8 mAh g-1) can be obtained below 0.1 V, which shows great potential for practical application in the full cells. As suggested by IG/ID from Raman tests, the degree of graphitization increases accompanied by the melting & evaporation process, which improves the electrical conductivity of the HC material as well. Furthermore, according to First-principle calculation, it is found that the nitrogen is conducive to increase the electron density around Fermi level, which intrinsically enhances the electrical conductivity and enriches active sites for sodium-ions storage. The result from this study has provided insights on producing interpenetrated porous HC by a simple and novel salt melting & evaporation process and enriched the methods of pore structure preparation.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has attracted considerable attention in the application of sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes, but the poor realistic capacity and low rate performance severely hinder their practical application. Herein we report a solvent mechanochemical protocol for the in situ fabrication of the HC-MXene/TiO2 electrode by functionalizing MXene to improve the electrochemical performance of the batteries. MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups reacts with HC particles in the ball milling process to form a Ti-O-C covalent cross-linked HC-MXene composite, in which the edge of the MXene nanosheets is in situ oxidized by air to form TiO2 nanorods, forming a regular 1D/2D MXene/TiO2 heterojunction structure. Ti-O-C covalent bonding can protect the heterojunction structures from pulverization and detachment from the current collector during charge/discharge cycles due to sodium-ion intercalation/detachment, thus improving the stability of the electrode structure. Meanwhile, the MXene/TiO2 heterojunction can form a 3D conductive network and provide more active sites. The resulting HC-MXene/TiO2 electrode exhibits superior electrode capacity (660 mAh g-1), making it a promising anode material for SIBs. This simple and efficient method for preparing MXene/TiO2 heterojunction-decorated HC provides a new perspective on the structural design of MXene and carbon material composites for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been regarded as a promising anode material in the field of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), with the advantages of high theoretical capacity and large interlayer spacings. Unfortunately, its intrinsic poor electrical conductivity and large volume changes during the sodiation/desodiation reactions still limit its practical application. To deal with this shortcoming, we built MoS2 nanosheet/multiwalled carbon nanotube (denoted as MoS2-MSs/MWCNTs) composites with a three-dimensional (3D) micro-spherical structure, assembled in situ from MoS2 nanosheets. These nanosheets are connected to each other by the MWCNTs network, which provides a highly conductive pathway for electrons/ions through interparticle and intraparticle interfaces, accelerating charge transfer and ion diffusion capabilities. More importantly, the carbon network can boost electrical conductivity and relieve structural strain. Consequently, the as-prepared MoS2-MSs/MWCNTs composite presents a high reversible specific capacity of 519 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 94.4% and excellent rate performance (227 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1).

        "abstract": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) are widely thought as promising choices for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their refined molecular structures and excellent reversible multielectron charge-discharge behaviors. Nevertheless, the POMs anion clusters could dissolve in the electrolyte when attacked by solvent molecules, thus reducing active sites and affecting the actual performance of these POMs-based electrodes. Herein, we report the development of a new type of electrode system that produces single-dispersed POMs molecular cluster/polydopamine/reduced graphene oxide composites ({PMo12}/PDA@rGO) through a self-assembly method. PDA acts as the role of “killing two birds with one stone”. It not only works as the linker to promote the formation of stable and uniform monodisperse {PMo12} clusters on the rGO surface, but also prevents the POMs from desorbing and dissolving upon deep cycling test. As a consequence, when used as the anode material for SIBs, the obtained {PMo12}/PDA@rGO exhibits an admirable long-term cycling performance, for instance, it holds a high Na-storage capacity of 277.5 mAh g−1 with an average Coulomb efficiency up to 99.89 % over 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1. This work offers versatile possibilities for designing POMs-based composites and provides new insight into developing single dispersed POMs for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Recent global concerns over continuously increasing air pollution and the related health risks due to automobile exhaust have shifted our attention towards green transportation. Recent decades have witnessed a revolution in portable energy-storage systems, mainly lithium-based energy-storage devices. However, the uneven distribution of global lithium reserves and its scarcity lead to huge price differences and geopolitical imbalances, and hence the research in energy-storage materials has shifted towards the development of cost-effective, abundant electrode materials. Here, NaCr(SO4)2, a transition metal-based polyanionic layered material with low cost and high stability during the charge/discharge process vs. Na, operating on the basis of the Cr3+/2+ redox couple, is presented. The test materials were characterized by techniques like XRD, FTIR, SEM, UV, XPS, TGA-DTA, and a detailed electrochemical analysis of the charge/discharge capacity of the materials is presented here. Here, the findings provide insights towards achieving a Cr3+/Cr2+ redox-couple-based sodium-ion battery with a specific capacity of 75 mA h g-1 and 150 mA h g-1 at operating voltages of 0.95 V vs. Na and 1.05 V vs. Li, respectively, with 100% coulombic efficiency. Cr2+ is a very special oxidation of Cr that cannot be obtained easily and CrTa2O6 is the only known oxide where Cr exists in the 2+ state. Here, a shift in the redox energy of the Cr3+/2+ couple was obtained due to its bonding with (SO4)2- polyanions in eldfellite that made the accessibility of Cr3+/2+ possible, resulting in the superior intercalation/deintercalation of Na and Li and the superior energy-storage capacity of the NaCr(SO4)2vs. Na/Li cell.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) anodes together with ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolytes have shown significant promise for high-performing sodium-ion batteries. However, questions remain in relation to the initial contact between the carbon surface and the EC molecules. The surface of the HC anode is complex and can contain both flat pristine carbon surfaces, curvature, nanoscale roughness, and heteroatom defects. Combining density functional theory and experiments, the effect of different carbon surface motifs and defects on EC adsorption are probed, concluding that EC itself does not block any sodium storage sites. Nevertheless, the EC breakdown products do show strong adsorption on the same carbon surface motifs, indicating that the carbon surface defect sites can become occupied by the EC breakdown products, leading to competition between the sodium and EC fragments. Furthermore, it is shown that the EC fragments can react with a carbon vacancy or oxygen defect to give rise to CO2 formation and further oxygen functionalization of the carbon surface. Experimental characterization of two HC materials with different microstructure and defect concentrations further confirms that a significant concentration of oxygen-containing defects and disorder leads to a thicker solid electrolyte interphase, highlighting the significant effect of atomic-scale carbon structure on EC interaction.",

        "abstract": "Potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) is a low-cost Prussian blue analogue (PBA) having a rigid and open framework that can accommodate large alkali ions. Herein, the synthesis of KMHCF and its application as a high-performance cathode in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) is reported. High-quality KMHCF with low amounts of crystal water and defects and with homogeneous microstructure is obtained by controlling the nucleation and grain growth by using a high-concentration citrate solution as a precipitation medium. The obtained KMHCF exhibits superior cycling and rate performance as a NIB cathode, showing 80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C and a high capacity of 95 mA h g-1 at 20 C. Unlike conventional single-cation batteries, the hybrid NIB with KMHCF as cathode and Na as anode in Na-ion electrolyte displays three reversible plateaus that involve stepwise insertion/extraction of both K+ and Na+ in the PBA framework. In later cycling, the K+ -Na+ cointercalated phase is partially converted into a cubic sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMHCF) phase due to the increasing replacement of Na+ for K+ .",

        "abstract": "Rationally designing on sundry multiphase compounds has come into the spotlight for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to enhanced structural stability and improved electrochemical performances. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism of high-active phase boundaries existing between multiphase compounds. Here, a VS4 /Bi2 S3 @C composite anode for SIBs with rich phase boundaries in heterostructure is successfully synthesized. In situ X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrate a multistep redox mechanism in the heterostructures and ex situ transmission electron microscopy results confirm that tremendous self-generated phase boundaries are obtained and well-maintained during cycling, dramatically leading to stable reaction interfaces and better structural integrity. Combining experimental and theoretical results, a self-built-in electric field forming between phase boundaries acts as a dominate driving force for Na+ transport kinetics. Benefiting from the fast reaction kinetics of phase boundaries, the heterojunction provides an efficient approach to avoid abnormal voltage failure. As expected, the VS4 /Bi2 S3 @C heterostructure displays superior sodium storage performances, especially an excellent long-term cycling stability (379.0 mAh g-1 after 1800 cycles at a current density up to 2 A g-1 ). This work confirms a critical role of phase boundaries on superior reversibility and structural stability, and provides a strategy for analogous conversion/alloying-type anodes.",

        "abstract": "Development of sodium anodes, both hard carbon (HC) and metallic, is dependent on the discovery of electrolyte formations and additives able to stabilize the interphase and support Na+ transport. Halogen salt additives are known to lower the energy barrier for the Na-ion charge transfer at the interface and facilitate stable Na plating/stripping in a symmetric cell configuration. Here, a halogen-rich additive for the sodium-ion battery electrolyte, 2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether (enflurane), is reported. Enflurane offers a simple molecular alternative to salt-based additives. The additive is also shown to improve the cycling performance of sodium metal electrodes. Our analysis demonstrates that enflurane is preferentially reduced at the HC electrode over propylene carbonate and is incorporated into the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The result is a thin, halogen-rich SEI that offers better charge transport properties and stability during cycling compared to that formed in the additive-free electrolyte. Additionally, enflurane inhibits polarization of metallic sodium electrodes, and when included in HC half-cells at 10 v/v %, it improves the reversible specific capacity and stability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are a promising substitute for lithium batteries due to the abundant resources and low cost of sodium. Herein, honeycomb-shaped MoSe2 /reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite materials are synthesized from graphene oxide (GO) and MoSe2 through a one-step solvothermal process. Experiments show that the 3D honeycomb structure provides excellent electrolyte penetration while alleviating the volume change during electrochemical cycling. An anode prepared with MoSe2 /rGO composites exhibits significantly improved sodium-ion storage properties, where a large reversible capacity of 215 mAh g-1 is obtained after 2700 cycles at the current density of 30.0 A g-1 or after 5900 cycles at 8.0 A g-1 . When such an anode is paired with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 to form a full cell, a reversible specific capacity of 107.5 mAh g-1 can be retained after 1000 cycles at the current of 1.0 A g-1 . Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization reveal the reversible storage reaction of Na ions in the MoSe2 /rGO composites. The significantly enhanced sodium storage capacity is attributed to the unique honeycomb microstructure and the use of ether-based electrolytes. This study illustrates that combining rGO with ether-based electrolytes has tremendous potential in constructing high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Metal selenides are considered as one of the most promising anode materials for Na-ion batteries owing to high specific capacity and relatively higher electronic conductivity compared with metal sulfides or oxides. However, such anodes still suffer from huge volume change upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction processes and simultaneously undergo severe shuttle effect of polyselenides, thus leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, a facile chemical-blowing and selenization strategy to fabricate 3D interconnected hybrids built from metal selenides (MSe, M = Mn, Co, Cr, Fe, In, Ni, Zn) nanoparticles encapsulated in in situ formed N-doped carbon foams (NCFs) is reported. Such hybrids not only provide ultrasmall active nanobuilding blocks (≈15 nm), but also efficiently anchor them inside the conductive NCFs, thus enabling both high-efficiency utilization of active components and high structural stability. On the other hand, Cu-driven replacement reaction is utilized for efficiently inhibiting the shuttle effect of polyselenides in ether-based electrolyte. Benefiting from the combined merits of the unique MSe@NCFs and the utilization of the conversion of metal selenides to copper selenides, the as-obtained hybrids (MnSe as an example) exhibit superior rate capability (386.6 mAh g-1 up to 8 A g-1 ) and excellent cycling stability (347.7 mAh g-1 at 4.0 A g-1 after 1200 cycles).",

However, the sodium anode showed low efficiency and poor cycling in Na-metal battery performance due to the formation of sodium dendrites and serious corrosion. In this work, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) co-doped carbon paper (NP-CP) modified with cobalt tetroxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles was prepared as the Na anode carrier (Co3O4@NP-CP), and a sodium-based composite anode (Na–Co@NP-CP) was further prepared by electrodepositing sodium. The experimental results indicate that the N, P and Co3O4 multi-doped carbon paper has good sodiophilicity, which can induce the uniform plating/stripping of Na+ ions and inhibit the growth of Na dendrites. The N, P doped carbon paper provides a high surface area and tremendous three-dimensional (3D) framework to effectively reduce the areal current density, facilitate the transfer of electrons, and enhance battery life. Therefore, Na–Co@NP-CP based symmetric cells exhibit stable cycling of over 1100 hours at current densities of 1 mA cm−2 and fixed capacity of 1 mA h cm−2. When the Na–Co@NP-CP anode couples with CO2, the assembled batteries can deliver a stable cycling of 165 cycles at current densities of 500 mA g−1 and limited capacity of 500 mA h g−1.

However, due to the large sizes of sodium and potassium ions, it is a great challenge to realize a carbon anode with high reversible capacity, long cycle life, and high rate capability. Herein, by rational design, N‐doped 3D mesoporous carbon nanosheets (N‐CNS) are successfully synthesized, which can realize unprecedented electrochemical performance for both SIBs and PIBs. The N‐CNS possess an ultrathin nanosheet structure with hierarchical pores, ultrahigh level of pyridinic N/pyrrolic N, and an expanded interlayer distance. The beneficial features that can enhance the Na‐/K‐ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetic process, shorten the diffusion length for both ions and electrons, and accommodate the volume change are demonstrated. Hence, the N‐CNS‐based electrode delivers a high capacity of 239 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 10 000 cycles for SIBs and 321 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles for PIBs.

        "title": "Unveiling the Microscopic Origin of Irreversible Capacity Loss of Hard Carbon for Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "The primary bottleneck hindering the application of hard carbon in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) anodes lies in its inadequate initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Unclear causes of capacity loss at the microscopic level restrict the improvement of hard carbon anodes. Here, two pivotal stages that influence the structure and composition of hard carbon, namely synthesis, and storage are evaluated; subsequently identifying crucial determinants contributing to irreversible capacity loss. The results suggest that undergrown carbon layers allowing the intrusion of solvent molecules into the interior of the hard carbon is a key factor during the synthesis stage, while the gradual formation of oxygen‐containing functional groups on the surface of the hard carbon is another factor leading to irreversible loss of capacity during storage stage. This research microscopically clarifies the irreversible capacity loss mechanism on hard carbon and provides guidelines for designing and applying high ICE hard carbon for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries have become popular owing to their low redox potential, high theoretical capacity, and superior energy density. But the formation of sodium dendrites during electrochemical cycles diminishes the security and longevity of these batteries. In response to this challenge, we employ lignin as a carbon source to fabricate a three‐dimensional (3D) carbon framework current collector. This framework boosts an expansive specific surface area and a wealth of oxygen‐rich functional groups. These components serve to cushion the volume fluctuations of sodium metal throughout the electrochemical cycle, directing the even deposition of sodium ions. The as‐prepared anode displays a low overpotential of ‐7 mV and a stable cycling life of 400 hours at 0.5 mA cm‐2. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the full cell can achieve a capacity of 97.6 mAh g‐1 and a capacity retention of 94.7% after 60 cycles. This research shows that using lignin as a carbon source to prepare a 3D carbon framework current collector is an effective mean to inhibit the harmful effects of sodium dendrites on batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next‐generation grid‐scale energy storage. However, the highly instable electrolyte/electrode interphases threaten the long‐term cycling of high‐energy SIBs. In particular, the instable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage causes persistent electrolyte decomposition, transition metal dissolution, and fast capacity fade. Here, this work proposes a balanced principle for the molecular design of SIB electrolytes that enables an ultra‐thin, homogeneous, and robust CEI layer by coupling an intrinsically oxidation‐stable succinonitrile solvent with moderately solvating carbonates. The proposed electrolyte not only shows limited anodic decomposition thus leading to a thin CEI, but also suppresses dissolution of CEI components at high voltage. Consequently, the tamed electrolyte/electrode interphases enable extremely stable cycling of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with outstanding capacity retention (>90%) over 3000 cycles (8 months) at 1 C with a high charging voltage of 4.3 V. Further, the NVOPF||hard carbon full cell shows stable cycling over 500 cycles at 1 C with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6%. The electrolyte also endows high‐voltage operation of SIBs with great temperature adaptability from −25 to 60 °C, shedding light on the essence of fundamental electrolyte design for SIBs operating under harsh conditions.",

Herein, nitrogen‐doped carbon (NC) was used as a multifunctional bridge to uniformly compound high‐capacity MoS2 nanoparticles with highly conductive Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to form Ti3C2Tx@MoS2/NC composite with flower‐like architecture. Ultrafine MoS2 nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to form nanosheets primary building blocks with a sandwich‐like architecture, which not only shortens the ion transfer distance but also enlarges the layer spacing of Ti3C2Tx favoring the storage of more sodium ions as well as their transport capacity. Moreover, the flower‐like structures with abundant edges can provide a ample active sites and high pseudocapacitance behavior. As a result, flower‐like Ti3C2Tx@MoS2/NC displays a high electrochemical properties with an excellent cycling stability over 2000 cycles (81.4% capacity retention) and preeminent rate capacity of 383 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Although sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising alternatives to their Li counterparts, they still suffer from challenges like slow kinetics of the sodiation process, large volume change, and inferior cycling stability. On the other hand, the presence of additional reversible conversion reactions makes the metal compounds the preferred anode materials over carbon. However, conductivity and crystallinity of such materials often play the pivotal role in this regard. To address these issues, atomic layer deposited double-anion-based ternary zinc oxysulfide (ZnOS) thin films as an anode material in SIBs are reported. Electrochemical studies are carried out with different O/(O+S) ratios, including O-rich and S-rich crystalline ZnOS along with the amorphous phase. Amorphous ZnOS with the O/(O+S) ratio of ≈0.4 delivers the most stable and considerably high specific (and volumetric) capacities of 271.9 (≈1315.6 mAh cm-3 ) and 173.1 mAh g-1 (≈837.7 mAh cm-3 ) at the current densities of 500 and 1000 mA g-1 , respectively. A dominant capacitive-controlled contribution of the amorphous ZnOS anode indicates faster electrochemical reaction kinetics. An electrochemical reaction mechanism is also proposed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. A comparison of the cycling stability further establishes the advantage of this double-anion-based material over pristine ZnO and ZnS anodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) gradually become ideal substitutes to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as a result of higher applicability in new-generation energy storage system. However, the controlled preparation of superior electrode materials for obtaining high-performance SIBs remains a challenge. In this study, a composite structure comprising three-dimensional nanoflower Sb2S3 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was successfully manufactured by applying a hydrothermal method as an emerging anode material for SIBs. Nanoflower Sb2S3@rGO exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, yielding 544.8 mAh/g at a rate of 100 mA/g, and sustained stability in the later 200 cycles, which was 75.4% of the initial value for the specific capacity. Even the current density is 2000 mA/g, a specific energy capacity of 433.4 mAh/g was obtained. The sodium storage mechanism was explored using cyclic voltammetry at different sweep speeds to clearly point out the electrochemical process of forming nanoflower Sb2S3@rGO. The results indicate that the high performance is ascribed to the particular flower-like three-dimensional structure, which provides cache space for Sb2S3 volume expansion during charge/discharge, while the addition of rGO effectively improves the overall electrical conductivity of the electrode. This work furnishes a new insight into the construction of specially structured anode materials to promote the development of SIBs.",

Cobalt in SnCoP/C stabilizes the conductive matrix of tin phosphide and promotes the diffusion kinetics of sodium.

The hollow porous structure and multiple heterointerfaces stabilize the anode by mitigating the volume changes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that induced multilevel built-in electric fields facilitate the formation of rapid ion diffusion pathways and reduce the Na+ adsorption energy, thereby boosting Na+/electron transport kinetics. The fabricated TA-Co0.85Se/ZnSe@MXene anode demonstrates outstanding long-term cycling stability of 406 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1, with an ultrahigh rate performance of 288 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1.

Both the amorphous V2O5 (a-V2O5) cathode and crystalline V2O5 (c-V2O5) cathode show good rate cycling performance and long cycling life. After five rate cycles, the reversible capacities of both the cathodes were almost unchanged at different current densities from 40 to 5120 mA g-1. Long cycling tests with 10 000 cycles were carried out and the two cathodes exhibit excellent cycling stability. The c-V2O5 cathode retains a high specific capacity of 54 mA h g-1 after 10 000 cycles at 2560 mA g-1 and can be charged within 80 s. Interestingly, the a-V2O5 cathode possesses higher reversible capacities than the c-V2O5 cathode at low current densities, whereas it is inversed at high current densities. The c-V2O5 cathode shows faster capacity recovery from 5120 to 40 mA g-1 than the a-V2O5 cathode. When discharged at 80 mA g-1 (long discharge time of 140 min) and charged at 640 mA g-1 (short charge time of 17 min), the a-V2O5 cathode shows a higher discharge capacity than its c-V2O5 counterpart.

However, the interfacial incompatibility and sodium dendrite hazards still hinder its applications. Herein, a conversion-alloy reaction-induced interface ionic/electronic redistribution strategy, constructing a gradient sodiophilic and electron-blocking interphase consisting of sodium-tin (Na-Sn) alloy and sodium fluoride (NaF) between NASICON ceramic electrolyte and Na anode is proposed. The Nax Sny alloy-rich layer near the side of the sodium electrode acts as a superior conductor to enhance the anodic sodium-ion transport dynamics while the NaF-rich layer near the side of the ceramic electrolyte serves as an electron insulator to confine the interfacial electron turning ability, achieving uniform and dendrite-free Na deposition during the cycling. Profiting from the synergistic effect of the gradient interphase, the critical current density (CCD) of the assembled Na symmetric cell is significantly increased to 1.7 mA cm-2 and the cycling stability of that is as high as 1200 h at 0.5 mA cm-2 . Moreover, quasi-solid-state sodium batteries with both Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 and NaNi1/3 Fe1/3 Mn1/3 O2 cathode display outstanding electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-based materials are the most advantageous candidates for anode in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, their practical utilization has been hampered by their low reversible capacity and poor cyclic performance. In this study, novel double-shell and hierarchical porous N-doped carbon nanocages (DHNCNs) were prepared by a soft template-assisted strategy in the presence of ZIF-8 as the matrix, dopamine hydrochloride as the nitrogen and carbon source, and F127/TMB as the soft template. The study found that the carbonization temperature has a significant impact on the surface area, pore volume, interlayer distance, defect concentration, and N content of DHNCNs, thereby altering their electrochemical performance. The DHNCNs-900 synthesized at 900 °C exhibit the best sodium-ion storage performance, including high discharge capacity of 235.5 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1, outstanding rate performance of 209.4 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1, and excellent long-term cycling stability of 171.3 mAh g−1 after 900 cycles at 500 mA g−1. The exceptional electrochemical performance of the DHNCNs-900 electrode is induced by synergistic effects of the double-shell, hierarchical porous, N-doped, and hollow structure. Additionally, the electrochemical kinetic analysis indicates that DHNCNs-900 electrode possesses a reinforced sodium-ion storage mechanism by the pseudo-capacitive-control behavior. In conclusion, this study presents a superior anode material for SIBs and exhibits a simple method for synthesizing N-doped carbon nanocage materials, holding promise for advanced energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbons (HCs) are extensively investigated as the potential anodes for commercialization of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical deployment of HC anode suffers from the retarded Na+ diffusion at the high-rate or low-temperature operation scenarios. Herein, a multiscale modification strategy by tuning HC microstructure on the particle level as well as replenishing extra Na+ reservoir for the electrode through a homogeneous presodiation therapy is presented. Consequently, the coulombic efficiency of HC anode can be precisely controlled till the close-to-unit value. Detailed kinetics analysis observes that the Na+ diffusivity can be drastically enhanced by two orders of magnitude at the low potential region (< 0.1 V vs. Na+ /Na), which accelerates the rate-limiting step. As pairing the presodiated HC anode (≈5.0 ± 0.2 mg cm-2 ) with the NaVPO4 F cathode (≈10.3 mg cm-2 ) in the 200 mAh pouch cell, the optimal balance of the cyclability (83% over 1000 cycles), low-temperature behavior till -40 °C as well as the maximized power output of 1500 W kg-1 can be simultaneously achieved. This synergistic modification strategy opens a new avenue to exploit the reversible, ultrafast Na+ storage kinetics of HC anodes, which thus constitutes a quantum leap forward toward high-rate SIB prototyping.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) represent a promising energy storage technology with great safety. Because of their high operating potential, superior structural stability, and prominent thermal stability, polyanion-type phosphates have garnered significant interest in superior prospective cathode materials for SIBs. Nevertheless, the disadvantages of poor intrinsic electronic conductivity, sluggish kinetics, and volume variation during sodiation/desodiation remain great challenges for satisfactory rate performance and cycle stability, which severely hinder their further practical applications. In this work, by adjusting the amounts of pretreated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) added intentionally at the beginning of the preparation, biphasic polyanion-type phosphate materials (marked as NFC) are synthesized through a one-pot solid state reaction methodology, which are composed of CNT-interwoven Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) and a small amount of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). Benefiting from the improved electronic conductivity and unique composition and structure, the optimized sample (labeled as NFC-2) illustrates exceptional cycle stability and remarkable rate performance. The discharge capacities of the NFC-2 electrode are 114.8 and 78.6 mAh g-1 tested at 20 and 5000 mA g-1, respectively. Notably, such an electrode still gives out 75.7% capacity retention upon 10 000 cycles at 5000 mA g-1. In situ X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrates that the NFC-2 cathode has outstanding structural reversibility during charge/discharge cycles. More importantly, such a biphasic material has achieved impressive electrochemical performance within a wide operating temperature range of -20-50 °C. When temperature is decreased to -20 °C, the NFC-2 electrode still delivers an initial discharge capacity of 102.4 mAh g-1 and exhibits a remarkable capacity retention of 97.8% even after 500 cycles at 50 mA g-1. In addition, the sodium-ion full cell assembled by integrating NFC-2 cathode and hard carbon anode shows a satisfying energy density of 431.3 Wh kg-1 at 20 mA g-1 with a better long-term cycle performance. The synergistic effect among high energy NVPF, conductive CNT, and stable NVP may lead to the great improvement in the electrochemical sodium storage performance of the NFC-2 sample. Such biphasic polyanion-type phosphate materials will inject new ideas into the material design for SIBs with excellent electrochemical performance and further promote practical applications of this advanced energy storage technology.",

        "abstract": "The low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) greatly hinders the practical application of MXenes in sodium-ion batteries. Herein, theoretical calculations confirm that -F and -OH terminations as well as the tetramethylammonium ion (TMA+) intercalator in sediment Ti3C2Tx (s-Ti3C2Tx) MXene possess strong interaction with Na+, which impedes Na+ desorption during the charging process and results in low ICE. Consequently, Na+-intercalated sediment Ti3C2Tx (Na-s-Ti3C2Tx) is constructed through Na2S·9H2O treatment of s-Ti3C2Tx. Specifically, Na+ can first exchange with TMA+ of s-Ti3C2Tx and then combine with -F and -OH terminations, thus leading to the elimination of TMA+ and preshielding of -F and -OH. As expected, the resulting Na-s-Ti3C2Tx anode delivers considerably boosted ICE values of around 71% in carbonate-based electrolytes relative to s-Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, electrolyte optimization is employed to improve ICE, and the results demonstrate that an ultrahigh ICE value of 94.0% is obtained for Na-s-Ti3C2Tx in the NaPF6-diglyme electrolyte. More importantly, Na-s-Ti3C2Tx exhibits a lower Na+ migration barrier and higher electronic conductivity compared with s-Ti3C2Tx based on theoretical calculations. In addition, the cyclic stability and rate performance of the Na-s-Ti3C2Tx anode in various electrolytes are comprehensively explored. The presented simple strategy in boosting ICE significantly enhances the commercialization prospect of MXenes in advanced batteries.",

A 100 % increase in capacity of sodium cells (full-cell configuration) has been observed when using the new sodium salt at a C-rate of 2C.

The present work demonstrates that single‐phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal–organic framework (MOF)‐derived N‐doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high‐rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long‐cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC‐based Na‐ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274 Wh kg−1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state‐of‐the‐art Na‐ion full cells based on P‐, Se‐, or S‐containing binary/ternary anodes to date.",

The improved ICE of the Sb8Bi1 anode is due to the alloying of bismuth (Bi) that prevents irreversible interfacial reactions during the sodiation process. Unlike carbon buffers, the use of Bi will reduce the number of side reactions between the carbon buffer and sodium. Moreover, Bi2O3 can promote the reduction of Sb2O3 and reduce the particle size of Sb from ∼20 μm to below 300 nm. The electrolytic products can be modulated by controlling the cell voltages and electrolysis time. The electrolytic Sb8Bi1 anode delivered a capacity of 625 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles with an ICE of 87.1% at 0.1 A g-1 and even 625 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 over 100 cycles. Hence, alloying Bi into Sb is an effective way to make a long-lasting Sb anode while maintaining a high Coulombic efficiency.",

Additionally, pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N functionalities significantly increase surface defect density, promoting rapid electron and ion transport.

Herein, an insight into failure mechanisms within high-voltage layered cathodes is unveiled, while a two-in-one tactic of charge localization and coherent structures is devised to improve structural integrity and Na+ transport kinetics, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Elevated Jahn-Teller [Mn3+O6] concentration on the particle surface during sodiation, coupled with intense interlayer repulsion and adverse oxygen instability, leads to irreversible damage to the near-surface structure, as demonstrated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ characterization techniques. It is further validated that the structural skeleton is substantially strengthened through the electronic structure modulation surrounding oxygen. Furthermore, optimized Na+ diffusion is effectively attainable via regulating intergrown structures, successfully achieved by the Zn2+ inducer. Greatly, good redox reversibility with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6%, impressive rate capability (86.5 mAh g-1 with 70.4% retention at 10C), and enhanced cycling stability (71.6% retention after 300 cycles at 5C) are exhibited in the P2/O3 biphasic cathode.

Two typical classes of materials including transition metal oxides and polyanion compounds have been under intensive investigation as cathodes for SIBs; however, they are still limited to poor stability or low capacity of the state-of-art. Herein, we report a low cost carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 with simultaneous high capacity and good stability, owing to the highly pure Na-rich triclinic phase and the carbon-incorporated three-dimensional network morphology. The present carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 demonstrates the highest reversible capacity of 181.0 mAh g-1 to date with multielectron redox reaction that occurred among various polyanion-based SIBs cathodes, which achieves a close-to-100% initial Coulombic efficiency and a stable cycling with 88% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. In addition, such an electrode shows excellent stability either charged at a high voltage of 4.5 V or heated up to 800 °C.

The cathode is crucial in determining energy storage capability of the battery. Polyanionic compounds exhibit great potential as cathode materials due to their stable three-dimensional structure, high working voltage, and intrinsic safety. Although there has been scholarly interest in vanadium and iron-based polyanionic compounds, their practical application has been delayed due to environmental concerns or poor energy density. Manganese-based polyanionic compounds are becoming strong candidates because they are cost-effective, have high voltage capabilities, and are environmentally friendly. In recent years, there have been notable advancements in this field. This study examines the present level of research on manganese-based polyanionic compounds of fluorophosphates, pyrophosphate, sulphates, silicates and mixed type materials, emphasizing the difficulties they encountered in terms of their structure, morphology, and electrochemical characteristics. Additionally, it explores potential future paths for progress and proposes solutions to overcome significant obstacles.

Still, the structure instability originating from irreversible oxygen redox at high voltage remains a challenge. Here, a high sustainability cobalt-free P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 X0.01 O2  (X = Ti/Si) cathode is developed. The outstanding capacity retention and voltage retention after 150 cycles are obtained in half-cells. The finding shows that Ti localizes on the surface while Si diffuses to the bulk of the particles. Thus, Ti can act as a protective layer that alleviates side reactions in carbonate-based electrolyte. Meanwhile, Si can regulate the local electronic structure and suppress oxygen redox activities. Notably, full-cells with hard carbon (≈300-335 W h kg-1 based on the cathode mass) deliver the capacity retention of 83% for P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 Si0.01 O2  and 66% for P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 Ti0.01 O2  after 500 cycles; this electrochemical stability is the best compared to other reported cathodes based on oxygen redox at present.

However, carbon compositing process would bring up fluorine-loss issue and the designation of tailor-made nanocomposite remains challenging. Here, we realize the optimal regulation on crystal growth by virtue of a fluorinated ionic liquid usage, which could compensate the fluorine-loss during high-temperature annealing process.

The tailored I-NVPF@rGO exhibits enhanced conductivity and optimized crystal planes, resulting in excellent rate capability and improved energy density.

        "abstract": "Layer metal oxides demonstrate great commercial application potential in sodium-ion batteries, while their commercialization is extremely hampered by the unsatisfactory cycling performance caused by the irreversible phase transition and interfacial side reaction. Herein, trimethoxymethylsilane (TMSI) is introduced into electrolytes to construct an advanced cathode/electrolyte interphase by tuning the solvation structure of anions. It is found that due to the stronger interaction between ClO4- and TMSI than that of ClO4- and PC/FEC, the ClO4--TMSI complexes tend to accumulate on the surface of the cathode during the charging process, leading to the formation of a stable cathode/electrolyte interface (CEI). In addition, the Si species with excellent electronic insulation ability are distributed in the TMSI-derived CEI film, which is conducive to inhibiting the continuous side reaction of solvents and the growth of the CEI film. As a result, under a current density of 250 mA g-1, the capacity retention of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode after 200 cycles in the TMSI-modified electrolyte is 74.4% in comparison to 51.5% of the bare electrolyte (1 M NaClO4/PC/5% FEC). Moreover, the NFM cathode shows better kinetics, with the specific discharge capacity increasing from 22 to 67 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1. It also demonstrates greatly improved rate capability, cycling stability, and Coulombic efficiency under various operating conditions, including high temperature (55 °C) and high cutoff voltage (2.0-4.3 V vs Na+/Na).",

        "title": "Unlocking iron-based mixed-phosphate cathode for sodium-ion batteries through off-stoichiometry",
        "abstract": "The off-stoichiometric iron-based phosphate (Na_3.12Fe_2.44(P_2O_7)_2, denoted as Na_3.12) as a low cost and high structure stability cathode material has been widely studied for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the lower theoretical specific capacity (117 mAh·g^−1) has seriously limited its practical application. In this work, we incorporate varying proportion of sodium-iron phosphate (NaFePO_4) into the Na_3.12 to form a series of new high specific capacity mixed-phosphates Na_3.12+ x Fe_2.44+ x (P_2O_7)_2(PO_4)_ x cathode materials for SIBs. After optimizing the introduction amount of NaFePO_4 into Na_3.12, the practical reversible of Na_3.12+ x Fe_2.44+ x (P_2O_7)_2(PO_4)_ x increased from 92 to 125.2 mAh·g^−1. The nano-size Na_5.12Fe_4.44(P_2O_7)_2(PO_4)_2 cathode material shows a reversible specific capacity of 125.2 mAh·g^−1 at 0.1 C in SIBs. Even at 60 C, it still exhibits a reversible specific capacity of 93.3 mAh·g^−1 and keeps a capacity retention ratio of 87% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Thereby, we present a novel approach to design a series of off-stoichiometric mixed-phosphates cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Iron-based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium-ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core-shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny-void space (THoCS-0.6Ni) via a one-step spray-drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieve volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS-0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g-1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS-0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at -20 °C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core-shelled structure with tiny-void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast-charge and low-temperature storage features.",

        "abstract": "The supply of battery-grade nickel to produce positive electrodes of sodium-ion batteries may soon become insufficient. For this reason, it is crucial to find new electrode materials that minimize its use or even fully remove this element from synthesis. We have prepared a Na0.67Mg0.05FexNiyMnzO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2; y = 0.05, 0.15; 0.6 ≤ z ≤ 0.9) series with low Ni and Fe contents by a single and easily scalable sol-gel method. This procedure yields high-purity and crystalline samples as evidenced by structural, morphological, and spectroscopic studies, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical tests showed an exceptional performance for the F0N05 sample with the lowest (Ni + Fe) contents, at 5 C (ca. 100 mA h g-1), and good capacity retention after 100 cycles. This excellent behaviour was also evidenced when cycling at -15 °C. These results were confirmed by electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, that evidenced a fast exchange of sodium ions due to a significant capacitive contribution and high apparent diffusion coefficients. Post-mortem analysis of the F0N05 electrodes by XRD showed the reversible insertion and the absence of detrimental P2-O2 and P2-P2' transitions, while XPS spectra demonstrated the reversible redox activity of both transition metals and oxygen.",

        "title": "Unlocking anionic redox activity in O3-type sodium 3d layered oxides via Li substitution",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries could be an attractive alternative to Li-ion technology but designing high energy density and moisture stable Na-based cathodes is challenging. Adjusting synthesis conditions and stoichiometry, an O3-type NaLi_1/3Mn_2/3O_2 phase with anionic redox activity is reported. Sodium ion batteries, because of their sustainability attributes, could be an attractive alternative to Li-ion technology for specific applications. However, it remains challenging to design high energy density and moisture stable Na-based positive electrodes. Here, we report an O3-type NaLi_1/3Mn_2/3O_2 phase showing anionic redox activity, obtained through a ceramic process by carefully adjusting synthesis conditions and stoichiometry. This phase shows a sustained reversible capacity of 190 mAh g^−1 that is rooted in cumulative oxygen and manganese redox processes as deduced by combined spectroscopy techniques. Unlike many other anionic redox layered oxides so far reported, O3-NaLi_1/3Mn_2/3O_2 electrodes do not show discernible voltage fade on cycling. This finding, rationalized by density functional theory, sheds light on the role of inter- versus intralayer 3 d cationic migration in ruling voltage fade in anionic redox electrodes. Another practical asset of this material stems from its moisture stability, hence facilitating its handling and electrode processing. Overall, this work offers future directions towards designing highly performing sodium electrodes for advanced Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is of particular interest for sodium-ion batteries due to its satisfactory properties and low production cost. However, it commonly suffers from deterioration in air, side reactions with electrolyte and structural instability during delithiation/lithiation (especially at high voltage). In this work, Y-doping is applied to NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2, and the crystallographic structure, morphology and electrochemical properties are characterized. An appropriate amount of Y-dopant significantly improves the structural stability of the cathode when charged over 4 V, resulting in higher capacity and more importantly, remarkably improved cycling stability. The optimized cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 156.33 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 150 mA g−1) in a Na-metal half cell, with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 86.94 %. After being cycled at 0.5 C for 300 cycles, it exhibits a capacity retention of 68.42 %, whereas the undoped sample only maintains 28.40 % of its initial capacity under the same test conditions. When tested in a full cell with a hard carbon anode, the Y-doped cathode also shows a promising cycle life that a capacity retention of 83.12 % after 200 cycles is obtained. X-ray diffraction measurement after long-term cycling reveals that the Y-doping enhances the structural stability of the cathode.",

        "abstract": "P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 is a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost, high theoretical capacity, and non-toxicity. However, it still suffers from unsatisfactory cycling stability mainly incurred by the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and electrolyte decomposition on the electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, the P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2@PPy (NNMO@PPy) composite applied as cathode materials for SIBs is obtained by introducing conductive polypyrrole (PPy) as coating layer on the P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) microspheres. Numerous physical characterization methods indicate that the PPy layer was uniformly coated on the surface of NNMO microspheres without change in phase structure and morphology. The PPy coating layer can alleviate Mn dissolution and effectively suppress the side reactions between the electrolyte and electrode during cycling. The optimal NNMO@PPy-9 with 9 wt% PPy delivers a high capacity of 127.4 mAh/g at the current density at 150 mA g−1, an excellent cyclic stability with high capacity retention of 80.5 % after 300 cycles, and enhanced rate performance (169.3 mAh/g at 15 mA g−1 while 89.8 mAh/g at 600 mA g−1). Furthermore, hard carbon (−)//NNMO@PPy-9 (+) full cell delivers a high energy density of 305.1 Wh kg−1 and superior cycling stability with 88.2 % capacity retention after 150 cycles. In-situ X-ray diffraction experiment and electrochemical characterization verify the highly reversible structure evolution and robust P2-type phase structure of NNMO@PPy-9 for fast and stable Na+ diffusion. This effective strategy of using conductive PPy as a coating layer may provide a new insight to modify NNMO surface, improving the cycling stability and rate capability.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxide materials have attracted widespread attention as advanced cathodes for sodium-ion batteries due to their excellent rate potential and attractive cost-effectiveness. However, the unexpected dissolution of transition metal (TM) ions and the annoying Jahn-Teller effect leading to rapid capacity fading and low capacity remain obstacles to their commercial applications. To tackle these handicaps, we introduced a synergistic effect based on surface modification and doping strategies to obtain air-stable sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) protective aluminum (Al)-doped manganese-based layered oxide cathode. The surface Na2CO3 nanolayer is created by converting residual alkali ions, which enhances the air stability of the cathode and scavenges hydrofluoric acid into the fluoride-rich cathode electrolyte interphase layer during cycling, resulting in a steady interfacial interaction. In addition, Al doping causes TMO6-octahedral shrinkage and inhibits structural distortion, thereby affecting structural evolution and phase transition. These findings provide valuable insights into improving the performance of layer oxide cathodes for next-generation low-cost batteries.",

        "abstract": "Achieving multicationic redox reactions with low lattice strain accumulation upon repeated sodiation/desodiation processes is pivotal for developing high‐energy and long‐durability Na superionic conductor (NASICON)‐type cathodes but still a formidable task. Herein, a novel NASICON‐structured high‐entropy Na3.4VMn0.2Fe0.2Al0.3Cr0.3(PO4)3 (HE‐NVMFACP) cathode is delicately devised, where the entropy‐driving stepwise Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+/V5+, Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+, and Cr3+/Cr4+ redox couples not only trigger the multielectron transfer chemistry, but also alleviate the lattice strain accumulation. Consequently, the HE‐NVMFACP cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 151.3 mAh g−1 with an admirable energy density of 520.5 Wh kg−1, and an impressive “quasi‐zero strain” behavior (1.33% cell volume change) during the whole charge‐discharge process. Meanwhile, an excellent rate capability of 90.4 mAh g−1 at 50 C and an ultralong cycling life of 91.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles are demonstrated. Advanced in situ/ex situ techniques reveal the complete solid‐solution behavior and highly reversible stepwise multicationic redox mechanism of HE‐NVMFACP upon Na+ uptake/release, and the rapid electrode process kinetics of HE‐NVMFACP are confirmed by systematic electrochemical measurements and theoretical computations. Furthermore, the HE‐NVMFACP||hard carbon Na‐ion full batteries are assembled in both coin and pouch configurations, manifesting bright application prospects. The present high‐entropy strategy provides invaluable perspectives for designing high‐energy and long‐life NASICON‐cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na-superionic-conductor (NASICON)-type Na3V2(PO4)3 is considered as one of the potential cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its inherent low electronic conductivity and non-adjustable voltage plateau is an urgent issue hindrance to its practical application. Hereof, the concept of multicationic-substituted high-entropy doping is innovatively utilized to modify the fine structure within crystals, enhance electronic conductivity, and achieve excellent local diffusion kinetics and high redox activity according to theoretical calculations. The carbon-free Na3V1.8(CrMnFeZnAl)0.2(PO4)3 (HE-NVP-0.2) cathode exhibits a maximum specific capacity of 119.8 mA h g−1, achieved through V3+/V4+/V5+ redox reactions, while maintaining an impressive capacity retention rate of 80 % after 3000 cycles at 10 C. Moreover, the in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that the incorporation of multi-(high entropy) elements induces a stable transition state, facilitating rapid phase transitions. Combined with in-situ digital image correlation (DIC), reversible structural evolution has been verified at both micro and macro scales. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, the HE-NVP-0.2//HC full cells exhibit exceptional energy density/power density characteristics while simultaneously maintaining excellent high-rate performance and prolonged cycle life (2000 stable cycles at 50 C). The regulation of configurational entropy enables the realization of an intermediate phase in the equilibrium state and makes the unlikely potential regulation possible, presenting innovative approaches to expedite the commercialization of high-power SIBs.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides based on the elements Fe and Mn have attracted great interest as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathode materials owing to their inexpensive metal constituents and high specific capacity. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable batteries based on the most abundant elements, such as sodium and iron, have a great potential in the development of cost effective sodium ion batteries for large scale energy storage devices. We report, for the first time, crystallite size dependent structural investigations on maricite-NaFePO4 through X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. Rietveld refinement analysis on the X-ray diffraction data reveals that a decrease in the unit cell parameters leads to volume contraction upon reduction in the crystallite size. Further, the atomic multiplet simulations on X-ray absorption spectra provide unequivocally a change in the site symmetry of transition metal ions. The high resolution oxygen K-edge spectra reveal a substantial change in the bonding character with the reduction of crystallite size, which is the fundamental cause for the change in the unit cell parameters of maricite-NaFePO4. In parallel, we performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on maricite-NaFePO4 with different sodium ion vacancy concentrations. The obtained structural parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations on the mesostructured maricite-NaFePO4. The volumetric changes with respect to crystallite size are related to the compressive strain, resulting in the improvement in the electronic diffusivity. The nano-crystalline maricite-NaFePO4 with improved kinetics will open a new avenue for its usage as a cathode material in sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis and low cost. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA causes poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, we develop a novel Ni and Cu co-doped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode via a simple co-precipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn-Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as-prepared Mn-based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1).

The NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NaNFM) cathode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) has not received, sufficient attention concerning its thermal safety compared to its electrochemical properties. Herein, we investigated the thermal stability of NaNFM, exothermic reaction and electrochemical performance of NaNFM with various electrolytes. The comprehensive electrochemical performance of NaNFM in different electrolytes followed this sequence: sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) > sodium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) > sodium perchlorate (NaClO4)- based electrolytes. Additionally, ethylene carbonate (EC): propylene carbonate (PC)- type electrolytes displayed superior cycling stability compared to ethylene carbonate (EC): diethyl carbonate (DEC)- type electrolytes. Moreover, the heat flow profiles demonstrated that the thermal stability between NaNFM and various electrolytes could be ordered according to the total heat release as: NaClO4 < NaPF6 < NaTFSI-based electrolyte. X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analyses were carried out to investigate the changes in crystal structure, morphology and valence state of thermal reaction products after microcalorimetric analysis experiments.

One of the Prussian Blue analogs, sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaxMn[Fe(CN)6], MnHCF), experiences significant initial capacity decrease due to Jahn–Teller distortion depending on the sodium content. In contrast, Sodium copper hexacyanoferrate (NaxCu[Fe(CN)6], CuHCF) exhibits lower reversible sodium-ion content compared to MnHCF and exhibits excellent cycling stability. We designed direct-strike coprecipitation process to synthesize nanocomposite of PBAs. The proposed encapsulated composite has been successfully synthesized by encapsulating MnHCF with self-assembled CuHCF, leading to substantial improvement in the cycling performance of MnHCF. The encapsulated composite demonstrated a capacity of 106.2 mAh g−1 even at high current rate. Regarding cycle stability, it retained over 68 % of its initial capacity even after 500 cycles. The ion conductivity was calculated through the Galvanostatic intermittent titration test (GITT), and the encapsulated composite exhibited higher ion conductivity than pristine MnHCF. Ex-situ post-analysis was conducted to confirm structural evolution of samples. The severe structural collapse of MnHCF led to electrode damage, whereas the encapsulated composite demonstrated excellent electrode condition.

The NaPO3 nanolayer on the surface effectively stabilizes the crystal structure by inhibiting surface parasitic reactions and increasing the observed average voltage. Superior cyclic stability is exhibited by the surface-modified cathode (80.1% vs 63.6%) after 150 cycles at 1 C in the wide voltage range of 2.0 V-4.2 V (vs Na+ /Na).

        "abstract": "The two‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3 in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is hindered by low electronic and ionic conductivity. To address this problem, a surface‐N‐doped NVP encapsulating by N‐doped carbon nanocage (N‐NVP/N‐CN) is rationally constructed, wherein the nitrogen is doped in both the surface crystal structure of NVP and carbon layer. The surface crystal modification decreases the energy barrier of Na+ diffusion from bulk to electrolyte, enhances intrinsic electronic conductivity, and releases lattice stress. Meanwhile, the porous architecture provides more active sites for redox reactions and shortens the diffusion path of ion. Furthermore, the new interphase of Na2V2(PO4)3 is detected by in situ XRD and clarified by density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a lower energy barrier during the fast reversible electrochemical three‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na2V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3. Therefore, as cathode of sodium‐ion battery, the N‐NVP/N‐CN exhibited specific capacities of 119.7 and 75.3 mAh g−1 at 1 C and even 200 C. Amazingly, high capacities of 89.0, 86.2, and 84.6 mAh g−1 are achieved after overlong 10000 cycles at 20, 40, and 50 C, respectively.

In this study, we successfully synthesized a series of K-doped P2-Na0.67−xKxNi0.33−yMn0.67CuyO2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.06, 0.10, 0 < y < 0.16) cathode materials using a convenient sol-gel method.

And the electrode retains a specific capacity of 101.6 mAh g−1, with a good capacity retention rate of 84.5 % after 100 cycles. The enhanced cycle performance can be attributed to the appropriate amount of K+ ions occupying the Na+ sites and providing support between the transition metal layers, which stabilizes the crystal structure and improves cycle stability of the electrode. Moreover, larger-sized K+ ions expand the Na+ diffusion channel, facilitating Na+ diffusion. Furthermore, the pouch cell of NKNMC0.06 delivers a capacity of 0.28 Ah during the first discharge and maintains a capacity retention rate of 78.2 % after 100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Facilitating anion redox chemistry is an effective strategy to increase the capacity of layered oxides for sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of literature pertaining to the oxygen redox chemistry of O3-type layered oxide cathode materials. This work systematically investigates the effect of Fe doping on the anionic oxygen redox chemistry and electrochemical reactions in O3-NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2. The results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electrons of the O 2p occupy a higher energy level. In the ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) of O 1s, the addition of Fe facilitates the lattice oxygen (O\n                        n\n                     \n                     −) to exhibit enhanced activity at 4.45 V. The in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrates that the doping of Fe effectively suppresses the Y phase transition at high voltages. Furthermore, the Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) data indicate that Fe doping significantly increases the Na+ migration rate at high voltages. Consequently, the substitution of Fe can elevate the cut-off voltage to 4.45 V, thereby facilitating electron migration from O2−. The redox of O2−/O\n                        n\n                     \n                     − (n < 2) contributes to the overall capacity.

This work not only demonstrates the beneficial impact of Fe substitution for promoting the redox activity and reversibility of O2− in O3-type layered oxides, but also guarantees the structural integrity of the cathode materials at high voltages (>4.2 V). It offers a novel avenue for investigating the anionic redox reaction in O3-type layered oxides to design advanced cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na4VMn(PO4)3 (NVMP), with its three-dimensional framework and high operating voltage, has demonstrated great potential as a cathode material for Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its performance is hindered by the Jahn-Teller effect from Mn3+ and slow Na+ diffusion kinetics, leading to capacity fade and structural instability. In this study, Li+ and K+ cations were separately doped into the NVMP structure to improve electrochemical performance. Li-doping enhanced the V3+/V4+ redox activity and significantly reduced the Jahn-Teller effect, contributing to a high-capacity retention of 97.7 % after 100 cycles at 1 C and 96.1 % after 1000 cycles at 10 C. This high-rate stability highlights the role of Li-doping in maintaining structural integrity and efficient ion transport under fast cycling conditions. Meanwhile, K-doping improved the structural stability by stabilizing V3+ oxidation states, leading to a capacity retention of 110.3 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 C and a discharge capacity of 99 mAh g−1 at 10 C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further confirmed that both Li+ and K+ doping suppressed the Jahn-Teller effect by regulating the Mn3+ environment, which contributed to the improved cycling stability and Na+ cation diffusion kinetics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of alkali metal cations doping as a strategy to enhance the cycling performance of NVMP cathodes for high-performance SIBs.",

Electrolyte composition, which plays an indispensable and critical role in determining cycle stability and electrode/electrolyte interfacial properties, are of great significance to possess good compatibility with electrode materials, especially NVPF1+2x. Here, different electrolyte systems, including commonly used 1.0 M NaPF6/diglyme (NP-005), 1.0 M NaPF6 /propylene carbonate (PC)/5.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (NP-009), 1.0 M NaClO4 /ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC) =1: 1 Vol%/5.0% FEC (NC-019) and 1.0 M NaClO4 /PC (NC-013), are systematically investigated and compared for NVPF1+2x cathode. NVPF1+2x  with NP-009 shows a more superior cycle stability and rate capability at 1 C~10 C (1 C=130 mA g -1 ) than that of NC-019 and NC-013 while NVPF1+2x  with NP-005 shows the best high-rate capability at 20 C~50 C.  It demonstrates that NVPF1+2x  with NP-005 exhibits a thin, efficient and NaF-rich CEI layer with less polarization, smaller interfacial resistance and faster Na+ diffusion than that of NC-019 and NC-013 since they suffered from a thick, over-grown CEI layer due to the consecutive decomposition of FEC, NaClO4 and/or linear DMC. This work provides new insights for the battery community to gain more comprehensive understanding about the interfacial chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Layered cathodes have been recognized as potential advanced candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but the poor electrochemical performance has seriously hindered their further development. Herein, an ordered Na2/3[Ni2/9Mg1/9Mn5/9Ti1/9]O2 (NMMT) is designed and investigated as a high-performance cathode for SIBs through the synergistic effect of Mg and Ti codoping. Compared to the single Mg- or Ti-doped materials, NMMT clearly exhibits superstructure ordering diffraction peaks, and neutron diffraction further confirms that the diffraction peaks can be well indexed by a larger supercell P63, rather than the common unit cell P63/mmc by X-ray diffraction (XRD). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy also approves the ordering arrangement. This material shows an obvious capacity activation process during the first cycles, thus delivering 113 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C (close to the theoretical value). Excellent rate capability even at 15 C and cycling stability after 500 cycles between 2.0 and 4.3 V can also be achieved, indicating that an ordered cathode is still promising. Besides, a single-phase reaction mechanism is revealed by ex situ/in situ XRD experiments. This study offers some insights into the material design and characterization of layered oxide cathodes for high-performance SIBs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is regarded as the most promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), due to its high structural stability and low-cost environmental friendliness. However, its intrinsic low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion restricted the fast-charge and low-temperature sodium storage. Herein, an NFPP composite encapsulated by in-situ pyrolytic carbon and coupled with expanded graphite (NFPP@C/EG) was constructed via a sol-gel method followed by a ball-mill procedure. Due to the dual-carbon modified strategy, this NFPP@C/EG only enhanced the electronic conductivity, but also endowed more channels for Na+ diffusion. As cathode for SIBs, the optimized NFPP (M-NFPP@C/EG) delivers excellent rate capability (capacity of ∼80.5 mAh/g at 50 C) and outstanding cycling stability (11000 cycles at 50 C with capacity retention of 89.85%). Additionally, cyclic voltammetry (CV) confirmed that its sodium storage behavior is pseudocapacitance-controlled, with in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further elucidating improvements in electrode reaction kinetics. At lower temperatures (0 °C), M-NFPP@C/EG demonstrated exceptional cycling performance (8800 cycles at 10 C with capacity retention of 95.81%). Moreover, pouch cells also exhibited excellent stability. This research demonstrates the feasibility of a dual carbon modification strategy in enhancing NFPP and proposes a low-cost, high-rate, and ultra-stable cathode material for SIBs.",

However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen-redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn-based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6 mAh g-1 at 10C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn-O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O-O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long-enduring reversible oxygen-redox activity (100% high capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C and 84.28% retention after 300 cycles at 5C). Time-resolved operando two-dimensional X-ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero-strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra-low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1C: 1.75%, 1C: 0.31%, 5C: 0.04%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211 Wh kg-1 with superior performance.

However, on the other hand, the conductivity as well as the available capacity of the polyanion compounds are still poor, which limits their applications; moreover, some polyanion cathode operate at low voltage, which reduces the energy density and raises the cost of the battery system. We here try to summarize the recent progress of polyanion compounds as cathode materials for SIB. These compounds are categorized based on the metal redox couple, including V‐, Cr‐, Mn‐, Fe‐, Co‐, and Ni‐polyanion compounds. Our attention is specifically drawn to properties such as reversible redox voltage, capacity, cycling stability, and sodium storage mechanisms.

        "abstract": "P2-type Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 (MF) has attracted great interest as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity and low cost. However, its poor cyclic stability and rate performance hinder its practical applications, which is largely related to lattice oxygen instability. Here, we propose to coat the cathode of SIBs with Li2ZrO3, which realizes the \"three-in-one\" modification of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+/Zr4+ doping improves both the cycle stability and rate performance, and the underlying modification mechanism is revealed by a series of characterization methods. The doping of Zr4+ increases the interlayer spacing of MF, reduces the diffusion barrier of Na+, and reduces the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+, thus inhibiting the Jahn-Teller effect. The Li2ZrO3 coating layer inhibits the side reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping enhances the stability of lattice oxygen and the reversibility of anionic redox, which improves the cycle stability and rate performance.

We unveil that such a configuration featuring inhomogeneous coordination environment of transition metal (TM) elements, can enable enhanced gliding energy (-0.38 vs -0.58 eV) of TMO2 slabs upon desodiation both theoretically and experimentally, which underlies the fundamental origin of the outstanding structural stability of HEO materials.

        "abstract": "P3-layered transition oxide cathodes have garnered considerable attention owing to their high initial capacity, rapid Na+ kinetics, and less energy consumption during the synthesis process. Despite these merits, their practical application is hindered by the substantial capacity degradation resulting from unfavorable structural transformations, Mn dissolution and migration. In this study, we systematically investigated the failure mechanisms of P3 cathodes, encompassing Mn dissolution, migration, and the irreversible P3-O3' phase transition, culminating in severe structural collapse. To address these challenges, we proposed an interfacial spinel local interlocking strategy utilizing P3/spinel intergrowth oxide as a proof-of-concept material. As a result, P3/spinel intergrowth oxide cathodes demonstrated enhanced cycling performance. The effectiveness of suppressing Mn migration and maintaining local structure of interfacial spinel local interlocking strategy was validated through depth-etching X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction. This interfacial spinel local interlocking engineering strategy presents a promising avenue for the development of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "A mixed iron-manganese based pyrophosphate cathode, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, for rechargeable sodium ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "The development of secondary batteries based on abundant and cheap elements is vital. Among various alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising due to the abundant resources and low cost of sodium. While there are many challenges associated with the SIB system, cathode is an important factor in determining the electrochemical performance of this battery system. Accordingly, ongoing research in the field of SIBs is inclined towards the development of safe, cost effective cathode materials having improved performance. In particular, pyrophosphate cathodes have recently demonstrated decent electrochemical performance and thermal stability. Herein, we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and thermal behavior of a novel Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 cathode for SIBs. The material was synthesized through a solid state process. The structural analysis reveals that the mixed substitution of manganese and iron has resulted in a triclinic crystal structure (P1[combining macron] space group). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is electrochemically active with a reversible capacity of ∼80 mA h g(-1) at a C/20 rate with an average redox potential of 3.2 V. (vs. Na/Na(+)). It is noticed that 84% of initial capacity is preserved over 90 cycles showing promising cyclability. It is also noticed that the rate capability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is better than Na2MnP2O7. Ex situ and CV analyses indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 undergoes a single phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction due to different Na coordination environment and different Na site occupancy when compared to other pyrophosphate materials (Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7). Thermogravimetric analysis (25-550 °C) confirms good thermal stability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 with only 2% weight loss. Owing to promising electrochemical properties and decent thermal stability, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, can be an attractive cathode for SIBs.",

        "title": "Na3V2(PO4)3-decorated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as a high-rate and cycle-stable cathode material for sodium ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Since Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) possesses modest volume deformation and three-dimensional ion diffusion channels, it is a potential sodium-ion battery cathode material that has been extensively researched. Nonetheless, NVP still endures the consequences of poor electronic conductivity and low voltage platforms, which need to be further improved. On this basis, a high voltage platform Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was introduced to form a composite with NVP to increase the energy density. In this study, the sol–gel technique was successfully used to synthesize a Na3V2(PO4)2.75F0.75/C (NVPF·3NVP/C) composite cathode material. The citric acid-derived carbon layer was utilized to construct three-dimensional conducting networks to effectively promote ion and electron diffusion. Furthermore, the composites' synergistic effect accelerates the quick ionic migration and improves the kinetic reaction. In particular, NVP as the dominant phase enhanced the structural stability and significantly increased the capacitive contribution. Therefore, at 0.1C, the discharge capacity of the modified NVPF·3NVP/C composite is 120.7 mA h g−1, which is greater than the theoretical discharge capacity of pure NVP (118 mA h g−1). It discharged 110.9 mA h g−1 of reversible capacity even at an elevated multiplicity of 10C, and after 200 cycles, it retained 64.1% of its capacity. Thus, the effort produced an optimized NVPF·3NVP/C composite cathode material that may be used in the sodium ion cathode.",

        "title": "Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2‐Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution",
        "abstract": "Oxygen‐based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn‐rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium‐ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2‐type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron‐deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6–4.5 V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a ≈1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a “zero‐strain” cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen‐related Mn‐rich cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxides always suffer from sluggish kinetics and deleterious phase transformations at deep-desodiation state (i.e., >4.0 V) in O3 structure, incurring inferior rate capability and grievous capacity degradation. To tackle these handicaps, here, a configurational entropy tuning protocol through manipulating the stoichiometric ratios of inactive cations is proposed to elaborately design Na-deficient, O3-type NaxTmO2 cathodes. It is found that the electrons surrounding the oxygen of the TmO6 octahedron are rearranged by the introduction of MnO6 and TiO6 octahedra in Na-deficient O3-type Na0.83Li0.1Ni0.25Co0.2Mn0.15Ti0.15Sn0.15O2-δ (MTS15) with expanded O-Na-O slab spacing, giving enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and structural stability, as disclosed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements. Concomitantly, the entropy effect contributes to the improved reversibility of Co redox and phase-transition behaviors between O3 and P3, as clearly revealed by ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Notably, the prepared entropy-tuned MTS15 cathode exhibits impressive rate capability (76.7% capacity retention at 10 C), cycling stability (87.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles) with a reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh g-1, good full-cell performance (84.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles), and exceptional air stability.

In this study, high entropy Na4Fe2.95(MgCaAlCrMn)0.01(PO4)2P2O7 (HE-NFPP) have been synthesized via a spry-drying and high temperature sintering technique. The incorporation of transition metals (TMs) ions into NFPP using the HE strategy facilitates electron transportation by reducing the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. Meanwhile, the 3D network Na+ ions diffusion channels formed in HE-NFPP can effectively improve the Na+ ions diffusion efficiency, resulting in enhanced electrode reaction kinetics at low temperatures. Moreover, it leads to a significantly mitigated volume expansion/contraction in HE-NFPP caused by Na+ ions extraction/insertion during (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the fabricated HE-NFPP exhibits an excellent rate and cyclic performance at low temperatures.",

        "abstract": "High-entropy layered oxides have emerged as a new class of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries by providing infinite possibilities to tailor energy storage capabilities. However, owing to the lack of advanced high-entropy layered material, the influence of configurational entropy/compositional disorder on the high-voltage electrochemical performance of sodium-based layered cathode has seldom been explored. In this work, a Ni/Co-free high-entropy layered oxide P2-Na0.65Mn0.65Cu0.2Li0.06Mg0.015Ti0.015Al0.015Zr0.015Y0.015La0.015O2 (Mn-Cu-HEO) was prepared by stirring hydrothermal method, and investigated as a new cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. It is found that high configurational entropy and strong M−O configurations (M = Ti, Al, Zr, Y, and La) greatly stabilize the layered framework structure and MnO6 octahedral local structure, restraining the deleterious phase transition and large volume change during high-voltage cycling, thus resulting in high reversible cationic/anionic redox. In the meantime, disordered atomic arrangement in transition metal layer efficaciously mitigates Na+/vacancy ordering during de-/sodiation, enhancing the Na+ transport kinetics. Benefiting from the high-entropy stabilization effect, complex atomic arrangement, and multielemental composition, Mn-Cu-HEO displays splendid cyclic stability (87.2 % capacity retention after 500 cycles, very small change in cell volume (0.53 %) after 100 cycles), excellent rate capability (55.5 mAh g−1 at 10C), and a usable reversible capacity of 85.1 mAh g−1 at 1C in high-voltage range of 2.0–4.5 V.

The consequences of Li substitution and the challenge of elevating the Na content are explored. Structurally, honeycomb ordering is observed in all samples, while Li induces the loss of Na+/vacancy ordering. Electrochemically, the materials exhibit an increasing trend of polarized hysteresis in the 1st cycle. Semi‐simultaneous operando x‐ray absorption and diffraction are coupled to appreciate the structural evolution and redox behavior during this process. Li in the transition metal site eliminates phase transitions at high voltage and modifies the activation of O‐redox. All samples show anionic redox: as confirmed computationally, in the Li‐free sample this is rooted in Ni─O hybridized states, while in the Li‐containing samples in O non‐bonding states. Composition Na0.745(6)Li0.164(4)Ni0.238(1)Mn0.599(3)O2 proves to have the least O‐redox among all, coupled with reduced phase transitions, disordered occupancy of Na sites, and small volume change during cycling, leading to the best balance of cycling stability (≈92% after 100 cycles), capacity (> 100 mAh g−1) and rate capability.

The loss of conductivity (LoC) and the loss of active material (LAM) are proven to be principal degradation modes. Key insights are that bulk degradation and structure evolution of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) at high potential are pivotal factors leading to the decline of capacity and thermal stability. Meanwhile, the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) due to the cathode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions simultaneously affect the cycling performance. In addition, it revealed that high potential weakens the thermal stability of NFM and the oxygen released from pyrolysis of NFM impacts the thermal stability of NFM/electrolyte system.

In this work, we proposed a La3+/Al3+ codoping strategy in O3-Na(Ni1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3)O2 cathode materials and found that batteries with the Na (Ni1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3)0.998La0.001Al0.001O2 (NFM-La/Al) cathodes exhibited not only promoted capacity from 135.80 to 170.42 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C but also significantly enhanced cycling stability, with a 10% improvement in capacity retention compared with NFM cathodes after 300 cycles. Particularly, their rate performance was significantly improved as well. XRD and XPS tests indicated that La could expand the c-axis of NFM due to its larger ionic radius and thus significantly increased Na+ ion diffusion efficiency, and in addition, Al doping could effectively increase the content of Ni2+ and Mn4+ and thus greatly alleviated the negative Jahn-Teller effect caused by Mn3+. Moreover, consistent with XRD analyses, DFT calculations further substantiated the effectiveness of the La/Al codoping strategy by demonstrating the detailed atom substitution mechanism in the NFM crystal lattice. The boosted structure stability and Na+ diffusion kinetics may enhance the potential for practical applications of O3-type oxide cathodes.",

Vacancy reduction boosts the capacity contribution from low-spin Fe in FeHCF. Iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF) is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.

In particular, FeHCF-P delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 131 mAh g^−1 at 1 C and remains 109 mAh g^−1 after 500 cycles, with a capacity retention of 83%.

        "abstract": "A Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) cathode is regarded as a promising cathode candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, issues such as low electronic conductivity and partial cation dissolution contribute to high polarization and structure distortion. Herein, we engineered the local electron density and reaction kinetic properties of NMVP cathodes with varying oxygen vacancies by introducing varying amounts of Zr doping and carbon coating. The optimized sample exhibited a high-rate capacity of 71.8 mAh g-1 at 30 C (83.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) and excellent performance over a wide temperature range (84.1 mAh g-1 at 60 °C and 61.4 mAh g-1 at -30 °C). In situ X-ray diffraction technology confirmed a redox solid solution and a two-phase reaction mechanism, revealing minor changes in cell volume and slight strain variations after Zr doping, effectively suppressing the structural distortion. Theoretical calculations illustrated that Zr doping largely shrinks the band gap of NMVP, enriches local electron density, and slightly alters the local element distribution and bond lengths. Moreover, full-cells have shown high energy density (259.9 Wh kg-1) and outstanding cycling stability (200 cycles). The work provides fresh insights into the synergistic effect of strain suppressing and interface engineering in promoting the development of wide temperature range and long-calendar-life SIBs.",

        "title": "Tailoring local electronic structure to achieve reversible anion redox chemistry of layered oxide cathodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Oxygen redox chemistry plays a crucial role in the capacity and stability of O3-type sodium-ion battery cathodes; however, effectively controlling the activity and reversibility of oxygen anion redox (OAR) still remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a doping strategy by simultaneously incorporating low-valence Li and strong-covalent Ti to tailor local electronic structure to achieve reversible anion redox chemistry. The nonbonding Li-O-Na initiates and enhances the reversibility of O2− → (O2)n−, while the strong Ti-O bond alleviates the excessive oxidation of O and suppresses the irreversible oxygen redox. Li/Ti co-doping upshifts the O 2p orbitals energy band closer to the Fermi level and splits the TM 3d orbital energy band into low energy bands above the Fermi level, facilitating the transition of O single-pair electrons, thus enhancing the activity, reversibility, and stability of O2−. As a result, the optimized O3- NaLi0.1Ni0.3Fe0.1Mn0.45Ti0.05O2 cathode delivers a remarkable capacity of 163.5 mAh/g at 0.1C and impressive capacity retention of 81.7 % after 200 cycles at 1C and 90.2 % after 500 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the full cells constructed with this cathode and a commercial hard carbon anode deliver a high specific energy of up to 214.7 Wh kg−1 at 1C and excellent cycling stability, showing great potential for practical applications. This study not only reveals the underlying mechanism between reversible oxygen redox chemistry and local electronic structure in O3-type cathode but also provides insights into the precise regulation of local electronic structure to activate and stabilize OAR.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as potential candidates for stationary energy storage because of the low cost and wide availability of Na sources. O3‐type layered oxides have been considered as one of the most promising cathodes for SIBs. However, they commonly show inevitable complicated phase transitions and sluggish kinetics, incurring rapid capacity decline and poor rate capability. Here, a series of sodium‐sufficient O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5‐ x Ti x O2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) cathodes for SIBs is reported and the mechanisms behind their excellent electrochemical performance are studied in comparison to those of their respective end‐members. The combined analysis of in situ X‐ray diffraction, ex situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy for NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 reveals that the O3‐type phase transforms reversibly into a P3‐type phase upon Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. The substitution of Ti for Mn enlarges interslab distance and could restrain the unfavorable and irreversible multiphase transformation in the high voltage regions that is usually observed in O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, resulting in improved Na cell performance. This integration of macroscale and atomicscale engineering strategy might open up the modulation of the chemical and physical properties in layered oxides and grasp new insight into the optimal design of high‐performance cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The Mn-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have garnered significant attention due to their high specific capacity, stemming from the unique multi-electron reactions with Na+. However, the structural instability caused by multi-ion insertion impacts the cycle life, thus limiting their further application in aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs). To address this issue, this work employed an in situ epitaxial solvent deposition method to homogeneously grow Ni hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) on the surface of MnPBA, which can effectively overcome the de-intercalation instability. The resulting heterostructured MnPBA@NiHCF integrates the multiple redox-active centers of MnPBA with the confinement ability of the outer NiHCF layer, thereby maintaining overall structural stability. As a cathode material for ASIBs, MnPBA@NiHCF achieves a reversible specific capacity of 66.2 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 1 A/g, significantly outperforming the single-component MnPBA and NiHCF, respectively. Moreover, it demonstrates ultralong cycling stability with only 0.0002 % capacity fade per cycle over 20,000 cycles at 10 A/g. Extensive kinetic analyses further confirm its superior Na+ diffusion behaviors with disclosed redox mechanism through the comprehensive in situ Raman and ex situ analysis. A full cell built with a polyimide (PI) anode achieved an energy density of up to 59.9 Wh kg−1, displaying a power output of 1200.4 W kg−1 and exceptional cycle stability. This work provides innovative insights for developing stable PBA cathodes for ASIB applications.",

        "abstract": "High-voltage layered oxide cathodes attract great attention for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the potential high energy density, but high voltage usually leads to rapid capacity decay. Herein, a stable high-voltage NaLi0.1Ni0.35Mn0.3Ti0.25O2 cathode with a ribbon-ordered superlattice is reported, and the intrinsic coupling mechanism between structure evolution and the anion redox reaction (ARR) is revealed. Li introduction constructs a special Li-O-Na configuration activating reversible nonbonded O 2p (|O2p)-type ARR and regulates the structure evolution way, enabling the reversible Li ions out-of-layer migration instead of the irreversible transition metal ions out-of-layer migration. The reversible structure evolution enhances the reversibility of the bonded O 2p (O2p)-type ARR and inhibits the generation of oxygen dimers, thus suppressing the irreversible molecular oxygen (O2)-type ARR. After the structure regulation, the structure evolution becomes reversible, |O2p-type ARR is activated, O2p-type ARR becomes stable, and O2-type ARR is inhibited, which largely suppresses the capacity degradation and voltage decay. The discharge capacity is increased from 154 to 168 mA h g-1, the capacity retention after 200 cycles significantly increases from 35 to 84%, and the voltage retention increases from 78 to 93%.

Herein, a spray-drying and solid-state reaction method have been utilized to fabricate the spherical trace amount Mg/Cu co-doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP). The Mg/Cu co-doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP by reducing band gap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the unique spherical structured NFMCPP with a carbon film even coated on its surface ensures rapid electron transport. Moreover, small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry demonstrate an alleviated diffusion-induced stress and enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables fluent Na+ extraction/insertion, leads to a low high-stress concentration and uniform stress/strain distribution during extensive (de)sodiation process.

In this paper, a vanadium oxide hydrate (H2V3O8) nanowire membrane is presented as a flexible cathode for SIBs without addition of any other additives (binders or conductive compounds). Such a freestanding flexible membrane exhibits a high specific capacity of 168 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1), and its high capacity is maintained well after 100 cycles. It is found that the capacitive charge storage accounts for a relatively large proportion of the total capacity, whereas the crystal structure of H2V3O8 is highly reversible during the sodiation/desodiation processes. This research demonstrates that the H2V3O8 nanowire is an exceptional candidate for SIBs.",

Herein, an electrochemical-active Co3+ substitution is introduced to suppress the P2-O2 phase transformation but not at the cost of capacity. The spherical, Co3+ substituted P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 with a high tap-density of 1.86 g cm-3 is successfully synthesized by co-precipitation and solid-state reactions. As anticipated, it delivers a large specific capacity of 161.6 mA h g-1 with a high median-voltage of 3.64 V (vs. Na/Na+), translated into a high energy-density of ∼590 W h kg-1, which is comparable to that of the commercialized LiCoO2 cathode in lithium-ion batteries. Apart from improved cycling stability ascribed to the mitigated P2-O2 transition, this cathode also shows a better rate property compared with those modified by Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ti4+ doping and Al2O3 coating.

The results reveal that Ni50-NMCP/C has the most effective doping composition, showing a discharge capacity of 143.0 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and long-term cyclic stability with capacity retention of 55.7 % at 1000 mA g−1 over 500 cycles, higher than those of the pristine NMCP (106.6 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and 38.8 % capacity retention at 1000 mA g−1). The substitution of Ni2+ for Mn2+ promotes electron conductivity and structural stability, rendering improved electrochemical performance. Moreover, the promising electrochemical performance of Ni50-NMCP/C//HC full cell demonstrates the anode's potential for use. This study indicates a quick way to understand the effects of elemental doping on NMCP and explore novel high energy and high stability cathodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Addressing a changing energy environment, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as one of the most potentially applicable energy resources in the world. Nevertheless, its further application is hindered owing to high degree of interfacial degradation and structural changes, which caused rapid capacity fading. Herein, a novel Ce modiﬁed P2-type layered structure cathode material Na0.67Mn0.8Co0.17Ce0.03O2 @ CeO2 is introduced, the stability of cell is improved by simultaneous bulk doping and surface coating in one scalable step. The doping of Ce4+ increases sodium ion transport rate by shrinking transition metal layer ions and expanding Na layer spacing. Irreversible phase transition can be mitigated from the stronger the bond energy between TM and O, which is conducive to the decrease in the Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio, and suppression of the Jahn−Teller distortion. Besides, the doping of larger radius Ce4+ extends the internal paths of crystal structure, which decreases the barrier of Na+, correspondingly, the Na+ diﬀusion rate was increased. Meanwhile, the CeO2 coating layer effectively inhibits parasitic reactions on the surface and improves the stability of the interface. Which display excellent capacity with a remarkable retention of 86.9 % after 100 cycles at 0.5 C and outstanding discharge rate performance of 87 mA h g−1 at 20 C. This study provides a simple process to concurrently stabilize the bulk structure and interface for the future application for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered Na-based oxides with the general composition of NaxTMO2 (TM: transition metal) have attracted significant attention for their high compositional diversity that provides tunable electrochemical performance for electrodes in sodium-ion batteries. The various compositions bring forward complex structural chemistry that is decisive for the layered stacking structure, Na-ion conductivity, and the redox activity, potentially promising new avenues in functional material properties. In this work, we have explored the maximum Na content in P2-type layered oxides and discovered that the high-content Na in the host enhances the structural stability; moreover, it promotes the oxidation of low-valent cations to their high oxidation states (in this case Ni2+). This can be rationalized by the increased hybridization of the O(2p)-TM(3d-eg*) states, affecting both the local TM environment as well as the interactions between the NaO2 and TMO2 layers. These properties are highly beneficial for the Na storage capabilities as required for cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries. It leads to excellent Na-ion mobility, a large storage capacity (>100 mAh g–1 between 2.0-4.0 V), yet preventing the detrimental sliding of the TMO2 layers (P2–O2 structural transition), as reflected by the ultralong cycle life (3000 (dis)charge cycles demonstrated). These findings expand the horizons of high Na-content P2-type materials, providing new insights of the electronic and structural chemistry for advanced cathode materials.",

To date, commercialized SIBs offer inferior energy density with passable extended cycling. By contrast, next‐generation SIBs will likely utilize layered oxide cathodes that offer improved energy density but to date show inferior stability both during cycling and in terms of stability of the cathodes in air during cell assembly. These properties are highly tunable with composition and herein the promising P2 phases are systematically explored in the Na–Fe–Mn–O phase diagram by making 256 different compositions. The optimal material is a P2 material saturated with Ni (a modest 16% of the transition metal layer) and shows a highly competitive energy density of 640 Wh kg−1 while minimizing the amount of sacrificial sodium needed in full cells and also improving the air stability of the material. This study shows the vital role that thorough systematic screening will play in the continued development of these vital materials for sustainable secondary battery production and provides guidance toward sustainable Na‐ion cathodes by minimizing the nickel content required for high performance.",

        "abstract": "The layered iron manganese oxide cathodes accompanied by anionic redox reaction (ARR) activity show large promise of high-energy and economical sodium-ion batteries. However, the adverse surface oxygen lattice evolution caused by irreversible ARR tends to lead to poor cyclic stability and severe voltage decay, which limits its commercial application. In this work, using Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 (NMFO) as the model compound, an optimization strategy by modulating surface oxygen coordination through a simultaneous surface Li doping and Li3PO4 coating is proposed to achieve both triggered and reversible ARR processes. As revealed by neutron diffraction techniques and transmission electron microscopy tests, Li ions and Li3PO4 are successfully doped and coated on the surface of the NMFO cathode, respectively. The optimized cathode expectedly shows not only enhanced specific capacity but also improved cyclic stability. The excellent electrochemical properties are ascribed to the suppressed detrimental P2-O2 phase transition, enhanced ARR reversibility, and improved thermal structural stability. More broadly, this work demonstrates the feasibility of modulating surface oxygen coordination to activate and stabilize the ARR ion-storage process.",

        "abstract": "NASICON (super ion conductor)-type Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is considered to be one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its good structural stability, fast Na+ diffusion coefficient, and excellent electrochemical properties. However, the poor intrinsic conductivity and electronic conductivity and severe volume shrinkage of NVP, resulting in serious limitations in the practical application of NVP materials. Carbon, especially N-doped carbon modification, is the most effective method and strategy to improve the conductivity of NVP. The study of N source and N content in carbon plays a very important role in improving the electronic properties. Herein, N-doped carbon coated NVP composites was synthesized via the classical sol-gel method using common, green and inexpensive urea and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as N sources, respectively. According to EIS tests and GITT tests, N-doped carbon layers with urea as the N source significantly improved the conductivity of the carbon layers and the Na+ diffusion kinetics. The effects of N-doped carbon layers on the electrode kinetics and electrochemical properties of NVP materials were investigated in detail. The optimized U-NC15@NVP composite exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 114.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and 92.1% capacity retention after 400 cycles at 1C. When the optimal U-NC15@NVP electrode was selected to assemble a symmetric full cell, the reversible discharge capacity was 75.0 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 1C. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations establish that N-doped carbon can generate lots of active sites and external defects, which is beneficial to reduce the energy bandwidth of the carbon layer and thus improve the conductivity of the carbon layer. Additionally, it can also reduce the Na+ diffusion barrier and improve the adsorption energy for Na+. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations show that N-doped carbon can significantly increase the conductivity of the carbon layer and improve the electrochemical properties of NVP.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the development of cathode materials for Na-ion batteries has gained much attention due to the abundance, low cost, and easy availability of resources. Apart from the usual metal oxides, multi-electron redox materials grabbed attention due to their high energy density and practical capacity with long cycle life. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are inorganic clusters of higher valent metals, and act as electron sponges with multi-electron redox properties. Herein we report a Keggin-type polyoxometalate [PMo10V2O40]5− with Na+ and H+ counter cations as a cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Further the formation of POM is evidenced by PXRD, FT-IR, flame photometry and XPS studies. In Na-POM, Na+ ions in the intercluster cavities provide a better pathway and easy diffusion during the charge/discharge process, and contribute to better electrochemical properties than H-POM. The DFT studies further explore the detailed mechanistic pathway of Na+ ions around the clusters in the normal and super-reduced states. Na-POM enables better cycling stability and capacity retention with a specific discharge capacity of 123 mA h g−1 at 0.1C rate at room temperature.",

Consequently, a fundamental understanding of how layered oxide cathodes degrade in air is of paramount importance, but it has not been fully understood yet. Here a comprehensive study on a model material NaNi0.7Mn0.15Co0.15O2 reveals its reaction chemistry with air and the dynamic evolution of the degradation species upon air exposure. We find that besides the extraction of Na+ ions from the crystal lattice to form NaOH, Na2CO3, and Na2CO3·H2O in contact with air, nickel ions gradually dissolve from the bulk to form NiO and accumulate on the particle surface as revealed by subnanometer surface-sensitive time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The degradation species on the surface are insulating, leading to an increase in interfacial resistance and declined electrochemical performance. We also demonstrate a feasible surface coating strategy for suppressing the unfavorable degradation process. Understanding the degradation mechanism at a nanoscale can facilitate the future development of high-energy cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

However, the lack of atomic-level understanding regarding the distribution of substitution positions complicates the comprehension of the roles of substituting atoms and the mechanism of sodium-ion intercalation. In this study, we identified the stable configurations of Na in Na0.75Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 and Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 materials using the site exclusion method. Through simulating the complete charging process for both materials, the structure evolution of the cathodes during the cycling and the impact of the partial substitution of Ni elements by Li and Mg atoms were comprehensively elucidated. Our findings revealed that Mg atoms effectively regulate the distribution of forces within the materials, essentially serving as supportive pillars within the cathode. Meanwhile, Li atoms efficiently mitigated electron localization, consequently diminishing volume fluctuations during the charging process. More importantly, the substitution with Li and Mg atoms could synergistically reduce the interaction between transition metals and sodium ions, thereby reducing the diffusion energy barrier of Na ions. This study not only enhances the comprehension of substituted metal atoms in P2 layered oxides but also offers new insights for the development of sodium-ion cathode materials.",

The aromatic PI-based CMP can effectively utilize the redox activity site due to its abundant π-conjugated redox active units, stable imide bond, high specific surface area and clear pore structure. As expected, the optimum TAPT-NTCDA@CNT exhibits good rate performance (89.7 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) and long cycle stability (87.3% capacity retention after 500 cycles) in LIBs. Also, TAPT-NTCDA@CNT can provide a higher initial capacity of 91.1 mAh g−1 in SIBs at 30 mA g−1.

A unique pentametallic platform [MnII(ptac)3-Na-MnIII(acac)3-Na-MnII(ptac)3] (1) was derived from the known polymeric structure of [NaMnII(acac)3]∞, through a series of elaborate design procedures, such as mixed-ligand, unsymmetric ligand, and mixed-valent approaches. Importantly, the application of those techniques results in a molecule with distinctively different transition metal positions in terms of ligand environment and oxidation states.

The arrangement of metal ions and ligands in this pentametallic assembly was confirmed by single crystal X-ray investigation. The unambiguous assignment of the positions and oxidation states of the Periodic Table neighbors Fe and Mn in 3 has been achieved by a combination of investigative techniques that include synchrotron resonant diffraction, X-ray multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and gas-phase DART mass spectrometry.

By neutralizing the residual alkali and extracting Na+ from the CNMT lattice, H3BO3 forms a multifunctional Na2B2O5-dominated layer on the CNMT surface. This Na\n                        x\n                     B\n                        y\n                     O\n                        z\n                      (NBO) layer plays a positive role in providing low-barrier Na+ transport channels, suppressing phase transitions, and minimizing the generation of O2/CO2 gases and resistive byproducts. As a result, at a charge cutoff voltage of 4.5 V, the NBO-coated CNMT delivers a high discharge capacity of 149.1 mAh g−1 at 10 mA g−1 and exhibits excellent cycling stability at 100 mA g−1 over 200 cycles with a higher capacity retention than that of pristine CNMT (86.4% vs. 62.1%). This study highlights the effectiveness of surface modification using low-melting-point solid acids, with potential applications for other layered oxide cathode materials to achieve stable high-voltage cycling. This proposed strategy opens new avenues for the construction of high-quality coatings for high-voltage layered oxide cathodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Due to high safety and cost-effective resources, sodium-ion batteries show great prospect in large-scale energy storage systems. Owing to wide structural framework and high theoretical capacity, Na-based layered oxide with prismatic P2-type structure is an ideal cathode candidate for sodium-ion batteries. However, Na-based layered compounds always suffer from detrimental multiple phase transitions during cycle period, resulting in structure deterioration and rapid capacity decay. Herein, stable P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67-xTixO2 cathodes are constructed through substituting Mn with Ti. In-situ XRD demonstrates that Ti substitution effectively successfully suppresses the undesired phase transition of P2-O2, and in turn appears a stable Z-symbiotic intermediate phase with minimal volume change. Hence, designed P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.37Ti0.3O2 cathode shows better structural stability and long-term cycling reliability, yielding a high reversible capacity of 123 mAh g−1 and a high capacity retention of 89 % after 100 cycles at 0.2C. More importantly, a high working voltage of 3.5 V and a boosted energy density of 400 Wh kg−1 is achieved in the NNMTO-3 || HC full cell, which further strengthens the competence of Ti-substituted Na-based layered oxide cathodes. This work provides a feasible design insight for long-life, high-voltage sodium-ion batteries, which can be applied to construct more stable layered compounds and further improves their electrochemical properties.",

        "abstract": "Mn-containing sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) compounds have shown considerable potential as cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to higher working voltage (V5+/V4+: 3.9 V), lower cost, and lower toxicity compared to full vanadium-based NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3. Taking Na3.3V1.7Mn0.3(PO4)3 (NVMP) as an example, its practical application is still restricted by poor electronic conductivity, sluggish intrinsic Na+ diffusion, and poor high-voltage stability. In this work, a high entropy strategy is proposed to develop Na3.3V1.613Mn0.3(Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Zr)0.1(PO4)3 (HE-NVMP) cathode for not only enabling more and rapid Na+ migration but also significantly improving deep desodiation stability. Based on theoretical calculations and experimental findings, such high entropy modification can efficiently alter the coordination environments of both V/Mn and Na sites for reducing Na+ diffusion energy barrier, increasing the occupancy of Na+ at Na(2) sites, and consolidating the structure stability. Thus, the obtained HE-NVMP delivers superior high-rate capability (91.7 mAh g-1) up to 50 C and excellent cycling performance (capacity retention: 81.2%) after 10 000 cycles at 20 C at the cutoff voltage of 4.1 V. More importantly, such cathode also exhibits superior sodium storage properties at a higher cutoff voltage (4.5 V) with electrochemical polarization with 75% reduction at 1 C and higher capacity retention of 80.3% after 2000 cycles at 20 C compared to pristine counterpart, indicating a great potential for practical rechargeable batteries with excellent overcharge resistance capability.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues are recognized as promising cathodes for rechargeable batteries intended for application in low-cost and large-scale electric energy storage. With respect to PB cathodes, however, their intrinsic crystal regularity, vacancies, and coordinated water will lead to low specific capacity and poor rate performance, impeding their application. Herein, nanocubic porous Nax FeFe(CN)6 coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the Nax FeFe(CN)6 electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 . The sodium storage mechanism of this Nax FeFe(CN)6 coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that FeII sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties. Both experiments and computational simulations present guidelines for the rational design of nanomaterials as electrodes for energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries hold a great importance in power storage devices due to affordable price and earth abundancy. However, the complex phase evolution during Na+ ions insertion/extraction severely limits their durability and rate capability, which largely limits their practical applications. Herein, we have successfully synthesized O3-type Na1.05 (Ni0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33)0.83Ti0.05Cu0.12O2 (NaTiCuNFM). It was found that the as-obtained NaTiCuNFM exhibits enhanced rate performance as well as specific discharge capacity of 124.5 mAhg−1 at the rate of 1C with 82 % capacity retention after 200 cycles. Besides, at high current density of 10C, the obtained NaTiCuNFM shows a high initial discharge capacity of 99 mAhg−1 which was significantly higher than that of NaNFM (61 mAh/g). The higher performance of Cu/Ti co-doped NaTiCuNFM was attributed to the enhancement of inter sodium layer spacing resulting an easy migration of sodium ions, which leads to the enhanced Na+ diffusion and rate performance. The co-doping of Cu/Ti has proven to provide a more stable structure. Our obtained results, will open a new window for bi-metals doped cathode materials for practical battery application.",

        "abstract": "The cycle stability and voltage retention of a Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (NMF) cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has been impeded by the huge distortion from NaMnII[FeIII(CN)6] to MnIII[FeIII(CN)6] caused by the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect of Mn3+. Herein, we propose a topotactic epitaxy process to generate K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) submicron octahedra and assemble them into octahedral superstructures (OSs) by tuning the kinetics of topotactic transformation. As the SIB cathode, the self-assembly behavior of KMF improves the structural stability and decreases the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby inhibiting the transition metal in the KMF cathode from dissolving in the electrolyte. More importantly, the KMF partly transforms into NMF with Na+ de/intercalation, and the existing KMF acts as a stabilizer to disrupt the long-range JT order of NMF, thereby suppressing the overall JT distortion. As a result, the electrochemical performances of KMF cathodes outperform NMF with a highly reversible phase transition and outstanding cycling performance, and 80% capacity retention after 1500/1300 cycles at 0.1/0.5 A g-1. This work not only promotes creative synthetic methodologies but also promotes to explore the relationship between Jahn-Teller structural deformation and cycle stability.",

        "abstract": "P2-phase layered cathodes play a pivotal role in sodium-ion batteries due to their efficient Na+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by crystal disintegration and interfacial instability, bulk and interfacial failure plague their electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a structural enhancement combined with surface modification is achieved through trace Y doping. Based on a synergistic combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the introduction of partial Y ions at the Na site (2d) acts as a stabilizing pillar, mitigating the electrostatic repulsions between adjacent TMO2 slabs and thereby relieving internal structural stress. Furthermore, the presence of Y effectively optimizes the Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization, resulting in enhanced electronic conductivity and a notable rapid charging ability, with a capacity of 77.3 mA h g-1 at 40 C. Concurrently, the introduction of Y also induces the formation of perovskite nano-islands, which serve to minimize side reactions and modulate interfacial diffusion. As a result, the refined P2-Na0.65 Y0.025 [Ni0.33 Mn0.67 ]O2 cathode material exhibits an exceptionally low volume variation (≈1.99%), an impressive capacity retention of 83.3% even at -40 °C after1500 cycles at 1 C.",

Herein, Ga3+ is introduced into Na3V2(PO4)3 to activate the V4+/V5+ redox couple at a high potential of 4.0 V for enhancing energy density of the materials (Na3V2-xGax(PO4)3). After the partial substitution of Ga3+ for V3+, three redox couples (V2+/V3+, V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+) of V are reversibly converted in the voltage range of 1.4–4.2 V, suggesting multi-electrons (>2e−) involved in the reversible reaction, and simultaneously the electronic conductivity of the materials is effectively enhanced. As a result, the cathode with x = 0.75 exhibits excellent electrochemical properties: in the voltage range of 2.2–4.2 V, delivering an initial capacity of 105 mAh/g at 1C with a capacity retention rate of 92.3% after 400 cycles, and providing a stable reversible capacity of 88.3 mAh/g at 40C; and in the voltage range of 1.4–4.2 V, presenting the reversible capacity 152.3 mAh/g at 1C (497.6 Wh kg−1), and cycling stably for 1000 cycles at 20C with a capacity decay of 0.02375% per cycle. It is found that the Na3V2-xGax(PO4)3 cathodes possess the sodium storage mechanism of single-phase and bi-phase reactions. This investigation presents a useful strategy to enhance the energy density and cycling life of NASICON-structured polyanionic phosphates by activating high-potential V4+/V5+ redox couple.",

Herein, the composite materials of manganese-iron based Prussian white and reduced graphene oxide (PW/rGO) were synthesized via a one-step in situ synthesis method with sodium citrate, which was employed both as a chelating agent to control the reaction rate during the coprecipitation process of PW synthesis and as a reducing agent for GO. The low precipitation speed helps minimize lattice defects, while rGO enhances electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the one-step in situ synthesis method is simpler and more efficient than the traditional synthesis method. Compared with pure PW, the PW/rGO composites exhibit significantly improved electrochemical properties. Cycling performance tests indicated that the PW/rGO-10 sample exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity and the best cyclic stability. The PW/rGO-10 has an initial discharge capacity of 128 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 170 mA g-1), and retains 49.53% capacity retention after 100 cycles, while the PW only delivers 112 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention of 17.79% after 100 cycles. Moreover, PW/rGO-10 also shows better rate performance and higher sodium ion diffusion coefficient (DNa+) than the PW sample.

While, the existed coordinated water and vacancy defects will cause the skeleton collapsed and lattice disordered during the cycling process, which lower the coulombic efficiency and shorten the cycle consistency. Furthermore, the inferior electron transport of Fe-HCF further affects the charge-discharge performance. Herein, we designed a high-quality FeMnCu co-doped Prussian blue (PB) crystal and controlled its crystallization process with assistance of citrate. Moreover, a core-shell structure of conductive polyaniline (PANI) coated Prussian blue analogue (FeMnCu@PANI) was constructed. The as-developed FeMnCu@PANI as the cathode for SIB delivers a capacity of 107 mAh g-1 at the current density of 1C and 82 mAh g-1 at 10C. The capacity retention rate reaches ∼90 % at 10C for 500 cycles. This FeMnCu@PANI crystal is nontoxic, high yield, low cost, and suitable for large-scale producing, which has great potential as cathode for SIB with high-capacity retention rate and long service life.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as competitive candidates for the next generation of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems due to their low cost and abundant sodium resources. Layered oxide cathodes have attracted much interest owing to their simple preparation process, high specific capacity and environmental friendliness. However, undesired cation migration during electrochemical reactions can lead to irreversible phase transitions and structural degradation of layered oxide cathode materials, resulting in a sharp decrease in specific capacity and energy density. Therefore, in order to find effective strategies to suppress cation migration, the fundamental failure mechanism of layered oxides and the practical approaches to solve this key scientific issue are thoroughly investigated, and herein the history and current status of developments in this field are also reviewed. Elemental doping and structural design can directionally modify the electronic structure, energy band structure and electronic density of states in layered oxides and enhance cation migration barriers, which benefits the improvement of electrochemical performance and structural stability during the whole sodiation/desodiation process. The summary and prospects of inhibiting cation migration in layered oxides provide insights into the development of advanced cathode materials with high energy density and excellent structural stability for the commercialization of SIBs.",

Here, we reported a P2-Na0.76Li0.1Ni0.23Mn0.67O2 cathode by implementing a synergistic scheme involving charge compensation modulation and crystal growth optimization. The cathode was prominently not only enhanced the redox reaction of Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+ but also alleviated the Jahn-Teller distortion to suppress the oxygen loss at high voltage, yielding a strain-free crystal structure evolution without phase transition during Na+ extraction-insertion. Moreover, its monocrystalline particle feature exhibited uniform cathode-electrolyte interphase layers, direct Na+ diffusion paths, and effective inhibition of the grievous parasitic side reactions and inner micro-cracks. Giving the credit to the boosted structure stability and Na+ diffusion kinetics, consequently, the P2-Na0.76Li0.1Ni0.23Mn0.67O2 cathode demonstrated a high rate-capacity (86.9 mAh/g at 10C), a considerable cycling stability (74.7 mAh/g at 5C & the 200th cycle), and a practical energy density (225 Wh kg−1 in full cell).

However, because of its unstable lamellar structure and poor Na+ diffusion channels, the cycle performance and rate performance of NFM electrode materials are poor. In this work, Ca0.05Na0.9Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (Ca-NFM) electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance were prepared by the modification strategy of Ca2+ doping to replace part of Na+. Calculations show that Ca2+ successfully occupies part of the Na sites, which leads to an increase in the Na layer thickness and thus enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics. Tests on Ca-NFM electrodes in the charged state show that the doped non-electrochemically active Ca2+ is firmly stabilized in the Na layer and supports the laminar body structure, which in turn enhances the cycling performance of the material. The capacity retention of Ca-NFM electrode with 200 cycles at 1 C was 87.65%, while the capacity retention of NFM electrode under the same conditions was only 66.73%. The Ca-NFM electrode also performs significantly better than the NFM electrode in terms of rate performance. It has been shown that Ca doping also increases the upper limit of the voltage window of the electrode, which provides a significant capacity advantage while maintaining excellent cycling performance.",

The Ti-substituted Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 shows superior electrochemical properties compared to the pristine sample. We investigated the changes in the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and particle morphology caused by Ti doping and correlated these changes to the improved performance. The enhanced rate capability and cycling stability were attributed to the enlargement of the NaO2 slab in the crystal structure because of Ti doping. This promoted Na-ion diffusion and prevented the phase transition from the P2 to the OP4/″Z″ structure.",

        "abstract": "Na3MnZr(PO4)3, a typical manganese-based NASICON-type material, has consistently been at the forefront of research on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to the abundant manganese reserve and high operating voltage. However, the severe Jahn-Teller effect, poor electronic conductivity and kinetic limitation of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 impose constraints on its rate capability and cycling performance, thereby hindering its practical application. To address this challenge, a ternary NASICON-type material Na3MnTi0.5Zr0.5(PO4)3/C, with a multi-metal synergistic effect, is proposed in this study. The substitution of Ti at Zr site significantly mitigates the Jahn-Teller effect induced by Mn3+. Furthermore, the stability of the ZrO bond is enhanced, leading to a more robust crystal structure overall. Cyclic voltammetry and constant-current intermittent titration techniques reveal that the appropriate Ti substitution markedly boosts the electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion coefficient of the electrode material, thereby mitigating polarization effects and expediting electrode reaction rates. Leveraging the multi-effect of Ti substitution, the prepared Na3MnTi0.5Zr0.5(PO4)3/C presents an improved electrochemical performance. Notably, Na3MnTi0.5Zr0.5(PO4)3/C enables a high discharge capacity of 71.0 mAh g−1 at 10C and maintains 78.8 % capacity after 1000 cycles at 2C rate. This investigation establishes a robust theoretical foundation for comprehending the synergistic effects of multimetal systems in NASICON materials and offers insights into the development of cost-effective, high-performance cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The conventional P2-type cathode material Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 suffers from an irreversible P2–O2 phase transition and serious capacity fading during cycling. Here, we successfully carry out magnesium and calcium ion doping into the transition-metal layers (TM layers) and the alkali-metal layers (AM layers), respectively, of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Both Mg and Ca doping can reduce O-type stacking in the high-voltage region, leading to enhanced cycling endurance, however, this is associated with a decrease in capacity. The results of density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the introduction of Mg2+ and Ca2+ make high-voltage reactions (oxygen redox and Ni4+/Ni3+ redox reactions) less accessible. Thanks to the synergetic effect of co-doping with Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, the adverse effects on high-voltage reactions involving Ni–O bonding are limited, and the structural stability is further enhanced. The finally obtained P2-type Na0.62Ca0.025Ni0.28Mg0.05Mn0.67O2 exhibits a satisfactory initial energy density of 468.2 W h kg−1 and good capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 within the voltage range of 2.2–4.35 V.

The polyanion phosphate, Na3V2(PO4)3 stands out as an excellent candidate due to its high nominal voltage, ambient air stability, and long cycle life. The caveat is that Na3V2(PO4)3 can only exhibit reversible capacities in the range of 100 mAh g−1, 20% below its theoretical capacity. Here, the synthesis and characterizations are reported for the first time of the sodium‐rich vanadium oxyfluorophosphate, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O, a tailored derivative compound of Na3V2(PO4)3, with extensive electrochemical and structural analyses. Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O delivers an initial reversible capacity of 117 mAh g−1 between 2.5 and 4.5 V under the 1C rate at room temperature, with 85% capacity retention after 900 cycles. The cycling stability is further improved when the material is cycled at 50 °C within 2.8–4.3 V for 100 cycles. When paired with a presodiated hard carbon, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O cycled with a capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles. Cosubstitution of the transition metal and fluorine in Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O as well as the sodium‐rich structure are the major factors behind the improvement of specific capacity and cycling stability, which paves the way for this cathode in sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract significant attention due to their potential as an alternative energy storage solution, yet challenges persist due to the limited energy density of existing cathode materials. In principle, redox-active organic materials can tackle this challenge because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, electrode-level energy densities of organic electrodes are compromised due to their poor electron/ion transport and severe dissolution. Here, we report the use of a low-bandgap, conductive, and highly insoluble layered metal-free cathode material for SIBs. It exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 355 mAh g-1 per formula unit, enabled by a four-electron redox process, and achieves an electrode-level energy density of 606 Wh kg-1electrode (90 wt % active material) along with excellent cycling stability. It allows for facile two-dimensional Na+ diffusion, which enables a high intrinsic rate capability. Growth of the active cathode material in the presence of as little as 2 wt % carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes improves charge transport and charge transfer kinetics and further enhances the power performance. Altogether, these allow the construction of SIB cells built from an affordable, sustainable organic small molecule, which provide a cathode energy density of 472 Wh kg-1electrode when charging/discharging in 90 s and a top specific power of 31.6 kW kg-1electrode.",

Here, we successfully introduce six transition metals into N coordination site to increase the configurational entropy, significantly improving the structure stability and cycle life of PBA cathode materials. Electrochemical characterization methods are used to compare the behavior of hexa-, penta-, quadr-, and tri-metal PBA, exhibiting the characteristic of performance increasing with entropy. Time-resolved in situ X-ray diffraction confirms the “quasi-zero-strain” structure of H-PBA during desodiation/sodiation process. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Mn, Fe, Co and Cu contribute the high capacity of H-PBA, while Ni and Zn stabilize the structure.

        "abstract": "The development of low-cost and high-safety cathode materials is critically important to sodium-ion battery (Na-ion) research. Here we report a carbon nanotube (CNT)-percolating Na2Fe(SO4)2 cathode (NFS-CNT) prepared via a rationally designed mechano-chemical method. The material synthesis mechanism is elucidated for the first time by in situ X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. It is discovered that Na2Fe(SO4)·4H2O is formed as an intermediate phase during the mechano-chemical process, which is dehydrated to produce the Na2Fe(SO4)2 cathode material upon a mild thermal treatment. The NFS-CNT composite cathode achieves an ultra-long cycle-life of over 13,000 cycles at 10 C at room temperature and over 6000 cycles at 55 °C, demonstrating its exceptional durability. The superior cycling performance is attributed to the small lattice change during Na-ion extraction/insertion and the percolating CNT network. Furthermore, the NFS/CNT cathode exhibits stable cycle performance in Na-ion full cells (93.4 % retention after 700 cycles) and a significantly lower heat release (∼ 229.2 J g−1) at the fully charged state compared to a wide range of Na-ion and Li-ion cathodes. materials. demonstrating its high thermal stability and safety.

A novel cobalt orthosilicate, Na2CoSiO4, shows promise as a high voltage (3.3 V vs. Na/Na+) cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. Here, the synthesis and room temperature electrochemical performance of Na2CoSiO4 have been investigated with the compound found to yield a reversible capacity greater than 100 mA h g-1 at a rate of 5 mA g-1. Insights into the crystal structures of Na2CoSiO4 were obtained through refinement of structural models for its two polymorphs, Pn and Pbca. Atomistic modelling results indicate that intrinsic defect levels are not significant and that Na+ diffusion follows 3D pathways with low activation barriers, which suggest favourable electrode kinetics.

        "abstract": "Na4MnCr(PO4)3 (NMCP) has garnered significant interest as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its impressive energy density resulting from three-electron reactions. Nevertheless, its low intrinsic conductivity and the sluggish Na+ diffusion hinder it from commercial applications. Herein, to overcome the above obstacles, K-ions were chosen as pillar components to be doped into Na sites in NMCP, and how the K doping affects the electrochemical performance of NMCP were thoroughly investigated. Consequently, the as-prepared Na3.88K0.12MnCr(PO4)3/C (K12-NMCP/C) was found to be the optimal sample, which delivers an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 152.4 mAh/g at 50 mA g−1 and an outstanding rate capability of 69.9 mAh/g at 1000 mA g−1, as compared with that (105.5 and 44.3 mAh/g) of undoped NMCP. Additionally, K12-NMCP/C provides higher capacity retention than that of undoped NMCP. The partial substitution of Na+ by larger K+ can increase intrinsic conductivity, promote Na+ diffusion rate and reinforce structural stability. Moreover, a K12-NMCP/C||HC full cell was successfully assembled, which exhibits a high energy density of 448.5 Wh Kg−1. This work offers new avenue to the design of high-performance and durable NMCP-based cathodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The sodium superionic conductor Na4MnCr(PO4)3 gains increasing attention owing to its three-dimensional structure and the three-electron reaction. However, rapid structure degradation during cycling is the major challenge for its practical application. Herein, Ti4+ is utilized to replace a portion of Mn2+ in Na4MnCr(PO4)3. The low redox voltage and d\n                     0 electronic configuration of the Ti4+ ions are helpful to suppress the structure alteration and improve electronic conduction. Consequently, the as-prepared Na3.4Mn0.7Ti0.3Cr(PO4)3/C cathode exhibits a remarkable good 91.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 10C rate, with exceptional rate capacities of 99.5 mAh g−1 and 81.0 mAh g−1 at 5C and 10C rate, respectively. Furthermore, based on ≈2.86-electron reactions involving Mn2+/Mn3+ (3.5 V), Mn3+/Mn4+ (4.1 V), Cr3+/Cr4+ (4.3 V), and Ti3+/Ti4+ (2.1 V), the material can provide an energy density of approximately 541.6 Wh kg−1, slightly surpassing that of Na4MnCr(PO4)3. Ex-situ XRD investigation further elucidates that throughout the entire charge–discharge process, the Ti-substituted material experiences highly reversible solid-solution and two-phase reactions. Additionally, Ti substitution can greatly promote the interfacial charge transfer of the material and suppress the decomposition of the electrolyte during cycling. This work might open a new insight for designing sodium-ion battery cathode materials with good cycling stability and high energy density.",

Herein, a two‐step carbon‐coating technique has been developed to synthesize high‐performance NFP@C cathode materials by controlling the NFP particle size and the coating layer uniformity. The first step of in‐situ carbon coating greatly restrains the excessive growth of NFP crystals with a shortened Na‐ion diffusion path. Meantime, the extra secondary carbon‐coating is adopted to repair some exposed areas, guaranteeing the full coverage of NFP particles for rapid electronic transfer. As a consequence, the as‐obtained NFP@C cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 95.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C (theoretical value: 97 mAh g−1) and with high‐rate capability (75.2 mAh g−1 at 5 C) within 2.0–4.0 V. A capacity retention of 95.3% can be achieved even after 500 cycles at 5 C in coin‐type cells.

However, the understanding of how the particle size and arrangement of these secondary spherical structures influence electrochemical performance remains limited. Herein, a series of O3-type layered oxide cathode materials with various sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 μm) and internal structures (hollow and radial arrangements) were tailored based on precursor-based structural control and particle sizing strategies. The relation in precursor size/structure, cathode characteristics, crystal microstress, structural stability, and electrochemical performance was established through a combination of structure, morphology, and electrochemical characterization.

Elevated microstress levels induced compression of the unit cell along the c-axis, hampering sodium ion migration and undermining the stability of secondary spherical particles during cyclic charge-discharge processes.

Co0.2‐MnO2 provides capacitive behavior and strengthens the hydrogen bonds between molecules. KOH acts as an ion crosslinker to enhance hydrogen bond and as electrolyte to transport ions. 5 wt% Co0.2‐MnO2@KOH/PVA has superb mechanical endurance, appreciable electrical conductivity, and ideal capacitive behavior. The quasi‐solid‐state supercapacitor demonstrates stabilized longevity (86.5% at 0.2 mA cm−3 after 500 cycles), which can greatly promote the integration of flexible energy storage fabric devices.",

        "abstract": "A general polymer‐assisted spinodal decomposition strategy is used to prepare hierarchically porous sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON)‐structured polyanion‐type materials (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3, Li3V2(PO4)3, K3V2(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3, and Na2TiV(PO4)3) in a tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/H2O synthesis system. Depending on the boiling point of solvents, the selective evaporation of the solvents induces both macrophase separation via spinodal decomposition and mesophase separation via self‐assembly of inorganic precursors and amphiphilic block copolymers, leading to the formation of hierarchically porous structures. The resulting hierarchically porous Na3V2(PO4)3 possessing large specific surface area (≈77 m2 g−1) and pore volume (≈0.272 cm3 g−1) shows a high specific capacity of 117.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C achieving the theoretical value and a long cycling life with 77% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 5 C. This method presented here can open a facile avenue to synthesize other hierarchically porous polyanion‐type materials.",

        "abstract": "To improve the energy and power density of Na‐ion batteries, an increasing number of researchers have focused their attention on activation of the anionic redox process. Although several materials have been proposed, few studies have focused on the Na‐rich materials compared with Li‐rich materials. A key aspect is sufficient utilization of anionic species. Herein, a comprehensive study of Mn‐based Na1.2Mn0.4Ir0.4O2 (NMI) O3‐type Na‐rich materials is presented, which involves both cationic and anionic contributions during the redox process. The single‐cation redox step relies on the Mn3+/Mn4+, whereas Ir atoms build a strong covalent bond with O and effectively suppress the O2 release. In situ Raman, ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and soft‐X‐ray absorption spectroscopy are employed to unequivocally confirm the reversibility of O22− species formation and suggest a high degree of anionic reaction in this NMI Na‐rich material. In operando X‐ray diffraction study discloses the asymmetric structure evolution between the initial and subsequent cycles, which also explains the effect of the charge compensation mechanism on the electrochemical performance. The research provides a novel insight on Na‐rich materials and a new perspective in materials design towards future applications.",

        "title": "Enhancing the Sodium Storage Performance of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 through the Manipulation of Intrinsic Site Occupation Defects.",
        "abstract": "Manganese-based NASICON-type compounds are promising as high-energy-density cathodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the structural defects of Mn ions inside the crystal framework reduce the sodium storage capacity, voltage plateau, and cyclic stability of the cathodes. Here, a strategy to inhibit the Mn ion defects of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 has been proposed by using different phosphate sources. It is found that Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with NH4H2PO4 (NMCP-N) exhibits less noticeable voltage hysteresis than that of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with H3PO4 (NMCP-H), indicating that the site occupation defects of Mn ions in the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 crystal structure are successfully suppressed, as confirmed by theoretical calculations and structural refinements. In the case of NMCP-N, a capacity of 109.7 mAh g-1 is delivered at 0.01 A g-1, and 54.2% capacity retention can be kept after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, which is much better than that of the counterpart of NMCP-H (a lower capacity of 96.1 mAh g-1 and poorer cyclability of only 22.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles), showing that the structure defects strongly affect the sodium storage properties of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 cathodes. This work provides an effective strategy to manipulate the structure defects of Mn-based NASICON-type cathode materials to enhance their electrochemistry.",

        "title": "Enhanced cycling stability and rate capability of Na0.75Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode material by Zn/F co-doping for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "P2-type layered transition metal oxides with high theoretical specific capacity and operating voltage are considered as one of the highly promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, but the poor cycling stability attributed to the P2-O2 phase transition and Na^+/vacancy ordering limits their practical applications. In this paper, a hydrothermal method is used to investigate the improvement of the electrochemical properties of Na_0.75Ni_0.33Mn_0.67O_2 by Zn/F synergistic doping. The synergistic modification of Zn/F not only adjusts the valence distribution of Mn and improves the specific capacity, but also suppresses the phase transition under high voltage and the dissolution of transition metal ions. In particular, Na_0.75Ni_0.23Mn_0.67Zn_0.1O_1.95F_0.05 (ZF-5) has excellent cycling performance (82.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C), compared to just 11.6% for the Na_0.75Ni_0.33Mn_0.67O_2(ZF-0). Above that, the rate performance is also significantly improved, with the specific capacity reaching 94.7 mAh g^−1 even at a high current density of 5 C. Therefore, the Zn/F double doping modification strategy provides a simple and effective method for designing high-performance layered oxide cathode materials.",

        "title": "In-situ constructing porous N-doped carbon skeleton with rich defects from modified polyamide acid to boost the high performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode for full sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "Generally, the transport of electrons and Na+ is seriously constrained in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) due to intense interactions of V-O and PO bonds. Besides, polyamide acid (PAA) is hardly used in the sol–gel route due to insolubility. This work develops a facile liquid synthesis strategy based on modified PAA, achieving in-situ construction of a porous N-doped carbon framework with rich defects to improve the kinetics of NVP. The addition of triethylamine (TEA) reacts with carboxyls in PAA to achieve acid-base neutralization, turning PAA into polyamide salts with good solubility. The special morphology construction mechanism of this unique system was observed by ex-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specifically, PAA undergoes in-situ conversion into chain-like polyimide (PI) through a thermal polymerization mechanism during the pre-sintering process. Meanwhile, NVP precursors are evenly dispersed in the PI fibers, efficiently reducing the particle size. After the final treatment, the favorable porous carbon skeleton could be generated derived from the partial decomposition of PI, on which small active grains are in situ grown. The resulting N-doped carbon substrate contains rich defects, benefiting from the migration of Na+. Furthermore, the porous construction is conducive to alleviating the stress and strain generated by the high current impact, increasing the contact area between electrodes/electrolytes to improve the utilization efficiency of active substances. Comprehensively, the optimized samples exhibit a capacity of 82.1 mAh g−1 at 15C with a retention rate of 95.45 % after 350 cycles. It submits a capacity of 67.6 mAh g−1 at 90C and remains 52.2 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles. Even in full cells, it reveals a value of 110.6 mAh g−1. This work guides the application of in-situ multiple modifications of polymers in electrode materials.",

        "title": "Amorphous Aluminum Oxide-Coated NaFe0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33O2 Cathode Materials: Enhancing Interface Charge Transfer for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Layered cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gained considerable attention as promising candidates owing to their high capacity and potential for industrial scalability. Nonetheless, challenges arise from stress and structural degradation resulting from the deposition of larger ion radius species, leading to diminished cyclic stability and rate performance. In this study, we present a novel and straightforward strategy that combines the synergistic effects of an amorphous aluminum oxide coating and aluminum ion doping. This approach effectively addresses the issues of grain cracking and expands the interlayer spacing of alkali metal ions in SIB materials, thereby enhancing their overall performance. Consequently, it optimizes the diffusion of charge carriers and facilitates interfacial charge transfer, leading to remarkable improvements in the performance of the NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 material with 0.4 wt % amorphous aluminum oxide coating (NNMF-0.4A), which exhibits reversible capacities of 135.7, 114.3, 106.8, 99.9, 89.5, and 77.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. Furthermore, the NNMF-0.4A material maintains a capacity of 76.7 mA g-1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 800 mA g-1 (10 C), with a capacity retention rate of 98.2%. Our findings present a groundbreaking pathway for modifying high-power sodium-ion battery cathode materials, contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy storage technologies.",
