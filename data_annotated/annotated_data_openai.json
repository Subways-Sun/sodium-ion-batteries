        "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large‐scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high‐rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite‐type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+‐diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as‐synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well‐matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full‐cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of ≈10 kW kg−1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23 kW kg−1, an energy density of 58 Wh kg−1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high‐power SIB for large‐scale applications in the future.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a top alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale renewable energy storage units due to their low cost and the abundance of sodium-bearing precursors in the earth's mineral deposits. However, the development of anode materials for SIBs to date has been mainly limited to carbonaceous materials with minimal research devoted to high capacity alloy-based materials. In this study, an antimony (Sb)/carbon (C) electrode with ~30 nm Sb nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly encapsulated in interconnecting one-dimensional (1D) 400 nm carbon fibers (denoted as SbNP@C) was fabricated using a simple and scalable electrospinning method. This binder-free, current collector-free SbNP@C electrode demonstrated high capacity and stable long-term cycling performance at various current densities. The SbNP@C electrode showed an initial total capacity of 422 mAh/gelectrode and retained 350 mAh/gelectrode after 300 deep charge-discharge cycles under 100 mA/gSb. Moreover, because of the efficient 1D sodium-ion transport pathway and the highly conductive network of SbNP@C, the electrode preserved high overall capacities even when cycled at high currents, extending its usability to high power applications.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",
        "Symmetric sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage owing to the simplified manufacture and wide abundance of sodium resources. However, most symmetric SIBs suffer from suppressed energy density. Here, a superior congeneric Na4V2(PO4)3 anode is synthesized via electrochemical preintercalation, and a high energy density symmetric SIB (Na3V2(PO4)3 as a cathode and Na4V2(PO4)3 as an anode) based on the deepened redox couple of V4+/V2+ is built for the first time. When measured in half cell, both electrodes show stabilized electrochemical performance (over 3000 cycles). The symmetric SIBs exhibit an output voltage of 3.0 V and a cell-level energy density of 138 W h kg-1. Furthermore, the sodium storage mechanism under the expanded measurement range of 0.01-3.9 V is disclosed through an in situ X-ray diffraction technique.",
        "Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are receiving intense interest because the resource abundance of sodium and its lithium-like chemistry make them low cost alternatives to the prevailing lithium-ion batteries in large-scale energy storage devices. Two typical classes of materials including transition metal oxides and polyanion compounds have been under intensive investigation as cathodes for SIBs; however, they are still limited to poor stability or low capacity of the state-of-art. Herein, we report a low cost carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 with simultaneous high capacity and good stability, owing to the highly pure Na-rich triclinic phase and the carbon-incorporated three-dimensional network morphology. The present carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 demonstrates the highest reversible capacity of 181.0 mAh g-1 to date with multielectron redox reaction that occurred among various polyanion-based SIBs cathodes, which achieves a close-to-100% initial Coulombic efficiency and a stable cycling with 88% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. In addition, such an electrode shows excellent stability either charged at a high voltage of 4.5 V or heated up to 800 °C. The present work might open up the possibility for developing high capacity, good safety and low cost polyanion-based cathodes for rechargeable SIBs.",
        "The anode/electrolyte interface behavior, and by extension, the overall cell performance of sodium‐ion batteries is determined by a complex interaction of processes that occur at all components of the electrochemical cell across a wide range of size‐ and timescales. Single‐scale studies may provide incomplete insights, as they cannot capture the full picture of this complex and intertwined behavior. Broad, multiscale studies are essential to elucidate these processes. Within this perspectives article, several analytical and theoretical techniques are introduced, and described how they can be combined to provide a more complete and comprehensive understanding of sodium‐ion battery (SIB) performance throughout its lifetime, with a special focus on the interfaces of hard carbon anodes. These methods target various length‐ and time scales, ranging from micro to nano, from cell level to atomistic structures, and account for a broad spectrum of physical and (electro)chemical characteristics. Specifically, how mass spectrometric, microscopic, spectroscopic, electrochemical, thermodynamic, and physical methods can be employed to obtain the various types of information required to understand battery behavior will be explored. Ways are then discussed how these methods can be coupled together in order to elucidate the multiscale phenomena at the anode interface and develop a holistic understanding of their relationship to overall sodium‐ion battery function.",
        "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",
        "The solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) film in a sodium-ion battery is closely related to capacity fading and cycling stability of the battery. However, there are few studies on the SEI film of sodium-ion batteries and the mechanism of SEI film formation is unclear. The mechanism for the reduction of ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), vinylene carbonate (VC), ethylene sulfite (ES), 1,3-propylene sulfite (PS), and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC) is studied by DFT. The reaction activation energies, Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, and structures of the transition states are calculated. It is indicated that VC, ES, and PS additives in the electrolyte are all easier to form organic components in the anode SEI film by one-electron reduction. The priority of one-electron reduction to produce organic SEI components is in the order of VC>PC>EC; two-electron reduction to produce the inorganic Na2 CO3 component is different and follows the order of EC>PC>VC. Two-electron reduction for sulfites ES and PS to form inorganic Na2 SO3 is harder than that of carbonate ester reduction. It is also suggested that the one- and two-electron reductive decomposition pathway for FEC is more feasible to produce inorganic NaF components.",
        "A positive effect of the polyacrylic acid (PAA)-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder to enhance the performance of an oxide-based anode was reported in batteries. A series of super high capacity and cycling ability oxide powders rarely achieved before was obtained, particularly most of them without any specific carbon modification and/or morphology control.",
        "Silicon (Si) has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for the next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density because it has 10 times higher theoretical specific capacity (4200 mAh/g) than that of graphite. However, severe volume change (~300%) of Si during lithiation and delithiation hinders the practical application of Si anode. In the last decade, significant progresses have been made on the specific energy and cycle life of Si based LIBs. However, calendar-life of these batteries is still far less than 10-year target required by DOE’s electrical vehicle (EV) project.\n In the current work, the role of FEC/VC in conventional carbonate electrolytes has been investigated. It has been found that FEC/VC causes large impedance growth on both Si and graphite anodes at 55 oC. The cut-off voltage of NMC622 has been found to significantly affect its impedance. NMC622 at 4.2V shows no impedance growth at 55 °C for 8 days, while severe impedance growth is observed at 4.4V. To address the instability of both SEI and CEI at elevated temperature, a new Localized High Concentration Electrolyte (LHCE) has been developed to improve the calendar life of Si based LIBs by effectively limiting impedance growth of Si/NMC622 full cells. In addition, the cycle life of the full cell is improved. The mechanism of Si full cells with improved calendar life will also be discussed.",
        "\n Over the past decade, there has been a significant acceleration in the adoption of lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries for various applications, ranging from portable electronics to automotive, defense, and aerospace applications. Lithium-ion batteries are the most used energy storage technologies due to their high energy densities and capacities. However, this battery technology is a potential safety hazard under off-nominal conditions, which may result in thermal runaway events. Such events can release toxic gaseous and particulate emissions, posing a severe risk to human health and the environment. Particulate emissions from the failure of two different cell chemistries – lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) were studied. Experiments were conducted at multiple states of charge (SOC), and three repeats were conducted at each SOC for each cell chemistry to examine the repeatability/variability of these events. Particulate emissions were characterized in terms of particulate matter mass (PM2.5), black carbon, and particle number (PN)/size. Failure of a single cell led to a significant release of particulate emissions, with peak emission levels being higher at the higher SOCs. A high level of variability was observed for a specific SOC for LFP cells, while NMCs exhibited relatively less variability. In general, much higher particulate emissions were observed for NMCs compared to LFPs at each SOC. For NMCs at 100% SOC, peak PN levels were ∼2.5E+09 particles/cc (part/cc), and black carbon levels were ∼60 mg/m3. For LFPs at 100% SOC, peak PN levels were ∼9.0E+08 part/cc, and black carbon levels were 2.5 mg/m3.",
        "Formation of vanadium oxide nanofilm-coated graphene oxide (GO) is achieved by thermally induced explosive disintegration of a microcrystalline ammonium peroxovanadate-GO composite. GO sheets isolate the microcrystalline grains and capture and contain the microexplosion products, resulting in the deposition of the nanoscale products on the GO. Thermal treatment of the supported nanofilm yields a sequence of nanocrystalline phases of vanadium oxide (V3O7, VO2) as a function of temperature. This is the first demonstration of microexplosive disintegration of a crystalline peroxo compound to yield a nanocoating. The large number of recently reported peroxide-rich crystalline materials suggests that the process can be a useful general route for nanofilm formation. The V3O7@GO composite product was tested as a sodium ion battery anode and showed high charge capacity at high rate charge-discharge cycling (150 mAh g-1 at 3000 mA g-1 vs 300 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1) due to the nanomorphology of the vanadium oxide.",
        "A comprehensive understanding of the morphology evolution of deposited lithium (Li) is a primary challenge in the commercialization of Li-metal batteries. Li-metal batteries, which contain a Li-metal anode, have a theoretical capacity that is an order of magnitude greater than that of a Li-ion battery helping to overcome their energy storage limitations. However, while Li-metal batteries have proven to have a much larger specific capacity, they are hindered by unstable deposition at the electrode-electrolyte interface and severe dendritic growth. Interfacial stability is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by many different factors, including local current densities, overpotentials, Li+ concentrations, and transport properties. Additionally, varying surface characteristics such as surface chemistries and the physical structure of the anode can affect Li deposition and could be used to design a more stable interface. Due to the nature of the anode surface, it is difficult to observe the complex physics experimentally. Thus, computational modeling is a powerful tool for understanding the deposition of Li on the anode surface. In this work we present a computational model to comprehensively study the morphology of dendrites when exposed to varying conditions. While transport properties1, electrolyte characteristics2, separator structures3, and charging protocols4 play significant roles in Li dendrite morphology and interfacial stability, this work focuses on the impact of the anode surface itself on stability. This includes patterned anode surfaces for guided lithium deposition and varying surface chemistries such as surface energy and reaction rate. We concentrate on the types of defects that are present along the anode surface including surface roughness, points of high convexity, breaks in the SEI layer, lattice defects leading to changes in surface energy and their impact on instability. We also look at guided deposition through modifications of the anode surface.\n 1. J. Tan, A. M. Tartakovsky, K. Ferris, and E. M. Ryan, J Electrochem Soc, 163, A318–A327 (2016).\n 2. J. Tan and E.

        "Rational fabrication of anode electrodes for sodium-ion batteries remains a challenge due to the problem of sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, large volume expansion etc. Significant efforts, such as fabricating carbon composites and novel nanostructures, have been devoted to the development of anode materials. Herein, an ultra-small few-layer MoS2 nanostructure confined on a hierarchical porous carbon fiber composite was synthesized through the nanocasting route using a novel hierarchical porous carbon fiber as the template. As an anode material, the composite displays outstanding electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries. For instance, it delivers high reversible capacities (491 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), high rate performance (387 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1) and long-term cycling stability (234 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 3000 cycles). Note that it shows one of the best long-term cycling properties reported to date for MoS2-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. This regulation strategy may offer new insights into the fabrication of high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "We develop zirconium-templated NiO/NiOOH nanosheets on nickel foam and polypyrrole-embedded in exfoliated carbon fiber cloth as complementary electrodes for an asymmetric battery-type supercapacitor device. We achieve high volumetric energy and power density by the modification of commercially available current collectors (CCs). The modified CCs provide the source of active material, actively participate in the charge storage process, provide a larger surface area for active material loading, need no additional binders or conductive additives, and retain the ability to act as the CC. Nickel foam (NF) CCs are modified by use of a soft-templating/solvothermal treatment to generate NiO/NiOOH nanosheets, where the NF is the source of Ni for the synthesis. Carbon-fiber cloth (CFC) CCs are modified by an electrochemical oxidation/reduction process to generate exfoliated core-shell structures (ECFC). Electropolymerization of pyrrole into the shell structure produces polypyrrole embedded in exfoliated core-shell material (PPy@rECFC). Battery-type supercapacitor devices are produced with NiO/NiOOH@NF and PPy@rECFC as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Volumetric energy densities for the full-cell device are in the range of 2.60-4.12 mWh cm-3 with corresponding power densities in the range of 9.17-425.58 mW cm-3. This is comparable to thin-film lithium-ion batteries (0.3-10 mWh cm-3) and better than some commercial supercapacitors (<1 mWh cm-3).1 The energy and power density is impressive considering that it was calculated using the entire cell volume (active materials, separator, and both CCs). The full-cell device is highly stable, retaining 96% and 88% of capacity after 2000 and 5000 cycles, respectively. These results demonstrate the utility of directly modifying the CCs and suggest a new method to produce high volumetric energy density and power density storage devices.",
        "High gravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density energy storage devices are highly desirable due to the rapid development of electric vehicles, and portable and wearable electronic equipment. Electrospinning is a promising technology for preparing freestanding electrodes with high gravimetric and volumetric energy density. However, the energy density of the traditional electrospun electrodes is restricted by the low mass loading of active materials (e.g. 20%-30 wt%). Herein, a biomimetic strategy inspired by the phenomenon of the sticky spider web is demonstrated as a high performance anode, which simultaneously improves the gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Freestanding carbon nanofiber (CNF) membranes containing over 50 wt% of bismuth were prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. Membranes consisting of CNF network structures bonded tightly with active Bi cluster materials, resulting in excellent mechanical protection and a fast charge transport path, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. The composite membrane delivers high reversible capacity (483 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 200 cycles) and high rate performance (242 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1) as a lithium-ion battery anode. For use as a sodium ion battery, the composite membrane also shows a high reversible specific capacity of 346 mA h g-1 and outstanding cycling performance (186 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 after 100 cycles). This work offers a simple, low cost and eco-friendly method for fabricating free-standing and binder-free composite electrodes with high loading used in LIBs and SIBs.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are prospective alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy-storage applications, owing to the abundant resources of sodium. Metal sulfides are deemed to be promising anode materials for SIBs due to their low-cost and eco-friendliness. Herein, for the first time, series of copper sulfides (Cu2S, Cu7S4, and Cu7KS4) are controllably synthesized via a facile electrochemical route in KCl-NaCl-Na2S molten salts. The as-prepared Cu2S with micron-sized flakes structure is first investigated as anode of SIBs, which delivers a capacity of 430 mAh g-1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.9% at a current density of 100 mA g-1. Moreover, the Cu2S anode demonstrates superior capability (337 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1, corresponding to 50 C) and ultralong cycle performance (88.2% of capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g-1, corresponding to 0.0024% of fade rate per cycle). Meanwhile, the pseudocapacitance contribution and robust porous structure in situ formed during cycling endow the Cu2S anodes with outstanding rate capability and enhanced cyclic performance, which are revealed by kinetics analysis and ex situ characterization.",
        "To achieve a broader public acceptance for electric vehicles based on lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology, long driving ranges, low cost, and high safety are needed. A promising pathway to address these key parameters lies in the further improvement of Ni-rich cathode materials for LIB cells. Despite the higher achieved capacities and thus energy densities, there are major drawbacks in terms of capacity retention and thermal stability (of the charged cathode) which are crucial for customer acceptance and can be mitigated by protecting cathode particles. We studied the impact of surface modifications on cycle life and thermal stability of LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2 layered oxide cathodes with WO3 by a simple sol–gel coating process. Several advanced analytical techniques such as low-energy ion scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and high-temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction of delithiated cathode materials, as well as charge/discharge cycling give significant insights into the impact of surface coverage of the coatings on mitigating degradation mechanisms. The results show that successful surface modifications of WO3 with a surface coverage of only 20% can prolong the cycle life of an LIB cell and play a crucial role in improving the thermal stability and, hence, the safety of LIBs.",
        "Sodium ion batteries possess several advantages for large-scale energy storage, such as low cost and enhanced safety. However, graphite or other anode materials are not satisfactory because the large radius of Na+ hinders their embedding and removal in the charge and discharge processes. Recently, a biphenylene network (BPN), a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has been synthesized. In this paper, we reveal the potential possibility of BPN as a Na storage material. The theoretical results indicate the advantages of BPN as a sodium battery anode. The maximum specific capacity (413 mA h g-1) is larger than that of the graphite-Li system (372 mA h g-1). With low Na+ diffusion barrier (<0.6 eV) and small volume expansion in the charging process (∼26%), BPN presents superiority to the graphite-Na system. Our findings show new insights into Na storage in BPN and provide guidance for the use of a BPN anode in sodium ion batteries.",
        "The phase transition and lattice parameter evolution of O3 structure commonly occurs in O3-type sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes, which might enlarge the voltage hysteresis and lower the energy efficiency. Given that the cost is one of the issues discouraging the application of SIBs in large-scale energy storage, here we focus on Co/Ni-free NaxCu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 (x = 0.8, 0.85, 0.9) and propose a convenient strategy to reduce the voltage hysteresis. It is found that when the Na content is 0.8, the highest energy efficiency of 95.4% after activation is achieved (2.5-4.0 V, 50 mA g-1, the 50th cycle), in addition to a satisfactory capacity retention (about 0.056% decay per cycle). The further characterizations reveal that Na0.8Cu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 owns a gentle O3-P3 phase transition process and does not undergo O3 phase lattice parameter evolution. The key point lies in the attainability of the O3/P3 composite of the material. This work will provide a simple strategy for the rational design of O3-type cathodes with a high energy efficiency and might offer inspiration to search for layered oxides with a higher O3/P3 critical Na content through element adjustments.",
        "This study develops a composite cathode material suitable for solid-state Li-ion batteries (SSLIB). The composite cathode consists of LiFePO4 as the active material, Super P and KS-4 carbon materials as the conductive agents, and LiTFSI as the lithium salt. An LiFePO4/LATP-PVDF-HFP/Li all-solid-state LIB was assembled using Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP)/ poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) as the solid-state electrolyte and lithium metal as the anode. The structure of the synthesized LATP was analyzed using X-ray diffraction, and the microstructure of the composite cathode and solid electrolyte layer was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope. The electrochemical properties of the all-solid-state LIB were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and a charge–discharge test. The effect of the composition ratio of the fabricated cathode on SSLIB performance is discussed. The results reveal that the SSLIB fabricated using the cathode containing LiFePO4, Super P, KS-4, PVDF, and LiTFSI at a weight ratio of 70:10:10:7:3 (wt.%) and a LATP/PVDF-HFP solid electrolyte layer containing PVDF-HFP, LiTFSI, and LATP at a weight ratio of 22:33:45 (wt.%) exhibited the optimal performance. Particularly, the SSLIB fabricated using the cathode containing 3% LiTFSI exhibited a discharge capacity of 168.9 mAhg−1 at 0.1 C, which is close to the theoretical capacity (170 mAhg−1), and had very good stability. The findings of this study suggests that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of LiTFSI can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of SSLIB batteries.",
        "Ultrafine niobium oxide nanocrystals/reduced graphene oxide (Nb2O5 NCs/rGO) was demonstrated as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery with high rate performance and high cycle durability. Nb2O5 NCs/rGO was synthesized by controllable hydrolysis of niobium ethoxide and followed by heat treatment at 450 °C in flowing forming gas. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that Nb2O5 NCs with average particle size of 3 nm were uniformly deposited on rGO sheets and voids among Nb2O5 NCs existed. The architecture of ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs anchored on a highly conductive rGO network can not only enhance charge transfer and buffer the volume change during sodiation/desodiation process but also provide more active surface area for sodium ion storage, resulting in superior rate and cycle performance. Ex situ XPS analysis revealed that the sodium ion storage mechanism in Nb2O5 could be accompanied by Nb(5+)/Nb(4+) redox reaction and the ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs provide more surface area to accomplish the redox reaction.",
        "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C‒S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 Å for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g‒1. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage.",
        "To design a high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode, binary zinc phosphides (ZnP2 and Zn3P2) were synthesized by a facile solid-state heat treatment process, and their Na storage characteristics were evaluated. The Na reactivity of ZnP2 was better than that of Zn3P2. Therefore, a C-modified ZnP2-based composite (ZnP2-C) was fabricated to achieve better electrochemical performance. To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",
        "\n With the development of electric vehicles, the demand for lithium-ion batteries has been increasing annually. Accurately estimating the State of Health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for their efficient and reliable use. Most of the existing research on SOH estimation is based on parameters such as current, voltage, and temperature, which are prone to fluctuations. Estimating the SOH of lithium-ion batteries based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and data-driven approaches has been proven effective. In this paper, we explore a novel SOH estimation model for lithium batteries based on EIS and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Vision Transformer (VIT). The EIS data is treated as a grayscale image, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction and simultaneously capturing both local and global features in the data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of simulation experiments are conducted, comparing it with various traditional machine learning models in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model performs best overall in the testing dataset at three different temperatures. This confirms that the model can accurately and stably estimate the SOH of lithium-ion batteries without requiring manual feature extraction and knowledge of battery aging temperature.",
        "Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as potential next-generation energy storage systems due to their high specific energy of 2600 Wh kg-1 and 2800 Wh L-1. Nevertheless, the practical application of LSBs still faces several hazards, including the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides, low electrical conductivities of solid sulfur and lithium sulfides, and large volume expansion during charge/discharge cycles. To address this critical challenge, we innovatively proposed facile synthesis of nanostructured VN quantum dots (VNQD)/holey graphene matrix for stabilizing the sulfur cathode by simultaneously promoting the trapping, anchoring, and catalyzing efficiencies of both LiPSs and Li2S. Benefiting from abundant edge catalytic sites of VNQD, in-plane nanopores of graphene, and high electrical conductivity, the sulfur host not only provides high adsorption capability toward soluble polysulfides, strong binding ability for anchoring solid Li2S, and their rapid conversion kinetics but also contributes abundant sulfur storage sites and efficient transport pathways for lithium ions (Li+) and electrons. Consequently, the sulfur cathode exhibits high initial capacities of 1320 mAh g-1, high rate capability (850 mAh g-1 @ 4 mA cm-2), and high capacity retention of 99.95% per cycle after 500 cycles, providing a feasible solution for the practical utilization of shuttle-free Li-S batteries.",
        "Layered manganese-based cathode materials are of great interest due to their high specific capacities for sodium ion batteries. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and the inevitable phase transition are detrimental for achieving considerable cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, a P2-type manganese oxide nanoplate cathode material modified by Mo-substitution with oriented stacking structure and exposed {010} active facets is reported. The manganese oxide nanoplate cathode yields remarkable capacity retention of 87.8% after 1200 cycles at 10C (2000 mA g-1). The specific power density is estimated as high as 530 W Kg-1 with a specific discharge capacity 143.9 mA h g-1 at 1C and 89.6% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances can be attributed to the efficient chemical modification and the unique structural features of the present manganese oxide nanoplate. Mo-modification can endow manganese oxide cathode with enlarged lattice space and average oxidation state and thus favorable Na+ diffusion to inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and improve the structure stability, thereby achieving an extremely long cycling life. Multilayer oriented stacking nanoplate structure with exposed {010} active facets is also beneficial for providing more surface active sites and shortening the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better rate capability.",
        "Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK-5-like structures that are constructed to consist of sub-10 nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow-structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, we report a versatile and general silanol-assisted surface-casting method to create hollow-structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom-doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2-thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400 m2 g-1 ), large pore volume (4.0 cm3 g-1 ), as well as satisfactory lithium-storage capacity (1460 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 ), excellent rate capability (320 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 ), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5 A g-1 ).

The structural and morphological characterizations reveal that Sb@C microspheres are composed of Sb nanoparticles (∼20 nm) homogeneously encapsulated in the C matrix. The self-catalyzing solvothermal mechanism is verified through comparative experiments by using different raw materials. The as-prepared Sb@C microspheres exhibit superior sodium storage properties, demonstrating a reversible capacity of 640 mAh g(-1), excellent rate performance, and an extended cycling stability of 92.3% capacity retention over 300 cycles, making them promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "Present day lithium ion batteries face challenges regarding the sustainability, cost, and natural resource availability of their components. Sodium has been shown to be a complementary energy storage material, providing usable volumetric energy density. In designing sodium ion batteries (SIBs), hard carbon is used at the anode in place of graphite, due to the necessary micro domain structure needed to store sodium ions. Coal char is a low cost material and viable source of hard carbon. The use of coal char in SIBs also provides a high value, secondary use pathway for the abundant char component of coal.\n In this work, flash pyrolyzation is explored as a novel approach for coal char synthesis for SIB anodes using a Utah local bituminous coal. During flash pyrolyzation, char is heated in a drop-tube furnace at 1000 oC/s vs. the traditional slow pyrolyzation approach where char is heated at 20 oC/min. Flash pyrolyzed (FP) char has a surface structure that is vastly different in comparison to the slow pyrolyzed (SP) char (Figure 1.), larger d-spacing (FP d-spacing = 0.379 nm, SP d-spacing = 0.364 nm) and a smaller closed micropore diameter (FP micropore = 1.52 nm, SP micropore = 1.91 nm), as concluded from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, respectively.\n The SIB performance of FP char vs. SP char is tested and compared in ether-based and ester-based electrolytes. FP char performs better as a SIB anode than SP char in both electrolytes. Additionally, both char anodes achieve higher reversible capacity and better initial coulombic efficiencies (ICE) in an ether-based vs. ester-based electrolyte. When FP char is combined with an ether-based electrolyte, a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh/g is achieved, whereas a SP char with an ester-based electrolyte cell has a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 72.5 mAh/g, when both cells are cycled at 50 mA/g (sodium metal half-cells). FP ether cells also perform with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 64%, but SP ester cells only show an ICE value of 52%. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the FP cells is attributed to differences in surface/bulk structure due to the high heating rate. The improvement in char anode performance in ether-based cells is likely due to the formation of a thinner solid-electrolyte interphase and/or improved sodiation due to an ether-based electrolyte.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",
        "Lithium‐based all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) are attracting worldwide attention as the next step in the evolution of Li‐ion batteries (LIBs). They have the potential to address safety concerns and limited energy densities, which are key challenges for LIBs. The current focus is on enhancing the electrochemical properties of ASSBs. However, a suitable economic method for fabricating them remains to be established, especially when ceramic materials are used as solid electrolytes. The powder aerosol deposition method (PAD or ADM) is a ceramic processing method that uses raw ceramic powders to fabricate dense, several micrometer thick ceramic films. The entire process takes place at room temperature and in the absence of additional binders. Therefore, PAD is used in this study to fabricate ASSBs with LiNi0.83Mn0.11Co0.06O2 (NMC) as the cathode active material and Al0.2Li6.025La3Zr1.625Ta0.375O12 (LLZO) as the solid electrolyte. The cathode is fabricated as a composite with a gradient in the electrolyte concentration. The successful fabrication is confirmed through scanning electron microscopy and energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy analysis. Electrochemical characterization shows that a PAD‐ASSB can be cycled. Furthermore, it can be shown that 145 µm thick NMC films can be fabricated by PAD. The electrochemical results are compared with the theoretical potential of PAD‐ASSBs, and methods to further improve the achieved state are discussed.",
        "Tin disulfide (SnS2) has emerged as a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs) due to its unique layered structure, high theoretical capacity, and low cost. Conventional SnS2 nanomaterials are normally synthesized using hydrothermal method, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale up for mass production. In this study, we develop a simple solid-state reaction method, in which the carbon-coated SnS2 (SnS2/C) anode materials were synthesized by annealing metallic Sn, sulfur powder, and polyacrylonitrile in a sealed vacuum glass tube. The SnS2/C nanospheres with unique layered structure exhibit a high reversible capacity of 660 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) and maintain at 570 mAh g(-1) for 100 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.14% per cycle, demonstrating one of the best cycling performances in all reported SnS2/C anodes for NIBs to date. The superior cycling stability of SnS2/C electrode is attributed to the stable nanosphere morphology and structural integrity during charge/discharge cycles as evidenced by ex situ characterization.",
        "Sodium (Na) ion batteries (SIBs) promise low‐cost energy storage systems but are still restricted by insufficient energy density. Introducing oxygen (O) redox into the design of the Na‐storage cathode is presently considered an effective avenue to generate extra capacity in solving the energy density bottleneck. The succeeding issues are how to overcome the irreversible electrochemical behavior accompanied by O release. Meanwhile, the O redox chemistry and subsequent structural evolution remain ambiguous so far. Here, we deliberate on the O redox mechanism in Na‐storage transition metal oxides. Challenges associated with the reaction irreversibility and structural collapse are summarized by virtue of the advanced characterization techniques. Beyond that, strategies that potentially enhance the electrochemical properties of O redox and future research perspectives on exploring useable O redox cathode materials are outlined.",
        "Graphene‐based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene‐based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore‐forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in‐plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene‐based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene‐based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.",
        "Heterostructure engineering is one of the most promising modification strategies toward improving sluggish kinetics for the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a systemic investigation on the different types of heterostructure interfaces' effects of discharging products (Na2O, Na2S, Na2Se) on the rate performance. First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant. The experimental evidence confirms that the metal sulfide/metal selenide (SnS/SnSe2) hierarchical anode exhibits outstanding rate performance, where the normalized capacity at 10 A g-1 compared to 0.1 A g-1 is 45.6%. The proposed design strategy in this work is helpful to design high rate performance anodes for advanced battery systems.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries are promising futuristic large-scale energy-storage devices because of the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the development and commercialization of the sodium-ion battery solely depends on the use of high-capacity electrode materials. Among the various metal oxides, SnO2 has a high theoretical specific capacity for sodium-ion battery. However, the enormous volume expansion and low electrical conductivity of SnO2 hinder its capability to reach the predicted theoretical value. Although different nanostructured designs of electrode materials like SnO2 nanocomposites have been studied, the effects of other cell components like electrolyte and binder on the specific capacity and cyclic stability are yet to be understood. In the present study, we have investigated the synergistic effect of electrolyte and binder on the performance enhancement of SnO2 supported on the intertwined network structure of reduced graphene oxide partially open multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrid as anode in sodium-ion battery. Our result shows that sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate as the electrolyte solvent offers a high specific capacity of 688 mAh g–1 and a satisfactory cyclic stability for 500 cycles. This is about 56% enhancement in specific capacity compared to the use of poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder and propylene carbonate as the electrolyte solvent. The present study provides a better understanding of the synergistic role of electrolyte and binder for the development of metal-oxide-based electrode materials for the advancement of the commercialization of sodium-ion battery.",

        "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",
        "Single‐layered MoS2 is a promising anode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) due to its high capacity and isotropic ion transport paths. However, the low intrinsic conductivity and easy‐agglomerated feature hamper its applications. Here, a charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy that Co2+ replaces Mo4+ in the doping form to endow MoS2 layers with negative charges, thus inducing electrostatic repulsion, together with the insertion of gaseous groups, to drive interlayer expansion which once breaks the confinement of interlayer van der Waals force, single‐layered MoS2 is obtained and uniformly dispersed into carbon matrix arising from the transformation of carbonaceous gaseous groups under high vapor pressure, is proposed. Co atom doping helps enhance the intrinsic conductivity of single‐layered MoS2. Carbon matrix effectively prevents agglomeration of single‐layered MoS2. The doped Co atoms can be fully transformed into ultrasmall Co nanoparticles during conversion reaction, which enables strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance and thus significantly boosts ion transport and storage. Consequently, the prepared material delivers superb Li/Na/K‐ion storage performances, which are best in the reported MoS2‐based anodes. The proposed charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy provides a novel perspective for preparing single‐layered MoS2, which shows huge potential for energy storage.",
        "The utilization of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to enhance performance, but as yet it has rarely been reported. Taking the MoO(3-x) nanosheet anode as an example, for the first time we demonstrate the benefits of OVs on SIB performance. Moreover, the benefits at deep-discharge conditions can be further promoted by an ultrathin Al2O3 coating. A series of measurements show that the OVs increase the electric conductivity and Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and the promotion from ultrathin coating lies in the effective reduction of cycling-induced solid-electrolyte interphase. The coated nanosheets exhibited high reversible capacity and great rate capability with the capacities of 283.9 (50 mA g(-1)) and 179.3 mAh g(-1) (1 A g(-1)) after 100 cycles. This work may not only arouse future attention on OVs for sodium energy storage, but also open up new possibilities for designing strategies to utilize defects in other energy storage systems.",
        "The rational design of anode materials is a challenge in developing sodium ion batteries. Alloy anodes provide high gravimetric and volumetric capacities but suffer the short cycle life as a result of the continuous and accumulated pulverization, resulting from a large volume change during the cycling process. Herein, using pure Sn, an irreversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (SnO), and a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (Sn4P3) as samples, we demonstrate that the pulverization and aggregation of the alloy anode can be partially recovered and the accumulation of pulverization and aggregation during charge/discharge cycles can be terminated using a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction. The cycling stability of three Sn-based anodes increases in order of Sn4P3 > SnO > Sn. The enhancement in Sn4P3 can be attributed to a reversible reaction of Sn4P3 + 9Na ↔ 4Sn + 3Na3P, which repairs the cracks, damage, and aggregation of Sn particles that occurred in the alloy process of 4Sn + 15Na ↔ Na15Sn4 during cycling and, hence, terminates the pulverization. The repair mechanism looks like the self-healing feature in nature, where the damage can be healed by itself. Therefore, the suggested mechanism can be called self-healing, while the repaired anode can be termed as the self-healing anode. The use of self-healing strategies to build an electrode architecture is new and highly desirable because it can increase the cycle life and provide a general approach toward stable electrode materials.",
        "Black phosphorus (BP) has recently aroused researchers' great interest as promising anode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), owing to its high theoretical capacity (2596 mAh g-1) and good electric conductivity (about 300 S m-1). However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles.",
        "Layered O3-type sodium oxides (NaMO2 , M=transition metal) commonly exhibit an O3-P3 phase transition, which occurs at a low redox voltage of about 3 V (vs. Na+ /Na) during sodium extraction and insertion, with the result that almost 50 % of their total capacity lies at this low voltage region, and they possess insufficient energy density as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Therefore, development of high-voltage O3-type cathodes remains challenging because it is difficult to raise the phase-transition voltage by reasonable structure modulation. A new example of O3-type sodium insertion materials is presented for use in NIBs. The designed O3-type Na0.7 Ni0.35 Sn0.65 O2 material displays a highest redox potential of 3.7 V (vs. Na+ /Na) among the reported O3-type materials based on the Ni2+ /Ni3+ couple, by virtue of its increased Ni-O bond ionicity through reduced orbital overlap between transition metals and oxygen within the MO2 slabs. This study provides an orbital-level understanding of the operating potentials of the nominal redox couples for O3-NaMO2 cathodes. The strategy described could be used to tailor electrodes for improved performance.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), as one of the potential candidates for grid-scale energy storage systems, are required to tackle extreme weather conditions. However, the all-weather SIBs with a wide operation-temperature range are rarely reported. Herein, we propose a wide-temperature SIB, which involves a carbon-coated Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a Bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme-based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na + can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de-solvent process.  Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na + diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low-temperature behavior. Even at -70 °C, this battery still delivers 70.19% of the room-temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature up to 100 °C. These encourage results might shed light on the exploration of wide-temperature SIBs.",
        "Three-dimensional honeycomb-like carbon network-encapsulated Fe/Fe3C/Fe3O4 composites are constructed via a facile pyrolysis of ferrite nitrate-poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) precursors. The nanostructures of the composites form in terms of the iron catalysis in the pyrolysis process, which greatly depends on the reaction temperature and contents of raw materials. The Fe/Fe3C/Fe3O4/C composite obtained at 700 °C possesses a high surface area, outstanding structural stability, and fast electron/Li ion transportability. As the anode for lithium-ion batteries, it displays a high specific capacity (1295 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1), long cycling stability, and fast kinetics (345 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 5 A g-1). Besides the nanostructures, the marriage of different components also contributes to the superior electrochemical performance. The integral carbon matrix supplies a fast electron/Li transportation pathway. Fe/Fe3C acts as an electrocatalyst in the electrode, which may bring extra capacity.

Now, a molecular design concept is presented for improving the stability of organic compounds for battery electrodes. The molecular design of the investigated compound, [2.2.2.2]paracyclophane‐1,9,17,25‐tetraene (PCT), can stabilize the neutral state by local aromaticity and the doubly reduced state by global aromaticity, resulting in an anode material with extraordinarily stable cycling performance and outstanding performance under fast‐charge/discharge conditions, demonstrating an exciting new path for the development of electrode materials for SIBs and other types of batteries.",
        "Lithium (Li) metal is widely acknowledged as the most promising anode material, owing to its high capacity and low potential. However, the practical implementation of Li faces challenges, including uncontrollable dendritic growth and a deficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here a straightforward method is provided for fabricating Li composites using Al‐doped Li7La3Zr2O12 particles (Li/LLZO) with high Li‐ion conductivity achieved using a mechanical kneading process. The optimized composite, with 20% LLZO content (Li/LLZO‐20), effectively regulates the Li‐ion flux, successfully suppressing Li dendritic growth. Using a systematic investigation, it is demonstrated that incorporating LLZO particles significantly accelerates Li‐ion migration at the electrode–electrolyte interface, facilitating smooth transport through the LLZO particles.

        "The incorporation of oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 has been studied as a promising way to accelerate the transport of electrons and Na+ ions, which is important for achieving excellent electrochemical properties for anatase TiO2. However, wittingly introducing oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 for sodium-ion anodes by a facile and effective method is still a challenge. In this work, we report an innovative method to introduce oxygen vacancies into the urchin-like N-doped carbon coated anatase TiO2 (NC-DTO) by a facile plasma treatment. The superiorities of the oxygen vacancies combined with the conductive N-doped carbon coating enable the obtained NC-DTO of greatly improved sodium storage performance. When served as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, the NC-DTO electrode shows superior electrochemical performance (capacity: 272 mA h g-1 at 0.25 C, capacity retention: 98.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, as well as ultrahigh capacity: 150 mA h g-1 at 15 C). Density functional theory calculations combined with experimental results suggest that considerably improved sodium storage performance of NC-DTO is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity from the N-doped carbon layer as well as narrowed band gap and lowered sodiation energy barrier from the introduction of oxygen vacancies. This work highlights that introducing oxygen vacancies into TiO2 by plasma is a promising method to enhance the electrochemical property of TiO2, which also can be applied to different metal oxides for energy storage devices.",
        "Maximum releasable capacity and internal resistance are often used as the health indicators (HIs) of a lithium-ion battery for degradation modeling and estimation of remaining useful life (RUL). However, the maximum releasable capacity is usually difficult to estimate in online applications due to complex operating conditions in the field. Moreover, measuring the internal resistance is too expensive to be implemented on-line. In this paper, an HI extraction and optimization framework requiring only the operating parameters of lithium-ion batteries is proposed for battery degradation modeling and RUL estimation. The framework carries out raw HI extraction, transformation, correlation analysis, and verification and evaluation to achieve HI enhancement. In particular, the Box-Cox transformation is adopted to improve the correlation between the extracted HI and the battery's actual degradation state. To estimate the battery's RUL using the enhanced HI, an optimized relevance vector-machine algorithm is utilized, which can be performed in a flexible and agile way. Experimental studies using two different industrial testing data sets illustrate the high efficiency and adaptability of the proposed framework in lithium-ion battery degradation modeling and RUL estimation.",

        "The dual-ion battery (DIB) system has attracted great attention owing to its merits of low cost, high energy, and environmental friendliness. However, the DIBs based on sodium-ion electrolytes are seldom reported due to the lack of appropriate anode materials for reversible Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, a new sodium-ion based DIB named as MoS2 /C-G DIB using penne-like MoS2 /C nanotube as anode and expanded graphite as cathode is constructed and optimized for the first time. The hierarchical MoS2 /C nanotube provides expanded (002) interlayer spacing of 2H-MoS2 , which facilitates fast Na+ insertion/extraction reaction kinetics, thus contributing to improved DIB performance. The MoS2 /C-G DIB delivers a reversible capacity of 65 mA h g-1 at 2 C in the voltage window of 1.0-4.0 V, with good cycling performance for 200 cycles and 85% capacity retention, indicating the feasibility of potential applications for sodium-ion based DIBs.",
        "Hard carbon (HC) is the most promising candidate for sodium-ion battery anode materials. Several material properties such as intensity ratio of the Raman spectrum, lateral size of HC crystallite (La ), and interlayer distance (d002 ) have been discussed as factors affecting anode performance. However, these factors do not reflect the bulk property of the Na+ intercalation reaction directly, since Raman analysis has high surface sensitivity and La and d002 provide only one-dimensional crystalline information. Herein, it was proposed that the crystallite interlayer area (Ai ) defined using La , d002 , and stacking height (Lc ) governs Na+ intercalation behavior of various HCs. It was revealed that various wood-derived HCs exhibited the similar total capacity of approximately 250 mAh g-1 , whereas the Na+ intercalation capacity (Ci ) was proportional to Ai with the correlation coefficient of R2 =0.94. The evaluation factor of Ai was also adaptable to previous reports and strongly correlated with their Ci , indicating that Ai is more widely adaptable than the conventional evaluation methods.",
        "While lithium resources are scarce for high energy‐dense lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), serving as an alternative, inherently suffer from low capacity and the high‐cost use of non‐graphite anodes. Combining Li‐ and Na‐ions within a single battery system is expected to mitigate the shortcomings of both systems while leveraging their respective advantages. In this study, we developed and assembled a nanodiamonds (NDs)‐assisted co‐Li/Na‐ion battery (ND–LSIB). This innovative battery system comprised a commercial graphite anode, an ND‐modified polypropylene (DPP) separator, a hybrid lithium/sodium‐based electrolyte, and a cathode. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the ND/Li co‐insertion can serve as an ion‐drill opening graphite layers and reconstructing graphite anodes into few‐layered graphene with expanding interlayer space, achieving highly efficient Li/Na storage and the theoretical maximum of LiC6 for Li storage in graphite. In addition, ND is helpful for creating a LiF‐/NaF‐rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface with improved ionic mobility, mechanical strength, and reversibility. Consequently, ND–LSIBs have higher specific capacities ~1.4 times the theoretical value of LIBs and show long‐term cycling stability. This study proposes and realizes the concept of Li/Na co‐storage in one ion battery with compatible high‐performance, cost‐effectiveness, and industrial prospects.",

Benefiting from the efficient combination of GO and Cd2GeO4 NWs, our Cd2GeO4 NW/GO/CNT composite film exhibits a capacity of 784 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 200 mA g−1, which is 2.7 times higher than that of Cd2GeO4 NW/CNT film (290 mA h g−1). At a higher rate of 400 mA g−1 and 1 A g−1, the Cd2GeO4 NW/GO/CNT film delivers a stable capacity of 617 and 397 mA h g−1, respectively. Even at 2.5 A g−1, it still exhibits a high rate capacity of 180 mA h g−1. The flexible Cd2GeO4 NW/GO/CNT film clearly demonstrates good cycling stability and rate performance for anode materials in LIBs.

The carbon coating, introduced by sucrose addition, had an effect of suppressing the growth of the TiO2 primary crystallites during calcination. The carbon coated TiO2 (sucrose 20 wt % coated) electrode exhibited excellent cycle retention during 50 cycles (100%) and superior rate capability up to a 30 C rate at room temperature. This cell delivered a high discharge capacity of 155 mAh g(composite)(-1) at 0.1 C, 149 mAh g(composite)(-1) at 1 C, and 82.7 mAh g(composite)(-1) at a 10 C rate, respectively.",
        "Development of intrinsically safe and long lifespan sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is urgently needed for large-scale energy storage applications. However, most of the currently developed SIBs suffer from insufficient cycle life and potential unsafety. Herein, we construct an all-phosphate sodium-ion battery (AP-SIB) using a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, NaTi2(PO4)3 anode, and nonflammable trimethyl phosphate (TMP) electrolyte. The AP-SIB exhibits not only high safety, high rate performance, and ultralong cycle life but also zero-strain characteristics due to the inverse volume change of the phosphate cathode and anode during charge and discharge cycles, offering a safer and cycle-stable Na-ion technology for electric storage applications.",
        "To solve the problem of large volume change and low electronic conductivity of earth-abundant ilmenite used in rechargeable Na-ion batteries (SIBs), an anode of tiny ilmenite FeTiO3 nanoparticle embedded carbon nanotubes (FTO⊂CNTs) has been successfully proposed. By introducing a TiO2 shell on metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) nanorods by sol-gel deposition and subsequent solid-state annealing treatment of these core-shell Fe-MOF@TiO2, such well-defined FTO⊂CNTs are obtained. The achieved FTO⊂CNT electrode has several distinct advantages including a hollow interior in the hybrid nanostructure, fully encapsulated ultrasmall electroactive units, flexible conductive carbon matrix, and stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) of FTO in cycles. FTO⊂CNT electrodes present an excellent cycle stability (358.8 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1) and remarkable rate capability (201.8 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1) with a high Coulombic efficiency of approximately 99%. In addition, combined with the typical Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to constitute full SIBs, the assembled FTO⊂CNT//Na3V2(PO4)3 batteries are also demonstrated with superior rate capability and a long cycle life.",
        "We report the fabrication of 3D flower-like MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth as a binder-free anode for sodium ion battery. Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the ALD TiO2 layer can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of MoS2. The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",
        "Creating new architectures with a combined superiority of diverse materials achieving for more fantastic performances are attracting great attention recently. Herein, we introduce a novel dual metal (oxide) microsphere reinforced by vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and covered with a titanium oxide metal ion transfer diffusion layer. The CNTs penetrate the oxide particles and buffer structural volume change, while enhancing electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the external TiO2-C shell serves as a transport pathway for mobile metal ions (e.g., Li+) and acts as a protective layer for the inner oxides by reducing the electrolyte/metal oxide interfacial area and minimizing side reactions. The proposed design is shown to significantly improve the stability and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of metal (oxide) anodes. For example, the as-prepared MnO-CNTs@TiO2-C microsphere demonstrates an extremely high capacity of 967 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles, where a CE as high as 99% is maintained. Even at a harsh rate of 5 A g-1 (ca. 5C), a capacity of 389 mAh g-1 can be maintained for thousands of cycles. The proposed oxide anode design was combined with nickel-rich cathode to make a full-cell battery that works at high voltage and exhibits impressive stability and life span.",
        "Sodium‐ion batteries are now considered as a low‐cost alternative to lithium‐ion technologies for large‐scale energy storage applications; however, their safety is still a matter of great concern for practical applications. In this paper, a safer sodium‐ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb‐based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb‐based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications.",
        "The lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) shuttling and slow chemical reactions at the sulfur cathode and the formation of dendritic lithium in metal anodes severely hinder the popularization of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here, a B,N-codoped carbon nanotube (BNCNTs) array decorated with sulfilic and lithiophilic CoSe nanoparticles grown on a carbon cloth (CoSe@BNCNTs/CC) as both a sulfur and a lithium host is reported. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, simulations, and electrochemical performance determinations demonstrate that CoSe@BNCNTs/CC can simultaneously exert catalytic effects for accelerating LiPSs conversion and realize smooth and uniform lithium deposition to regulate the S and Li electrochemistry. Moreover, the unique structure of the BNCNTs array provides sufficient storage space for sulfur and homogenizes the distribution of Li ions and the electric field of the electrode. The assembled Li-S full battery with a CoSe@BNCNTs/CC dual-functional host exhibits a long-term cycling stability (800 cycles at 0.5 C with a decay rate of 0.066% per cycle) and a high rate capacity (684 mAh g-1 at 2 C). Even at a high sulfur loading of 7.9 mg cm-2, the Li-S full battery has a high areal capacity of 9.76 mAh cm-2 at 0.2 C. This study proposes a viable strategy to solve the challenges of both S and Li electrodes for practical Li-S full batteries.",

However, its poor electrical conductivity, combined with its degraded cycling performance, restricts its practical application. Herein, Bi microsphere coated with nitrogen-doped carbon (Bi@NC) was synthesized. Owing to the unique Bi crystals and nitrogen-doped carbon layer, the obtained Bi@NC anode exhibited satisfactory cycling stability and superior rate capability. Moreover, after assembling Bi@NC anode with Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 @C cathode to full battery, excellent sodium storage performance was obtained (57 mA h g -1 after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g -1 ).",
        "Cellulose is a promising natural bio-macromolecule due to its abundance, renewability and low cost. Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles. The excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability indicate MrGO-CNF a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "The further improvement of sodium ion battery requires the elucidation of the mechanisms pertain to reversibility, which allows the novel design of electrode structure. Here, through a hydrogel-embedding method, we are able to confine the growth of few-layer SnS2 nanosheets between nitrogen- and sulfur-doped carbon nanotube (NS-CNT) and amorphous carbon. The obtained carbon-sandwiched SnS2 nanosheets demonstrate excellent sodium storage properties. In operando small angle X-ray scattering combined with the ex situ X-ray absorption near edge spectra reveal that the redox reactions between SnS2/NS-CNT and sodium ion are highly reversible. On the contrary, the nanostructure evolution is found to be irreversible, in which the SnS2 nanosheets collapse, followed by the re-generation of SnS2 nanoparticles. This work provides operando insights into the chemical environment evolution and structure change of SnS2-based anodes, elucidating its reversible reaction mechanism, and illustrates the significance of engineered carbon support in ensuring the electrode structure stability.",
        "LiFePO4 is an important cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. Regardless of the biphasic reaction between the insulating end members, Lix FePO4 , x≈0 and x≈1, optimization of the nanostructured architecture has substantially improved the power density of positive LiFePO4 electrode. The charge transport that occurs in the interphase region across the biphasic boundary is the primary stage of solid-state electrochemical reactions in which the Li concentrations and the valence state of Fe deviate significantly from the equilibrium end members. Complex interactions among Li ions and charges at the Fe sites have made understanding stability and transport properties of the intermediate domains difficult. Long-range ordering at metastable intermediate eutectic composition of Li2/3 FePO4 has now been discovered and its superstructure determined, which reflected predominant polaron crystallization at the Fe sites followed by Li(+) redistribution to optimize the Li-Fe interactions.",
        "It is of great importance to exploit electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with low cost, long life, and high-rate capability. However, achieving quick charge and high power density is still a major challenge for most SIBs electrodes because of the sluggish sodiation kinetics. Herein, uniform and mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres are synthesized via a facile one-step polyvinylpyrrolidone assisted method. By controlling the voltage window, the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres present excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs. It delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 692 mA h g-1 . The NiS2 anode also exhibits excellent high-rate capability (253 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ) and long-term cycling performance (319 mA h g-1 capacity remained even after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 ). A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. The impressive electrochemical performance reveals that the NiS2 offers great potential toward the development of next generation large scale energy storage.",
        "A one-dimensional MWCNT@a-C@Co9S8 nanocomposite has been prepared via a facile solvothermal reaction followed by a calcination process. The amorphous carbon layer between Co9S8 and MWCNT acts as a linker to increase the loading of sulfides on MWCNT. When evaluated as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the MWCNT@a-C@Co9S8 nanocomposite shows the advantages of high capacity and long life, superior to Co9S8 nanoparticles and MWCNT@Co9S8 nanocomposites. The reversible capacity could be retained at 662 mA h g(-1) after 120 cycles at 1 A g(-1). The efficient synthesis and excellent performances of this nanocomposite offer numerous opportunities for other sulfides as a new anode for lithium ion batteries.",
        "Antimony- (Sb) based materials have been considered as one of promising anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate sodium inserting potentials. So far, the reported energy density and cycling stability of the Sb-based anodes for SIBs are quite limited and need to be significantly improved. Here, we develop a novel Sb/C hybrid encapsulating the Sb nanorods into highly conductive N and S codoped carbon (Sb@(N, S-C)) frameworks. As an anode for SIBs, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid maintains high reversible capacities of 621.1 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, and 390.8 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling.",
        "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",
        "In this article, we report NiSe2 nanooctahedra as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). They exhibit outstanding long-term cyclic stability (313 mAh/g after 4000 cycles at 5 A/g) and excellent high-rate capability (175 mAh/g at 20 A/g). Besides, the initial Coulombic efficiency of NiSe2 is also very impressive (over 90%). Such remarkable performances are attributed to good conductivity, structural stability, and the pseudocapacitive behavior of the NiSe2. Furthermore, the sodium ion storage mechanism of NiSe2 is first investigated by in situ XRD and ex situ XRD. These highlights give NiSe2 a competitive strength for rechargeable SIBs.",
        "All‐solid‐state sodium ion batteries (AS3iBs) are highly sought after for stationary energy storage systems due to their suitable safety and stability over a wide temperature range. Hard carbon (HC), which is low cost, exhibits a low redox potential, and a high capacity, is integral to achieve a practical large‐scale sodium‐ion battery. However, the energy density of the battery utilizing this anode material is hampered by its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, two strategies, namely i) additional pyrolysis and ii) presodiation by thermal decomposition of NaBH4, are explored to improve the ICE of pristine HC. Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations elucidate that the thermal treatment increases the Csp2 content in the HC structure, while the presodiation supplies the sodium to occupy the intrinsic irreversible sites. Consequently, presodiated HC exhibits an outstanding ICE (>99%) compared to the thermally treated (90%) or pristine HC (83%) in half‐cell configurations. More importantly, AS3iB using presodiated HC and NaCrO2 as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits a high ICE of 92% and an initial discharge energy density of 294Whkgcathode−1$294\\ {\\rm Wh}\\ {\\rm{kg}}_{{\\rm{cathode}}}^{ - 1}$ .",
        "Sodium ion batteries (NIB, NAB, SIB) are attracting interest as a potentially lower cost alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIB), with readily available and geographically democratic reserves of the metal. Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture.",
        "Lithium hydride has been widely identified as the major component of the solid-electrolyte interphase of Li metal batteries (LMBs), but is often regarded as being detrimental to the stabilization of LMBs. Here, we identify the positive and important role of LiH in promoting fast diffusion of Li ions by building a unique three-dimensional (3D) Li metal anode composed of LiMg alloys uniformly confined into graphene-supported LiH nanoparticles. The built-in electric field at the interface between LiH with high Li ion conductivity and LiMg alloys effectively boosts Li diffusion kinetics toward favorable Li plating into lithiophilic LiMg alloys through the surface of LiH. Therefore, the diffusion coefficient of Li ions of the thus-formed 3D structured Li metal anode is 10 times higher than the identical anode without the presence of LiH, and it exhibits a long cycle life of over 1200 hours at 3 mA cm−2 under 5 mA hour cm−2.",
        "Na-based layered transition metal oxides with an O3-type structure are considered promising cathodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, rapid capacity fading, and poor rate performance caused by serious structural changes and interfacial degradation hamper their use. In this study, a NaPO3 surface modified O3-type layered NaNi1/3 Fe1/3 Mn1/3 O2 cathode is synthesized, with improved high-voltage stability through protecting layer against acid attack, which is achieved by a solid-gas reaction between the cathode particles and gaseous P2 O5 . The NaPO3 nanolayer on the surface effectively stabilizes the crystal structure by inhibiting surface parasitic reactions and increasing the observed average voltage. Superior cyclic stability is exhibited by the surface-modified cathode (80.1% vs 63.6%) after 150 cycles at 1 C in the wide voltage range of 2.0 V-4.2 V (vs Na+ /Na). Moreover, benefiting from the inherent ionic conduction of NaPO3 , the surface-modified cathode presents excellent rate capability (103 mAh g-1  vs 60 mAh g-1 ) at 10 C. The outcome of this study demonstrates a practically relevant approach to develop high rate and durable sodium-ion battery technology.",
        "Hard carbon (HC) is an attractive anode material for low cost and high energy density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), however, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) limits its practical battery application. To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process. More importantly, this presodiation reaction is very mild, highly eﬃcient and can be widely extended to a variety of Na-storage materials, offering a new route to develop high performance Na-storage materials for practical battery applications.",
        "Garnet-structured Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising solid Li-ion electrolyte for all-solid-state Li-metal batteries and Li-redox-flow batteries owing to its high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature and good electrochemical stability with Li metal. However, there are still three major challenges unsolved: (1) the controversial electrochemical window of garnet, (2) the impractically large resistance at a garnet/electrode interface and the fast lithium-dendrite growth along the grain boundaries of the garnet pellet, and (3) the fast degradation during storage. We have found that these challenges are closely related to a thick Li2CO3 layer and the Li-Al-O glass phase on the surface of garnet materials. Here we introduce a simple method to remove Li2CO3 and the protons in the garnet framework by reacting garnet with carbon at 700 °C; moreover, the amount of the Li-Al-O glass phase with a low Li-ion conductivity in the grain boundary on the garnet surface was also reduced. The surface of the carbon-treated garnet pellets is free of Li2CO3 and is wet by a metallic lithium anode, an organic electrolyte, and a solid composite cathode. The carbon post-treatment has reduced significantly the interfacial resistances to 28, 92 (at 65 °C), and 45 Ω cm2 at Li/garnet, garnet/LiFePO4, and garnet/organic-liquid interfaces, respectively. A symmetric Li/garnet/Li, an all-solid-state Li/garnet/LiFePO4, and a hybrid Li-S cell show small overpotentials, high Coulombic efficiencies, and stable cycling performance.",
        "Lithium–germanium binary compounds are promising anode materials for secondary lithium-ion batteries due to their high capacity, low operating voltage, and high electronic conductivity of lithiated Ge. For their successful application in batteries, it is essential to know the temperature stability of different Li–Ge phases and the variation of their ionic conductivity depending on the operating temperatures of the batteries. This work aims to comprehensively study the thermodynamic stability and ionic conductivity in Li–Ge binary compounds using a combination of first-principle computations and machine-learning interatomic potentials. We calculated convex hulls of the Li–Ge system at various temperatures and a temperature–composition phase diagram was obtained, delineating stability fields of each phase. Our calculations show that at temperatures higher than 590 K, LiGe undergoes a I41/a–P4/mmm transition, which leads to a change in the ionic conductivity. We show that all stable and metastable Li–Ge compounds have high ionic conductivity, but LiGe and Li7Ge12 have the lowest lithium diffusion. Trajectories of diffusion and Ge arrangements depend on lithium concentration. Based on advanced theoretical approaches, this study provides insights for the development of Li–Ge materials in lithium-ion and lithium-metal battery applications.",
        "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application.",

Novel structured Sn-MoS2 -C@C microspheres, in which Sn nanoparticles are evenly embedded in MoS2 nanosheets and a thin carbon film is homogenously engineered over the microspheres, have been fabricated by the hydrothermal method. The Sn-MoS2 -C@C microspheres demonstrate an excellent Na-storage performance as an anode of SIBs and deliver a high reversible charge capacity (580.3 mAh g-1 at 0.05 Ag-1 ) and rate capacity (580.3, 373, 326, 285.2, and 181.9 mAh g-1 at 0.05, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Ag-1 , respectively). A high charge specific capacity of 245 mAh g-1 can still be achieved after 2750 cycles at 2 Ag-1 , indicating an outstanding cycling performance.

        "The low-cost and scalable sodium ion (Na-ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium-ion batteries. To compensate the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high-voltage anode-free configuration composing a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high-voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high-voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode-free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg-1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250 cycles) for 4.0 V-class anode-free cells and a substantially reduced cost in a sustainable way.",
        "P2-type layered oxides based on the elements Fe and Mn have attracted great interest as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathode materials owing to their inexpensive metal constituents and high specific capacity. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",
        "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",
        "Usually the potentials of Li-ion battery electrodes (at constant temperature) are expressed against metallic lithium, assuming that it equals zero. In the case of potential temperature coefficients, and hence entropies, no similar assumption can be applied, as it is against the third principle of thermodynamics. Here, single electrode potential temperature coefficients were estimated using a 'negligible thermal diffusion potential assumption'. The open circuit voltage (Δφi) dependence on temperature T, for three Li-ion battery cathodes, was measured in non-isothermal symmetrical cells (both electrodes had the same composition but were kept in different temperatures). The measured values were interpreted as single cathode (LiMn2O4, LiFePO4 and LiCoO2) potential temperature coefficients dφi/dT, assuming that Soret and Thomson effects are negligible. The single cathode potential temperature coefficients, estimated in such a way, were positive (dφ(LiMn2O4)/dT = 0.86 mV K-1, dφ(LiFePO4)/dT = 0.86 mV K-1 and dφ(LiCoO2)/dT = 0.83 mV K-1). In addition to the measurements in non-isothermal cells, the temperature coefficients of the open circuit voltage of isothermal cells consisting of these cathodes and a metallic lithium reference (dE/dT) were determined. In this case, all temperature coefficients of the cell voltage were negative (dE(Li|LiMn2O4)/dT = -0.20 mV K-1, dE(Li|LiFePO4)/dT = -0.08 mV K-1 and dE(Li|LiCoO2)/dT = -0.25 mV K-1). The temperature coefficient of the single metallic-lithium electrode, dφLi/dT, was calculated from the temperature coefficients dE/dT of isothermal cells consisting of the cathodes and a lithium counter-electrode and the dφi/dT values measured in non-isothermal cells: dE/dT = dφi/dT - dφLi/dT. The dφLi/dT value was 1.03 mV K-1. The measured difference in the dφ/dT values for metallic lithium and graphite (LiC6) anodes was small (dE/dT = dφ(C6Li)/dT - dφLi/dT = -0.08 mV K-1). Literature data on the temperature coefficients of the isothermal cell open circuit voltage containing different electrodes at different states of charge (SOC) and metallic-lithium counter electrodes were used for the calculation of single electrode properties, taking into account that dφLi/dT = 1.03 mV K-1. The temperature coefficients of all single electrodes were positive for different SOC values and ranged between 1.69 mV K-1 and 0.84 mV K-1. The values of entropy change, ΔSi, for reversible single electrode reactions were all positive (for different states of charge) and ranged between ca. 70 J mol-1 K-1 and 120 J mol-1 K-1.",
        "Printed batteries have undergone increased investigation in recent years because of the growing daily use of small electronic devices. With this in mind, industrial gravure printing has emerged as a suitable production technology due to its high speed and quality, and its capability to produce any shape of image. The technique is one of the most appealing for the production of functional layers for many different purposes, but it has not been highly investigated. In this study, we propose a LiFePO4 (LFP)-based gravure printed cathode for lithium-ion rechargeable printed batteries and investigate the possibility of employing this printing technique in battery manufacture.",
        "Liquid plasma, produced by nanosecond pulses, provides an efficient and simple way to fabricate a nanocomposite architecture of Co3O4/CNTs from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and clusters of Co3O4 nanoparticles in deionized water. The crucial feature of the composite's structure is that Co3O4 nanoparticle clusters are uniformly dispersed and anchored to CNT networks in which Co3O4 guarantees high electrochemical reactivity towards sodium, and CNTs provide conductivity and stabilize the anode structure. We demonstrated that the Co3O4/CNT nanocomposite is capable of delivering a stable and high capacity of 403 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles where the sodium uptake/extract is confirmed in the way of reversible conversion reaction by adopting ex situ techniques. The rate capability of the composite is significantly improved and its reversible capacity is measured to be 212 mA h g(-1) at 1.6 A g(-1) and 190 mA h g(-1) at 3.2 A g(-1), respectively. Due to the simple synthesis technique with high electrochemical performance, Co3O4/CNT nanocomposites have great potential as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundance and wide distribution of sodium resources. Various solutions have been successfully applied to revolve the large-ion-size-induced battery issues at the mid-to-low current density range. However, the fast-charging properties of SIBs are still in high demand to accommodate the increasing energy needs at large to grid scales. Herein, a core-shell Co2VO4/carbon composite anode is designed to tackle the fast-charging problem of SIBs. The synergetic effect from the stable spinel structure of Co2VO4, the size of the nanospheres, and the carbon shell provide enhanced Na+ ion diffusion and electron transfer rates and outstanding electrochemical performance. With an ultrahigh current density of 5 A g-1, the Co2VO4@C anode achieved a capacity of 135.1 mAh g-1 and a >98% capacity retention after 2000 cycles through a pseudocapacitive dominant process. This study provides insights for SIB fast-charging material design and other battery systems such as lithium-ion batteries.",
        "Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) possess ordered accessible nano-channels. When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.",
        "Homogeneous LiF/Fe/Graphene nanocomposites as cathode material for lithium ion batteries have been synthesized for the first time by a facile two-step strategy, which not only avoids the use of highly corrosive reagents and expensive precursors but also fully takes advantage of the excellent electronic conductivity of graphene. The capacity remains higher than 150 mA h g(-1) after 180 cylces, indicating high reversible capacity and stable cyclability. The ex situ XRD and HRTEM investigations on the cycled LiF/Fe/G nanocomposites confirm the formation of FeF(x) and the coexistence of LiF and FeF(x) at the charged state. Therefore, the heterostructure nanocomposites of LiF/Fe/Graphene with nano-LiF and ultrafine Fe homogeneously anchored on graphene sheets could open up a novel avenue for the application of iron fluorides as high-performance cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.",
        "Significance It is possible to nearly double the energy density of existing lithium-ion batteries by using lithium metal anodes. However, it has been known for decades that the lithium dendrites and mossy lithium formed during charging (electrodeposition) limit the cycle life of the batteries. It is important to change the growth behavior of lithium metal, which is closely related to the properties of the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) formed via spontaneous reactions between the lithium metal and the electrolyte. In this experimental-modeling integrated study, we reveal the design principles of the SEI that facilitates the dendrite-free and dense deposition of lithium and demonstrate one of the best cycling performances of lithium metal anode to date under practically relevant conditions. The path toward Li-ion batteries with higher energy densities will likely involve use of thin lithium (Li)-metal anode (<50 µm thickness), whose cyclability today remains limited by dendrite formation and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Previous studies have shown that the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) of the Li metal plays a crucial role in Li-electrodeposition and -stripping behavior. However, design rules for optimal SEIs are not well established. Here, using integrated experimental and modeling studies on a series of structurally similar SEI-modifying model compounds, we reveal the relationship between SEI compositions, Li deposition morphology, and CE and identify two key descriptors for the fraction of ionic compounds and compactness, leading to high-performance SEIs. We further demonstrate one of the longest cycle lives to date (350 cycles for 80% capacity retention) for a high specific-energy Li||LiCoO2 full cell (projected >350 watt hours [Wh]/kg) at practical current densities. Our results provide guidance for rational design of the SEI to further improve Li-metal anodes.",
        "Heteroatom incorporation can effectively suppress the phase transition of layered sodium-ion battery cathode, but heteroatom behaviors during operating conditions are not completely understood at the atomic scale. Here, density functional theory calculations are combined with experiments to explore the mitigation behavior of Mg dopant and its mechanisms under operating conditions in P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. The void formed by Na extraction will pump some Mg dopants into Na layers from TM layers, and the collective diffusion of more than one Mg ion most likely occurs when the Mg content is relatively high in the TM layer, finally aggregating to form Mg-enrich regions (i.e., Mg segregation) apart from Ni vacancies. The void-pump-effect-induced Mg segregation effectively suppresses the P2-O2 phase transition owing to the stronger Mg-O electrostatic attraction that enhances the integrate of two adjacent oxygen layers and prevents the crack growth by mitigating the lattice volume variation under high-voltage cycling. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of heteroatom mitigation behavior in layered cathodes at the atomic level for next-generation energy storage technologies.",
        "Electrodes with higher Na + storage capability and cycling stability are vital to improve the energy density and rate capability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a coral-like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional carbon framework ( FeP@NC ). Due to the highly continuous N-doped carbon framework and a spring-buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra-stable cycling performance at 10 A g -1 with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the FeP nanoparticles go through a refining-recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na + storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This paper holds a new feasibility insight mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.",
        "We report a new sodium-ion battery formed by coupling a NaFePO(4) cathode and a nanocomposite tin-carbon (Sn-C) sodium-alloying anode. The NaFePO(4) cathode is obtained by Li-Na conversion of a LiFePO(4) cathode directly in the full cell employing the Sn-C anode and a sodium-ion electrolyte. The results show that the unique approach adopted here is capable of successfully and efficiently converting LiFePO(4) into NaFePO(4) in a sodium-ion battery operating at a voltage of 3 V, with a maximum reversible capacity of 150 mAh g(-1), high reversibility, and high rate capability.",
        "Sodium resources are inexpensive and abundant, and hence, sodium-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).",
        "Solid-state lithium metal batteries are promising next-generation rechargeable energy storage systems. However, the poor compatibility of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the low lithium ion conductivity of solid-state electrolytes are key issues hindering the practicality of solid-state electrolytes. Herein, rational designed metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with the incorporation of two types of ionic liquids (ILs) are fabricated as quasi-solid electrolytes. The obtained MOF-IL electrolytes offer continuous ion transport channels with the functional sulfonic acid groups serving as lithium ion hopping sites, which accelerate the Li+ transport both in the bulk and at the interfaces. The quasi-solid MOF-IL electrolytes exhibit competitive ionic conductivities of over 3.0 × 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature, wide electrochemical windows over 5.2 V, and good interfacial compatibility, together with greatly enhanced Li+ transference numbers compared to the bare IL electrolyte. Consequently, the assembled quasi-solid Li metal batteries show either superior stability at low C rates or improved rate performance, related to the species of ILs. Overall, the quasi-solid MOF-IL electrolytes possess great application potential in high-safety and high-energy-density lithium metal batteries.",
        "Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been taken much attention for various applications, such as catalyst, energy storage, and electronics. However, the lack of effective exfoliation methods for obtaining 2D materials in a large quantity has been one of the technical barriers for the real applications. We report a facile liquid-phase exfoliation method to improve the exfoliation efficiency for single-layer MoS2 sheets in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) with a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) assistant. The concentration of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets was greatly improved compared to that achieved with conventional liquid-phase exfoliation methods using NMP solvent. We demonstrate stable operation of sodium-ion battery by using the exfoliated MoS2 and MoS2-rGO composite as anode materials.",
        "Symmetric sodium ion batteries possess the promising features such as low cost, easy-manufacturing process, and facile recycling post-process, which are suitable for the application of large-scale stationary energy storage. Herein, we proposed a symmetric sodium ion battery based on dual-electron reactions of NASICON structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 material. The Na3MnTi(PO4)3 electrode can deliver a stable capacity up to 160 mAh g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 97 % at 0.1 C by utilizing the redox reactions of Ti3+/4+, Mn2+/3+ and Mn3+/4+. It is the first time to investigate the symmetric sodium-ion full-cell using Na3MnTi(PO4)3 as both cathode and anode in the organic electrolyte, demonstrating the excellent reversibility and cycling performance with the voltage plateaus about 1.4 V and 1.9 V. The full-cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 75 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and an energy density of 52 Wh kg-1. In addition, both ex-situ XRD analysis and the first-principle calculations are employed to investigate the sodiation mechanism and structural evolution. The current research provides a feasible strategy for the symmetric sodium-ion batteries to achieve high energy density.",
        "Amorphous carbon materials have been confirmed as attractive anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Herein, an effective strategy to fabricate amorphous carbon materials at low temperature under air atmosphere is proposed. As demonstrated, one-dimensional nitrogen-doping carbon nanofibers were obtained through simple electrospinning technology, following low-temperature heat treatment. Meanwhile, the nitrogen-doping concentration can be regulated by the heating temperature, which can further introduce different levels of adsorption sites on the surface of carbon and enhance the electronic conductivity. Based on experimental investigation, carbon nanofibers with a high nitrogen doping concentration of 18.1 at% achieved an outstanding cycling durability (194.0 mA h g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 after 2000 cycles).",
        "Sodium-ion batteries have been considered as one of the most promising types of batteries, beyond lithium-ion batteries, for large-scale energy storage applications. However, their deployment hinges on the development of new anode materials, since it has been shown that many important anode materials employed in lithium ion batteries, such as graphite and silicon, are inadequate for sodium-ion batteries. We have simply prepared novel SnS/C nanocomposites through a top-down approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Their electrochemical performance has been significantly improved when compared to bare SnS, especially in terms of cycling stability and rate capabilities. SnS/C nanocomposites exhibit excellent capacity retention, at various current rates, and deliver capacities as high as 400 mA h g−1 even at the high current density of 800 mA g−1 (2C). Ex situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and operando X-ray absorption near edge structure studies have been performed in order to unravel the reaction mechanism of the SnS/C nanocomposites.",
        "The polymer electrolytes are considered to be an alternative to liquid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries because of their high thermal stability, flexibility, and wide applications. However, the polymer electrolytes have low ionic conductivity at room temperature due to the interfacial contact issue and the growing of lithium dendrites between the electrolytes/electrodes. In this study, we prepared gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) through an in situ thermal-induced cationic ring-opening strategy, using LiFSI as an initiator. As-synthesized GPEs were characterized with a series of technologies. The as-synthesized PNDGE 1.5 presented good thermal stability (up to 150 °C), low glass transition temperature (Tg < −40 °C), high ionic conductivity (>10−4 S/cm), and good interfacial contact with the cell components and comparable anodic oxidation voltage (4.0 V). In addition, PNGDE 1.5 exhibited a discharge capacity of 131 mAh/g after 50 cycles at 0.2 C and had a 92% level of coulombic efficiency. Herein, these results can contribute to developing of new polymer electrolytes and offer the possibility of good compatibility through the in situ technique for Li-ion batteries.",

        "Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are interesting as one of the alternative metal-ion battery systems to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance and low cost of potassium. We have herein investigated Sn4P3/C composite as a novel anode material for PIBs. The electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 384.8 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and a good rate capability of 221.9 mA h g-1, even at 1 A g-1. Its electrochemical performance is better than any anode material reported so far for PIBs. It was also found that the Sn4P3/C electrode displays a discharge potential plateau of 0.1 V in PIBs, slightly higher than for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) (0.01 V), and well above the plating potential of metal. This diminishes the formation of dendrites during cycling, and thus Sn4P3 is a relatively safe anode material, especially for application in large-scale energy storage, where large amounts of electrode materials are used. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism of the Sn4P3/C composite as PIB anode is proposed. This work may open up a new avenue for further development of alloy-based anodes with high capacity and long cycle life for PIBs.",
        "Ether‐based electrolytes have high ionic conductivity and good stability toward the lithium metal anode relative to carbonate‐based electrolytes, but they typically exhibit poor oxidation stability (<4 V vs Li+/Li). Most approaches aimed at enhancing the oxidative stability of ether‐based electrolytes, such as “salt‐in‐solvent” and “weakly solvating” strategies, often sacrifice their inherent advantage of high ionic conductivity. Herein, this article proposes a cost‐effective synergistic additive strategy by co‐adding LiNO3 and vinylene carbonate (VC) to achieve an optimized ether‐based electrolyte (OEE) that simultaneously offers high Li‐ion (Li+) conductivity (11.52 mS cm−1 at 20 °C) and high‐voltage stability (4.4 V). LiNO3 and VC can enter the inner solvation shell of the electrolyte, preferentially participating in the film‐forming progress at the electrode surface, leading to the formation of a unique organic–inorganic bilayer interfacial protective layer. This layer could effectively suppress electrolyte side reactions and enhance electrode stability. As a result, the 4.4 V Li‐LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) full cells assembled with the OEE exhibit stable cycling performance at both room temperature and low temperature. This work provides a new approach to the design of ether‐based electrolytes for high‐voltage lithium metal batteries.",
        "To improve lithium and sodium ion battery technology, it is imperative to understand how the properties of the different components are controlled by their chemical structures. Operando structural studies give us some of the most useful information for understanding how batteries work, but it remains difficult to separate out the contributions of the various components of a battery stack (e.g., electrodes, current collectors, electrolyte, and binders) and examine specific materials. We have used operando X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) to study specific components of an essentially unmodified working cell and extract detailed, space-resolved structural information on both crystalline and amorphous phases that are present during cycling by Rietveld and pair distribution function (PDF) methods. We illustrate this method with the first detailed structural examination of the cycling of sodium in a phosphorus anode, revealing surprisingly different mechanisms for sodiation and desodiation in this promising, high-capacity anode system.",
        "The emerging sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising candidates expected to complement lithium‐ion batteries and diversify the battery market. However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high‐rate performance and long‐cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1) and ultralong cycling life (>3000 circulations at 0.5 A g−1), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA‐based cathode materials. This study opens a new avenue for boosting sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in electrodes of rechargeable batteries and also provides a new paradigm for solving the dilemma that electrodes’ failure due to high‐stress concentration upon ion storage.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for grid-level energy storage due to the high natural abundance of sodium and low material cost of sodium compounds. Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively. In a cycling performance test, after 500 deep cycles, the capacity of BP/rGO anodes stabilized at 1250 and 640 mAh/g at 1 and 40 A/g, respectively, which marks a significant performance improvement for sodium-ion battery anodes.",
        "Pyrite (FeS2) has been considered as one of the most potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost, environmentally friendly features and high theoretical capacity. However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs. The results demonstrate the potential applications of FeS2/CNS in SIBs with low-cost, high power density and long cycling life.",
        "Flexible and portable devices are a mainstream direction in modern electronics and related multidisciplinary fields. To this end, they are generally required to be stretchable to satisfy various substrates. As a result, stretchable devices, such as electrochemical supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and artificial skin sensors have been widely studied. However, these stretchable devices are made in a conventional planar format that has largely hindered their development. For the portable applications, the devices need to be lightweight and small, though it is difficult for them to be made into efficient microdevices. In particular, it is challenging or even impossible for them to be used in electronic circuits and textiles that are urgently required also in a wide variety of other fields, such as microelectronic applications. Recently, some attempts have been made to fabricate wire-shaped microdevices, such as electrochemical supercapacitors. They have been generally produced by twisting two fiber electrodes with electrolytes coated on the surface. Several examples have been also successfully shown to make fiber-shaped supercapacitors with a coaxial structure. Compared with their planar counterparts, the wire or fiber shape enables promising advantages such as being lightweight and woven into textiles. Although the wire and fiber-shaped supercapacitors are also flexible with high electrochemical performance, they are not stretchable, which is critically important for many applications. For instance, the resulting electronic textiles could easily break during the use if they were not stretchable. To the best of our knowledge, herein we have, for the first time, developed a novel family of highly stretchable, fibershaped high-performance supercapacitors. Aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets that are sequentially wrapped on an elastic fiber serve as two electrodes. The use of aligned CNT sheets offers combined remarkable properties including high flexibility, tensile strength, electrical conductivity, and mechanical and thermal stability. As a result, the fibershaped supercapacitor maintains a high specific capacitance of approximately 18 F/g after stretch by 75% for 100 cycles. Spinnable CNT arrays were first synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the array with height of 230 mm is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S1, and the CNT shows a multi-walled structure with diameter of about 10 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S2). Aligned CNT sheets could be then continuously drawn from the array and easily attached to various substrates. Elastic fibers were used herein to offer the stretchability in the resulting supercapactiors, and rubber fibers have been mainly studied as a demonstration. For a typical fabrication on the fiber-shaped supercapacitor (Figure 1), a rubber fiber was first coated with a thin layer of",

Here we report an intriguing effect of interstitial H2O on the structure and electrochemical properties of sodium manganese(II) hexacyanoferrates(II) with the nominal composition Na2MnFe(CN)6·zH2O (Na2-δMnHFC). The newly discovered dehydrated Na2-δMnHFC phase exhibits superior electrochemical performance compared to other reported Na-ion cathode materials; it delivers at 3.5 V a reversible capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) in a sodium half cell and 140 mAh g(-1) in a full cell with a hard-carbon anode. At a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the half-cell capacity is 120 mAh g(-1), and at 0.7 C, the cell exhibits 75% capacity retention after 500 cycles.",
        "Embedding the functional nanostructures into a lightweight nanocarbon framework is very promising for developing high performance advanced electrodes for rechargeable batteries. Here, to realize workable capacity, core-shell (FeSe2 /C) nanostructures are embedded into carbon nanotube (CNT) framework via a facile wet-chemistry approach accompanied by thermally induced selenization. The CNT framework offers 3D continuous routes for electronic/ionic transfer, while macropores provide adequate space for high mass loading of FeSe2 /C. However, the carbon shell not only creates a solid electronic link among CNTs and FeSe2 but also improves the diffusivity of sodium ions into FeSe2 , as well as acts as a buffer cushion to accommodate the volume variations. These unique structural features of CNT/FeSe2 /C make it an excellent host for sodium storage with a capacity retention of 546 mAh g-1 even after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 . Moreover, areal and volumetric capacities of 5.06 mAh cm-2 and 158 mAh cm-3 are also achieved at high mass loading 16.9 mg cm-2 , respectively. The high performance of multi-benefited engineered structure makes it a potential candidate for secondary ion batteries, while its easy synthesis makes it extendable to further complex structures with other morphologies (such as nanorods, nanowires, etc.) to meet the high energy demands.",
        "Rational construction of nanosized anode nanomaterials is crucial to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",
        "The conversion reaction-based lithium-sulfur battery features an attractive energy density of 2600 W h/kg. Nevertheless, the unsatisfied performance in terms of poor discharge capacity and cycling stability still hinders its practical applications. Recently, porous carbon materials have been widely reported as promising sulfur reservoirs to promote the sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur conversion, tolerate volume expansion of sulfur, and suppress polysulfide shuttling. However, porous carbon with a simply designed nanostructure is hard to satisfy all of these aspects simultaneously. Herein, we have applied a dual-template strategy that assembles carbon pores into carbon sheets to prepare three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (N-PCSs) as the multifunctional sulfur host for the Li-S battery. By arranging carbon pores within an interconnected 3D architecture, the porous carbon sheets enable rapid electron/ion transfer. Moreover, the micro/mesopores and nitrogen dopant in N-PCS provide both physical and chemical restrictions to polysulfide species. With these advances, the N-PCS/S cathode delivers a large initial discharge capacity of 1360 mA h/g at 0.1 C. When performed at 0.5 C for 1000 cycles, the cathode can still remain ∼50% of its capacity with a low decay rate of 0.05% per cycle, showing the important role of the 3D carbon material in the Li-S battery.",
        "Silicon (Si), known for its high theoretical capacity, holds promise for developing high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, the intrinsic low conductivity and substantial volume expansion limit its commercial application. Developing a binder that can suppress the massive volume expansion while improving Si conductivity is particularly important for LIBs based on Si anode. Here, grafting natural adhesive cationic guar gum (CGG) with small molecular acrylamide (AM) is proposed and applied it to the Si‐based anode. The rigid guar gum main chain and the elastic polymerized acrylamide (pAM) side chain forms a 3D network that completely encapsulated Si nanoparticles and cross‐linked with the natural hydroxyl groups on the surface of Si particles through abundant functional groups. Numerous link anchors and robust mechanical networks facilitate lithium‐ion transport and effectively mitigated the significant stress generated by silicon during charge and discharge cycles. Based on this innovative design, the Si@CGG@pAM@SP (Super P) electrode demonstrates excellent long‐term cycle stability and rate performance. The Si@CGG@pAM@SP electrode preserves 2086 mAh g−1 discharge capacity after 100 cycles (corresponding to 91.5% capacity retention). Physical characterization and electrochemical tests confirm the rationality of the polymer binder design, serving as a valuable reference for the material design of lithium‐ion batteries.",
        "Hard carbon is currently considered the most promising anode candidate for room temperature sodium ion batteries because of its relatively high capacity, low cost, and good scalability. In this work, switchgrass as a biomass example was carbonized under an ultrahigh temperature, 2050 °C, induced by Joule heating to create hard carbon anodes for sodium ion batteries. Switchgrass derived carbon materials intrinsically inherit its three-dimensional porous hierarchical architecture, with an average interlayer spacing of 0.376 nm. The larger interlayer spacing than that of graphite allows for the significant Na ion storage performance. Compared to the sample carbonized under 1000 °C, switchgrass derived carbon at 2050 °C induced an improved initial Coulombic efficiency. Additionally, excellent rate capability and superior cycling performance are demonstrated for the switchgrass derived carbon due to the unique high temperature treatment.",
        "This study addresses the pervasive concern surrounding battery performance degradation in electronic devices. While some attribute this decline to device aging, a significant portion of the population lacks awareness of the precise factors contributing to diminished battery efficiency. Consequently, the research investigates the factors related to battery performance, aiming to identify the determinants of reduced efficiency. Decision trees are used to meticulously analyze the intricate relationships between variables and discern the factors that respondents perceive as causative of diminished battery performance. This algorithm is chosen since, in predicting high-capacity lithium-ion battery performance, the decision tree outperforms other algorithms in machine learning in accuracy. The study elucidates diverse user preferences, with 55.38% favoring Android and 44.62% expressing a preference for iOS, indicating disparate perceptions of battery health: 61.54% consider their batteries as \"Good,\" while 38.46% acknowledge a decline. The decision tree analysis of 195 participants underscores the pronounced impact of prolonged usage on battery health, revealing that 95% maintain good battery performance.

        "Real-time temperature prediction is essential for ensuring the thermal safety of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), yet its industrial application faces challenges due to fluctuations in operating conditions such as temperature, voltage range, capacity degradation, and current rates (C-rates). To address this, we introduce a novel framework, Transformer-GPR, which merges the physical battery model with a Transformer-based network. This integration facilitates the offline training of hyperparameters, enhancing real-time temperature prediction accuracy. Additionally, we employ two residual models using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to correct for local temperature deviations. The Transformer-GPR framework is designed to predict temperature accurately across the entire lifecycle of LIBs with limited data and under varied operational conditions. It has been benchmarked against several existing methods, showing superior interpretability, accuracy, and transferability. Validation with operational data from a pure electric vehicle confirmed the model’s efficacy; it precisely predicted temperature change sequences, with an RMSE of 0.048, an MAE of 0.036, and a maximum error of 0.28, using training inputs from similar vehicles.",

        "Advanced functional materials enable lithium-ion batteries to reach high specific capacity. To achieve this goal, nickel foam (NF), as current collector, is chosen to in situ form aligned nanoarrays composed of CoP3 /carbon polyhedron (CP)/CoO. The CoO nanowire acts as bridge to link NF and CoP3 /CP which not only reinforces the adhesion between active material and NF but also enhances the capacity of whole electrode. Besides, CoP3 is evenly coupled with CP, which can effectively buffer the volume expansion of CoP3 during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, the novel architecture of CoP3 /CP/CoO/NF is beneficial to improve the electronic conductivity. As a result, the CoP3 /CP/CoO/NF anode delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 1715 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 which can remain at 1150 mAh g-1 after 80 cycles, demonstrating the good durability. Thus, this work develops a facile strategy to design self-supporting electrodes for an enhanced energy storage device.",
        "The composite of tungsten-doped SnO2 and reduced graphene oxide was synthesized through a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. According to the structural characterization of the composite, tungsten ions were doped in the unit cells of tin dioxide rather than simply attaching to the surface. Tungsten-doped SnO2 was in situ grown on the surface of graphene sheet to form a three-dimensional conductive network that enhanced the electron transportation and lithium-ion diffusion effectively. The issues of SnO2 agglomeration and volume expansion could be also avoided because the tungsten-doped SnO2 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed on a graphene sheet. As a result, the nanocomposite electrodes of tungsten-doped SnO2 and reduced graphene oxide exhibited an excellent long-term cycling performance. The residual capacity was still as high as 1100 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles. It still remained at 776 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles at the current density of 1A g-1.",
        "\n In recent years, lithium-ion batteries have grown in popularity. Because of their extended cycle life and high energy density. A hexagon-shaped 18650 lithium-ion cylindrical cell battery pack was created using paraffin wax (PA) as a Phase change material (PCM) and nano-enhanced phase change material (Ne-PCM). However, the PCM's low thermal conductivity is a main challenge to the improvement of electrical vehicles (EVs). The highest temperature in the cylindrical cell battery pack is attained in the mid-region, resulting in an uneven temperature distribution across the cells. In order to overcome the constraints and achieve efficient battery module performance, phase change with nanomaterials was placed in the center of four cells using graphene platelet nano powder (GPN), multi-wall carbon nano tubes (MWCNTs), and graphite-synthetic powder (GSP). Studies on the battery module were conducted without, with PCM, and Ne-PCM cooling. The investigation found that the battery pack with Ne-PCM performed well by keeping the temperature under 50 °C at different discharge rates of 1C, 2C, and 3C and maintaining a uniform temperature variation within cells. Ne-PCM decreases the temperature differential between the modules at 1, 2, and 3 C discharge rates by 85.49, 91.47, and 84.21%, respectively, in comparison to PCM.",
        "Prussian blue attracts the attention of many researchers as a promising candidate for use in sodium-ion battery cathodes due to its open frameworks and high working potential. However, the interstitial water in its crystal structure and its poor electronic conductivity limits its performance in practical sodium-ion batteries. Here, acid-assisted ball milling synthesis was employed as a versatile method for the production of surface-modified Prussian blue. With (CH3COO)2Fe being used as the raw material, the Prussian blue produced using ball milling synthesis was modified by the carboxyl functional group on its surface, which resulted in lower interstitial water content and enhanced electrochemical cycling performance. In addition, ball milling synthesis provided the as-prepared Prussian blue with a large surface area, improving its electrochemical rate performance. When used as the cathode of sodium-ion batteries, as-prepared Prussian blue delivered a specific capacity of 145.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and 113.7 mAh g−1 at 1 C, maintaining 54.5% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 170 mA g−1). Furthermore, a solid-state sodium-ion battery was mounted, with as-prepared Prussian blue being employed as the cathode and Na metal as the anode, which delivered a high specific capacity of 128.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C. The present study put forward an effective solution to overcome the limitations of Prussian blue for its commercial application.",
        "Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium-ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na-free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) show great application prospect in large-scale energy storage. P2-type manganese-based layered oxides have received special attention by virtue of their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environment friendliness. However, the water sensitivity and limited cycling stability hinder their application, especially the underlying mechanisms for the above two issues are still unclear. In this work, copper substitution is used to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and affect the corresponding lattice structure. The water sensitivity and charge compensation mechanism were carefully investigated. Results demonstrate that water sensitivity of the electrode is related to the order of Na+/vacancy in the Na interlayers since water molecules are more easily inserted into the charged state electrodes, but the tendency for the uptake water does not increase with Na+ extraction. Furthermore, Mn2+ forms on the surface of electrodes in the initial discharge process, and the redox reaction in the bulk are predominantly between Mn3+ and Mn4+. Cu-substituted in TM layer affects the arrangement of Na+/vacancy and suppresses the Mn2+ formation on the Na0.7Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 electrode that results in superior air stability and better storage properties.",

Moreover, the self-discharge of the system has been investigated and shown to have an extremely low value of 0.18% h-1. Consequently, this work presents an excellent Na-DIB system, which could be a promising candidate for large-scale applications.",
        "As a promising cathode material of sodium-ion battery, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) possesses a theoretically high capacity and working voltage to realize high energy storage density. However, it still suffers from poor cycling stability mainly incurred by the undesirable P2-O2 phase transition. Herein, the electrochemically active Fe3+ ions are introduced into the lattice of NNMO, forming Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3- xFe xO2 ( x = 0, 1/24, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6) to effectively stabilize the P2-type crystalline structure. In such Fe-substituted materials, both Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples take part in the redox reactions, and the P2-O2 phase transition is well restrained during cycling, as verified by ex situ X-ray diffraction. As a result, the optimized Na2/3Ni1/3Mn7/12Fe1/12O2 (1/12-NNMF) has a long-term cycling stability with the fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 300 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the 1/12-NNMF delivers excellent rate capabilities (65 mA h g-1 at 25 C) and superior low-temperature performance (the capacity retention of 94% at -25 °C after 80 cycles) owing to the enhanced Na diffusion upon Fe doping, which is deduced by the studies of electrode kinetics. More significantly, the 1/12-NNMF also displays remarkable sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with an LS-Sb@G anode, thus implying the possibility of their practical application.",

Furthermore, a physics-based analysis of electrochemical response reveals that the stochastic features can cause preferential lithiation fronts.",
        "This paper proposes a robust framework for the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) of generating units, in the presence of lithium-ion battery energy storage units, using the information-gap decision theory (IGDT) technique. In the suggested model, the degradation cost of the battery storage units has been considered in the objective function as a highly influencing factor in the operation of such storage units. The framework is independent of probability density functions or membership of sets and enables the system operator to adjust the conservatism of the operating strategy (between overconservative and reckless) against the load demand uncertainty. In this respect, the SCUC model has been presented within a day-ahead scheduling problem on the hourly basis using mixed-integer linear programming. Finally, the proposed framework has been simulated on a typical 6-bus test system as well as IEEE 24-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems to verify the efficiency and the effectiveness of the model using the IGDT technique.",

With respect to the sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes constituting of transition metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), poor cycle stability and fast capacity degradation, due to low electronic conductivity and dissolution of chemical species in the electrolyte, hinders use of these promising layered materials as SIB anodes. Herein we report chemical functionalization in MoS2 nanosheets with polymer-derived silicon oxycarbide or SiOC with the aim to preserve MoS2 from dissolution in the SIB organic electrolyte, without compromising its role in sodiation and desodiation processes. Our results suggest that a MoS2–SiOC composite electrode is effective in bringing improved cycle stability to sodium-ion cycling over neat MoS2 even after 100 cycles.",
        "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance.",
        "Engineering of 3D graphene/metal composites with ultrasmall sized metal and robust metal–graphene interfacial interaction for energy storage application is still a challenge and rarely reported.

The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations. Moreover, this top‐down strategy can enable new paths to the low‐cost and high‐yield synthesis of 3D graphene/metal composites for applications in energy‐related fields and beyond.",
        "Cation-doped cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 is regarded as a promising solid electrolyte for safe and energy-dense solid-state lithium batteries. However, it suffers from the formation of Li2CO3 and high electronic conductivity, which give rise to an unconformable Li/Li7La3Zr2O12 interface and lithium dendrites. Herein, composite AlF3-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid electrolytes were created based on thermal AlF3 decomposition and F/O displacement reactions under a high-temperature sintering process. When the AlF3 is thermally decomposed, it leaves Al2O3/AlF3 meliorating the grain boundaries and F- ions partially displacing O2- ions in the grains. Due to the higher electronegativity of F- in the grains and the grain-boundary modification, these AlF3-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 deliver optimized electronic conduction and chemical stability against the formation of Li2CO3. The Li/AlF3-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12/Li cell exhibits a low interfacial resistance of ∼16 Ω cm2 and an ultrastable long-term cycling behavior for 800 h under a current density of 200 μA/cm2, leading to Li//LiCoO2 solid-state batteries with good rate performance and cycling stability.",

Nevertheless, great challenges of inferior reversible capacity and poor lifespan induced by the bigger ionic radius of sodium ions still exist. To solve these problems, improvements to anode materials prove to be an effective way. Herein, the latest research on promising anodes in SIBs is summarized, and the further prospects are also illustrated.",
        "Pyrite (FeS2) is a functional material of great importance for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs), but its sluggish dynamics greatly hinder its high performance. Here, we demonstrate an effective strategy of regulating the energy barrier of ion transport to significantly enhance the sluggish dynamics of FeS2 by Co doping. Compared to pristine FeS2, a series of Co-doped FeS2 shows enhanced alkali metal ion storage performance and most typically, the optimized Fe0.7Co0.3S2 sample displays high reversible capacities, of 1170 mA h g-1 for LIBs and 650 mA h g-1 for SIBs at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 as well as super long-life cycling stability for SIBs (1200 cycles at 5 A g-1). The evidently enhanced performances of Fe0.7Co0.3S2 for LIBs/SIBs can be attributed to its significantly decreased activation energy of ion transport, thus leading to greatly accelerated ion transport dynamics. Furthermore, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments also support this important regulation effect of Co doping on the ion transport dynamics of FeS2. The excellent ion transport dynamics induce a strong pseudo-capacitance behavior in both SIBs and LIBs, and their pseudo-capacitance contributions are more than 90% at 1.0 mV s-1. This work provides a new perspective to improve the alkali metal ion storage performance by optimizing the ion transport dynamics.",

Recent research has shown that LiBs can be improved by using extremely tiny materials with special properties, called nanomaterials. When they are used in LiBs, nanomaterials can increase the amount of energy that can be stored and decrease the amount of time it takes to recharge. Nanomaterials can also extend the life of LiBs.

        "Emerging sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium‐ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion‐storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali‐ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best‐performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na‐ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172 W kg−1 at an energy density of 181.5 Wh kg−1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode).

        "Red phosphorus (P) has attracted intense attention as promising anode material for high‐energy density sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs), owing to its high sodium storage theoretical capacity (2595 mAh g−1). Nevertheless, natural insulating property and large volume variation of red P during cycling result in extremely low electrochemical activity, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, the authors demonstrate a rational strategy to improve sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) ‐derived nitrogen‐doped microporous carbon matrix (denoted as P@N‐MPC). When used as anode for NIBs, the P@N‐MPC composite displays a high reversible specific capacity of ≈600 mAh g−1 at 0.15 A g−1 and improved rate capacity (≈450 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.02% per cycle). The superior sodium storage performance of the P@N‐MPC is mainly attributed to the novel structure. The N‐doped porous carbon with sub‐1 nm micropore facilitates the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and improves the conductivity of the encapsulated red P. Furthermore, the porous carbon matrix can buffer the volume change of red P during repeat sodiation/desodiation process, keeping the structure intact after long cycle life.",
        "P2‐type layered oxide material Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is a competitive candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it suffers from the strong P2–O2 phase transition during charging to the high voltage regime, rendering drastic volume variations and poor cycling performance. Here, a Quasi‐zero strain P2‐Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 cathode is synthesized, which reflects the vanishing P2–O2 transition with a volume change as low as 0.49%, thus resulting in the material an excellent cycling performance (83.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C). The low‐volume strain can be attributed to two aspects: (1) the Mg2+ riveted in the Na layer can act as a “pillar” to stabilize the crystal structure under the condition of sodium removal, thus restricting the structural changes under high voltage. (2) The entry of Li+ into the transition metal (TM) layer can mitigate the electron localization in the highly desodiation state and can effectively immobilize the coordination oxygen atoms, thus suppressing the slip of P2–O2 transition. This study not only provides a new insight of Li and Mg synergetic substitution effect on the structural stability of P2‐type cathode, but also an efficient avenue for developing cathode materials of SIBs with ultralow bulk strain.",

VS4 has emerged as a promising anode material for SIBs due to low cost and its unique linear chains structure that can offer potential sites for sodium storage. Herein, we present the growth of VS4 on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as SIBs anode for the first time. The VS4/rGO anode exhibits promising performance in SIBs. It delivers a reversible capacity of 362 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and a good rate performance. We also investigate the sodium storage behavior of the VS4/rGO. Different than most transition metal sulfides, the VS4/rGO composite experiences a three-step separation mechanism during the sodiation process (VS4 to metallic V and Na2S, then the electrochemical mechanism is akin to Na-S). The VS4/rGO composite proves to be a promising material for rechargeable SIBs.",
        "High-capacity lithium-rich sulfide cathodes with superior conductivity over S or Li2S materials are considered for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLBs), yet their capacity and rate performance require further improvement. In this...",
        "A simple one-step thermal pyrolysis route has been developed to prepare carbon membrane from a natural leaf. The carbonized leaf membrane possesses anisotropic surfaces and internal hierarchical porosity, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 360 mAh/g and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 74.8% as a binder-free, current-collector-free anode for rechargeable sodium ion batteries. Moreover, large-area carbon membranes with low contact resistance are fabricated by simply stacking and carbonizing leaves, a promising strategy toward large-scale sodium-ion battery developments.",
        "MnO2 is shown for the first time to be electrochemically active as a conversion anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Space-confined ultrafine (UF)-MnO2, with an average crystal size of 4 nm, synthesized using a porous silicon dioxide templated hydrothermal process exhibits a high reversible sodiation capacity of 567 mA h g(-1), in contrast to the negligible activity shown by the aggregates of larger (14 nm) MnO2 nanocrystallites. The remarkably enhanced sodiation activity of the UF-MnO2 is attributable to its greatly reduced crystal size, which facilitates diffusion of Na ions, along with high surface energy arising from extensive heterogeneous interfacial bonding with the SiO2 surrounding. The UF-MnO2 anode exhibits an exceptional rate and cycle performance, exhibiting >70% capacity retention after 500 cycles. In operando synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structural analysis reveals combined charge-storage mechanisms involving conversion reaction between Mn(III) and Mn(II) oxides, Mn(III)-O1.5 + Na(+) + e(-)- ↔ 1/2Na2O + Mn(II)-O, and non-Mn-centered redox reactions. The finding suggests a new strategy for \"activating\" the potential electrochemical electrode materials that appear inactive in the bulk form.",
        "Maintaining structural stability is a great challenge for high-capacity conversion electrodes with large volume change but is necessary for the development of high-energy-density, long-cycling batteries. Here, we report a stable phosphorus anode for sodium ion batteries by the synergistic use of chemically bonded phosphorus-carbon nanotube (P-CNT) hybrid and cross-linked polymer binder. The P-CNT hybrid was synthesized through ball-milling of red phosphorus and carboxylic group functionalized carbon nanotubes. The P-O-C bonds formed in this process help maintain contact between phosphorus and CNTs, leading to a durable hybrid. In addition, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose-citric acid binder was used to form a robust electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a stable cycling capacity of 1586.2 mAh/g after 100 cycles, along with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.7% and subsequent cycling efficiency of ∼99%. The unique electrode framework through chemical bonding strategy reported here is potentially inspirable for other electrode materials with large volume change in use.",
        "Abstract Systematic and systemic research and development of solid electrolytes for lithium batteries requires a reliable and reproducible benchmark cell system. Therefore, factors relevant for performance, such as temperature, voltage operation range, or specific current, should be defined and reported. However, performance can also be sensitive to apparently inconspicuous and overlooked factors, such as area oversizing of the lithium electrode and the solid electrolyte membrane (relative to the cathode area). In this study, area oversizing is found to diminish polarization and improves the performance in LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622)||Li cells, with a more pronounced effect under kinetically harsh conditions (e. g., low temperature and/or high current density). For validity reasons, the polarization behavior is also investigated in Li||Li symmetric cells. Given the mathematical conformity of the characteristic overvoltage behavior with the Sand's equation, the beneficial effect is attributed to lower depletion of Li ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this regard, the highest possible effect of area oversizing on the performance is discussed, that is when the accompanied decrease in current density and overvoltage overcomes the Sand's threshold limit. This scenario entirely prevents the capacity decay attributable to Li+ depletion and is in line with the mathematically predicted values.",
        "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted wide attention because of their prospect on grid-scale electrical regulation and cost-effectiveness of sodium. In this regard, iron oxides (FeOx) are considered as one of the most promising anode candidates due to its high theoretical capacity and low cost. Unfortunately, the utilization of FeOx anodes suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and significant lattice variation, causing insufficient rate performance and fast capacity degradation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In this study, Mn ions are incorporated through interstitial sites into Fe3O4 lattice to form the Mn-incorporated Fe3O4/graphene (M-Fe3O4/G) composites through a facile hydrothermal method. Confirmed by the XRD Rietveld refinement and the first principle calculation, Mn occupation into the body structure can effectively condense the electron density around Fermi lever and thus contributes to the increased electrical conductivity and improved electrochemical properties. Accordingly, the M0.1Fe2.9O4/G composite demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 439.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 over 200 cycles. Even at a high current density of 1 A g-1, the M-Fe3O4/G composites remain stable for over 1200 cycles, delivering a capacity of 210 mAh g-1. Coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3-type cathode, the Mn incorporated Fe3O4/G composites demonstrate a good suitability in full SIBs (161.2 mAh g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles). The regulation of Mn ions in Fe3O4 lattice provides insights on the optimization of metal oxides anode candidates for their application in SIBs.",
        "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can develop cost-effective and safe energy storage technology for substantial energy storage demands. In this work, we have developed manganese oxide (α-MnO2) nanorods for SIB applications. The crystal structure, which is crucial for high-performance energy storage, is examined systematically for the metal oxide cathode. The intercalation of sodium into the α-MnO2 matrix was studied using the theoretical density functional theory (DFT) studies. The DFT studies predict Na ions’ facile diffusion kinetics through the MnO2 lattice with an attractively low diffusion barrier (0.21 eV). When employed as a cathode material for SIBs, MnO2 showed a moderate capacity (109 mAh·g–1 at C/20 current rate) and superior life cyclability (58.6% after 800 cycles) in NaPF6/EC+DMC (5% FEC) electrolyte. It shows a much higher capacity of 181 mAh·g–1 (C/20 current rate) in NaClO4/PC (5% FEC) electrolyte, though it suffers fast capacity fading (11.5% after 800 cycles). Our findings show that high crystallinity and hierarchical nanorod morphology of the MnO2 are responsible for better cycling performance in conjunction with fast and sustained charge-discharge behaviors."
