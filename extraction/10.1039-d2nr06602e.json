                "The development and utilization of renewable energy, such as solar, wind and hydropower, are key steps to a carbon-neutral society in the near future. The intermittent and volatile nature of these renewable energy sources has stimulated the development of large-scale electrochemical energy storage technologies based on rechargeable batteries, where sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gained widespread attention owing to advantages that include low cost and abundant reserves of Na resources. However, existing Na storage cathode materials generally suffer from limited capacity and poor electronic conductivity, leading to an unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which has restricted the practical application of next-generation SIBs. In recent years, polyanion-type phosphate materials, such as Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3MnTi(PO4)3, have aroused widespread research attention in the field of Na+-ion storage, where Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with its Na-super-ionic conductor structure has shown promise as SIB cathodes, but still retains poor electroconductivity and limited capacity and thus low energy density performance. Therefore, developing advanced NVP cathode materials with improved electroconductivity and Na+-ion storage capacity for next-generation SIBs is highly desirable yet a great challenge.",
                "In pursuit of high-performance NVP cathode materials, several strategies including (i) reducing the size of NVP particles to reduce the ion diffusion pathway, (ii) mixing NVP with carbon to improve the electroconductivity, and (iii) elemental doping to stabilize the crystal structure, have been proposed. In terms of the chemical and crystal structure of NVP, the building blocks include tetrahedral [PO4], octahedral [VO6] and inserted Na+-ions. While Na+ and V3+ components are the sites responsible for Na+-ion storage capability, anionic phosphate (PO43−) is electrochemically inactive during battery cycling and inert for providing capacity. Substituting inert PO43− with tetrahedral redox-active anions within the NVP matrix could improve the material capacity and maintain the crystal structure at the same time. Thus, it is of significant importance being able to regulate the chemical/crystal structure and substitute inert PO43− with redox-active tetrahedral anions for improving NVP cathode materials towards next-generation SIBs with high energy density.",
                "In this work, redox-active silicate (SiO44−) was employed to substitute inert PO43− in order to regulate the crystal and chemical properties of NVP, thus enhancing its electrochemical performance as an SIB cathode. The introduction of SiO44− not only enables additional redox-active sites of Si, resulting in an improved Na-storage capacity, but also decreases the bandgap of the NVP lattice, leading to enhanced electroconductivity. Impressively, the best-performing Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 (denoted as “NVP-Si”) delivered a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g−1 than that of pristine NVP (109.6 mA h g−1) at 0.5 C. Moreover, the NVP-Si showed improved rate performance, as demonstrated by a capacity of 74.6 mA h g−1 at 40 C, much higher than that of the pristine NVP (53.1 mA h g−1) under the same test conditions. Hard carbon (HC)||NVP-Si full cells exhibited a capacity retention of 90.1% after 300 cycles at 5 C and a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.88%, demonstrating the practicability of the as-achieved NVP-Si material. These results suggest the significance of substituting inert phosphate with redox-active silicate for improving polyanion-type materials towards advanced SIB cathodes."

                        "The silicate-substituted Na3V2(PO4)3 materials were prepared by combining hydrothermal and annealing methods. To prepare NVP-Si (i.e., Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1), 468.0 mg of NH4VO3 and 756.4 mg of oxalic acid were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under stirring at 70 °C. Afterwards, 296.8 mg of Na2CO3, 56.8 mg of Na2SiO3, and 667.2 mg of NH4H2PO4 were added to form a homogeneous solution, which was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 190 °C for 20 h. Subsequently, a gel precursor was obtained, which was mixed with 50 mL of 2 mg L−1 graphene oxide solution under stirring and dried at 120 °C. The as-obtained powder was annealed at 400 °C for 4 h and then at 700 °C for 8 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere. The preparation of Na3V2(PO4)3−x(SiO4)x (x = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.15) was the same as that of NVP-Si except for employing stoichiometric amounts of Na2SiO3 precursor."

Then the electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 6 h. The active material mass loading of the cathodes was 0.7 mg cm−2. For the half-cell assembly, sodium metal was employed as the anode, 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (EC:DMC = 1:1, wt%) with 5% FEC was employed as electrolyte, and glass fiber (GF/D, Whatman) was used as the separator. For the full-cell assembly, a HC anode was employed and the N/P mass ratio was carefully controlled to be 1.5:1. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on a Land battery system (LAND CT2001A). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted at an open circuit voltage with a frequency range of 10−1–105 Hz and an AC voltage of 5 mV. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement, the electrodes were tested by galvanostatic charging or discharging for 10 min and resting for 30 min."

                "The ionic structures of PO43− and SiO44− are both tetrahedron, which suggested a good structural compatibility for our anionic manipulation strategy in an NVP matrix (Fig. 1a). To prepare SiO44−-substituted NVP, a hydrothermal method followed by an annealing process were employed. The XRD Rietveld refinement analysis of NVP-Si suggested that the crystal structure of NVP was maintained after the introduction of SiO44− anions (Fig. 1b and S1†). However, the lattices turned out to be expanded, as exemplified by the (113) diffraction peak of NVP-Si at ∼24° shifted to lower degrees, in accordance with the larger atom size of Si4+ (0.40 Å) than that of P5+ (0.38 Å), demonstrating the enlarged crystal lattice and ion diffusion channels. Interestingly, it was revealed that the Na+ content in NVP-Si was higher than that in pristine NVP so as to balance the charge difference between SiO44− and PO43−. As is evident from the XRD refinement (Table S1†), the occupancy ratio at the Na2 site increased from 0.3489 to 0.3652, which should be beneficial for the capacity improvement of NVP-Si materials. The SEM image of as-prepared NVP-Si showed a particle morphology with an average size of ∼200 nm (Fig. 1c), similar to that of pristine NVP (Fig. S2†). The EDS elemental mapping results of NVP-Si in Fig. 1d indicate the successful introduction of SiO44−, where uniform Si distribution over the detected particle is shown. XPS was also employed to confirm the introduction of Si (Fig. S3†). The Si 2p XPS analysis of NVP-Si demonstrated the mixed valence states of +3 and +4 (Fig. 1e), suggesting a balanced charge state and implying the redox-able nature of these Si sites in the NVP lattice. The Na 1s XPS peak area of NVP-Si was larger than that of NVP as shown in Fig. 1f, implying higher Na content in NVP-Si, in accordance with the XRD Rietveld refinement results (Fig. 1b and S1, Table S1†).",
                "The distinctive chemical composition, crystal structure, and valence state of as-designed NVP-Si make it promising for an SIB cathode. To study the SiO44− substitution–electrochemical performance relationship, NVP samples with different SiO44− substitution amounts were prepared and tested in Na||NVP half cells. The results showed that the NVP with 3.3% PO43− substituted with SiO44− (i.e., NVP-Si) was the best-performing one (Fig. S4–S6†). As shown in Fig. 2a, the Na||NVP-Si cells exhibit a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g−1 than the pristine NVP (109.6 mA h g−1) at a current density of 0.5 C, indicating the improved capacity performance. It is noted that the average discharge voltage of an NVP-Si cathode was ∼3.36 V, 50 mV higher than that of pristine NVP. Remarkably, both the power density and energy density of as-assembled Na||NVP cells are higher than those values for most reported NVP materials in recent publications (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the rate performance of an NVP-Si cathode was also improved. The Na||NVP-Si cell exhibited a capacity of 90.7, 83.6, and 74.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 C, 20 C, and 40 C, respectively, significantly higher than the Na||NVP cell under the same test conditions (Fig. 2c). Under 0.5 C, the NVP-Si cathodes delivered an excellent cycling performance with 88.9% capacity retention after 150 cycles, outperforming pristine NVP (80.1% under the same test conditions, Fig. 2d). The NVP-Si cathode also displayed 76% capacity retention after 2000 cycles under 10 C, outperforming NVP (only 51%), further confirming the good cycling stability (Fig. 2e). Besides, the XRD analysis of NVP-Si cathodes before and after cycling also suggested outstanding structural stability (Fig. S7†). All these results confirmed the improved electrochemical performance of as-designed NVP-Si cathodes.",
                "To understand the outstanding electrochemical performance of NVP-Si materials, the electronic structures of V3+ active centers for NVP and NVP-Si were first investigated. Results of XPS analysis, shown in Fig. S8,† suggested the same V valence state for NVP and NVP-Si, indicating the active V3+ sites for NVP-Si have not been affected by the introduction of SiO44−. The electronic structures of introduced Si centers during battery cycling were subsequently analyzed by XPS and theoretical modeling. As demonstrated in Fig. 3a, the Si3+/Si4+ ratio of NVP-Si was determined to be 1:1.02 before cycling, which turned out to be 1:3.23 after charging to 4.0 V, before recovering to 1:0.93 after discharging to 2.5 V, indicating the redox-active nature for the Si sites, which should be beneficial for the capacity increase of as-designed NVP-Si cathodes. The differential charge analysis demonstrated that the introduced Si centers should attract electrons from neighboring O (Fig. 3b), leading to a lower valence state (e.g. Si3+), agreeing well with the results of the XPS analysis shown in Fig. 1e. Moreover, the introduced Si centers promoted electron mobility compared with native P centers within the unit cell of NVP, implying enhanced electroconductivity of NVP-Si. Furthermore, Na1V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, with two Na atoms extracted from the unit cells, was established to simulate the NVP-Si structure after charging, which was recovered to Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 after full discharging (Fig. S9†). The differential charge analysis indicated the electronic density of Si sites in Na1V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 was quite different from that in Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 (Fig. S10†), suggesting the change of Si valence state during the electrochemical cycling of NVP-Si. Bader charge analysis of the Si sites for NVP-Si was also applied. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Bader charge value of Si centers after charging was 0.023 eV lower than that after discharging, suggesting a higher valence state of Si centers after charging and a redox-active nature of these Si centers in NVP-Si, in good agreement with the results of the XPS analysis shown in Fig. 3a. In addition, it should be noted that the diffusion activation energy difference of NVP-Si after charging and discharging was 42.23 eV, higher than that of NVP (41.34 eV), leading to the higher theoretical discharge voltage for NVP-Si than that for NVP (3.746 V vs. 3.675 V, Table S2†), in accordance with the electrochemical results of the higher discharge voltage for NVP-Si shown in Fig. 2a.",
                "The as-substituted SiO44− in NVP should not only increase the capacity by introducing redox-active Si centers and increasing the Na content, but also improve the rate performance by optimizing ion diffusion and intrinsic electroconductivity. As shown in Fig. 4a, Fig. S11 and S12,† the NVP-Si material showed faster Na+-ion diffusion kinetics than NVP at different depths of charge and discharge based on GITT measurements. Moreover, the NVP-Si showed a 0.1 eV lower energy barrier than that of NVP for the Na+-ion diffusion modeling (Fig. 4b), suggesting improved ion diffusion kinetics, which was in accordance with the GITT results. In order to study the effects of SiO44− substitution on the intrinsic electronic conductivity of NVP, the density of states (DOS) of both NVP and NVP-Si were calculated. The bandgap of the NVP-Si material was calculated to be 1.2 eV, 0.7 eV lower than that of NVP, indicating a higher electronic conductivity (Fig. 4c and S13†). Furthermore, when EIS was employed, as demonstrated in Fig. 4d and S14,† the solution resistance of NVP-Si was observed to be 3.9 Ω, lower than that of NVP (4.4 Ω), suggesting enhanced electroconductivity. Besides, the charge transfer resistance of NVP-Si was 420 Ω, also lower than that of NVP (1250 Ω), suggesting improved ion diffusion kinetics, in good agreement with the GITT and calculation results in Fig. 4a and b.",
                "The electrochemical properties and practicability of as-achieved NVP-Si cathodes were further examined in a full-cell configuration by using commercial hard carbon (HC) anodes (Fig. 5a and S15†). The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of as-assembled HC||NVP and HC||NVP-Si full cells are shown in Fig. 5b, which suggested a high capacity of 102.7 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C for HC||NVP-Si full cells, 8.9 mA h g−1 higher than that for HC||NVP full cells. Such an NVP-Si cathode displayed a high energy density of 335.9 W h kg−1, which is among the highest energy densities when compared with the values reported for NVP-based cathodes in recent publications (Fig. S16†). The NVP-Si cathodes also exhibited improved rate performance in full-cell configurations (Fig. 5c), which showed a reversible capacity of 73.1 mA h g−1 under a high current density of 10 C, outperforming the HC||NVP full cells (49.3 mA h g−1 at 10 C). Furthermore, the HC||NVP-Si full cells manifested a long-term cycling stability with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a high average CE of 99.88%, far better than the HC||NVP cells (only 20.8% capacity retention under the same test conditions). It was noted that the as-assembled HC||NVP-Si full cell powered up a light emitting diode (LED) lamp successfully, indicating the NVP-Si as a promising SIB cathode material at a practical level."

                "In summary, a redox-active anion substitution strategy is put forward to improve the electrochemical performance of polyanion phosphate cathode materials for SIBs.
